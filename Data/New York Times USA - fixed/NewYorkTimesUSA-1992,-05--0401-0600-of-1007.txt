HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Rain in Midwest Lowers Contract Prices for Grains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 11

 BODY:
Prices for grain and soybeans for delivery in July sank at the Chicago Board of Trade today following much-needed rainfall over the weekend in Kansas and forecasts of more rain on Thursday and Friday.
Wheat futures led the decline.
Wheat for delivery in May settled 3 1/2 cents lower at 3.77 1/2 a bushel; July wheat closed 4 cents lower at $3.65 3/4 a bushel. May corn settled 2 1/2 cents lower at $2.52 3/4 a bushel; July corn settled cents 3 1/4 lower at $2.58 a bushel. July soybeans closed a half-cent lower at $5.93 3/4 a bushel. 
 "The weather is still the most important factor," said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
Wheat led other grain and soybean prices lower this morning. Forecasts calling for more rain over the wheat belt this week and better chances for rain by the end of the week are likely to weigh on wheat prices, said Kyle Smith, an analyst with the Farmers Commodity Corporation in Kansas City.
 
U.S. Report on Leftover Stocks
 After the close, the Agriculture Department released its monthly report showing ending stocks, or what will be left over by the end of the year, for 1992-93. The department estimated ending stocks at 1.671 million bushels for corn, slightly above industry expectations; 1.618 million bushels for wheat, higher than expected, and 235 million for soybeans, lower than expected.
The report should send soybean prices higher and wheat lower on Tuesday, Mr. Lespinasse said. Corn could open steady to lower Tuesday, he said.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures prices settled higher, led by heating oil futures.
Still buoyed by tight supplies and unseasonably cool weather in the Unigted States and Europe, heating oil rose 0.65 cent to settle at 58.32 cents a gallon, the highest level since Nov. 11. Light sweet crude oil for delivery in June rose 14 cents to close at $21 a barrel, and June unleaded gasoline gained 0.46 cent to settle at 65.33 cents a gallon.
The price of coffee for delivery in July rose after traders "covered" short positions, or bets that the price of coffee would fall, by buying back outstanding contracts in case export quotas are established, analysts said.
July coffee settled 1.1 cent higher at 61.9 cents at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Representatives from the Colombian National Coffee Federation met with United States Agriculture and Commerce Department officials today to discuss support for new export quotas in an effort to shore up prices. And the Brazilian Coffee Council met today with the Brazilian economic secretary to discuss next month's International Coffee Organization talks.

HEADLINE: Despite New Data, Mysteries Of Creation Persist

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
THEORISTS digesting a NASA satellite's intriguing measurements of the faint ripples that emerged from the genesis of the universe say that far from resolving the major mysteries of creation, the discovery emphasizes a need for still deeper probing.
Indeed the measurements by the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite seem, if anything, to have heightened disagreements among some theorists as to how the universe acquired the structure it exhibits today. 
 The collection and analysis of the data, which scientists have called a landmark achievement, was reported at a meeting of physicists last month. Dr. George Smoot of the University of California at Berkeley, leader of the analysis team, announced that the COBE satellite's microwave telescope had found slight irregularities in the universal background of microwave radiation surviving from the earliest time to which astronomers can look back, a mere 300,000 years after the Big Bang creation event.
The discovery of minute ripples in the microwave background brought a collective sigh of relief from theorists.
Dr. Steven Weinberg of the University of Texas at Austin, winner of a Nobel Prize in Physics and a leading cosmological theorist, said in an interview that the satellite's detection of unevennesses in radiation dating from the infancy of the universe averted what might have been "a theoretical catastrophe." If the long-sought evidence of early structure in the universe had not been eventually discovered, he said, "there's no theory that would have survived."
One of the major mysteries that have long vexed astrophysicists has to do with the origin of structure in the universe. Just after the Big Bang event in which most scientists believe the universe sprang into existence, the initial fireball is generally thought to have been smooth and homogeneous, lacking any structure. By contrast, the present-day universe is lumpy and has lots of structure. Its visible matter is clumped into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and clusters of clusters. This structure, indeed, was essential for the origin and evolution of life.
Once the free-wheeling atoms of matter in the early universe began to clump together, the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies could be readily explained in terms of the growing gravitational attraction of the snowballing clumps. But the central mystery remained: when and how did the very first clumping of matter, the genesis of universal structure, arise?
The COBE satellite's detection of very slight variations in the intensity and frequency of the left-over microwave radio waves that permeate the sky has apparently proved that the seeds of the universe's ultimate structure existed 300,000 years after the Big Bang.
Not even the most powerful telescope or radio antenna could detect radiation more ancient than that for the reason that during its first 300,000 years, the universe was opaque to all forms of radiation. Its temperature was so high that all the atoms in the early universe were shorn of their electrons, resulting in a "fog" in which matter and energy were unified. Photons, the particles that carry light, radio, gamma rays and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation were constantly produced during this epoch, but were instantly reabsorbed by the ultra-hot, electrically charged primordial soup that produced them. No photon could escape from the fireball era to travel down the ages to our own time. Hence, the photons of microwave radiation observed by the COBE satellite had to originate somewhat later, after the universe had cooled enough for matter and energy to assume separate identities. This transition to transparency is described by scientists as the "decoupling of matter and energy."
Another kind of signal from the Big Bang itself might one day be detected, however. Scientists believe that certain cosmic events, like the explosion of a supernova, produce gravity waves that ripple outward at the speed of light. Although no gravity wave has ever been detected, physicists hope that an apparatus may some day be developed that could detect and interpret such gravity waves. The National Science Foundation recently selected two sites at which it hopes to build Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatories that might be capable of detecting gravity waves.
 
The Discovery
Variations Hint At Early Structure
 The left-over microwave background radiation, which has an average temperature of 2.73 degrees, above absolute zero, or about 455 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, was detected in 1964 by an innovative radio telescope built by Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson of Bell Laboratories, an achievement for which they were awarded Nobel Prizes. After that, astrophysicists began an intense but vain search for the slight variations in the microwave radiation that could reflect the early clumping of matter that is required by theory to account for the evolution of today's universe. It was COBE's instruments that finally found the ripple in the microwave background.
But the discovery leaves unresolved the more fundamental question of how structure originated.
One of the most popular theories of recent years supposes that structure began in an "inflationary universe," a universe that at one point in its evolution almost instantaneously sprang from a size smaller than the elementary particles in atoms to something many orders of magnitude greater. This transition would have almost instantly transformed the universe from an ultrasmall realm ruled by the peculiar effects of quantum mechanics to the more familiar large-scale domain that obeys the laws of "classical" physics.
The principle author of the inflationary-universe theory, Dr. Alan H. Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed such an "inflation" as a process that would have occurred during a tiny instant -- a period between 10-35 and 10-30 of a second -- after the Big Bang itself. Such an "inflation" would be a mechanism for translating the spontaneous fluctuations that constantly occur in ultrasmall "quantum" particles to large-scale objects, which do not undergo quantum fluctuations. The effects of quantum fluctuations imposed on a full-scale "inflated" universe could trigger the clumping of matter that led to a structured universe, Dr. Guth reasoned.
But what have COBE's measurements done for the inflationary theory?
"I think they have done a lot to help confirm the predictions of inflation, and I'm very, very happy about that," Dr. Guth said in an interview.
But Dr. Penzias reached a contrary conclusion. "I think COBE's measurements could well be a big setback for inflation," he said in an interview. "The data I've seen so far are consistent with a simple open Big Bang universe, one without enough matter to eventually stop its current expansion and contract again, and an open universe does not allow for the inflation idea."
Another leading astrophysical theorist, Dr. James E. Peebles of Princeton University, took the middle ground: "The inflationary theory is not contradicted by COBE's findings," he said, "but neither is it proved by them.
"The excitement and publicity occasioned by the COBE discovery is justified, because COBE has given us a hard number on which to rest some of our ideas," he said. "But it hasn't given us any final answers."
Dr. Peebles and other scientists said that "the single datum point" provided by COBE should prompt a major ground-based observational program to look for finer detail in the microwave unevennesses. The detail found by COBE takes the form of gigantic splotches strewn across the sky, splotches far too large to correspond to the clumping one would expect to see in nascent galaxies, galactic clusters or any of the other structural features astronomers have so far observed. Cosmologists would like to detect finer details in the microwave radiation, ones fine enough to correspond in size to observed structures like galaxies and galactic clusters.
 
The Debate
Data May Support An Older Theory
 Some scientists believe that even if COBE's data are consistent with the inflationary theory, they are equally consistent with an older theory proposed by Dr. Edward R. Harrison, now a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
In 1968, Dr. Harrison calculated that only a certain class of quantum fluctuations could survive from the early infancy of the universe to trigger the clumping of matter and the beginning of structure.
Dr. Guth describes such fluctuations as analogous to audible sounds, which consist of mixtures of frequencies, or tones, of varying intensities. A complex sound consists of all its frequencies at their respective intensities, and such a combination can be graphically plotted as a spectrum. The comparable spectrum of irregularities predicted by Dr. Harrison had a special shape called "scale invariant," in which wavelengths stretch as the universe expands.
"If the spectrum were different," Dr. Harrison said in an interview, "all the irregularities would grow too fast and become black holes. If the irregularities grew too slowly after the Big Bang, then by the time that matter and energy decoupled 300,000 years later, the irregularities would all have disappeared. Only the one spectrum would give a result consistent with the present-day universe."
The theoretical spectrum calculated by Dr. Harrison and, subsequently, by the Soviet physicist Dr. Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich, has a characteristic shape that very roughly approximates the spectrum of microwave radiation actually measured by the COBE satellite.
But neither Dr. Harrison nor Dr. Guth claims the match between the COBE measurements and either of their own theories is good enough to prove anything.
Said Dr. Harrison: "I enjoy ideas about cosmology, but I suspend all belief, because every 10 years the ideas change. It's ridiculous to say you believe in any of them, when things are always in such a state of flux with cosmology, and indeed, with science in general."
It may be, Dr. Harrison said, that the irregularities seen by COBE do not even date from so early an epoch as the "decoupling."
"After the decoupling," he said, "the universe continued to cool, and somehow or other, galaxies eventually began to form. But as they did so, gases were compressed by gravitational forces, heated up again, and hydrogen once again would have been stripped of electrons." This process in itself could have left its "imprint" of irregularities on the microwave background, so that the faint variations measured by COBE might not be primordial at all.
 
Other Theories
Some Seek Clues In 'Dark' Matter
 According to another theory, universal structure might have sprung from "cosmic strings" -- strings with no thickness but packing a mass of energy equivalent to some 20 quadrillion metric tons per inch -- which might have survived from the genesis explosion to this day because of their supposedly unique form. If they exist, they would be the skeletal remains of an ultradense state of matter spawned by the Big Bang.
Still other theories conjecture that the universe is full of exotic, undetected particles with such names as super-symmetric photinos, massive neutrinos, magnetic monopoles and "wimps." Such particles, many theorists believe, might make up most of the mass of today's universe. Although all these particles remain undetected, scientists hope eventually to find one or more of them.
Dr. Penzias, a physicist who now prefers to think of himself as an astronomer, does not believe in any of them. "The search for all this so-called missing mass is an act of desperation by physicists who are unwilling to accept the principle that in the universe, what you see is what you get," he said.
Some astrophysicists have calculated that only 10 percent of the mass of the universe has actually been observed or accounted for, but Dr. Penzias disagrees.
"You don't need hidden mass, because you don't need to close the universe," he said. "All the evidence suggests that the universe is open. Ultimately the universe and everything in it, created in a blinding flash, is doomed to disappear. There really is only one shot. The universe as we see it is a paradigm of our lives -- a very definite beginning with an indefinite but inevitable end."
Dr. Penzias, who recently underwent heart surgery, acknowledges that religious faith may color his thinking about cosmology, but he said: "If someone disproved the Big Bang theory I wouldn't start cheating or lying. My faith is not dependent on physics."
The evidence of astronomy seems to him consonant with general biblical precepts, but religious belief and science are not interdependent, he believes.
Dr. Guth, on the other hand, believes that the COBE results virtually prove the existence of large amounts of "dark" or unseen matter in the universe.
"For the very small amplitude of the density fluctuations that COBE has discovered," he said, "you need large amounts of dark matter to provide the gravitational influence needed to grow the large clumps we see in the universe today."
Whatever the theory, Dr. Weinberg said, "people shouldn't make dogmatic statements about it."
Has COBE settled any arguments?
Dr. Peebles commented: "It's worth emphasizing that one can invent many models for the early universe that equally well reproduce COBE's measurement. The point I want to stress is that this is an important step, but only a step."
At the very least, he added, COBE has won a new lease on life. "One very positive outcome of all this publicity is that NASA will now surely continue funding for COBE, and its measurements will improve," he said. "That in itself is good news."

Diagram: "Behind Earliest View Of Universe"
 What the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) has seen is radiation from the universe 300,000 year after the Big Bang. Before then, photons of light energy were reabsorbed by charged atoms as quickly as they were emitted. Only after the universe cooled so atoms could hold electrons did photons start escaping. In the earliest instants of an extremely dense, hot universe, matter and energy had extremely dense, hot universe, matter and energy had not yet assumed separate identities.
 The present-day universe of galaxies, galaxy clusters, stars, planets and electromagnetic radiation, including visible light.
 The COBE discovery of ripples in the background microwave radiation is a look backward to the universe as it was 300,000 years after the Big Bang. At this point photons decoupled from matter and the universe became "transparent."
 A transition to matter began to occur as temperatures cooled 10-12 seconds after Big Bang as quarks assembled into the sub-units of atoms. The particle accelerator at Fermi Lab has achieved the very high energies that resemble conditions at this time.
The early universe is known only by inference from experiments with particle accelerators.
 Rapid inflation is one theory to account for the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. Someday, gravity wave detectors might be able to plumb phenomena from the Big Bang itself.

A Lens for Conde Nast
After being wooed by Harper's Bazaar, the fashion photographer Steven Meisel has signed an exclusive magazine contract with Conde Nast, the publisher of Vogue and other magazines.
Mr. Meisel is also known for his advertising photographs, among them the current Barneys New York ads (including the Madison Avenue billboard of Linda Evangelista with a butterfly on her nose). He recently completed a book on Madonna that is to be published in September. 
 In the war for fashion talent, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar have been battling fiercely for the leading photographers, trying to sign the top guns to exclusive contracts and, in effect, banning photographers who shoot for the opposition.
Going the other way, Patrick Demarchelier, a regular Conde Nast contributor, recently signed an exclusive contract with Harper's Bazaar.
 
Tough Campaign in London
 The recession continues to wreak havoc on the London fashion-designer scene. Joe Casely-Hayford, a young designer who had dressed rock performers like U2, the Clash, Seal and Duran Duran, folded his nine-year-old designing business last week.
Mr. Casely-Hayford made his mark in the early 1980's by turning a cache of military surplus tents into safari clothes. His styles have been sold in Charivari stores in New York.
Last month, Val Piriou, another established British designer, closed her doors. John Galliano, an avant-garde London designer who had shown in Paris for two seasons, was unable to mount a collection last season after losing his financial backing. Norman Hartnell, an old-line British couture house that dresses the royal family, also has been seeking refinancing.
 
Accessorizing: The Delights
 This is accessories market week in New York, and buyers from around the country have been trooping through suites in the Plaza looking for the latest thrilling notions in belts, bags and baubles. (One learns from the promoters of the Accessorie Circuit, the trade show at the Plaza through today, that the "dandy" will be an important theme -- masculine vests, bow ties, ascots, cuff links and pocket watches -- along with "yin yang," or crossover styles like a camisole under a pin-striped vest.)
With perfect timing, Norma Kamali introduced her first collection of accessories yesterday. It includes belts, shoulder pads (she does a 40's look), bodysuits and collar-and-cuff sets. There are also sunglasses, made under a licensing agreement with Colors in Optics, and footwear (shoes, in fashionspeak) by Carrano.
A fashion accessory ball is to be held on Wednesday at the Marriott Marquis, where everyone can swish around in black tie and talk about accessories.
 
Jungle Clothes
 A who's who of international fashion, from Armani to Westwood, is contributing designs to the second Don't Bungle the Jungle party on May 18, which will raise money for preserving the world's rain forests.
All the fashions are jungle inspired and will be available for purchase during a silent auction throughout the evening at the Amazon Village Pier 25, on the Hudson River at North Moore Street. A fireworks show by Grucci and a performance by Queen Latifah are scheduled. Tickets: (212) 431-7845.
 
The Octogenerian Strut
 Irving Lazar, the powerful literary agent known as Swifty, has added fashion modeling to his accomplishments. Mr. Lazar, who is 85 years old, recently modeled in advertisements for Kenar sportswear with Linda Evangelista.
"Linda's so beautiful," Mr. Lazar said, "and unusually intelligent. She's got legs that never stop."
Ms. Evangelista could not be reached for comment on Mr. Lazar's legs. The ads are scheduled to begin appearing in September.

HEADLINE: Don't Tie Foreign Students to Black Ph.D. Drop

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Drop in Black Ph.D.'s Brings Debate on Aid for Foreigners" (front page, April 21) compares two dissimilar issues in an inflammatory manner. To claim that the presence of foreigners is responsible, if only in part, for the absence of blacks in universities is largely misleading.
The majority of foreign students study science and engineering. They remain in the United States filling junior positions, particularly in engineering departments that without them would have to close and jobs in industries that until the most recent economic downturn would have been crippled without them. 
 Yes, the foreign students receive a disproportionate share of teaching assistantships, but as the National Academy of Sciences reported in 1988, the costs are offset not only by their becoming productive members of our society but also by their having been educated at the undergraduate level by their home countries.
There are genuine problems regarding foreign students, ranging from the sticky question of quotas at most research universities to the moral questions raised by brain drain. Is the United States prospering at the expense of third world countries whose best students come here and remain, thereby making it impossible for a developing country to harness its intellectual capital?
The problem of underrepresentation of blacks in Ph.D. programs is a disaster for this country. Minorities will in time become the majority. If they are not a sizable part of our well-educated population, the country will lose its capacity to innovate and to be economically competitive.
The issue is not being ignored, but more money, talent and a national effort are required. There are programs to increase the numbers of minorities prepared for graduate school. In 1991 the National Science Foundation awarded grants of $30 million for this purpose to six universities -- Alabama, California-Irvine, Arizona State, Jackson State, Texas A&M and Puerto Rico. These cooperative grants are establishing networks with industry, community colleges and other institutions to identify minority undergraduate students for science, engineering and mathematics, the graduate fields from which they are largely absent.
However, by linking the absence of black and minority Ph.D.'s to the presence of foreign students, we run the risk of initiating policies to limit the access of foreign students without guaranteeing the success of black students. Last year, the education of foreign students netted the United States some $4 billion, according to the Department of Commerce. Those profits should somehow be invested in educating our own citizens.
During the 1980's more than 20,000 Taiwanese and South Koreans educated in United States graduate schools returned home to better employment opportunities. We can no longer count on 60 percent of foreign Ph.D.'s to remain here to occupy the teaching positions that will abet the education of larger numbers of minority students. We must use the accomplishments of one group to make possible those of the other. The situation demands cooperation, not confrontation.

HEADLINE: 'Value' Joins the Vocabulary of Wine

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
After decades of using mystique, prestige and cachet to pitch their products, some of the nation's wine makers have lately learned a new word: value. And those who have learned it best are selling more wine even while the industry is in its worst depression since Prohibition.
Value, of course, has always been in the eye of the oenophile, but most agree that it applies to a wine, costing $7 to $10 a bottle, that can give customers a taste that usually costs $12 to $16. The strategy behind such wines, which has been time-tested in many other industries, is to push up sales volume by keeping costs low.
 
Making Cutbacks
 
 Some wineries have cut back on the sales forces that call on the specialty shops and are marketing directly to large supermarkets and warehouse stores. Others have reduced their advertising, preferring instead to concentrate on getting a wine enthusiast publication's highest possible rating, which can be worth much more in sales. Still others are slicing their profit margins, a tacit concession that the premium prices they charged had little to do with the cost of making their product.
Whatever the tactic, the result gives wine drinkers a taste they like, even if it gives the purists fits.
One leading value vintner is Kendall-Jackson Vineyards of Santa Rosa, Calif., which became the fastest-growing winery in the last 10 years by offering a noticeably sweet chardonnay that sells for $9 a bottle. The taste irks the critics but pleases customers whose regular beverage might be white zinfandel, or even Pepsi.
The slight sweetness is "what the American palate preferred to have," said Jess Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who created the brand in 1983. "Our goal is to broaden the consuming public, to bring neophyte people to wine. I'm making wine for the consumer, not the wine writers."
It must be working: Kendall-Jackson's shipments grew 22.6 percent in 1991, to 705,000 cases, of which 70 percent was the winery's Vintners Reserve chardonnay.
"Not me, but people are saying, 'If you're not between $7.99 and $9.99, you're not in the premium wine business today,' " said Stephen Cousins, president of Racke U.S.A., which owns Buena Vista and other premium wine brands. "When you get under $10, assuming you have a good bottle of wine, it's magic."
Retailers agree. "Customers are very comfortable with that price," said Wilfred Wong, general manager of the Ashbury Market, a San Francisco store known for its wine selection. "All the big guys are making better wines to hit the $10 price point."
 
Success Near Seattle
 Few wineries acted earlier or more decisively than Stimson Lane Wine and Spirits in carving out a niche as a self-proclaimed "value winery" -- one that markets wines that are praised by critics but cost just $7 to $10 a bottle.
Based in Woodinville, Wash., a Seattle suburb, Stimson Lane owns the Chateau St. Michelle and Columbia Crest labels in Washington.
Like other wineries that have learned the value lesson well, Stimson Lane is reporting double-digit growth in cases shipped annually even as the wine industry as a whole slogs through its sixth year of decreasing shipments.
Indeed, the overwhelming success of a few large brands, like Clos du Bois, Kendall-Jackson and Beringer contradicts reports of an industry in decline. Measured in dollars, rather than gallons shipped, wine sales have increased in the last five years.
To sell well, a value wine has to receive quality scores comparable to those given higher-priced wines in such enthusiast publications as The Wine Advocate and The Wine Spectator.
"For $9 to $10 and discounted to less, you're getting an awful lot of character and quality," said James Laube, a senior editor at The Wine Spectator. "It doesn't take people long to say, 'These are as good as those other wines that cost a lot more.' "
 
Quality and Pricing
 The new move to sell Lexus wines at Honda prices concedes what many wine drinkers have long suspected: the high price of premium wines has little to do with actual production costs. And as the free spenders of the 1980's give way to the value-conscious oenophiles of the 1990's, success for a wine company means marketing a good wine at a reasonable price.
A unit of UST Inc., the leading producer of snuff and other smokeless tobacco products, Stimson Lane, which also owns the Villa Mount Eden and Conn Creek wineries in California, created Columbia Crest in 1985 specifically for the $7 to $10 category. Columbia Crest has grown from shipping just 12,000 cases that year to 383,000 cases in 1991.
Backed by a wealthy parent company, Stimson Lane had the capital to build a $37.5 million winery for the brand, and to invest in an aggressive advertising campaign featuring Jeff Smith. He is a best-selling cookbook author and host of "The Frugal Gourmet" cooking show on public television.
"The key was America did not need another wine brand, so we worked very hard to create a unique sales proposition," said Allen C. Shoup, the president of Stimson Lane. A former cosmetics marketing executive, he has also worked for the giant E.& J. Gallo Winery in Modesto, Calif.
"We attempted not to leave anything to chance, and treated each component as if a mistake would be critical," Mr. Shoup said.
 
A High-Rated Red

 
 Columbia Crest sells mostly chardonnay, the most popular white varietal. But merlot, a red similar to cabernet sauvignon, but softer, really established the winery's reputation for value. Columbia Crest merlot retails for $10 and is frequently discounted.
Despite their disclaimers about putting consumers first, successful wine makers all court the press. Many go so far as to tailor blends to please the palates of influential critics like Robert Parker. While the circulations of Mr. Parker's newsletter, The Wine Advocate, and its rival, The Wine Spectator, are relatively small, the publications are closely read by the distributors and retailers who make the first decision to buy a wine. They know that a score of 85 or above is a guaranteed sellout; scores in the 70's send a wine to the close-out bins.
"The first question I asked our wine maker was, 'What do you need to make a chardonnay that will consistently get good ratings?' " said William Hambrecht, president and chief executive of the Belvedere Winery in Healdsburg, Calif., as well as co-chief executive of Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm. The answer to his question was $300,000 for new French oak barrels, an amount that ultimately swelled to $1.2 million in new capital equipment.
It paid off. With a suggested retail price of $7.99, Belvedere's 1990 Alexander Valley chardonnay got 86 points and "wine of the month" in the February issue of The Wine Advocate. "That's worth a hundred salesmen," said Mr. Hambrecht, who reduced costs at Belvedere by eliminating all but one of the marketing staff members.
"In the wine business, marketing is just a euphemism for discounting to distributors," he said. With no discounting, and only minimal advertising, Belvedere sales are up 52 percent this year.
Newcomers like Belvedere and Columbia Crest are not the only ones pursuing the value niche; so are many of California's most venerable producers. The Buena Vista Winery in Sonoma, the oldest in California, recently lowered prices so that all of its nonreserve wines retail for less than $10; sales in the first quarter of 1992 were up 24.5 percent. Rodney Strong Vineyards, established in Santa Rosa in the early 1960's, says shipments are up 40 percent this year through March, driven by its line of $7 to $10 Sonoma County varietals. Fetzer Vineyards of Hopland, Calif., has always been known as a value brand.
Using new sales outlets is another part of the drive to push value wines.
"A very important part of the story today is new distribution that allows value to get to people," said John Fisher, a principal with Hambrecht & Quist who specializes in winery deals. "That's basically the warehouse clubs."
While customers get better wine at lower prices, the major wineries profit from increased sales volume and market share. The losers are medium-size wineries that lack the economy of scale to compete in the new market, and whose wines are not distinctive or rare enough to command super-premium prices. Burdened with heavy debts on equipment and vineyards and unable to raise prices, many face bankruptcy.
On the other hand, many small prestigious wineries with loyal followings are still selling all the wine they can make at $25 a bottle or more. But such wines had better deliver, said Theodor Baseler, Stimson Lane's vice president. Consumers will not long tolerate $30 wines that only provide $10 experiences.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
ACCORD IS OUTLINED ON MOVES TO HELP THE NATION'S CITIES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Trying to demonstrate that a beleaguered Washington establishment is responding to the Los Angeles riots, the White House and Congressional leaders today announced broad agreement to enact measures that they said would bring relief to American cities.
Democratic and Republican officials said a consensus was emerging on a set of programs that amounted to a few billion dollars nationwide. They include "enterprise zones" that offer tax incentives for creation of businesses in blighted neighborhoods, new efforts to drive out drug dealers and expand social services in poor neighborhoods, and enhanced job-training programs. 
 To provide immediate relief to Los Angeles, the White House said Mr. Bush would declare an emergency that would allow Congress to make an exception to current budget rules and provide $300 million in emergency assistance to the city and to individuals who lost property in the rioting.
 
Loans for Small Businesses

The emergency measure would also make avalable $300 million to $500 million in Small Business Administration loans. The House may vote on the proposal, which would increase the Federal deficit, as early as Wednesday.
The announcement, made after a White House meeting between President Bush and lawmakers from both parties, was accompanied by promises of cooperation and talk of urgency. But there was no agreement on details of the programs, most of which have long been under consideration, or on how to pay for them, apart from a new promise by Mr. Bush to oppose a tax increase.
Mr. Bush said, "The American Dream is hindered by too many obstacles: unsafe cities, slow economic growth, an out-of-date education system and dependency-creating government programs." He said the measures announced today qualified as a "radical" program of change. They included proposals not yet passed by Congress, although they were suggested some time ago.
Today's events carried strong elements of political expediency and symbolism. They seemed at times to devolve into a contest over who would seem the most responsible and concerned, as Republicans and Democrats come under intense pressure on domestic issues from a restive electorate.
The Democrats' surprisingly conciliatory stance seemed to mask an effort to pressure Mr. Bush on their own concerns, including a crime bill that would strengthen gun control and a permanent extension of unemployment benefits, in return for supporting him on policies like enterprise zones.
The Republicans seemed intent on shaping a response to the riots without risking alienating the conservative wing of their party with large new programs or, most threatening to the White House, a tax increase.
The White House took the moment to announce that the Republican leadership had agreed on a proposal to extend unemployment benefits for a third time, from July 4 until next March 6, although the White House said there was still wide disagreement with Congressional Democrats over permanent changes to the unemployment compensation system.
 
Most Proposals Repackaged
 Some new proposals were outlined today. But for the most part, both the Democrats in Congress and the White House repackaged as an emergency plan for the nation's cities proposals that were presented as recently as last month as ways to lift the economy.
Today's meeting was the first session on domestic policy this year between Mr. Bush and Democratic leaders. Under pressure from Congressional Democrats, it included Representative Maxine Waters, the Los Angeles Democrat who had strongly criticized Mr. Bush's response to the rioting and was ignored by the President last week during his visit there.
"I'm extremely encouraged," Ms. Waters said. "This is a time when both sides of the aisle must rise above partisan politics in the interest of the country. The viability of this country is at stake, and we must work together to try and get some solutions that will deal with those problems."
Mr. Bush is resubmitting his urban programs to Congress and has said his visit to Los Angeles convinced him his approach was correct. On Monday, during a visit to Philadelphia, Mr. Bush was confronted by residents who said his proposals were, as one put it, "a drop in the bucket."
 
No Money to Spare
 Clearly anticipating this sort of criticism, Mr. Bush began saying soon after the Los Angeles rioting that cities should not expect a lot of Federal money. This is in part because Mr. Bush's proposals center on familiar Republican trickle-down theories, like enticing businesses to inner cities instead of giving money to residents, and in part because Mr. Bush does not have money to spare.
Here are the President's proposals to help cities:
*Spending $500 million to drive drug dealers and violent criminals from blighted neighborhoods and create job-placement and other social programs.
*Spending $1 billion to help residents of low-income public housing buy their homes.
*Setting up zones in which businessmen would not be taxed for profit from their investments. White House officials said they had no reliable way of saying how much Mr. Bush's existing proposal in this area, which would create 50 such enterprise zones over five years, would cost and that he wants to expand it to permit an unlimited number based on criteria that have yet to be set forth.
*Putting into effect the President's existing proposals to improve schools, known as "America 2000." They include greater choice of schools and more flexibility for districts to spend Federal dollars.
*Relying on the President's existing $680 million plan to combine job-training programs under a single umbrella.
*Adopting changes in welfare rules that would give states the option of permitting those on the Aid to Families with Dependent Children to accumulate $10,000 in savings and assets without being taken off the program. The current limit is $1,000.
On Monday, Congressional Democrats promised to support enterprise zones and called on Mr. Bush to support spending $3.6 billion on additional public works projects, extend unemployment insurance to workers who do not currently qualify and back their crime bill, including extensions of gun control and the death penalty.
After today's meeting, Speaker Thomas S. Foley said: "I think there has been a commitment to see if we can in the coming days work out a cooperative series of legislative initiatives. I think we've pledged to work together to that effect."
But Isabel Sawhill, senior fellow of the Urban Institute, questioned the approach being taken by both sides.
"It is natural to be a little suspicious that this is all a reaction to Los Angeles that will be somewhat short-lived and is engineered to appear responsive in an election year," she said. "You have to ask why didn't we do this before? Or why aren't we doing it a little more carefully and with some assurances that it will do some good?"

HEADLINE: Arabs Want to Discuss Refugee Return Issue

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 12

 BODY:
Arab delegates to a Middle East meeting on the Palestinian refugee question said today they would defy an American request that they not raise the matter of the right of Palestinians to return to homes they left when Israel was created in 1948.
The issue has prompted Israeli delegates to boycott the talks, which begin here on Wednesday. They object to the participation of Palestinians from outside the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
 Israel is also boycotting talks on economic development, which began in Brussels on Monday, because of the participation of Palestinians from outside the territories. It is taking part in Washington talks on arms control, in Vienna discussions on the sharing of water resources, and in a Tokyo session on environmental problems.
Jordan's chief delegate to the refugee talks, Jawad al-Anani, said today that the State Department had sent a message to Arab delegations, asking them not to bring up the question of Palestinians' right of return or compensationfor loss of property.
The Israelis' fear that the discussions would focus on the matter intensified when the State Department said today that the United States backed the principle of return.
set forth in United Nations Resolution 194.
Today Margaret D. Tutwiler, State Department spokeswoman, asked whether Washington still supported the resolution, responded: "The United States has supported General Assembly Resolution 194 since it was adopted Dec. 11, 1948. We continue to support it."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Halt Food Aid Program for Lebanon

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, May 12

 BODY:
The United States has decided to discontinue food aid to Lebanon at a time when this country is suffering through its worst economic crisis in five decades, officials associated with the aid program said today.
The United States Agency for International Development has informed the Lebanese Government and charitable institutions that food aid will be stopped at the end of this year, said the aid officials, who did not want to be identified further. As many as 185,000 families have been receiving American food aid for several years. 
 Lebanese officials, who are trying to form a new government to replace the cabinet forced to resign last week because of bread riots, would not comment today on the decision. The switchboard at the United States Embassy did not answer.
 
400 to Be Dismissed
 The food sent by the American aid program has been distributed in all parts of Lebanon by a charitable institution known as Save the Children. The institution will now have to dismiss nearly 400 Lebanese workers employed in its food distribution program, the aid officials said.
There was no explanation for the move or its timing. A press release issued today by Save the Children said that more families have been applying for food aid because of the sharp rise in prices of essential commodities in Lebanon after the national currency lost more than half of its value in the last three months.
Each month, recipient families have been given $35 worth of basic food like lentils, rice, beans and vegetable oil. The amount is half the average monthly salary of those families. Save the Children distributes 22 metric tons of food commodities annually in all parts of Lebanon, mostly directed toward especially needy groups such as children and the elderly.
Food grants are the only aid Lebanon has received from the United States in the last seven years. The State Department maintains restrictions on travel of United States citizens to Lebanon and still has a ban on Lebanese airline flights to the United States.
Germany and the European Community are withholding all aid to Lebanon until two Germans held hostage by a Shiite Muslim group are released.
A report in the Beirut daily An Nahar said today that Lebanon is being deprived of all foreign aid because it has been boycotting the regional Middle East peace talks. Lebanese delegations have participated in direct negotiations with Israel, but officials here say the regional meetings are premature in the absence of tangible progress in the direct talks.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Decision Made After Study
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Special to The New York Times) -- A spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development said today that the decision to phase out the food program in Lebanon came after an assessment about the effectiveness of the project made over a period of more than two years by Save the Children.
The spokesman, J. D. Deming, said, in contrast to information provided by officials in Lebanon, that 25 percent of the program would be phased out by the end of the year, and the rest during 1993.

HEADLINE: Efforts Intensify to End Newspaper Labor Dispute

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
As more incidents of violence and vandalism hampered deliveries of The New York Times, efforts intensified yesterday to chart a way out of the increasingly bitter weeklong confrontation pitting The Times and a news distributor against the delivery union.
At an emotional meeting of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity last night, a packed hotel ballroom of cheering union members unanimously appointed three "go-betweens" to try to find an accord with The Times, which the union views as the key to resolving the dispute. 
 But despite the clear eagerness for peace, there was also a demonstration for war, as union members chanted, "Shut them down, shut them down," referring to The Times.
After a Federal District judge on Monday threatened heavy fines against the union, delivery disruptions outside the city abated yesterday for the second day, Times officials said. But the disruptions spread for the first time to parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, where many papers were undelivered or delayed.
Twelve of 31 Metropolitan News trucks picking up papers at The Times's plant on West 43d Street in the early hours yesterday were found disabled in the trucking bays with punctured tires, delaying or preventing delivery of 240,000 of 290,233 copies of the paper bound for the East Side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, said a Times spokeswoman, Nancy Nielsen.
 
Distribution Improves
 But distribution out of warehouses in New Rochelle, N.Y., and East Farmingdale, L.I., were 95 percent of the normal level, Ms. Nielsen said. On Sunday, the deliveries from the two locations were 30 percent of the normal level, The Times said. But by Monday, that had climbed to 92 percent, Times officials said, although some retailers disputed that figure.
In a further effort to curb the delivery disruptions and the violence, a New York State Supreme Court justice yesterday granted the news distributor's request for a preliminary injunction against union members picketing the two warehouses, said Jerold Glassman, a lawyer for the distributor, the Imperial Delivery Company.
The order by Justice Alfred M. Lama, which is valid for 30 days and was served on the union late last night, bars the pickets from causing property damage, inflicting physical injury or interfering with Imperial's operations. The justice limited the number of protesters at each warehouse to 12 and ordered them not to picket within 215 feet of the warehouse entrances.
The union meeting earlier yesterday was the first since the rejection last Wednesday of a long-range contract approved earlier by the union's leadership. The meeting, at the Ramada Inn on Seventh Avenue at 32d Street, was described as an informational session, but was widely seen as crucial in pointing the way toward a possible settlement.
The three men chosen at the meeting as "go-betweens" are John P. Kennedy, president of New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union Number 2, which has a particularly close relationship with the drivers; Barry Feinstein, the head of Joint Council 16 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which oversees all teamster locals in the area; and Michael M. Connery, a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who is working on behalf of unions in the effort to find a buyer for The Daily News.
A parade of other union leaders pledged to offer all legal support for the drivers.
John M. O'Brien, deputy general manager for The Times in charge of labor negotiations, said last night that The Times "was certainly willing to listen to anyone who has a solution to this, and we will talk to them."
If the conflict cannot be quickly resolved and the replacement of more than 200 union drivers becomes permanent, a settlement could become far more difficult and might spread labor strife in the industry.
The dispute is tied to the sale of the assets of four wholesale distribution companies: two to Arthur E. Imperatore, owner of Imperial, and two to The Times. The Times's purchase is still pending. Under the law, the new owners are not bound by previous labor contracts.
An agreement had been reached with the union's leadership, but the membership rejected it last week by a 57 percent majority. Mr. Imperatore, a New Jersey trucking and real-estate entrepreneur, then began using new drivers in place of the 267 union drivers who boycotted the distributorships he was purchasing: Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle and Newspaper Distributors Company in East Farmingdale. He has vowed not to deal any further with the union.
The Times, which had contracted to buy the assets of two other wholesale distributors -- the Newark Newsdealers Supply Company and the Metropolitan News Company, which deliver in New Jersey and New York City -- has said it is considering assigning its purchase agreement to Mr. Imperatore if the union refuses to agree to economies like reductions in overtime that would cut some yearly incomes to $40,000 from $80,000. In exchange, the rejected contract offered job security and other benefits.
Early yesterday, leaders of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella labor group representing all unions at The Times, The Daily News and The New York Post, met inconclusively in the absence of The Times and Imperial, which said their presence would serve no purpose prior to the driver's membership meeting.
As the maneuvering continued yesterday, the Connecticut office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had opened "a full field investigation" into the reported abduction at gunpoint on Saturday of an employee of Mr. Imperatore's.
The employee, Munir Fahreddine, a foreman at Imperial's Westfair Newspaper Distributors in New Rochelle, said a gunman forced him out of his car near his home in Danbury and into a van with three other men, who roughed him up and held him overnight before releasing him near Pawling, N.Y., Sunday morning. Milt Ahlerich, special agent in charge of the New Haven F.B.I. office, said the complaint had been judged credible.
In other acts of disruption reported yesterday by Times officials, shortly before 5 A.M. a tractor-trailer heading to the East Farmingdale warehouse was intercepted on the Long Island Expressway by three cars that waited in the breakdown lane. The drivers then chased the truck and one with a rifle or shotgun forced the truck driver to stop and get out, the company said. Ms. Nielsen, the Times spokeswoman, said the incident was not reported to the police because neither the driver nor three security guards following him could identify the assailants or their cars.
The newspaper also reported unusually frequent tearing of the paper on the presses at its printing plant in Carlstadt, N.J., and the smashing of a truck windshield at the New Rochelle warehouse. The union has disavowed acts of violence.
Federal District Judge Pierre N. Leval ruled Monday night that the deliverers' union was in contempt of court for disrupting deliveries and ordered fines of $100,000 for every hour the daily paper was delayed. He also set a court hearing for Wednesday on the newspaper's application to impose the penalties.
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, said yesterday that he was "tremendously heartened" by Judge Leval's ruling on fines but said that because of it, further acts of "violence and intimidation" were "almost unbelievable."
He said such acts would have "adverse short-term consequences" for the paper and its readers but that "in the long run it will severely damage, perhaps destroy, the drivers' union."

HEADLINE: U.S. Summons Ambassador To Yugoslavia Over Bosnia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The United States recalled its Ambassador from Yugoslavia today and said that Washington would seek "strong collective action against Belgrade's aggression against Bosnia."
But the Bush Administration stopped short of suggesting any specific steps that could put pressure on the Serb militias who have dismissed all mediation efforts in their armed drive to prevent Bosnia-Herzogovina from achieving full independence or on the Government and Serbian-led Yugoslav Army command in Belgrade, which have backed and armed the irregulars. 
 In announcing that Ambassador Warren Zimmermann had been summoned home for consultations, the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the United States was acting in concert with the European Community, which declared Monday that its members were recalling their ambassadors.
But in Europe as well as here, there seems to be no move to raise the level of response beyond the cautiously diplomatic. More active measures such as imposing economic sanctions or a show of force to defend Bosnia have apparently been ruled out for now because of concerns over the unpredictable consequences of such actions.
 
Use of Sanctions Doubtful
 The Yugoslav Army is a relatively large and powerful force that could not be easily suppressed. Moreover, Belgrade could parry an attempted boycott by having its effect fall most harshly on non-Serbian populations like the nearly 500,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Serbia or the even larger numbers of Albanians. Finally there is no assurance that pressure on the Serbs in Serbia will have great effect on the Serb militias in Bosnia. .
Earlier this year, when Yugoslavia was slipping into chaos, several European officials suggested at a March meeting in Brussels of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, an extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that NATO might consider creating a role for itself in conflicts in the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe or the new nations of the former Soviet Union. But a consensus, shared by Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d, emerged that it was "too early" to take such a step.
A meeting of the European Community Foreign Ministers decided on Monday to recall the European Ambassadors from Belgrade and demanded the withdrawal of Yugoslav Army forces from Bosnia-Herzogovina. The European Foreign Ministers also decided to suspend Yugoslavia from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 52-member organization promoting democratic principles and human rights.
Today, the organization backed off from a full suspension, choosing instead merely to suspend Belgrade from participation in discussions concerning Yugoslavia until the end of June.
 
U.S. Follows European Lead
 The United States first called for the suspension of Yugoslavia from the European security conference, then declined to push the issue. The Bush Administration had also first suggested the withdrawal of ambassadors, but then waited for the Europeans to take the lead. The United States also followed Europe in April in recognizing the independence of three breakaway former Yugoslav republics -- Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzogovina.
In keeping with the low-keyed style of the Bush Administration in recent regional crises -- in sharp contrast to the international campaign organized against Iraq in 1990-1991 -- no high-level United States official has made a public statement in recent days about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Secretary of State Baker, who made several trips to Yugoslavia over the last year to seek pledges of nonviolence, has not publicly condemned the fighting in Bosnia.
Miss Tutwiler today described the Serbian leadership in Belgrade as being "in clear and continuing violation of all C.S.C.E. principles." She said that reports from Marrack Goulding, the United Nations envoy in the region, indicated that over a million people had become refugees from the fighting in Bosnia-Herzogovina.
"All of us have done whatever we can to try to influence a cessation of this constant hardship and tragedy and disruption in people's lives," Miss Tutwiler said. "It is a real tragedy."
Miss Tutwiler said that Ambassador Zimmerman's last duties today would be to try to assist in getting humanitarian assistance to people without food and medicine. She said that relief convoys were being blocked from reaching most seriously affected areas.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Agents Raid Casinos On 5 Indian Reservations

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHOENIX, May 12

 BODY:
Acting on day-old Government rules, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided casinos at five Indian reservations across Arizona today and seized about 750 electronic game machines.
At four of the reservations, the raids were carried out with little incident. But at the Fort McDowell Yavapai Reservation, outside nearby Scottsdale, about 100 Indians used three dozen or so pickups, big earth-movers and other vehicles to surround eight trucks that were preparing to take away game machines from the parking lot of the casino there. 
 The blockade by the Indians, who appeared to be unarmed, trapped not only the trucks but also dozens of F.B.I. agents. The standoff lasted five hours and was not broken until Gov. Fife Symington negotiated an agreement with Clinton Pattea, the Yavapai tribal chairman at Fort McDowell.
 
Provisions of Accord
 Under the agreement, which the Governor said had been approved by United States Attorney Linda Akers, Federal agents removed the tractors of the Government trucks from the Fort McDowell parking lot, leaving the trailers and their load of 400 game machines for a 10-day cooling-off period. During that period, Mr. Symington will negotiate with reservation leaders about the possibility of their continuing to use the game machines, which are by far the casino's biggest money-makers.
The Governor also promised to speed state unemployment payments to the hundreds of Indians put out of work by today's raids.
At issue is a 1988 Federal law that permits Indian reservations to offer gambling in states that allow wagering outside the reservation. But the kind of gambling allowed on the reservations is limited to the kind offered outside, unless tribal leaders can persuade state officials to the contrary.
In Arizona, the state government has not been so persuaded. As a result, Government rules that took effect Monday bar two types of gambling that have proved popular on the reservations. One involves electronic machines that resemble card games, the other so-called pull-tab machines that dispense lottery-type slips.
Reservation casinos typically offer only two other kinds of gaming -- poker played man-to-man, not against the house, and bingo -- and neither is anywhere near so popular as the machines. Gilbert Jones, vice chairman at the Fort McDowell Reservation, said today that the casino there had brought in $19 million since October, 80 percent of it from the machines.
Indian leaders contend that without the revenue, social programs on the reservations will suffer. Asserting that the tribes are sovereign nations and fearful that the new rules would lead to more raids, several tribes around the country filed suit against the regulations in Washington last Friday.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise In Producer Price Index

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Producer prices crept up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Government said today. Economists said the report showed that the Federal Reserve had room to cut interest rates again to perk up the slowly recovering economy.
The Producer Price Index, which also went up by two-tenths of 1 percent in March and in February, has risen so far this year at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent, the Labor Department said.
"One reason the inflation rate is so low is the sluggish economy," said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a banking company in Minneapolis. "I think the Fed will recognize this and take appropriate action as soon as possible."
 
Consumer Data Due Today

 
 Analysts predict the Fed will wait to act until it sees if the low inflation figures are confirmed by the Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday.
"We will see further progress in reducing inflation in the C.P.I.," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.
That would ease any fears that another move to cut interest rates, which have been coming down steadily for more than a year, would overheat the economy and stoke inflation.
Mr. Sohn contends the central bank should be aggressive and move for cuts of half a percentage point in both the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for loans, and the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for loans.
Many economists maintain that such a move by the Fed would persuade banks to cut their prime lending rates by half a point. Many business and consumer loans are pegged to the prime.
Most banks' prime rates are at 6 1/2 percent, although Chemical Bank in New York, the nation's fourth-largest, cut its rate to 6 1/4 percent after the Fed's most recent push, on April 9, to lower the Federal funds rate to 3 3/4 percent from 4 percent.
The Labor Department said the core rate of wholesale inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also rose by two-tenths of 1 percent in April. Goods at the intermediate level rose one-tenth of 1 percent, and crude prices were up three-tenths.
 Wholesale food prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April after dropping five-tenths in March. Energy prices advanced by five-tenths last month, mainly because of increases in the price of refined oil products; they had shot up 1.2 percent in March. Some economists expressed concern about the rise in energy prices.
 "It's a good number," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, referring to the overall index. "But there are some special circumstances."
 
Gasoline and Heating Oil

 
 He noted that gasoline prices rose by 1.4 percent last month, after gaining 1.1 percent in March. Heating oil was up 4.6 percent in April, after advancing two-tenths of 1 percent in March and 16.2 percent in February.
 But other economists said the rise in energy prices should not deter Fed policy makers from easing credit.
"Energy is clearly not something that can be rectified by monetary policy, and they should not be concerned about it," said Mr. Gramley, a former Fed board member.
Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, said he thought the Fed was prepared to lower interest rates if inflation remained under control and the recovery appeared to falter.
 
Bond Prices Head Up
 "They have the opportunity and the will to do something extra if necessary," Mr. Boskin told reporters in Paris, where he was at a meeting.
Inflation-sensitive Treasury bond prices surged on the producer prices report, with the 30-year issue up more than half a point, cutting its yield to 7.86 percent, from 7.88 percent Monday. Stock prices fell, however, as investors awaited the consumer price report on Wednesday.
 Recent data show that business activity is gradually picking up speed, which would traditionally argue for the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold the line on interest rates. The committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday.
 But economists said the Fed needed to insure that the recovery took hold and did not falter, as it did last year. They added that the tepid 2 percent annual rate of economic growth recorded in the first quarter was not enough to accomplish that.

HEADLINE: BELGRADE SHOCKED BY EUROPEAN MOVE

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, May 12

 BODY:
Despite weeks of being warned that it could not continue with the effective dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina and escape diplomatic and economic sanctions, the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Government appeared somewhat surprised today by the moves taken by the European Community and the United States to begin the process of isolation by withdrawing their ambassadors from Belgrade.
An official Yugoslav statement claiming that Western governments were guilty of "bias" against Serbia in designating it as the main culprit in Bosnia was not issued until late today, more than 24 hours after the European Community's foreign ministers announced that they were pulling out their envoys. 
 The Belgrade Government's statement made no reference to the withdrawal of Warren Zimmermann, the United States Ambassador, although the Government had been told of the American move earlier in the day.
 
Serbia Is Indignant
 The ambassadors' withdrawal was about the least threatening measure the Western nations could take. But instead of relief that nothing more concrete was announced, and that economic sanctions apparently will be further delayed, Serbia was indignant.
A senior Foreign Ministry official, Branko Brankovic, even suggested that the Western nations were "opening the door to Islamic fundamentalism in Europe," a reference to the contention among hard-line leaders of Bosnia's Serbs, who are Orthdox Christians, that in fighting a civil war with the republic's Muslim Slavs they are battling for religious survival.
Apart from overlooking the fact that the Serbian effort to seize control of much of Bosnia has also pitted them against the republic's Croats, who are mostly Roman Catholics, the statement by Mr. Brankovic reflected the degree to which historical passions have inflamed Serbia's policies.
Reflecting on this, diplomats here said that even if economic sanctions were adopted, as the United States and the European Community have threatened at various stages of the Serbian offensives in Croatia and Bosnia, there was no certainty that Serbia would relent in its determination to entrench separate territorial strongholds for Serbs in the two neighboring republics.
For now, the European Community has held open the possibility of sanctions by instructing the European Commission, the body that administers the community's affairs, to look at what sanctions could be applied if Serbia fails to end its military offensive in Bosnia and to support the community's efforts to draw all three ethnic groups into agreement on Bosnia's future as an independent state.
Diplomats said that a number of measures available to the European nations, including banning Yugoslav truck traffic and closing European airports to Yugoslav aircraft, could have a major effect on Serbia, although probably not enough to cause a collapse of its weakened economy.
 
Greece and Macedonia
 One reason that tougher actions have been deferred is that steps like closing European borders to Yugoslav trucks would require unanimous approval by all 12 community members, and one of them, Greece, has aligned itself with Serbia in its diplomatic confrontation with Europe.
The Greek position is partly the result of its dispute with another breakaway Yugoslav republic, Macedonia, which wants to take its independence under that name. Greece contends that the name belongs exclusively to its own province of Macedonia.
The United States, which has maintained its own range of minor economic sanctions against Serbia, could also close its airports to Yugoslav aircraft, cutting off scheduled Yugoslav Airlines flights to New York. But with the total two-way trade between the two countries amounting to about $1 billion, about 5 percent of Serbia's total trade, the impact of American sanctions would be limited. In any case, diplomats said, an American decision to apply sanctions was "still some way off."
 
The New Federation
 For the time being, the Serbian anxieties appear to be focused mainly on whether the Western nations will recognize the new truncated Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro proclaimed last month. Without recognition, the new Yugoslav federation could find itself excluded from a wide range of international organizations to which the former Yugoslavia belonged, including some, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, that are of major importance.
The difficulty of isolating Serbia was illustrated by the decision today to suspend Serbia from taking part in discussions on the Bosnian issue at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a 52-nation organization that met in Helsinki. The decision, effective until the end of June, was made only after several days of diplomatic maneuvering to overcome the objections of Russia, which had effectively vetoed the move. Diplomats said that Russia, whose historical links with Serbia have been reviving since the collapse of Communism, could pose similar objections to excluding Serbia from other international bodies.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans to Join Other Leaders At Earth Summit in Brazil in June

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
As expected, President Bush said today that he would join more than 100 other world leaders and attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.
"Today's environmental problems are global and every nation must help in solving them," Mr. Bush said in a statement. "As the U.S. has demonstrated over more than two decades, protecting the environment and encouraging economic growth can go hand in hand." 
 Mr. Bush's decision came after months of internal Administration debate. For many months, Mr. Bush has been criticized by Democratic members of Congress, environmentalists and his likely Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, for not embracing the Earth Summit and its ambitious envrionmental goals.
Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado said the President "reflexively responds to the politics of an old world order while preaching the need for the new."
Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who has become an expert in environmental matters, criticized what he called the Administration's "policy of photo opportunities and symbols instead of real commitments."
 
Treaty on Climate Change
 Mr. Bush said in the statement that he decided to go to the summit conference after top aides negotiated a treaty last weekend on global climate change that aims at, but does not set specific timetables for limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.
White House aides said the President was advised to refrain from attending until conditions more favorable to United States industries were worked out.
"Once the President committed to go he ran the risk of being presented with demands we would find unacceptable," said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, explaining the strategy. "The climate change treaty that we got owes a little bit at least to a desire that the President would attend and a concern on the part of other governments to make sure that the treaty language would be helpful to get him to Rio."
Environmentalists said the treaty is a weak, but not worthless step toward stabilizing the output of gases they argue are rapidly warming the earth. Liz Barratt-Brown, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington said that much more aggressive steps would need to be taken to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants to prevent dangerous ecological disruptions.
 
U.S. Given Wide Latitude
 The President's top environmental advisers, though, said the treaty set in motion a global process for stabilizing concentrations of gases at levels that were produced in 1990. The treaty also gives the United States wide latitude in deciding how to achieve those levels without injuring industrial development, Administration officials said.
The Earth Summit, expected to be the largest gathering of world leaders ever, takes place in Rio from June 3 to June 14. The White House said today that the President's schedule had not been set. Mr. Reilly said the President was likely to attend the conference on June 13 to sign the climate change treaty and a separate treaty to preserve species that is under negotiation in Nairobi, Kenya.

HEADLINE: Radical Overhaul Proposed In System of Child Support

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Despite a season of bitter partisanship, two of Congress's most divergent members today proposed a radical change in the way the country collects child-support payments from absent fathers.
Most experts agree that the current system is deeply flawed and that it contributes to a variety of urban problems, including escalating welfare rolls and children living in poverty. 
 But while many proposals have been advanced to change the system, none have been embraced by such an unlikely alliance as the one offered today by Representative Thomas J. Downey, a liberal Long Island Democrat, and Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is one of Congress's staunchest conservatives.
The proposal met with praise from many liberals today, skepticism from the White House and attacks from some conservatives.
 
Bipartisan Approach
 "I am here to demonstrate that Republicans and Democrats can work together," said Mr. Downey, who has been working on the proposal for more than a year. Several months ago he approached Mr. Hyde, who has long had an interest in child-support issues.
"Both of us are appalled by what we see today, the disintegration of the American family and the havoc this has wrought on millions of innocent children," Mr. Hyde said.
Their plan would transfer responsibility for all child-support collection from states to the Internal Revenue Service. And it would also guarantee that the Government make a minimum payment of $2,000 a year for a mother with one child if it failed to collect from the absent father. The maximum per family would be $4,000.
The proposal would also create 300,000 new public service jobs to give unemployed fathers a way to make their payments.
Mr. Downey estimated that the stepped-up enforcement could increase the $11 billion now collected in child support to as much as $35 billion a year. He predicted a substantial drop in poverty and dependency as a result. Mr. Hyde said the plan echoed traditional conservative themes by holding fathers responsible for their families.
The lawmakers estimated the cost of the proposal at $5 billion to $10 billion a year. They plan to introduce it as legislation early next year.
Gail Wilensky, a domestic policy adviser to President Bush, said the White House would consider supporting a small pilot project if the funds came from cuts in other social spending. But she criticized the notion of a Government guarantee, saying it might discourage fathers from paying.
Other conservatives said the plan would discourage single mothers from working or getting married. "It's the worst single welfare proposal I've ever seen in my life, bar none," said Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington.
 
Disintegration of Family
 In calling for the plan, Mr. Downey emphasized the sweeping and perhaps irreversible changes in family structure that have occurred over the past generation. In 1960, 9.1 percent of American children lived in single-parent families; by 1990 that figure had grown to 24.7 percent.
Of the approximately 10 million women raising children by themselves, 42 percent have never been awarded child support from a state court.
Many women are reluctant to identify the father, particularly since child-support payments can be used to reduce welfare benefits. But collection remains a big problem even when state courts get involved.
Some fathers deliberately evade payment, often by moving to another state. Others have little or no earnings and find themselves unable to pay.
Only 51 percent of the women with court-orders collect the full amount they are owed. Another 24 percent get less than they are owed, and 25 percent receive no money from the father.
The Downey-Hyde plan would leave responsibility for identifying fathers with the states, but provide new money to do so. Only mothers who cooperated in identifying fathers would be eligible for the guaranteed benefits.
 
Federal and State Roles
 States would determine the initial amount a father was expected to pay. The Internal Revenue Service would be responsible for collecting and distributing the payments, through a payroll deduction system much like the one used to collect taxes. In addition, the plan offers new job-training services for fathers with low incomes.
Mr. Downey said the proposal was carefully put together to include work incentives for women on welfare. If they stayed on welfare, their grants would be reduced by the amount the Government paid or collected, so there would be no net income gain. But if they worked, they could keep both their earnings and the child-support amount.
It was Mr. Hyde, the conservative, who resorted to the visionary language more often used by liberal child advocates. "The social costs of the current system can't be calculated," he said. "We've seen some of it in riots, in lives wasted from the moment they're conceived."

Virgin Megastore to Enter U.S. Market in a Big Way

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Richard Branson, the 41-year-old British entrepreneur, said yesterday that he planned to open the largest record store in Los Angeles next fall in the first United States venture for his fast-growing Virgin Megastore division.
"It will be three times as big as that of our nearest competitor," he said of the store, which is to in a shopping mall on Sunset Boulevard. 
 The store will have 30,000 square feet of space, compared with the 10,000-square-foot Los Angeles store of his major rival, H.M.V, a major British retailer also known as His Majesty's Voice.
The Virgin Megastore division already has 30 stores in Britain, the European Continent, Australia and Japan. Founded in 1971 when Mr. Branson was 20 years old, the Megastore group has expanded rapidly in the last two years, with most of the growth on the Continent and in the Far East.
Its store in Paris on the Champs-Elysee has more than $125 million a year in revenue, which Mr. Branson said represented one of the largest amounts in retailing for 30,000 square feet of space.
As with his other stores, Mr. Branson said, the one in Los Angeles will consist of groups of smaller shops specializing in such styles as rock, jazz and classical. It will also sell books and games and have a restaurant.
Mr. Branson, who attended a lunch with editors and reporters at The New York Times yesterday, also gave further details of his plans to establish special trains on the tracks owned by British Railways to feed the London flights of his airline, Virgin Atlantic Airways.
He said that the British Government had already approved the right for his company to lease tracks from the Government-owned railroad and set up a competing service. He added that he was talking with Electra Investment Trust, a large investment group in Britain, to help with the financing.
 
Railway Amenities
 The trains will be patterned after the service on Virgin Atlantic planes, having such amenities as computer games in seats, stand-up lounges and special food service provided by attendants. Virgin has competed with the major airlines by offering business-class fliers service similar to first class but at business-class prices; it also offers more creature comforts to economy-class fliers.
One of Mr. Branson's goals is to be able to provide express trains to London from such cities as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle, with travel times close to those available through current plane service in Britain.
Virgin Atlantic at this point has no way of bringing travelers to London from other parts of Britain for its flights, which depart from London to such big cities as Newark and Tokyo. The rail service, he said, would help to feed Virgin's expansion to new destinations like Johannesburg, Chicago and San Francisco.
Mr. Branson is flush with cash since he recently sold the Virgin Music Group, a record company, for $880 million to Thorn EMI P.L.C. His share of the sale was $540 million.
That does not mean, however, that he is ready to expand wildly. He prefers that his empire, which also includes hotels and computer games, stays small enough to keep tabs on, and that he keep its individual companies small enough so that the employees know one another.
Reaching into his pocket, he drew scraps of paper on which he had made notes on his Virgin Atlantic flight Monday night, jottings that illustrate his attention to the minutiae of his operations. He noted, for instance, that business fliers wanted their complimentary travel booties given out about a half-hour after takeoff because they want to go to sleep soon after they board. He found that some of the caps on the free bottles of scented oil were sometimes loose. And he found that some business fliers wanted cash instead of the free ticket for the miles they had racked up traveling on Virgin.
 
The Romance of It All
 A challenge, Mr. Branson said, was to keep some of the romance alive in working for an airline, an important element in maintaining the morale of the 8,000 employees at Virgin. To help, he said, the airline tries to hire people who have not worked for other carriers -- except in the more technical jobs, like pilots, many of whom come from Virgin's archrival, British Airways.
He also allows the staff to participate in decisions affecting them, such as bringing 500 flight attendants together with a group of designers in a hangar and allowing them to design their own uniforms. And he said he sought out good hotels for his traveling employees.
"There should be romance," he said. "Often, airlines forget that."

HEADLINE: INCREASE APPROVED IN FEES BANKS PAY TO INSURE DEPOSITS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Defying heavy pressure from both the Bush Administration and the industry, Federal regulators voted today to raise the premiums that banks and savings associations pay to their insolvent insurance funds and to make fundamental changes in the way those premiums are assessed.
The 3-to-2 decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would raise premiums an average of 22 percent starting in January. And for the first time since 1934, when the initial fund was set up in the wake of the bank collapses of the Depression, weaker institutions would pay a bigger increase than stronger ones. 
 In an effort to encourage prudent banking practices, Congress last year gave the regulators until 1994 to end the 58-year-old system of having all banks pay the same rate.
 
Impact on Consumers
 The increase, which the Administration had hoped until the last minute to be able to block, would have a broad economic impact, making banking more expensive for customers, who will have to pay more for loans and receive lower yields on deposits.
It would also hurt the stockholders of about 14,500 banks and savings associations, reducing the industry's after-tax earnings by more than 4 percent. Some of the premium costs are also borne by taxpayers, because institutions are permitted to write off a percentage of their premium payments on their corporate taxes.
Supporters of the increase say it is intended to protect confidence in the economy by strengthening the insurance fund, which is deeply in the red and at its lowest level since its creation during the Depression.
 
More Big Losses Expected
 William Taylor, the chairman of the insurance corporation, said that the bank insurance fund lost about $11 billion last year, giving it a deficit of about $7 billion that it has had to borrow from the Treasury, and that even greater annual losses could be posted in the next two years. The proposed changes would raise an additional $1.25 billion annually.
The increase, to an average of 28 cents for every $100 in deposits from the current 23 cents, is expected to be approved after a 60-day comment period. The weakest banks, those with the least capital and the most problem loans, would pay an additional 3 cents for every $100 in deposits, and the strongest would pay 3 cents less.
Regulators said that the new risk-based system may take longer to put in place, but that any delay would not postpone the premium increase.
The bank insurance fund, which stood at $18.3 billion six years ago, has been battered by the failures of 885 banks since then, costing more than $26 billion. While assessments have nearly tripled, from 8.3 cents per $100 just three years ago to the current 23 cents, they have failed to keep pace with the devastation of the industry.
The dissenting votes on the premium increase were cast by the Treasury Department's representatives on the board: T. Timothy Ryan Jr., head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and Stephen R. Steinbrink, Acting Comptroller of the Currency.
Mr. Steinbrink said in an interview afterward that he supported a 4-cent increase, but that the board's approval of 5 cents, bringing in an additional $250 million, "was not justified."
After the board appeared to be moving toward a 4-cent increase, Mr. Taylor said that would not be enough, and two other members, C. C. Hope Jr. and Andrew C. Hove Jr., joined him to support the 5-cent raise.
Mr. Taylor's term expires in February, and the premium increase, one of the most important regulatory decisions this year, had put him squarely between Congress and the Treasury. Today's decision was in clear defiance of the industry and the Bush Administration, which appointed Mr. Taylor less than a year ago.
 
Tough Political Fight
 Mr. Taylor, who has told associates the increase was the most difficult political fight he has fought, said that in recent months the industry had shown some signs of improvement, primarily because of favorable interest rates, but that it was too soon to conclude that troubled banks had worked out their problems with real estate loans.
"I would prefer to be here lowering the premium," he said at the packed board meeting today. "But if we were to overestimate the problem and take in too much money, it would be the first time in a long time. The information in front of us is overwhelming, and it's responsible for us to do what's right and increase the premium.
"We're trying to close a widening gap between revenues and expenses, a reasonable business principle, a reasonable government principle and one that shows strength rather than weakness."
 
One Grim Forecast
 A report by the F.D.I.C. staff stated that "as bad as the past five years have been in terms of insurance losses, the next two years could be even worse." It said a rate of about 50 cents would be needed to prevent the fund from deteriorating further. The agency has said it expects 200 banks holding $80 billion in assets to fail this year, at a cost to the fund of about $14 billion.
Industry groups had complained that the increase was unnecessary and harmful, and had pressed the five board members in the last few days to postpone a decision until after Election Day. They have also said the F.D.I.C. projections are too pessimistic, noting that so far this year the Government has seized only 51 banks holding $16.1 billion in assets.
"Raising premiums will do more harm than good at a time when the banking industry and the economy are beginning to show signs of strength," said Alan R. Tubbs, president of the American Bankers Association and head of the Maquoketa State Bank in Maquoketa, Iowa.
Officials at the American Bankers Association said the premium increase would have a small impact on customers at some institutions, and a much larger impact at others, depending on the markets and financial condition of each bank.
 
Congressional Reaction
 The increase was supported by several important lawmakers, who have sought higher assessments to avoid an embarrassing repeat of the huge taxpayer bailout of the nation's savings and loans.
"The F.D.I.C. has taken a much-needed step toward protecting taxpayers and depositors," said Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee. "The industry must shoulder this burden, not the taxpayer."
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and the head of the House Banking Committee, called the increase "the minimum that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could do to keep the bank insurance fund afloat."
The theory behind the new risk-based insurance system is that it would reward the best-managed institutions and deter other banks from risky lending, just as private insurance is thought to work in other industries.
 
Some Delay Is Possible
 It has been widely supported in principle for years, but putting a plan into effect has always proved nettlesome. Some regulators said today that the plan might not be ready to carry out by January, in which case the premium increases would still take effect.
Under the proposed change, banks would be ranked in one of nine categories. The rankings would be based on a bank's level of capital and on a more subjective supervisory judgment.
Capital, which is the owners' interest in an institution, is an important indicator of financial health because it provides a cushion to absorb losses.
The supervisory considerations include the results of examiners' reports, public filings on performance, and other information available to the regulators.

He Doesn't Call Them Dirty Deals

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Many entrepreneurs have tried to pull off emissions-trading deals under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Apparently the first to be successful, with the agreement between the Tennessee Valley Authority and Wisconsin Power and Light, is a small Washington-based investment banking firm, Clean Air Capital Markets, established by John B. Henry 2d shortly after passage of the act.
Mr. Henry, 43 years old, said in a telephone interview that his approach was different from many competitors, who were acting as consultants. He is an investment banker, paid only if a deal is signed. He did not disclose the fee for the T.V.A.-Wisconsin deal, but said he and his partners had spent more than $1 million "establishing the franchise," or setting themselves up to arrange such deals. 
 The size of the potential market is huge; by Mr. Henry's calculation, if all the emission reductions were achieved by trades -- which is unlikely -- the value would equal one-third the capitalization of all the companies on the American Stock Exchange. "We're not shooting mice here," he said. "It's an elephant hunt."
 
Making Them Cringe
 Mr. Henry and others in the field cringe at the idea that utilities are buying the right to pollute. "Utilities are buying clean air," he said. No utility would rely exclusively on allowance purchases, rather than cleaning itself up, he said; for one thing, that would be politically impossible.
But if buying allowances is cheaper than cutting emissions, then utilities should buy, to help hold their rates down, he said. Electric rates increased by environmental requirements are like a regressive tax, Mr. Henry believes, falling more heavily on the poor.
A second such deal was announced yesterday by Wisconsin Power; the company said that in addition to T.V.A., it was also selling allowances to the Duquesne Light Company, with headquarters in Pittsburgh. Mr. Henry was not involved in that deal.
Mr. Henry, a graduate of Columbia Law School, describes Clean Air Capital Markets as his second environmental company. From 1981 to 1990 he was chief executive of Crop Genetics International, an agricultural biotechnology company traded over-the-counter.
Clean Air Capital Markets' vice president is Ernest G. Ellingson, formerly in charge of strategic planning at Georgia Power. The company's lawyer is Andrew D. Weissman, who specializes in air pollution law.
While economists have hailed the emissions trading concept, utilities, which are inherently conservative, have been slow to warm to the concept. "They have an extraordinary bias to on-system compliance, cleaning up your own system," he said. One reason, he said, is that each utility has a fuel department, which would handle the arrangements if the company chose fuel-switching, an engineering staff that would negotiate with companies that install scrubbers or other pollution control equipment. But, he said, "generally there are no constituents inside for buying compliance outside your own system."
But buying allowances is the most conservative option, he argued. "What a scrubber really is, is a decision to buy a 30-year stream of allowances," he said, meaning that the scrubber would generate emission reductions for that long. But if the scrubber went into service in 1995 and ran until 2025, he said, that committed the utility to that option for all those years. If the price of allowances declines in future years, he said, the scrubber would look like a bad buy.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Off On Weak Demand for Loans

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were down for the week ended today, The Bank Rate Monitor said in its most recent survey.
Frank J. Barkocy, a senior vice president and bank analyst at Advest Inc., said that because of a weak demand for loans, many banks were flush with cash and had no need to increase rates to lure new depositors. When rolling over certificates of deposits, banks have been able to offer rates at about half the level they were two years ago. 
 "The result has been some depositors moving their money into more liquid demand deposits, with mutual funds having offered one of the best alternatives since there are so many," Mr. Barkocy said, noting that the low interest rates were especially hard on depositors living on fixed incomes.
"There are funds that offer the safety of principal as well as those with some risk advantages, but a blend of positioning makes the most sense.".
At the Treasury's auction of new three- and six-month bills on Monday, interest rates declined slightly. The weekly auction is seen as a good barometer of what many banks will pay depositors in the weeks ahead.
At the auction, the average rate on a three-month bill slipped a basis point, to 3.64 percent, and a six-month bill fell 4 basis points, to 3.74 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Metropolitan-Area Banks
 Yields at New York area banks were down, but the decline was not severe. The average money market account was off a basis point, to 3.49 percent, and three- and six-month C.D.'s were down an average 2 basis points, to 3.55 percent and 3.71 percent, respectively.
In the latest week, commercial banks and savings banks were both down similar amounts, with commercial money market accounts and three- and six-month certificates all off 2 basis points. The average money market account was at 3.22 percent, while the three- and six-month certificates were at 3.38 percent and 3.46 percent, respectively.
Savings banks, meanwhile, cut their money market accounts a basis point, to 3.76 percent, and their three- and six-month C.D.'s 2 basis points, to 3.74 percent and 3.96 percent, respectively.
The largest cuts in yields among the New York banks were at the Republic National Bank of New York, which lowered the yield on its money market account by 26 basis points, to 3.30 percent, and the Bank of Tokyo, which lowered its three- and six-month C.D.'s by 16 basis points, to 2.93 percent and 3.05 percent, respectively.
For 20 large banks outside the New York market, yields fell further. A money market account slipped 2 basis points, to 3.36 percent, and a six-month C.D. was down 4 basis points, to 3.71 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, May 13, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on themethod of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: U.S. Predicts Slow Decline in Trade Deficit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration predicted today that the United States trade deficit would gradually decline this year, although it conceded that a severe economic slowdown in Europe and Japan could jeopardize the forecast.
In its semiannual report to Congress on trade and exchange rates, the Administration said recent trade statistics suggested a continuation of a gradual improvement in the deficit, especially given growing demand for United States products in Latin America. 
 "However, prospects for further declines in the trade deficit are subject to particular uncertainty this year given the cyclical situation in both the United States and the other major industrial countries," the report said.
The report said a slow economic recovery in the United States would contribute to lower imports from overseas.
It noted that the merchandise trade deficit had dropped in 1991 for the fourth consecutive year, to $74 billion, from $108 billion in 1990. While imports fell $8 billion, to $490 billion in 1991, exports grew by $27 billion, to $417 billion.
Unless offset by economic conditions in the United States or in Japan and Europe, "the pattern of recent monthly data is consistent with a continuation in 1992 of a gradual downward trend in the trade deficit, perhaps to the $65 billion range from $74 billion in 1991," the report said.
Because of weakening economies in Japan and Europe, the pattern of exports has shifted to Latin America and East Asia, where many nations have been experiencing strong growth.
"One-third of the increase in exports went to Latin America, and this area replaced Europe as our fastest-growing market," the report said.
The report also accused China for the first time of manipulating its exchange rate, resulting in a large trade surplus with the United States.
Three previous reports attributed China's trade surplus primarily to causes other than exchange rate manipulation.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
NBC Likes Young Viewers, Judging From Its Fall Plans

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IF NBC needs a theme to promote its prime-time schedule for 1992-93, "Young at Heart" might do.
The network has embarked on a much-discussed effort to bolster its advertising revenues by attracting younger viewers, consumers aged 18 to 49, for whom marketers yearn because they spend more freely and are more likely to try new products or change brands. 
 Toward that end, the new NBC fall lineup, to be announced a week from tomorrow, will replace mainstay series like "The Golden Girls," "Matlock" and "In the Heat of the Night," which appealed to older viewers, with shows more along the lines of newer comedies like "Seinfeld" and "Blossom," which draw high ratings among younger audiences.
Some advertising and media executives, tongues firmly in cheek, labeled NBC's efforts "granny dumping," after the practice by which people abandon older relatives requiring long-term care. Though not doubting the desirability of younger demographic groups, or NBC's pursuit of them, they wonder if NBC, as it plays catch-up with rival networks, is trying to do too much at once.
"You can't change that much of a schedule in one year and expect success," said Jon Mandel, the senior vice president and director of national broadcast at Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, referring to the dreadful mortality rate for new series.
Executives also took issue with the way NBC has handled the change. Even the syndicated columnist Erma Bombeck mocked the network for chasing after "high-spending consumers" like her thirtysomething children, members of a demographic group "whose first words were not 'Daddy,' but 'Do I have to use my own money?' "
Arnie Semsky, the executive vice president and director of media and programming services at BBDO Worldwide in New York, praised NBC's strategy, but added, "Maybe their positioning was incorrect," referring to the abrupt cancellations of the series not renewed.
"They are obviously not bad shows," he added, "or they wouldn't have been picked up by CBS and ABC." CBS said it would take "The Golden Girls," to be revamped into "Golden Palace" following the departure of one cast member, Bea Arthur, and "In the Heat of the Night." ABC said it would schedule "Matlock" as a midseason replacement during 1992-93.
NBC, of course, sees the path it has taken as the right one.
"We respond to what our advertisers are looking for," said Larry Hoffner, the executive vice president of sales in New York. "And we have found that some of these shows, as they get more mature, attract an older audience that is not as desirable to advertisers.
"It's like wearing an overcoat in July. It may be a nice overcoat, but it doesn't fit the season."
Preston Beckman, NBC's vice president of program planning and scheduling, said that while the network's goal remained "to appeal to the widest possible audience," the canceled series "were appealing, almost exclusively at this point, to adults 55 and older."
"The perception that we're not interested in anyone older than 55 is not true," he added. "The general pattern is, as we've seen with 'Seinfeld,' is that when ratings increase because of 18- to 49-year-olds, more 50-plus viewers join in, too."
Fueling NBC's intent is an economic issue apart from the network's advertising concerns. The canceled series not only appealed to older viewers, but were themselves older programs, meaning that the licensing fees NBC paid to their producers to run them exceeded fees for new series.
"Are we getting the right value for our programming dollar?" Mr. Hoffner asked. "And what goes into that is what we can sell it for."
In focusing on younger viewers, NBC has joined ABC, which has long aimed programming at them, and the fledgling Fox network, which has found success with shows aimed at viewers aged 12 to 24.
CBS, which supplanted NBC in first place during the 1991-92 season, has traditionally emphasized series appealing to older viewers, like "Murder, She Wrote," though it, too, has been seeking younger audiences with offerings like "Northern Exposure."
"Most of what's sold on TV are products and services used by younger families," said Alan Wurtzel, the senior vice president of marketing and research services at ABC in New York. "They consume a lot of packaged goods."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Busy Trading; Drop Against Yen Is Sharp

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined in hectic trading on world currency markets yesterday, registering its biggest losses against the Japanese yen.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $335.30 an ounce, off $1.40 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1.70 an ounce to a late bid price of $334.60. 
 Analysts said the dollar had initially been weakened by a Government report showing wholesale prices edged up a slight two-tenths of 1 percent in April. It was the third straight month that the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation before goods reach consumers, posted a modest gain.
The market interpreted the report as painting a favorable backdrop against which the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates to spur a sluggish economy.
The fresh data on wholesale prices "got the ball rolling on the downside for the dollar," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Comments by Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford accelerated the move. Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Mulford said the Group of Seven industrialized nations must cooperate closely in foreign exchange trading.
"It sounded like he was championing the G-7 to support the yen against the dollar," Mr. Donney said. A stronger yen would help correct Japan's growing trade surpluses, he said.
Traders interpreted Mr. Mulford's comments as a sign that the Fed would prefer a much lower yen, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
The dollar sold off sharply against the yen, tumbling more than 2 yen and through the important support level of 131.00 yen, which in turn spurred even more technical selling.
"It was a crazy day for the dollar and the yen," Mr. Flanagan said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 132.60 yen, down 0.57 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 130.45 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 130.55 yen, down from 133.00 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8135, from $1.7935 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.8135 to buy one pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.7945.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.6230 German marks, down from 1.6390; 1.5035 Swiss francs, down from 1.5255; 5.4460 French francs, down from 5.5095, and 1,222.00 Italian lire, down from 1,233.25.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Fixing Prices For Virtue's Sake?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
IS it O.K. to fix prices in pursuit of a good cause? If so, who gets to decide which causes are good enough?
These questions, rarely joined outside law school classrooms, are the nub of the Federal antitrust suit against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is set for trial in June. And many observers, it is safe to say, will be torn between gut admiration for one of America's great institutions of learning and a nagging sense that only governments should be allowed to fix prices. 
 Last year the Justice Department charged that the eight Ivy League universities and M.I.T. had fixed the "price" of scholarship benefits by using a common formula for calculating financial need and agreeing not to offer scholarships based on merit.
Without admitting guilt, the Ivies consented to abandoning the practice. But M.I.T., angered by the attack on the university's reputation and worried that a settlement would inspire private antitrust suits by aggrieved students, decided to go to court.
There is no real argument over the facts. M.I.T. was indeed one of 23 elite colleges that met each year to hammer out a common student-aid policy. Nor, apparently, is there much dispute over some of the consequences.
The need-based formula spread aid to a large number of students. In M.I.T.'s case, $20 million was budgeted to offset all or part of the tuition of some 60 percent of the undergraduates. The agreement also eliminated the temptation to bid for the most desirable candidates for admission -- namely, minority students with good prospects, and exceptionally gifted students.
But beyond this point, M.I.T. and the Justice Department sound as if they are talking about different cases. M.I.T. cannot imagine why the antitrust division cares how a nonprofit institution with a proud record of academic excellence and racial diversity chooses to distribute its charity. The Government, for its part, sees M.I.T. and the Ivies as businesses that have increased fees to customers almost twice as fast as consumer prices have risen over the last two decades.
When the suit was announced in May 1991, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asserted that students were entitled to the full benefits of price competition -- "just as they would in shopping for any other service." What other business, countered M.I.T., would not even try to recover its expenses from the customers? Full tuition, the university notes, is just half the $30,000 average cost of a year's education.
The one place where the argument is joined is over the impact of collusion on the cost of attending one of the schools involved. The Justice Department's economic consultant, Keith Leffler of the University of Washington, argues that some of the savings achieved in the absence of competitive bidding for students surely must have been diverted to other uses -- anything, say, from faculty salaries to carpeting for administrators' offices.
But M.I.T.'s consultant, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago, argues that the elite 23 never used their market power to such selfish ends. And he employs high-powered techniques to buttress his point. His statistical-regression analysis attempts to tease out the sources of variation in average net tuition -- posted fees, less financial aid -- among some 225 colleges during the late 1980's. Various measures of academic quality, exclusivity and regional income seemed to have a large influence on college charges. By contrast, membership in the group that colluded on scholarship aid mattered not at all.
It is not yet known whether this conclusion will withstand hostile scrutiny in the courtroom. In the view of Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, the statistical analysis is almost beside the point.
Suppose the Big Three auto makers colluded to raise prices on luxury cars, and pledged to plow the profits into something deemed socially valuable -- say a cheap, fuel-efficient Toyota-buster. Would we want the Justice Department to look the other way, Mr. White asks.
To Mr. White and Steven Salop, a Georgetown University economist, who was co-author of an analysis of the antitrust case in the Summer 1991 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, the real economic sin was procedural. If a ban on merit-based aid is good public policy, they argue, the policy should be made by the Government -- not by colluding universities.
Nonetheless, a loss in court could cost M.I.T. dearly if students followed with suits to recover part of their tuition. And if there is one thing almost everyone who has followed this case agrees on, it is that the universities should not be penalized for past aid policies that were never hidden from the Government. If collusion on scholarship aid was bad for society, Mr. Salop asked, "why did it take 15 years for the Justice Department to intervene -- years in which the colleges dug themselves into a treble-damages nightmare?"

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup: Secret C.I.A. File Shows Agents Followed Oswald Before 1963;
Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat sponsoring the budget-balancing amendment proposal with the widest support in Congress, told the House Budget Committee today that the amendment was needed to force the White House and Congress to get serious about eliminating the deficit.
In his first testimony on the amendment since he began a new push to get it passed, Mr. Simon said, "It forces us to make the painful choice that candidly neither political party is willing to make right now." 
 Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, repeatedly asked Mr. Simon how the amendment would suddenly make Republicans and Democrats agree on how to reduce the deficit, after they have been unable to agree for more than a decade.
He pressed the Senator on what specific measures he would take to balance the budget. Mr. Simon said that unspecified tax increases and spending cuts would be needed, and that cutting the $281 billion military budget could provide most of the savings.
He said he thought the amendment might come to a Senate vote in the next two weeks. "I think we have a good chance, but I'm not predicting it will pass," he said, although many other lawmakers say the amendment will probably pass this year.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, also criticized the amendment, saying it would restrict Washington's flexibility to use fiscal policy to counteract recessions.
He voiced fears that lawmakers would use their vote for the amendment as an excuse not to get serious about reducing the deficit until the states ratify it years from now.

DEAR DIARY:
The passing of Marlene Dietrich brings to mind a scene I witnessed about 25 years ago when, fresh from Oklahoma, I moved to New York. This particular afternoon I was outside Saks Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change, when -- gasp! -- I spotted the magnificent Marlene. Though glamorous as ever, she went virtually unrecognized, no doubt because of her get-up -- cowboy gear, from Stetson hat to Tony Lama boots. 
 One fellow did sidle up beside her, stared in awe for a second or two and said, "Pardon me, but aren't you Marlene Dietrich?" Dietrich eyed him coolly, smiled slightly, stuck her thumbs in her holster and spoke.
"Yup," she said. Then she crossed the street and headed west. ROBERT MITCHELL

 	 	 		. . .	 	The place: 51st Street between First and Second Avenues.
Time: Just the other day.
Action: Frances P. Glassner walks past a store with a large sign on the window. The sign reads:
ZELDA THE PSYCHIC. SEES ALL. KNOWS ALL.
PREDICTS THE FUTURE. COME IN FOR A READING.
Just then a woman -- quite possibly Zelda, herself -- dashes out of the store and confronts a male passer-by.
"Where have you been?" she asks. "And what have you been doing?"

 	 	 		. . .	 	Conversation, caught in midsentence, at the Rainbow Room. Elegantly outfitted woman to dinner companions: "So we thought we'd try someplace different this year. After all, how many times can you sail up the Amazon?"

 	 	 		. . .	 	ONION
 Coiled in circular perfection
 and giving off an aroma to
 send your taste buds into euphoria . . .
 I peel this onion.
 The colors, magenta and white,
 excite the gourmet in me.
 Were its color blue, I would
 slice it with indifference; drop it
 into soup, or just an ordinary stew.
 But magenta and white surely deserve
 a more delectable brew!
 Call Bon Appetit, ask their
 opinion:
 "What can I do
 with this wonderful onion?" DORIS KLEIN

 	 	 		. . .	 	The scene: Caldor's bookstore in Old Greenwich, Conn. Closeup of Audrey Orenbach, browsing, searching for Julia Phillips's book on Hollywood, "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again." It takes a while, but she finally finds it. It's displayed in the Diet and Health section.
And in Greenwich Village, Albert Sussman spots a hand-lettered sign attached to a bookshelf at Shakespeare & Company. It reads:
MARX (KARL) IS NOW IN ECONOMICS.

 	 	 		. . .	 	More signs, these spotted by Jim Story of Brooklyn, in the window of Amsterdam Accounting Service and Travel at 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue:
SANTO DOMINGO, $149. PUERTO RICO, $139. MIAMI, $149. DIVORCES, $150.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Among recent vistors to New York were Janos and Rebecca Wilder of Tucson, Ariz. Mr. Wilder, the owner and chef of the Tucson restaurant that bears his first name, had come to town to attend the James Beard Awards ceremony celebrating all aspects of cooking in America (he was a nominee in the Southwest division).
High on the Wilders' must-do list was dinner at Le Cirque. Mr. Wilder phoned the almost-always-packed restaurant, and reservations were made for 9:30, the earliest time available. When the day of the dinner arrived, the couple wondered if they might be able to switch to a more convenient hour. Mr. Wilder called again, this time explaining that he, too, was in the restaurant business and that perhaps Le Cirque could accommodate him and his wife with an earlier reservation.
The voice at Le Cirque said please hang on. A minute or so later, the voice was back on the line with the good news that, yes, an earlier dinner time was indeed available.
"Thank you," said Mr. Wilder. "What time?"
"9:15," the voice said.

HEADLINE: The War Democrats, 1992 Style

 BODY:
There's no blaming unreconstructed cold warriors in the Pentagon or the Administration now. It's Democrats in Congress who are throwing away the future to protect the past. By insisting on spending billions to build unneeded weapons, they are protecting a few defense jobs but retarding the healthy development of as many permanent, non-defense jobs.
By propping up outmoded producers, they are keeping resources from flowing to products the country needs and the world wants. By preserving pet programs in their districts, they reflect the worst in reckless parochialism instead of challenging President Bush for the lead in redefining national priorities. 
 So far this session, the Democratic Congress has illustrated precisely how not to cut defense spending.
It failed the first test -- re-allocating resources from defense spending to domestic needs. That requires removing the cap on domestic spending imposed by the 1990 bipartisan budget agreement. Otherwise Congress has little incentive to cut defense dollars, since any savings would go to deficit reduction, not to domestic needs. But threatened with a White House veto, Democrats knuckled under and left standing the wall between defense and domestic spending.
House Democrats may settle for a second-best solution: setting aside $1 billion for defense conversion. But they have yet to say how they would spend the money. If carefully targeted on investment in non-defense research and development, retraining and job placement, the result could be of some benefit for laid-off defense workers and the country. That makes more sense than wasting the money on unneeded weapons -- which is just what the Democrats are mostly doing.
They are providing the votes the Pentagon needs to protect weapons like the Stealth bomber; so what if the billion-dollar B-2 can't evade radars as well as advertised? The 15 planes already being built aren't enough for key Democrats; they tentatively approved a 16th last year, and now a House subcommittee wants to buy four more -- at over $1 billion each.
Even more shamefully, Democrats are trying to restore funds for weapons that even the Pentagon is prepared to cut, like the Seawolf submarine. The Senate voted to build two more of them, and the House one more.
Proponents contend that the difference between closing down the Seawolf assembly line and building two more subs amounts to "little or no money." Since when is $2 billion little or no money? And that does not include billions more to man, exercise and maintain the subs once they are built.
To pay for Seawolf, the Democratic majority in the Senate did cut funding for Star Wars defenses. But such savings would be better set aside for domestic needs. Otherwise, these latter-day War Democrats will sacrifice the peace dividend.

HEADLINE: Record School Construction

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
A record $10.7 billion was spent on public school construction and renovation last year in a building boom that reflects continued efforts by school districts in the United States to replace or restore aging school buildings.
The 1991 total, the seventh year in which school construction spending was higher than the year before, represented a 10.7 percent increase over the $9.7 billion spent in 1990, according to a soon-to-be released annual construction survey of the nation's school districts by American School and University magazine. 
 "The need is still there and the buildings are still falling apart," said Joe Agron, the editor of the magazine, in explaining the continuing spending increases on school buildings despite the nearly two-year-old recession.
The Midwest showed the largest increase in construction spending, with $1.5 billion last year as against $1.1 billion in 1990. The Northeast also showed an increase, to $607 million from $554 million in 1990. But the Southeast continued to have the largest slice of construction spending, $2.8 billion, off slightly from the $2.9 billion it reported in 1990.
The magazine attributed last year's increases partly to school districts' using bond money that was approved by voters in the 1980's, when the economy was stronger. Many school districts held that money in reserve but are now using it to repair deteriorating school buildings.
The magazine, which sent out surveys to all 15,600 school districts in the nation and received responses from 18 percent of them, said the construction growth also stemmed from continuing efforts by school systems to replace their aging buildings.
Half of the nation's 110,000 school buildings were erected 30 to 40 years ago and have seen little significant repairs since then, the American Association of School Administrators said last November.

THE DIFFICULTY OF REDISTRICTING
As the State Legislature has struggled in vain to negotiate a Congressional redistricting plan, the devil has been in the details -- the political details. Legislators have agreed in principle on which incumbents should be forced to run against each other as the state's Congressional delegation shrinks to 31 seats from 34. But their ability to strike a deal has been stymied by a series of thorny political decisions, ranging from exactly where district lines should be drawn to which incumbents should be given advantages in races against other incumbents.

HEADLINE: American Vehicle Sales Down 0.3% in Early May

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks fell three-tenths of 1 percent in early May. But the sluggish results included a hopeful sign for the Big Three, which grabbed a larger share from Japanese transplant producers.
The nine foreign and domestic auto makers operating North American assembly plants sold 130,408 cars from May 1-10, a 2.9 percent drop from a year earlier. Sales of light trucks assembled in North America rose 3.9 percent, to 87,497. from last year. Over all, vehicle sales reached 217,905, compared with last year's sales of 245,871. 
 Percentage changes were adjusted for the length of the period, which had eight selling days this year versus nine selling days last year.
 
No Recovery in Showrooms
 "Economic recovery has failed to make an appearance in dealer showrooms," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
The seasonally annual rate of car sales in early May was 5.7 million, down from 6.1 million in late April and slightly ahead of the 5.4 million rate a year earlier. The slow selling rate has been stalled at the current level since August, but auto makers have been building more cars because retail dealers were liquidating inventories last year and, therefore, were not ordering from auto makers.
"One silver lining is that domestic companies are getting a bigger share of the market," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "But if the rate doesn't pick up there may have to be a slowdown in production later in the year, mostly at plants assembling light-truck models."
The General Motors Corporation sold 62,882 cars in the period, a drop of 1.8 percent. G.M.'s Chevrolet division was the biggest loser, posting a 28.1 percent drop in car sales and an 11.9 percent drop in light-truck sales. Pontiac, with strong sales of the new Bonneville and Grand Am models, posted a 35.9 percent increase.
The Ford Motor Company sold 39,332 cars, an increase of 2.8 percent.
The Chrysler Corporation, which announces sales only once a month, sold an estimated 11,550 cars, down 5.5 percent, according to Ward's Automotive Reports.
 
Big Three's Share
 But the large Japanese auto makers were hit much harder. The Honda Motor Company's car sales of models produced in North America fell 15 percent, to 8,310; the Toyota Motor Corporation sales fell 8.3 percent, to 5,160, and the Nissan Motor Company's car sales fell 44 percent, to 1,099.
Consequently the Big Three's share of the market for domestically built cars rose to 87.2 percent from 85.3 percent, while the sales from Japanese transplants fell to 12.8 percent from 14.7 percent
Some retail dealers said the rising prices of imports compared with American brands and the perception that American brands had substantially improved quality had had an impact on consumer choice. "We used to sell 50 Saabs and Porsches a month, now we're selling 10," said Jim Henderson, general manager of Major Cadillac-Pontiac-Saab-Porsche in Kansas City, Mo.
G.M's sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, fell 10.4 percent, to 31,416. Ford light-truck sales rose 8.6 percent, to 31,380. Ward's estimated Chrysler's truck sales at 21,950.
Nissan, which makes more light trucks in the United States than other Japanese auto makers, posted a 36.7 percent decline in sales to 1,297.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Advance Only 0.2%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Inflation moderated in April as declining food and clothing costs and slower gains in housing and transportation held consumer price increases to a slim two-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said today.
The modest gain in the Consumer Price Index -- the most widely used measure of inflation -- should give the Federal Reserve room for another cut in interest rates, economists said. 
 The increase followed an unexpectedly sharp five-tenths of 1 percent rise in March, but economists view that as an aberration in an otherwise nonthreatening price front.
"It looks like we have developed a real stable inflation rate," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. "It's relatively moderate across the board."
So far this year, the index has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.3 percent, about the same pace as the modest 3.1 percent rise for all of last year.
 
Possibility of Fed Action
 Helped by the moderate inflation level, the Fed has been pushing interest rates lower for the last year and a half. But with the recovery looking like one of the weakest in 50 years, many economists think it is only a matter of time before the central bank acts again.
"I should think that the Fed could ease," Mr. Ratajczak said.
Such a move by the Fed could induce banks to cut the prime lending rates they charge their best customers by a half-point from the 6 1/2 percent level most now have.
The department's report supports other evidence of a benign inflation rate that economists say reflects the country's sluggish, uneven effort to recover from recession.
The biggest restraint on price rises has been the minimal wage gains workers have eked out in today's tight job market, which has limited their purchasing power, economists said.
"The reasons for the low inflation rate are readily apparent -- slack in labor markets and diminished inflationary expectations in the wake of three years of slow growth," said Gordon Richards, an economist with the Washington-based National Association of Manufacturers.
In a separate report, the department said the average weekly earnings of United States workers, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors, fell six-tenths of 1 percent in April, their third monthly decline this year. Over the last 12 months, real earnings have risen only at an average of 3.1 percent.
Excluding food and energy costs, which can vary widely from month to month, prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April after a five-tenths of 1 percent gain in March, the department said. In the last 12 months, this so-called core inflation has risen 3.9 percent.
Today's report showed food prices falling one-tenth of 1 percent last month, reflecting sharp declines in fresh fruit and vegetable costs, which were down 1.1 percent. In March, total food prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent.
Clothing and cleaning prices fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, reflecting earlier-than-usual store markdowns. In March, prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Housing Costs Slowing
 Increases in overall housing costs slowed to one-tenth of 1 percent last month from four-tenths of 1 percent in March, while transportation price increases slowed to five-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Energy prices rose a modest four-tenths of 1 percent last month after climbing six-tenths of 1 percent in March.
New-car prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent following a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in March, leaving them 2.3 percent above their level a year earlier.
Medical care cost increases, which nearly always exceed gains in other areas, moderated slightly, rising five-tenths of 1 percent in April and in March after heftier gains earlier this year. Since April 1991, medical care costs have soared 7.9 percent.
The over all index stood at 139.5 over its 1982-84 base, meaning a basket of consumer goods that on average cost $100 between 1982 and 1984 cost $139.50 last month.

Reichmann Troubles Roil Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 13

 BODY:
Canadians used to break down the wealthy into three categories: the rich, the superrich and the Reichmanns.
The Reichmann family business, Olympia & York Developments, is the world's largest real estate developer, having altered skylines throughout Canada as well as in New York and London. But in March it ran out of cash, and fear is rippling through many corners of the Canadian economy. 
 The commercial real estate market is paralyzed, the stock market has fallen and many companies are finding it hard to borrow cash. Some hospitals, schools and cultural institutions that the Reichmanns have showered with millions are wondering whether the largesse is now at an end.
The situation has looked so grave that the Bank of Canada, the nation's central bank, has been maneuvering behind the scenes to insure that Canada's banks, which have extended an estimated $3 billion (Canadian) to Olympia & York, can weather the crisis.
While Canadian bank regulators say that the banks could withstand an Olympia bankruptcy, the Bank of Canada has been pursuing an aggressive easing of short-term interest rates, even at the risk of igniting inflation, with the nation's benchmark Bank Rate now down to 6.78 percent.
The uncertainty over Olympia's fate "adds to the economic malaise and sense of gloom," said Tom Hutchinson, chief Canadian economist for MMS International, a financial information service in Toronto, adding, "It's one of the negative influences out there that are making consumers keep their wallets zipped and could delay the recovery substantially."
 
Destroying an Image
 Yet some analysts believe much of the potential impact may have already been discounted. "The Reichmanns might lose control of their company, but this need not necessarily have grave implications for the economy," said David J. Marshall, president of the North American Economist of Toronto, a financial information service. "What it could mean is that the positive image of Canada as the home of aggressive, well-managed family firms with good, solid financial structures -- this image is blown out of the water."
For its part, Olympia has been negotiating for the last few weeks with dozens of creditor banks, seeking more favorable terms, moratoriums on payments due and fresh money for completion of several projects. The banks have provided some short-term loans -- far less than the Reichmanns sought -- and have been cool thus far to the brothers' ideas, including an offer of a 20 percent stake in the family business in return for concessions. Some bankers wryly questioned what the attraction was of owning a fifth of a company whose debts exceeded, by some counts, its assets.
On Thursday, the Reichmanns face a deadline on First Canadian Place, their 72-story white marble skyscraper in the heart of Toronto's financial district. Olympia & York owes $17 million in interest, and was granted a grace period by its bondholders, who warned that if payment were not made this week, they might foreclose.
John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc., a local investment house, warns of "ripple effects" if Olympia's buildings, some of the most expensive real estate in North America, are seized by banks and bondholders and then sold into an already depressed market.
At the Toronto Stock Exchange, the "Reichmann factor" is also blamed for the depressed state of prices, which are nearly 20 percent below the record highs of August 1987, even as the New York Stock Exchange has been reaching highs.
 
Rattled Confidence
 Banks have been particularly hard hit, with investors in bank stocks worried about loans to Olympia. Indeed, before the markets recovered Monday, fears of bank losses had wiped $7 billion from the value of the banks' stocks. That is more than twice the generally accepted estimate of their total loans to Olympia and provides evidence, analysts said, of the extent of rattled confidence.
Over the last two months, the market has clipped nearly $800 million from the common stock value of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country's second-largest bank. The bank is believed to have Olympia loans with a value of $700 million to $1 billion.
The National Bank of Canada, the smallest of Canada's Big Six banks, with some $300 million to $500 million of Olympia loans, has seen its common stock value drop by more than $300 million.
Fears of how many dominoes will fall have increased difficulties for companies trying to raise money, especially in the market for commercial paper, where large companies trade i.o.u.'s for short-term cash.
"Commercial-paper investors are especially sensitive to credit quality these days," said Ihor Kots, managing director of the Canadian Bond Rating Service of Montreal. "The tone of the market is impacting those companies tending to see weakening profitability."
 
Some With Problems
 Among companies that have had trouble in the market or reduced their commercial-paper programs are the Trizec Corporation Ltd., a real estate company partly owned by the Reichmanns, with $11.9 billion of property in Canada and the United States, including the Hahn Company of San Diego, a builder of shopping malls. Besides the Reichmanns, the brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman own a controlling 40 percent block of Trizec.
Other companies that have had problems in the commercial-paper market include: Bramalea Ltd., a Toronto-based property company controlled by Trizec; Gulf Canada Resources of Calgary, Alberta, a leading oil company controlled by the Reichmanns, and Markborough Properties Inc., a Toronto-based property company unrelated to the Reichmanns.
Smaller businesses are complaining that the commercial banks, to offset possible losses on their loans to Olympia, are raising fees, tightening credit availability and making life harder for the little guy.
Catherine Swift, vice president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said, "I've got calls from members who said, 'This banker squeezed me for a thousand,' and yet, we hear about billions and tens of billions being loaned to O.&Y. without them even looking at their financial statements."
The Ontario provincial government and the federal Government in Ottawa seriously weighed stepping in with guarantees for Olympia but feared a political backlash. Neither could reconcile a special bailout of the wealthy family with recent budget calls for generalized belt-tightening.
Their decision against intervention was made somewhat easier by Michael Mackenzie, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, who said that Canadian banks could survive a "meltdown" of Olympia. He defined meltdown as entering into the Canadian equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.
While the situation is serious, Mr. Mackenzie said, it "would not inflict a mortal wound on any of the banks or institutions in our system."
A collapse of Olympia would probably shave a few more cents from the Canadian dollar, which is now trading around 83 cents (United States), down from near 90 cents late last year.
The Reichmanns have always been a close-knit family. Samuel, the patriarch, had a thriving poultry business in Hungary before World War II, and his three sons were born in Vienna. The brothers -- Albert, 62 years old; Paul, 60, and Ralph, 57 -- grew up speaking German, Hebrew and Hungarian. Their father chose the Austrian capital as a better point for central European distribution.
The family fled to Paris after the 1938 Anschluss and after time in Madrid and Tangier arrived in Toronto in the 1950's. Samuel died in 1975; his wife, Renee, died two years ago.
Under the sons' leadership, with Paul as the chief strategist, the family turned a Toronto tile-importing company into the vast Olympia & York empire with interests in real estate, oil, financial services and timber.
 
In Modest Circumstances
 Despite their great wealth -- it remains unclear how the family's personal fortune has been affected by Olympia's difficulties -- the brothers live in relatively modest circumstances in north central Toronto. It is a district of leafy, tranquil streets and comfortable homes and gardens, but is not one of Toronto's most exclusive or fashionable places to live.
The brothers, who are Orthodox Jews, picked the area because several synagogues are within walking distance.
The family generally keeps a low profile and has not been active in politics. But in philanthropy, it cuts a huge swath.
"The Reichmanns are not the sort of people who boast about their charitable works," said Michael de Pencier, president of the Key Publishers Company, which publishes Toronto Life magazine. "But they have quietly contributed enormous amounts of money to our society -- many, many millions in recent years."
Among them, he said, were $3 million to Sunnybrook Hospital, $2 million to the University of Toronto and more than $1 million to the Sick Children's Hospital.
 
End of Charity?
 But contributions may be drying up. The Toronto Jewish News reported last week, for example, that Kolel Avreichim, or the Institute for Talmudic Study, is no longer receiving Reichmann donations. The newspaper said a charitable trust of Olympia had provided most of the school's $1.1 million annual operating budget.
The brothers, their wives and other family members sit on the boards of the Reichmann enterprises, which currently have no outside directors and no requirement to open their books -- except to negotiate with their creditors.
A younger generation of Reichmanns is being groomed. The heir apparent is Philip Reichmann, eldest of the brothers' 14 children and the son of Albert. Philip is senior vice president and is in charge of retail leasing at First Canadian Place. He has also worked on the retail operation of the Reichmanns' World Financial Center in Manhattan.
Among those expected to share responsibilities with him are Frank Hauer, who is married to Paul Reichmann's daughter, Rachel. He is senior vice president, property administration, at Olympia and has been working on the company's huge office project in the London docklands, Canary Wharf. Philip Reichmann and Mr. Hauer are in their early 30's.

HEADLINE: With Eye on Riots, Dinkins Announces Loan Plan for Poor Areas

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Spurred by the upheaval in Los Angeles, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced a new program yesterday to provide loans and subsidies for the creation of businesses in poor sections of the city.
Although the Neighborhood Retail Development Program was planned well before the outburst of fury after the Rodney G. King verdict, Mr. Dinkins said in a written statement yesterday that "In the wake of the tragedies in Los Angeles, we realize more than ever how acute the need is for the city not only to build housing and not only to build retail strips, but to help build neighborhoods." 
 The program will be tested in three Brooklyn communities -- along Broadway in Bushwick, Rockaway Avenue in Brownsville and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island.
The program was designed by the city's Economic Development Corporation. The corporation's president, Carl Weisbrod, said that from Monday the city would begin seeking proposals from developers who want to create commercial strips on city-owned property in the target areas.
At the same time, the city is setting aside $7.5 million in construction subsidies and Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banks are making construction loans available at the usual commercial rates.
Permanent financing for the construction loans will be provided by the Community Preservation Corporation, a private consortium of banks. The permanent loans will be guaranteed by the State of New York Mortgage Agency. Because the loans will be guaranteed by the state, they will be bought by the city employees pension funds.
Herbert Eisenberg, the district manager of Community Planning Board 13 in Coney Island, welcomed the program. "We have been trying for many years to get commercial development," he said. "The dollars are here. The spenders are here, and they have to go outside the community to go shopping."
In Brownsville, Jeannette Gadson, district manager for Community Board 16, said: "I am just ecstatic about this, because families need shopping and they need recreation and infrastructure. This new program at least addresses part of that in terms of retail stores."

HEADLINE: Mandela Presses Dinkins Not to Lift City Sanctions

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A mayoral delegation returned from South Africa yesterday with a letter from Nelson Mandela urging Mayor David N. Dinkins not to lift New York's City's economic sanctions until an interim government is established in South Africa, associates of Mr. Mandela and city officials said yesterday.
The letter is critically important to Mr. Dinkins's decision because the Mayor, who has been under increasing pressure from big business and banks in New York to move quickly on the sanctions, has steadfastly maintained he would take his cue from Mr. Mandela, the African National Congress president. Mr. Dinkins was to meet with the delegation last night and will make an announcement this afternoon about the city's policy, aides said. 
 City officials said Mr. Dinkins was expected to map out what sanctions the city would lift in response to specific reforms in South Africa if an interim government that includes blacks and other minorities is established there. The Mayor, who has been reviewing the city's sanctions against companies doing business in South Africa, has said he favors keeping some sanctions that affect the South African military. His aides would not discuss details yesterday.
City officials said the Mayor's announcement was timed for the day before the opening of the second round of talks today among South Africa's 19 political parties -- the Convention on a Democratic South Africa -- that many United States and South African officials believe will produce an agreement on a government. Mr. Mandela and other A.N.C. officials want the Mayor's promise to lift sanctions to use as a bargaining chip in the talks.
 
New York 'Is Crucial'
 "I think Mr. Mandela knows New York City is crucial in this," said a high-ranking mayoral aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
New York has the toughest anti-apartheid sanctions in the country; its decision to lift sanctions would send a strong message to other municipalities with similar laws, especially because it would carry the imprimatur of Mr. Mandela, according to State Department officials and anti-apartheid advocates.
"New York City's sanctions are meaningful because there are major corporations that find them inconvenient," a State Department official said. "The A.N.C. would be giving a signal" to the entire United States.
Though the city can bring to bear direct pressure on companies with contracts, it has greater influence with other states and municipalities, said William Moses, an analyst with the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. Other large cities like Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago, as well as states like Massachussets and California, will watch New York carefully, he said.
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who led the delegation, refused to speak to reporters about the trip last night. Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's chief spokesman, also declined to comment on what steps the Mayor would outline today. "Nothing has been decided as of yet," he insisted.
 
Mandela Will Send Signal
 In talks with Mr. Mandela, the city delegation sought to find out whether New York should lift sanctions when an agreement on an interim government is announced, which could happen this weekend, or whether it should hold off until the government is established, which could happen this summer, city officials and associates of Mr. Mandela said.
Mr. Mandela responded that Mr. Dinkins should wait for his signal, the officials said.
On Sunday night Mr. Lynch and three other mayoral aides quietly left New York and flew to Johannesburg to discuss with A.N.C. officials the best time to lift the sanctions. The trip was not announced and no reporters were invited, partly because it involved negotiations that could affect the city's investments. Besides Mr. Lynch, the delegation included Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain, Corporation Counsel O. Peter Sherwood, and David Scott, a Board of Education staff member.
The group met with Mr. Mandela and Walter Sisulu, the A.N.C. deputy president, at the Congress's headquarters in Johannesburg on Monday and Tuesday.
Under a 1990 local law, the city is prohibited from contracting with companies or banks with business ties to South Africa. The city also ranks banks according to how much they have done to encourage the end of the apartheid system of racial segregation and gives its business to those with the highest ranking. In addition, the city has avoided investing the $43.1 billion in pension funds that it controls in companies that do business in South Africa.
Combined, the city's sanctions have considerable influence, especially with large banks seeking city business or companies like International Business Machines Corporation and 3-M Corporation that would like to bid on lucrative city contracts.
"The city's sanctions have had real bite," said Jennifer Davis, executive director of the Africa Fund, an anti-apartheid monitoring group. "The city's sanctions have been the most effective in the country, especially controls on banks."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev, in New York, Warns Yeltsin on Social Instability

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
The former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, broke his silence about his Kremlin successors yesterday, saying the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin had "carried its reforms to the edge" and needed corrective steps to avoid a social "explosion."
Without mentioning Mr. Yeltsin by name, Mr. Gorbachev warned that greater social safeguards were needed at home to fight inflation and the plummeting standard of living if political instability is to be contained. 
 The former Soviet leader stressed that while he endorsed the "thrust" of the Yeltsin reforms, he felt obliged to criticize their "tactics" since the same reactionary forces that went after him in last August's coup were waiting once more in Moscow for social pressures to reach the breaking point.
"We have to make sure they do not raise their heads again," Mr. Gorbachev declared in an address to the Economic Club of New York.
"The government of Russia has carried its reforms to the edge," he said. "If it goes over the edge, there can be a certain explosion."
 
'Corrections' Needed
 He stressed that while he was rooting and working for the cause of Russia's success in reaching democracy and the free market, "I believe it is necessary to make corrections in order to support reform."
His words were the first in his showcase American fund-raising tour to reflect on the stewardship of President Yeltsin, his onetime political rival and critic. Mr. Yeltsin delivered Mr. Gorbachev from the hands of the coup plotters, then pressed him to resign last December as the Soviet Union collapsed into a loose commonwealth of gravely troubled independent republics.
Until this speech, Mr. Gorbachev had not talked of events in post-Communist Moscow as he made daily speeches and appearances across the United States in his campaign to raise funds for his new private Gorbachev Foundation based in Moscow and San Francisco.
In response to a question of whether he harbored ambitions to resume Kremlin power, Mr. Gorbachev told the club's luncheon gathering at the New York Hilton that he had no plans "to seek any kind of public or state office," but that he would remain in public life in his new role as head of a foundation devoted to political and economic progress in Russia and the world at large.
 
Lack of Detail
 The Gorbachev Foundation already is monitoring the affairs of the new Commonwealth of Independent States as part of its research interests, but there has been little serious speculation in Moscow about Mr. Gorbachev's ever returning to real power.
In some ways, his criticism and advice to the reform-minded Yeltsin Government echoed Mr. Gorbachev's incumbency. Then, his own numerous economic reform plans came to naught as he hesitated and retreated in the face of dire warnings of social upheaval from colleagues in the Communist establishment. The last two years of his power were marked by elaborate announcements promising free-market innovations, but then costly compromise in the final power struggle in the Kremlin between party reactionaries and reformers.
His luncheon criticism also was notable for the lack of detail in his prescriptions, beyond urging that salaries be increased to deal with Russian inflation and that social-welfare protections also be bolstered. The Yeltsin Government has pursued both causes to a degree, within an overall plan to contain government spending and prevent fresh inflationary spirals.
Mr. Gorbachev, who hired and dismissed a platoon of free-market Cabinet strategists in his final two years, offered a warning in his speech about allowing academic theoreticians the final say in Russia's journey toward the free market. This seemed a pointed criticism of the cadre of young free-market planners hired by Mr. Yeltsin.
 
Condemns Anti-Semitism
 "Let us see life as it is," Mr. Gorbachev said, calling for a willingness to readjust away from theory. "I think you know that better than I do," he declared, and the club's crowded luncheon of more than 3,000 corporate executives applauded loudly.
Last night, Mr. Gorbachev repeated his previous condemnation of anti-Semitism, in receiving the Benjamin Cardozo Democracy Award from Yeshiva University's School of Law. Mr. Gorbachev, whose foundation received an honorarium of $100,000 from university trustees for the brief address at the Pierre Hotel, said, "Anti-Semitism is one of the worst manifestations of national chauvinism."
He welcomed improving relations between Russia and Israel as a result of Moscow's liberalized emigration policy and he appealed to the American Jewish community for support for Russia.
Mr. Gorbachev spent much of his day on economic affairs, drawing rousing Wall Street cheers in the morning as he appeared on the rostrum at the New York Stock Exchange and surveyed the normal trading havoc below. In remarks to exchange members, Mr. Gorbachev pitched for fresh investment in Russia, particularly in the form of factories with new products for restless consumers.
In response to a question, Mr. Gorbachev said there was little grounds for fearing that China might become a new threat for Russia or other nations. "Hegel said, 'When someone is asleep, you shouldn't wake him up,' " he declared lightly. But then, after the audience's laughter died, he said the Chinese Government actually seemed to be moving toward responsible reforms and presented no cause for worry.

HEADLINE: Seeking Limits to a Drug Monopoly

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Congress is trying -- once again -- to rein in the profits that some companies are making on "orphan drugs," pharmaceutical products aimed at diseases affecting relatively few patients.
Backers of an amendment to the Orphan Drug Law have proposed that once an orphan drug reaches $200 million in revenues, it would lose the special tax breaks and seven-year monopoly protection that the Government grants companies to produce specialized drugs presumed to have only a limited market. 
 The proposal for a $200 million revenue limit has focused the debate over how much of a head start on profits is necessary to induce a company to make an orphan drug. Biotechnology and other pharmaceutical companies are split over the amendment, which will come before the antitrust and monopolies subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee early next month.
Some companies, like Novo-Nordisk, a $1.6 billion international pharmaceuticals concern based in Denmark, want to compete with companies that have monopolies. They say that $200 million is more than a sufficient inducement.
Others, however, like Genentech, a California biotechnology company that is one of the leading makers of drugs classed as orphans, are fiercely defending the act as it stands, even though they once opposed it. Genentech has spent millions of dollars in lobbying and has warned that suffering patients will be prevented from getting certain drugs if the act is amended.
The White House, which pocket-vetoed a somewhat different effort in 1990 to open the orphan market to limited competition, is threatening to veto this amendment, too. The White House Council on Competitiveness says that this amendment, like the 1990 one, will not provide enough incentive for manufacturers, which will make the United States less competitive in world markets.
 
Charges of Abuse
 There is widespread agreement that the tax breaks and monopoly status that Congress granted to orphan drugs in 1983 have worked: about 60 orphan drugs have been developed for 74 illnesses.
Before the law was passed, few drugs had been available to treat the approximately 20 million people in the United States who suffer from some 5,000 rare diseases. "If it were not for the act," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who is one of the authors of the amendment, "many of these drugs would never have been manufactured."
But he, along with Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, one of the sponsors of a version of the amendment now before a House committee, have complained that some drug companies are abusing the protections. Various patient groups have raised similar complaints.
These critics contend that the companies are making inordinate profits by charging very high prices. And they say the companies are using the law to protect rare-disease drugs that also have large markets as treatments for other, more common illnesses. The original law placed no limits on the profits a company could make or on the price it could charge.
 
Support for the Amendment
 Some industry executives say the proposed limit is reasonable, even generous.
A $200 million limit would allow a drug to bring in about $25 million to $30 million in sales annually for seven years and rank among the world's 100 biggest sellers -- and still be entitled to the protections for orphan drugs, said Henry Penner, president of Novo-Nordisk of North America. The limit simply means that after a period of profitable monopoly, the normal rules of free competition would apply, he said.
His company is eager to enter the market for human growth hormone, a treatment for dwarfism that is currently has orphan-drug protection. Two companies, Eli Lilly and Genentech, now make the product by different methods. And it has brought in more than $580 million in sales, at a cost to patients of between $10,000 and $30,000 a year.
"Human growth hormone is not an orphan," Mr. Penner said. "There were five or six companies that wanted to develop this drug. You have to begin to question what kind of products really need the incentive under the act."
In fact, figures supplied to Congress by pharmaceutical companies show that $200 million in revenues more than cover all research costs for the top-selling orphan drugs. And Congressional committees have concluded that the same holds true for all of the orphan drugs now on the books.
 
'Like Wildcatting in Texas'
 Few, if any, companies are disputing those findings. But some are arguing that $200 million would not necessarily cover costs beyond research and development, and allow for a substantial profit as well.
And a profitable return on their total investments is what the companies are asking for, said Henri Termeer, the chief executive of Genzyme, the Massachusetts company that makes an orphan drug known as Ceredase.
"It's like wildcatting in Texas," he said. "If there was a cap on how much you could make, you wouldn't get people to drill all the dry holes they need to drill in order to come up with the few winners that carry the company."
If orphan-drug privileges expired at $200 million in revenues, Mr. Termeer said, his company would not have developed Ceredase to treat a metabolic disorder known as Gaucher's disease.
If a disease is costing society hundreds of millions of dollars, he argues, and a company creates a drug to solve the problem, why should the company's return be limited?
 
A Defense of Profits
 Some orphan drugs will still be developed if the amendment is passed, Mr. Termeer added, but others may not be. He said that the profits were not outrageous, because the costs of researching, developing and making the drugs are often so high.
Genentech's general counsel, John P. McLaughlin, offers another argument against the revenue cap. The industry needs the hope of potential blockbuster sales to cover costs and get investors interested in financing the drugs, he contends.
Both Genzyme and Genentech are fighting the amendment in Congress.
Representative Waxman said the rewards should not be so lavish: "The Orphan Drug Act was designed to provide modest incentives for research on drugs, with little or no prospect of profit, because the diseases they are designed to treat are so rare. Where there is a prospect of striking it rich, that alone ought to be an adequate incentive to do the research, and the Orphan Drug Act just isn't necessary."
 
Limits to Patents
 Traditional drugs that win patents are entitled to 17 years of patent protection, during which a company is not required to license a drug to anyone else. Since many years are typically eaten up by the patent process and regulatory approval, however, the typical time left for selling the drug without competition is about 10 years.
Some orphan drugs are patentable, but many others are not, if they are natural substances or chemicals already in existence.
Architects of the original law say that when they wrote it they realized that it was theoretically possible that companies would try "salami slicing" tactics -- using the orphan-drug protection while selling the same product for much broader uses. But since lawmakers were unprepared for the scale of abuses, they say, no protection was written into the legislation. In fact, only about a dozen companies are usually cited as serious abusers of the law.
Senator Metzenbaum and his allies offer evidence that the law has backfired. They say that 3 of the 100 top-selling drugs in America, and 2 of the 5 top-selling drugs made by biotechnology companies (the chief category of companies getting into the orphan drug business), are now classed as "orphans" -- getting special monopoly status at the same time they are earning big revenues.
But the economics are somewhat murky. While it is clear that research and development of drugs is costly, the actual amount of these costs is less certain. Senator Metzenbaum charges that some drug companies have given Congress misleading and highly inflated estimates of their research and development costs.
Genentech, for example, told Congress at a recent hearing that its research and development costs for human growth hormone were $320 million. But company executives testified in court several years ago that the actual research and development cost was only about $45 million.
Even if the cost of using venture capital was added to the earlier figure, it would not approach the amount now claimed by the company, say Congressional critics like Mr. Waxman.
Genzyme, maker of Ceredase, has told Congress that its research and development costs were about $50 million to $70 million. But the amount it reported in Securities and Exchange Commission filings is closer to $30 million.
 
Companies Cite Other Costs
 The companies do not deny the gaps. They say, however, that the larger figures include not only direct research costs but also the costs of buying out their business partners, as well as outlays for advertising and marketing.
The buyouts may legitimately be considered part of the cost of research, they say, because the investors -- which in many cases are shell corporations run by the same executives and use the same researchers -- supplied them money used partly for research, along with marketing and other expenses.
But Daniel G. Bergstein, a venture capital lawyer at Paul Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in New York, said such financing approaches went beyond normal accounting practices. "If you say it fast, it might play," he said. "But it really is disingenuous. They are actually counting both their R. & D. costs and other costs such as buying out their partners."
The Senate subcommittee is expected to adopt the amendment in early June. But the opponents are likely to bring their arguments to the floor in the House and Senate -- and then to rely on the White House, once again, to stand up for their cause.


GRAPHIC: Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, pharmaceutical companies received tax breaks and seven-year monopolies as incentives to make drugs for rare diseases with potential markets of up to 200,000 people. Congressional leaders hope to amend the law, taking away a drug's orphan status when it generates $200 million in sales.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose 0.9% In April

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Retail sales climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent in April, essentially offsetting a March decline that was bigger than first thought, Commerce Department figures showed today.
The report unsettled some economists who saw it as a sign that the budding recovery might have begun to wilt, but it reassured others that sales climbed, albeit from a lower starting point. 
 Two other reports today had a similar split effect on analysts. The Labor Department report on the Consumer Price Index proved more reassuring than not, as it showed that prices rose just two-tenths of 1 percent last month, confirming the belief that inflation remains subdued. But auto makers said sales in the first 10 days of May were down three-tenths of 1 percent, a performance seen as disappointing. [Page D2.]
Taken together, the reports seemed to various analysts to be likely to nudge the Federal Reserve closer to another cut in interest rates.
 
Fed to Meet Next Week
 The Fed on Friday is to issue its monthly report on industrial production and rate of operation, followed on Tuesday by a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, its main policy-making body. Some analysts believe the Fed will wait until its meeting to act.
Since consumer prices are a lagging indicator -- one that generally moves after the economy at large -- much of the attention today went to retail sales, a current gauge that accounts for one-third of the nation's economic activity.
Although the nine-tenths of 1 percent April rise was more than expected, this was only because of a sizable downward revision for March that turned what had been a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent to a decline of a full 1 percent.
Among those disappointed by the sales numbers was Campbell Harvey, an associate professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. "We're not seeing the strength in the consumer sector that we saw at the beginning of the year," Professor Harvey said.
 
Expected Easter Effect
 With the benefit of favorable timing for Easter, sales should have been significantly better even allowing for the negative effects on shopping of the Chicago floods, he asserted.
At least a modest further easing by the Fed is imminent, he predicted.
The Commerce Department makes allowances, not always accurately, for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences in retail sales but does not do so for price changes.
Alan C. Lerner, a top economist at the Bankers Trust Company, took a more optimistic view of the sales figures. "They show the consumer is still moving along in a positive way," he said, adding that he believed the Fed would probably back away from further easing until the employment report due in early June.
To Norman Robertson of Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank, the sales results were so-so, reflecting a consumer sector still burdened by debt and concerned about jobs. "It's just about holding its own," Mr. Robertson said, citing a group of retail categories in which spending is mostly discretionary and that shows declines for both March and April following strong gains for the first two months of the year.
He said today's reports did little to change the odds of Fed action, which he said remained 50-50 for a cut during the next month.
Sales grew last month to $158 billion, with durable goods advancing 1.9 percent and nondurables three-tenths of 1 percent.
Automotive dealers enjoyed a 2.6 percent gain and merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes did even better, posting a 2.8 percent gain. But the other major durables category -- furniture, home furnishings and equipment -- suffered a 1.5 percent decline, roughly wiping out their March increase and a possible first sign of weakness in housing-related goods.
Without the automotive group, total retail sales rose just four-tenths of 1 percent. Auto sales themselves, analysts at C. J. Lawrence noted, have been much weaker in number of units than in dollar terms. The report from auto makers today on their early May sales showed a generally sluggish industry, but one automotive analyst did see a bright spot in the fact that American car companies were getting a bigger market share.
The automotive sector also accounted for most of the downward revision for retail sales in March.
Among nondurables, four of the main categories posted increases, while two fell. Sales rose 1.6 percent at apparel and accessory stores; eight-tenths of 1 percent at gasoline service stations, mainly because of higher prices; seven-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores, and five-tenths of 1 percent at food stores.
Restaurants and bars saw business fall off another 1 percent while stores selling general merchandise had a four-tenths of a percent sales decline.
Over all, said Kathleen Stephansen and Jade Kim of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, retail sales last month were only eight-tenths of 1 percent higher than than the first-quarter average. They saw this as "a somewhat disappointing performance," especially when adjusted for inflation.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks With Chile Are Planned

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it would seek to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Chile after a free trade pact with Mexico and Canada is completed.
American officials say that establishing a bilateral free-trade pact with Chile could be the first step toward setting up a free-trade bloc with all of South America. 
 Administration officials hope the agreements with Mexico and Canada will be ratified by Congress and signed by the three nations sometime this year.
Chilean officials said they were hoping that Washington would agree to begin negotiating such a pact immediately, but American officials said they were worried that beginning negotiations with Chile could complicate the efforts to establish the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
 
Less Likely to Worry Congress
 Congressional staff members said they doubted, however, that a free-trade pact with Chile would worry Congress the way talks with Mexico have. They said that because Chile is so much further away than Mexico, it does not raise the same intense fears that companies will close American factories and transfer those operations to Mexico.
After President Bush met today with Chile's President, Patricio Aylwin, Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson said, "Both governments want to pursue free-trade negotiations as quickly as that is feasible."
 
Protecting Foreign Investments
 American officials say Chile has been singled out for a free-trade deal because it has already lowered tariffs and enacted laws protecting foreign investments, making it easier to negotiate a trade pact with it than with almost all other Latin American nations.
One Administration official said, "The question is when, not whether, an agreement will be negotiated with Chile."
At a ceremony on the White House South Lawn, President Bush said, "Today Chile gives hope to an entire hemisphere. With market-oriented reforms, you've led by example."
Mr. Aronson praised Chile, noting that since 1985 it had averaged growth of 6 percent a year and that its jobless rate has fallen to 4.8 percent, its lowest level in 17 years.
"We are engaged in consolidating our reborn democracy," President Aylwin said. "We are not asking for help but for understanding and cooperation."
Last year the United States raised its exports to Chile to $1.58 billion, which included such products as computers, mining machinery and telecommunications equipment. Chile's exports to the United States, principally fruit, copper and fish, came to $1.3 billion last year.
The White House said it would seek to negotiate the free-trade agreement with Chile on a fast-track basis.
The Administration has to notify Congress officially before starting such negotiations, and Congress has 60 days to veto it before talks begin.

HEADLINE: Republicans Pressed on Plans for Cuts

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 13

 BODY:
With only five days left for Gov. Jim Florio to sign or veto a sales-tax rollback, the Republicans had promised to explain today their goals for the next fiscal year and how they would deal with a growing state budget gap.
Instead, after using two meetings to blast away at Mr. Florio, calling him the "Harry Houdini of state government," Republican leaders found themselves jousting with reporters about when they would offer specific fiscal plans. 
 "Not every New Jerseyan woke up today wondering if this would be the day for Republican cuts," the party's state committee chairman, Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, said at a news conference rife with testy exchanges. "You have to be patient. You are going to hear the other shoe, and it will be loud and resounding."
Mr. Franks said the Republicans would unveil their budget plan within a couple of weeks, though Mr. Florio has said he will not sign the rollback bill, which would lower the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent, unless the Republicans first specify what cuts they intend to make to compensate for the $610 million in revenue it would cost.
 
Haunted by Promises
 The unusually harsh exchanges at the news conference point to the many pressures the Republicans are facing as they try to make good on campaign promises to roll back taxes, cut spending and reduce the size of government.
With Mr. Florio facing a Monday deadline for action on the rollback bill -- he is expected to veto it -- and with Republicans facing possible defections that would make an override impossible, the party's leaders tried to badger the Democratic Governor into siding with them.
"As a candidate for governor in 1989, Jim Florio said that our state did not have a revenue problem, it had a spending problem," Mr. Franks said. "Today, we ask the Governor to remember those words and join with us in supporting the Republican plan to address the spending problem, which, if left unresolved, will permanently disable our state. Sign the sales-tax cut today and work with us to bring spending under control now."
Campaigning on a promise to reduce taxes if they were elected, Republicans crushed Democratic candidates in last November's general election, winning a 58-to-22 majority in the Assembly and a 27-to-13 advantage in the Senate. Their two-thirds majorities in both houses gave them the power to override any veto by Mr. Florio and, in effect, to supplant many of his policy ideas.
After only four months in power, the Republicans are hearing a public clamor for action. But miscalculations, policy differences among their leaders and a freshman class of legislators who have proved to be unusually independent have so far neutralized the Republicans' advantage.
 
Avoiding Assessment
 They have staked much of their credibility on passing the sales-tax rollback, but Mr. Franks would not speak on the politics of the issue, only of the economic harm that he said would befall the state if the tax is not reduced.
"It would be a tragedy if we missed this opportunity," he said. "We would be missing a key opportunity for future growth."
Republican support for a veto override on the tax rollback seems solid in the Assembly, but party members have said that there may be as many as six holdouts in the Senate, where even one lost vote would mean defeat.
The Florio administration further complicated the Republicans' budget-cutting plans last week when the State Treasurer, Samuel F. Crane, announced a $342 million budget shortfall for this fiscal year and a $310 million shortfall for the one that begins July 1, which he blamed on lower income-tax revenue. Mr. Crane proposed steps to close the gap, many of which require the support of the Legislature.
The chairmen of the Legislature's Budget Committees, Senator Robert E. Littell and Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, issued written statements today that they described as responses to the revenue shortfall. But neither commented directly on the Democrats' proposals, and neither offered alternatives. Each simply blamed Mr. Florio for the shortfalls.
About two hours later, Mr. Franks joined the fray at his news conference. "Over the past two years, Governor Florio has become the Harry Houdini of state government," he said, "inventing one trick after another to disguise massive overspending. Two years and $5.6 billion in new taxes later, Governor Florio has yet to deliver a realistic fiscal blueprint for our state."
Mr. Florio did not respond, leaving that job to his Democratic colleagues. "Somebody really should figure out a way to tell the Republicans that the campaign is over," the Senate Democratic leader, John A. Lynch, said in a statement. "This insistence on rehashing campaign cliches won't do after voters gave them a mandate to govern."

Jim Florio's insistence that he will not sign a sales-tax rollback bill until the Republicans announce plans to compensate for the $610 million that would be lost, Assemblyman Robert D.

HEADLINE: Campbell's Net Up 19.8% In 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that its earnings rose 19.8 percent in the third quarter. But analysts said much of the gain came from cost-cutting, not real growth.
William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the quality of Campbell's earnings was far weaker than the reported gain indicated. "How they got there was not entirely satisfactory," he said. 
 Analysts said earnings improvement came from keeping down expenses and a lower tax rate. By cutting costs, Cambpell's has reported a string of strong quarterly results, but Mr. Leach said yesterday, "This probably marks the end of the 20 percent gains."
Third-quarter profits increased to $91.5 million, or 36 cents a share, from $76.4 million, or 30 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Sales rose 3 percent, to $1.54 billion, compared with $1.49 billion last year.
 
Full-Year Earnings Estimates
 Based on yesterday's results, Mr. Leach slightly reduced his full-year earnings estimates for Campbell's to $1.87 a share.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell's shares slipped 75 cents yesterday, to $33.625.
The company said frozen food sales were down substantially for the quarter as a result of heavy price competition in the category. Earnings were also lower because of heavy marketing support behind the national introduction of LeMenu New American Cuisine dinners and the introduction of other new products in the Swanson line.
David W. Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said, "This was a very good quarter considering the recession and generally drab competitive results." He said the company's soup business grew strongly in the United States, Canada and Britain. Soup volume in North America gained 11 percent, bolstered in part by the acquisition of Sanwa Foods.
"We continue to spend aggressively on both advertising and promotion to support a wide array of new product initiatives," Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Exempt Yields Decline In Reverse of 3-Week Trend

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down in the latest week, with tax-exempt yields falling for the first time in a month.
In the week ended Monday, the yields on tax-exempt money funds were down after rising steadily the last three weeks. Analysts at Donoghue's said greater demand for fixed-income securities had lowered interest rates throughout the market, driving prices there higher and yields lower. 
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said the demand for tax-exempt securities could be seen in the flow of $1.2 billion into the funds, pushing total assets up to $94.8 billion.
The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell by 12 basis points, to 3.12 percent, while the simple yield dropped a like amount to 3.07 percent. In the same period, the lagging 30-day compounded average yield and simple yield, both increased by 7 basis points, to 3.08 percent and 3.04 percent, respectively. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities held in fund portfolios had increased by one, to 53.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 4.33 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 4.52 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Calvert Tax-Free Reserves/Money Market Portfolio offered the best return, at 4.01 percent. The fund's distributor is the Calvert Group of Bethesda, Md.
 
Taxable Funds
 In tracking taxable money market funds for the week ended Tuesday, Donoghue's reported that assets were up $340 million, to $491.4 billion. As institutional assets grew by $2.3 billion, to $164.1 billion, retail assets declined by $2 billion. Analysts said the narrow yield spread between taxable funds and tax-exempt funds had favored the tax-exempts.
The average seven-day taxable compounded yield fell 5 basis points, to 3.57 percent, and the simple yield dropped 4 basis points, to 3.51 percent. For the 30-day compounded average, the yield was 3.63 percent, down 5 basis points, with the simple yield down a similar amount to 3.57 percent.
The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series repeated as the best performer, with a return of 4.35 percent, down 3 basis points from its best yield last week. The fund is distributed by the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparsion, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of the money funds, stands at 3.46 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Decline; Gold Prices Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a broad decline yesterday as traders weighed whether the latest economic data would prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
Gold prices were higher after falling in Asia. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $335.60 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold added $1 an ounce to a late bid price of $335.60. 
 The United States currency initially strengthened on a better-than-expected report on retail sales. The Commerce Department said sales rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in April, but that followed a 1 percent decline in sales the previous month, more than double what had previously been reported.
Analysts said traders paid less attention to a separate report pointing to modest inflation. The Government said consumer prices rose a slight two-tenths of 1 percent in April.
Still, analysts said they believed the Fed would move soon to cut interest rates, a move that is bearish for the dollar. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston, said selling increased after reports that German union workers rejected a wage settlement.
"It raised the prospect of another rate hike there," he said, which would further hurt the dollar. The dollar fell in busy trading, closing at its lows for the session.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 130.30 yen, down 2.30 yen from Tuesday's finish. In London, the dollar closed at 130.40 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 129.60 yen, down from 130.55 yen on Tuesday. The dollar has not closed at these levels against the yen since early March.
In London, the British pound was unchanged at $1.8135. In New York it cost $1.8275 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8135.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6090 German marks, down from 1.6230; 1.4795 Swiss francs, down form 1.5035; 5.4005 French francs, down from 5.4560; 1,210.75 Italian lire, down from 1,222.00, and 1.2040 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2060.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame L.B.J.

BYLINE: By Joseph A. Califano Jr.; Joseph A. Califano Jr., a lawyer, was President Lyndon B. Johnson's Special Assistant for Domestic Affairs.

 BODY:
Abraham Lincoln was President more than a century ago, and a Republican, so the Administration couldn't blame the Emancipation Proclamation for the riots in Los Angeles. Instead, the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, and President Bush laid much of the blame on Lyndon B. Johnson and his domestic programs.
Asked to identify which programs the Administration was talking about, Mr. Fitzwater snapped, "I don't have a list with me." Which could be on the Administration hit list? 
 Surely Head Start was not one. Mr. Bush has adopted that Great Society program as one of his favorites. Since the Administration claims a devotion to having people stand on their own two feet, we can assume it was not talking about training programs like the Job Corps, the Vocational Education Act or the college work-study program, which helps the less affluent work their way through college.
I doubt the man who aspires to be our Education President had in mind the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides billions of dollars to schools with concentrations of poor children; the Higher Education Act, which provides loans and scholarships to those who have the brains and will, but not the wallets, to get into college, or the adult literacy program, which he has embraced.
Perhaps the Administration was talking about the Teachers Corps or Vista (Volunteers in Service to America). Those efforts were intended to get college graduates to volunteer (at $75 per month) to give the poor a hand up in education and work skills. They do sound like Gov. Bill Clinton's domestic peace corps; they also fit neatly into Mr. Bush's call for volunteerism.
Maybe Mr. Fitzwater had in mind the Voting Rights Act, which opened the polls to blacks (and later Hispanics) and helped elect thousands of local and county officials aross the South and a number of big-city mayors. These voters and officeholders are overwhelmingly Democrats.
Mr. Fitzwater's other targets may include the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned job discrimination against minorities and which the Administration has sought to gut and used to feed white resentment in a soft economy. Maybe he's aiming at the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which L.B.J. pressed Congress to pass as a constructive example of hope in the wake of the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King.
It is unlikely Mr. Fitzwater was criticizing the National Housing Act of 1968. It created the National Housing Partnership to attract the private sector into building low- and moderate-income housing by making it profitable, privatized the Federal National Mortgage Association and offered the poor a home ownership program. That is down the center of the Reagan-Bush alley.
The Aid for Dependent Children program was a 30's idea, so Mr. Fitzwater couldn't have had it in mind. President Johnson, like Mr. Bush, criticized its damage to families. L.B.J. pressed Congress in vain to drop the rule that a jobless husband must leave the house so his wife and children could get benefits.
Could Mr. Fitzwater have been talking about L.B.J.'s economic policies? When President Johnson got Congress to cut taxes in 1964, he didn't serve most benefits up to the rich so they could eventually trickle down to the rest of America. He kept the tax fully graduated. He used revenues from the expanding economy to increase minimum Social Security benefits and finance Medicare (thus lifting millions out of poverty) and to finance education, job training, Medicaid and other health programs that helped halve the number of Americans living in poverty. The last 12 years have seen that proportion double.
What seems most likely is that the Administration didn't know what it was talking about -- historically, ideologically or economically. L.B.J. left plenty of mistakes to learn from and successes to build on. Can't we start learning and building?

HEADLINE: Pay of College Graduates Is Outpaced by Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Two labor economists reported yesterday that the pay of most college-educated people -- once thought to be exempt from the wage stagnation that has afflicted Americans for more than 15 years -- had failed since 1989 to keep up with inflation.
The findings, published by the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research organization that often supports Democratic candidates, suggest that as many high-paying jobs vanish from the workplace, a bachelor of arts degree is becoming less of a ticket to a rising income -- a conclusion that other economists said was probably accurate. 
 "Unless we create more jobs, the college-educated are going to crowd out the people below them," said Janet L. Norwood, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and until recently the Commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The college-educated can at least go down, but the people below them have nowhere to go."
The study, by Lawrence Mishel, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, and Jared Bernstein, an economist there, found that among the college-educated, average pay continued to rise at a faster pace than inflation in the last three years only for black women with bachelor of arts degrees and all men and women with at least two years of postgraduate study.
"Black women, educated and uneducated, are becoming the prime wage earners in black America," Mr. Mishel said.
But for most Americans, a marked slowdown in the national economy, starting in early 1989, has pulled down wages. This is true not only for high-school-educated factory and clerical workers, whose pay, adjusted for inflation, continues to shrink, but also now for the educated. Indeed, the gap between high school and college graduates, which averaged $5.40 an hour in 1973, was $5.97 an hour in 1991, with the college-educated employee averaging $16.69 an hour, after adjustment for inflation, and the high school-trained worker $10.72. That makes a college degree still an advantage, although a diminishing one. The degree commanded $17.55 an hour in the late 1980's.
Many reasons are offered by economists and sociologists for the newly evident decline in the pay of the college-educated. Prominent among them are the white-collar layoffs in recent years in banking, on Wall Street, in real estate and retailing, and among middle-level managers in many industries as companies adjust to a weak economy, falling sales and hard-to-get price increases.
The Bush Administration argues that recent wage problems are a result of the recession that may now be giving way to a mild recovery. But most economists argue that if the recovery remains so mild that it keeps the economy as weak as it was in 1989 and 1990, before the recession set in, then the wages of the college-educated are likely to continue to suffer.
"You need economic growth far stronger than it has been in recent years to reverse the trend in declining wages," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist.
Until 1989, the average hourly earnings of people with a four-year college education had risen over a 10-year period by a total of 2 percent, after adjustment for inflation. Over the next three years, 1.6 percent of this gain was lost, the study found -- a loss that Mr. Mishel and Mr. Bernstein attributed in part to white-collar layoffs and to raises that were less than the average annual rise of 4.6 percent in the Consumer Price Index since 1989.
"If you look around Government, where college-educated people are employed in huge numbers, explosive pay raises during the 1980's have tailed off in recent years," said Thomas Plewes, Associate Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 
All Wages Fell
 Commenting on the findings, Frank Levy, a labor economist at the University of Maryland, said, "The new trend is striking not so much because the college-educated gained so much ground in the 1980's, but because the bottom fell out of wages for the less educated."
Whatever the reasons, the reversal for the college-educated, combined with a continued fall in inflation-adjusted incomes for people with only a high school diploma, or less, means that average hourly wages for all the nation's workers fell by nearly a percentage point from 1989 through 1991, on top of a 2.7 percent loss for the 1979-89 period, the study found.
Mr. Mishel and Mr. Bernstein are among the first to analyze recently released Bureau of Labor Statistics data covering income trends through 1991, a recession year. Among other things, they broke down wage and benefit data into hourly compensation rather than weekly or annual earnings, to filter out income from extra hours worked and to pin down what Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton labor economist, calls the cost of a unit of labor.
Their findings also contradicted another widely held perception: that employer-paid health and pension insurance had continued to rise in the late 1980's, after adjustment for inflation. While these outlays did go up during the decade, they were roughly the same on average at the end of 1991 as they were in 1987, the study found.
"The general wisdom has been that medical and pension costs are going up faster than wages are falling," Mrs. Norwood said. "But it is hard to break out insurance categories, as this study tries to do, because employers list insurance costs together."
 
Latest Documentation
 Bill Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential candidate, has publicly cited studies illustrating the gap that has developed between the incomes of the wealthiest Americans and those of the rest of the population. The Economic Policy Institute's findings are the latest to document the wage stagnation for people below the highest incomes.
A Census Bureau study, released earlier this week, reported that the percentage of full-time workers earning less than a low-income $12,195 annually, or $6.10 an hour for a 40-hour week, had risen sharply in the last decade. Other studies show that thousands of entry-level jobs for new college graduates evaporated during the recession that began in July 1990.
From World War II until the early 1970's, the incomes of most Americans, whether they were janitors or executives, rose faster than the annual inflation rate. As a result, the constantly rising standard of living generated a sense of national well-being that began to dissipate by the 1980's -- except for the 20 percent of the population at the high end of the income scale, who escaped the stagnation, and in particular the wealthiest 1 percent. College graduates are prominent among the top 20 percent.
An upturn in inflation-adjusted income that appeared to be developing in the mid-1980's failed to materialize, and by early 1989, when the nation's economic growth slowed to 2 percent a year or less, incomes had stagnated again, although college graduates had appeared to be exempt. The upshot is that median hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, for all workers, whatever their education, fell from $11.12 an hour in 1989 to $10.99 an hour last year.
The wage problem for the college-educated coincides with the onset, in early 1989, of a slowdown in the growth of the nation's economy, or gross domestic product, to an annual rate of 2 percent or less, from 2.5 percent or more since 1983. That raised the issue of whether a mild recovery now projected by the Bush Administration and most economists -- one in which the economy grows at an annual rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year -- would be enough to generate new jobs. "It is not clear that people will feel better off if the economy turns up a bit," Mr. Levy said. "People are catching on that beneath the ups and downs in the economy, wages have remained flat."

HEADLINE: Communists in Laos Steer Economy By Capitalist Lights, Not the Red Star

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos

 BODY:
"Socialism remains the goal," said the former official, one of the old guard of Laotian Communism who began the struggle against France in the 1940's and continued it from mountain caves in the north and during the heavy United States bombardment until they took over this country in 1975.
"When will Laos be socialist?" he asked with a shrug. "It may take 20 years, 50 years, maybe 100. I don't know." 
 The former official, the companion at arms of President Kaysone Phomvihan, insisted that his name not be used because the interview at his home had not been officially arranged. Laos still strictly regulates the activities of the rare visiting correspondent.
For the time being this small country, one of the world's least developed, has done away with the outward trappings of Communism and opened its economy to investment and trade by Laotians and foreigners. Last year it removed the word "socialism" from its national motto and replaced it with "prosperity."
On the national emblem, the hammer and sickle was removed, then the five-pointed Communist star; finally both were replaced by a revered Buddhist shrine. "Showing the hammer and sickle today is illegal," says the Deputy Foreign Minister, Soubanh Srithirath.
 
Economy Settles Down
 The openness to new investment has helped reduce inflation from 76 percent in 1989 to 10 percent last year, to stabilize the currency, and to increase annual growth in the gross national product to 4 percent last year despite a severe drought and the total loss of assistance from the Soviet Union and its former allies.
But Mr. Soubanh Srithirath, who is regarded as one of the most open-minded of the younger leaders, still adamantly defends the maintenance of a one-party state, as did the aged revolutionary and all officials questioned during a 10-day visit. All did so in almost identical phrases, indicating that heavy-handed indoctrination continues, even of top officials.
Khamsay Souphanouvong, who is the Acting Minister of the Economy, Planning and Finance, is a son of Prince Souphanouvong and a founder of the Communist Party. He defended the ban on opposition parties.
"The people know the ability of our party to lead them," he said in an interview. "They see who represents their interests. It is not we who impose ourselves on the people. They impose leadership on us and want no other party."
The paradox of a country that has reverted to capitalism while maintaining a rigorously Communist state was recently illustrated in a fashionable French restaurant here.
Mr. Khamsay Souphanouvong's cousin, Prince Panya Souvanna Phouma, was eating lunch with friends. The Prince, an international businessman and son of Souvanna Phouma, the American-backed Prime Minister who led the struggle against the Communists, was in town to look after his investment in tourism.
 
Little Tolerance for Pluralism
 In contrast, three officials who late in 1990 advanced the idea of broadening the nation's politics and who condemned the corruption that has been a product of free enterprise, have been held without trial since. The three, who are being detained in a remote and primitive mountain province, Houaphan, are the former Deputy Minister of Science and Technology, Thongsouk Saisangkhi; the former Deputy Agriculture Minister, Latsami Khamphoui, and Feng Sakchitthaphong, a senior Justice Ministry official.
Western diplomats said aid-giving countries had regularly pressed the Government on the detentions but had not made assistance conditional on the men's release.
Eight officials and military officers of the pre-1975 Government also remain in exile, without their families, in Houaphan; they are the last of thousands who were transported there for harsh "re-education" in 1975.
"Re-education was necessary for security and national defense," said the former revolutionary leader, who met privately with a reporter. "But we did one thing wrong -- we kept people there too long."
He contended that only Laotians who had fled the country were urging creation of opposition parties and "so-called human rights."
"They do it to disturb our Government and our security," added the ex-revolutionary, who still occupies an important public post.
The Constitution that Laos adopted last August, after 16 years without one, enshrines the leading role of the Communist Party in Article 3, and in Article 5 places Parliament and "all organs of state" under the "principle of democratic centralism." This is a Leninist doctrine that bans opposition to leadership decisions. Both provisions remain targets of dissidents struggling against Communist rule.
 
A Thousand Shops Bloom
 However tight the political fetters, Laotians in Vientiane and the few other major towns, all along the Mekong River, are living in an economic environment that recalls the pre-Communist days. In the markets and along the main streets, small shops of all kinds thrive. Soup and fruit vendors line streets. Consumer electronics goods fill rows of shops in the Central Market in Vientiane, which was built with American aid when the United States underwrote most of the economy.
But most consumer goods, even food, are imported from Thailand. The road system of Laos is so poor that Thai towns on the opposite bank of the Mekong supply Laotian needs more efficiently than could cumbersome transport within this country. A senior international economic official estimated the Thai share of the consumer market at 80 to 90 percent. In addition to controlling most trade, Thai investors are the most active in accepting the open invitation to foreign capital.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, Bountiem Phitsamay, said investment committed so far amounted to more than $300 million in 180 authorized projects, most backed by Thais. He and Mr. Khamsay Souphanouvong, at the Economics Ministry, said there was no reason to worry that Thai influence might become overbearing, and there is no ceiling on the share of total investment by one country.
Such confidence is not shared by all Laotians, particularly because Thailand holds the key to access to this landlocked country. Vietnam has not lived up to hopes that its ports might reduce Laotian dependence on Thailand for transit.
But after years of fluctuating tension, Thai-Laotian relations have grown warm, and Bangkok has pleased its smaller neighbor by reducing transit and customs rates.
The bustling economic life of the towns tends to make many foreigners forget that a large share of the population of perhaps four million still lives on a subsistence economy and is barely included in a modern economic process.
A visit to remote Houaphan and Xiengkhouang provinces showed very few manufactured or Thai goods in the local markets. The former revolutionary said that those living largely from the products of their own toil make up about two-thirds of the population.
 
Capitalism? 'No Comment'
 He said that the transformation of a subsistence economy had proved impossible under the all-out socialism, collectivization and state management of everything that was introduced in 1975, and that the leadership had thus been forced to return to earlier methods.
"Some people say Laos returned to capitalism," he said. "Is it true? I make no comment."
Whatever the present system is called, international economic officials and diplomats give the Government high marks for its realism in adopting non-Communist economics. "In most of the world we need to cajole and threaten," an official of a lending organization told a diplomat. "Here they can't get enough of our advice."
But despite the great economic freedom, when an adviser sent by the French Treasury drafted a decree late in April stipulating the qualifications for certain accounts, it was returned to her with a reminder that she had "forgotten" to include Communist Party membership among the requirements.

A tentative calm settled today over Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after Serbian leaders who have pressed a military offensive across the republic responded to Western diplomatic pressure by announcing a five-day cease-fire.
The artillery, mortar and rocket fire that has rattled Sarajevo for much of the last month was mostly stilled after the cease-fire went into effect at 6 A.M. The calm was broken only sporadically thereafter by gunfire from Serbian positions in the hills above the city. 
 Reporters in Sarajevo said that residents emerged from their houses for the first time in days, with some pausing to sip coffee at sidewalk cafes or to buy chocolate and other snacks from street vendors. Although truce violations were reported in other contested towns and villages around the republic, the violence appeared to be at its lowest level in 10 days.
But in Sarajevo, which has seen a succession of cease-fires disintegrate rapidly, there was little confidence that an end had come to two months of fighting has taken at least 1,300 lives and left as many as 700,000 people homeless.
There were reports from Sarajevo of widespread dismay over the United Nations' decision to withdraw about 200 of the 300 representatives it has in the city. The move, announced in New York, deepened the sense of isolation stirred by the evacuation on Tuesday of the last members of the European Community's military observer team. The International Committee of the Red Cross has considered withdrawing as well, but said it would remain for the time being.
 
Sign of Action by Belgrade
 Although the United Nations pullback seems likely to reduce the already slim influence that its representatives have on the warring sides, diplomats in Belgrade said that they were encouraged by signs that the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Government isfinally responding to demands that it seek to restrain the Serbs in Bosnia.
The self-proclaimed parliament of the Bosnian Serbs approved the unilateral cease-fire at a meeting in the northern town of Banja Luka on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after Western governments took their first serious step to punish the Belgrade Government for what they view as a Serbian bid to dismember Bosnia.
The 12 nations of the European Community announced on Monday that they were withdrawing their ambassadors from Belgrade, a move followed on Tuesday by the announcement that the United States Ambassador, Warren Zimmermann, would also depart. With a simultaneous decision by the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to bar Belgrade's representative from its deliberations on Yugoslav problems, the pullback of the ambassadors suggests that Western nations are moving from talk to action to constrain the Serbs.
There appears to be no collective resolve to move to the tougher option of economic sanctions, but the reaction of the Belgrade Government suggested that it recognized the dangers. The Yugoslav Government denounced the diplomatic reprisals as "one-sided," but added that it was being punished for the actions of Bosnian Serbs over whom it had no control.
"They are masters of their own fate," Belgrade's Foreign Minister, Vladislav Jovanovic, told reporters. "Even if we want to influence them, we cannot do it."
But signs have been accumulating for months that Radovan Karadzic, the hard-line leader of the Serbian Democratic Party, the political arm of the Bosnian Serbian militias, closely co-ordinates his actions with Belgrade.
For example, Mr. Karadzic and his associates also announced that they were creating an army for Bosnian Serbs. They said the new force would absorb Yugoslav Army soldiers who remain in Bosnia after the army completes a planned "withdrawal" on May 19.
Since Belgrade contends that 80 percent of the Yugoslav Army troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina are Bosnian Serbs, the announcement means that a force of at least 30,000 men with tanks, artillery, multiple-rocket launchers and large stocks of ammunition will make a nominal change of colors and continue fighting for the Serbian cause.
The Bosnian Serbs said the cease-fire was conditioned on the resumption of the European Community's talks on the future of Bosnia. The community suspended those talks on May 2.

HEADLINE: Europe Proposes Taxes on Fuels Tied to Warming

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 13

 BODY:
Sharpening its differences with the United States on environmental policies, the European Community proposed today that a high energy tax be imposed on all forms of fuel to limit pollution and global warming.
The proposal, which is one of the community's most ambitious fiscal and environmental moves so far, appears to be intended as the calling card the 12-nation group will present at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro next month. 
 So far, the step takes the form of a recommendation by the community's Brussels-based executive commission and will require approval by the 12 community member nations as well as the European Parliament before it becomes law.
But, suggesting that the proposal may also be used as a bargaining position at the Earth Summit, the commission proposed that the new tax only be adopted if Western Europe's major trading partners -- the United States and Japan -- adopt a similar measure.
Under the proposal, European governments would levy a tax on fossil fuels -- coal, oil and gas -- and all other forms of energy except that produced by sun, waves or wind. It would be introduced in 1993 at the rate of $3 per barrel of oil, or its equivalent in other fuels, with the tax rising by $1 per year to reach $10 in the year 2000.
By driving up fuel costs, the plan aims to force users to become more efficient and save energy, one of the main objectives of the current European rethinking of its economic and industrial policies. Community studies argue that with existing technology, energy efficiency can be increased at little extra cost by 25 percent. The proposed taxes will be highest for the dirtiest form of energy, coal, followed by oil. Taxes on natural gas would be the lowest and biomass fuel would be exempted.
The proposal, which has been studied and debated for more than two years, forms the basis of the community's strategy to slow pollution and global warming. The group has committed itself to keeping emissions of gases tied to global warming at 1990 levels. The United States has balked at setting such targets, which has caused a longstanding deadlock between American and European negotiators preparing a treaty to slow global warming.
If the European Community takes no measures, experts say that its emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, would be 12 percent higher by the year 2000. It hopes to achieve half of the needed cutback through the proposed "energy taxes" and the rest through other measures. The community is responsible for 13 percent of of global carbon dioxide emissions.
But the plan, formally announced in Strasbourg today, was unlikely to satisfy everyone. There has been bitter opposition from industrialists who assert that such additional taxes will hamper their competitiveness. That was the main reason why the community executive today said the tax would not be levied until major trading partners took the same step.
Officials said that would increase pressure on the United States, Japan and others to accept concrete measures to limit their emissions. But privately, officials said environmental ministers and politicians would press hard for the European Community to adopt their plan even if others did not make such moves.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Back to Politics as Usual, Parties Dispute Urban Plans

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Only a day after President Bush and Congressional leaders met to display a spirit of bipartisanship in dealing with the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, Republicans and Democrats returned to their normal political maneuvering today and demonstrated that they remained far apart on urban policy.
Mutual appeals for unity began to fray even as Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders moved ahead with modest programs. Mr. Bush announced a $600 million loan package to finance the rebuilding of businesses and homes in riot-damaged areas of Los Angeles, and the Democrats moved to advance an additional $822 million emergency appropriations package to the floor for a vote on Thursday. The package would also provide aid for areas of Chicago affected by the collapse of a tunnel and subsequent flooding. 
 The help Mr. Bush announced today came in addition to $600 million in loans and grants from the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Administration. White House officals also said that those loans might be increased by $200 million.
But the Administration and Democratic leaders were pulled in opposite directions by their respective constituencies in closed-door meetings through the day. Republican House members told four senior Administration officials that they would not tolerate an initiative that raised taxes or increased deficit spending. Hours later, Democratic mayors told Congressional leaders that nothing short of a vast new aid program would prevent rioting.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic House leader, appeared to distance himself from Mr. Bush's approach to urban policy, which emphasizes tax incentives for businesses to invest in inner cities and loans to low-income families to purchase the public housing units they live in.
"There's a great deal of difference between our agendas," Mr. Gephardt said after meeting for two hours with the Democratic mayors.
And only days after the Administration backed away from comments made by the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, who said the riots resulted from failed social programs of the 1960's, Vice President Dan Quayle made similar remarks. He told reporters in Japan, where he is holding three days of talks with leaders, that welfare programs backed by the Democratic Party "basically practiced and preached the idea of dependence, and dependency has created inertia, lack of drive, lack of self-help."
Keeping the public focus on his renewed interest in urban affairs, Mr. Bush went to one of Baltimore's poorest neighborhoods today for a previously scheduled visit to a medical clinic to discuss health insurance. But instead of focusing on health care, Mr. Bush announced that the Administration would make the $600 million available in South-Central Los Angeles for low-interest loans for housing and small businesses.
In a speech to health care workers, Mr. Bush said the loans were "good news for the people who lost homes and jobs as well as the owners who lost businesses due to the unrest out there, and it's one way we can underscore the fact that we are serious about helping Los Angeles recover."
Democratic leaders and a group of urban lawmakers met to begin constructing a legislative strategy for the weeks and months ahead after consulting with the mayors. The lawmakers decided to weave a jobs program costing $2 billion to $3 billion into Mr. Bush's proposals and said they also wanted to construct a more ambitious long-term policy to overhaul the welfare system and augment Federal financing for job training.
"The marching orders are to work something out with the Administration in the short term," said Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico. "And then in the longer term, we work on the fundamental urban ills."
The loans announced by Mr. Bush would be provided to banks and savings associations in California by the Federal Home Loan Bank system, a taxpayer-backed enterprise that was created by Congress during the Great Depression to make housing more affordable. The lower interest rates would then presumably be passed on to customers.
As the President made his announcement, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, the budget director, Richard G. Darman, Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp and Attorney General William P. Barr addressed the House Republican caucus to request support for the Administration's urban strategy.
Republican lawmakers praised Mr. Barr's call for a $500 million program to root out gangs from communities before delivering new social services. But they described the messages of the other officials on proposals for urban enterprise zones, privatization of public housing and education change as lackluster and imprecise. Several members spoke critically, warning that they could not support programs that would significantly raise either expenditures or taxes.
 
'The Wrong Message'
 "There's resentment from the rural areas," said Representative Bill Lowery, Republican of California, who added that "a large number" of Republican lawmakers were warning that the Administration was about to "send the wrong message that urban terrorism brings Federal largesse."
Meanwhile, Congressional leaders heard a very different message from 10 Democratic mayors, including David N. Dinkins of New York. The mayors delivered a report to Democratic leaders today declaring that unless Washington moved quickly to reverse "10 years of neglect," cities throughout the country would be forced to cut public payrolls and services severely.
"No one is on our side," said Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, as Mr. Gephardt looked on. "While it was Los Angeles in flames, it could have been any city in America."
Democratic lawmakers said the mayors pressed the leaders to use a meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House next week to push for sweeping new urban programs. Mr. Bush has said he will resist expensive new programs.
Despite statements by some Republican lawmakers earlier this week that Congress would enact legislation to aid urban areas within a few weeks, Mr. Fitzwater said today: "It will be three to four weeks before we get a good read on whether we have a good bill. We have to see what the strategy is on the Hill."

The Young Are Given A Refuge In Music

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 8

 BODY:
Like many other young people in urban areas, Sanettra Ferguson, 17 years old, and Michael Thompson, 18, have seen their share of drugs and guns, and they have watched their friends die in street violence.
Unlike their peers, the two have found a refuge from the gangs and drugs that have invaded city schools and neighborhoods: music. 
 They spend three afternoons a week writing lyrics, composing songs and recording them in a studio apartment near their East Boston high school.
Miss Ferguson and Mr. Thompson are among more than 60 young people who have been recruited by Music Mobile, a free program in East Boston that is open to all Boston students 8 to 18 years old.
The nonprofit program was begun last year by two East Boston residents, Madeleine Steczynski and Bob Grove, who quit their jobs because they wanted to do something more meaningful.
Their idea is for the young people to use music as a vehicle to discuss their problems and come up with solutions.
Ms. Steczynski, an aspiring musician, had worked full time for a Cambridge architect and Mr. Grove, a professional musician, had worked as a computer systems consultant. Music Mobile was financed out of their pockets, but they are hoping that with grants and community donations, the programs will be self-supporting in two years and provide them with a modest living.
"We wanted the kids here to have an outlet where they could develop their artistic talent and do something positive for the community," Ms. Steczynski said. "We also wanted to encourage understanding among people whose paths might not normally cross."
Members of the Music Mobile reflect a wide range of ethnic and economic backgrounds, as do their audiences at the schools, hospitals, senior citizen homes and city parks where the group performs.
"We are also hoping that the messages in their music will make their way to other communities as the kids play their tapes for their friends and families," Mr. Grove said.
Most of the songs deal with the young people's experiences on the streets. One of the most telling songs, composed by a group of 24, is called "We've Had Enough." These are the words in one verse:
 
We've had enough of what's bad in our lives
We've had enough of drugs, guns and knives
Now we're going to turn it around,
because music is something new that we've found.
Community leaders have hailed the program as a positive addition to a neighborhood that has been exploited in the name of the city's transportation needs, namely its airport.
Over the years, several recreational areas and many homes have been lost to an expanding Logan Airport, which now occupies two thirds of East Boston.
Once an island, East Boston is now connected to the city by two harbor tunnels. Yet residents here, known as Easties, still consider themselves separate from the city.
Because of their isolation, young people in East Boston have fewer artistic opportunities than those in other areas of the city. In addition, music programs have become less available in the schools over the years because of financial cutbacks.
"A lot of these kids have nowhere to go after school," said Mark Sarro, a program supervisor at Harborside Community School here. "Music Mobile is keeping them off the streets."
Community leaders also praised Music Mobile's efforts to promote understanding among cultures, particularly in East Boston, where Central and South Americans, Southeast Asians and blacks have transformed what was once primarily an Italian-American section.
Miss Ferguson suggested that she and fellow members of Music Mobile might be able to bridge the gaps between different cultures. "People are open to music," she said. "It's something we all share."
As their songs attest, they also share a desire to improve race relations. In a rap song called "Life in the City," another group composition, they say:
 
Now -- it's not too late
to alleviate -- all this hate
'cause city life -- ain't always great
let's collaborate -- make a better fate.
 
<ILS>Photo: "We wanted the kids here to have an outlet where they could develop their artistic talent and do something positive for the community," said Madeleine Steczynski, left, of the Music Mobile program in Boston. She and co-founder, Bob Grove, helped a high school student, Gloribell Mota, record a song. (Sarah Putnam for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Panel Told of Fraud in Rural Housing Program

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Scores of developers who built rental housing for the rural poor with subsidized loans and Federal tax credits have reaped huge profits and in many cases have added to those earnings by diverting project funds to their personal use, Government investigators told a House subcommittee today.
The program under scrutiny, the Farmers Home Administration's rural rental housing program, for which the Government has spent $12 billion in the last 20 years, is so marked by fraud that 64 criminal investigations related to it are now under way in 31 states, the investigators said. 
 They also said truly needy rural residents who qualify for assistance under the program may be shut out of apartments because people who do not qualify are gaining admittance by lying about their income.
 
Cash Down Payment if 3%
 The investigators, witnesses before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, are from the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, and the office of the inspector general at the Department of Agriculture, the parent of the Farmers Home Administration.
The program on which they gave testimony provides Government loans to build, purchase, repair and operate multifamily housing projects for low-income tenants in rural areas. The loan usually covers 97 percent of a project's cost or value; the developer puts up a cash down payment of only 3 percent.
The loans have subsidized interest rates of only 1 percent, and developers also qualify for Federal tax credits. In addition, rents for tenants can be subsidized by either the Farmers Home Administration or the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
A G.A.O. analysis of three projects financed under the program found that even in the absence of fraud, the developers had realized returns on their initial cash investment of 780 percent to 970 percent in the first year. Officials of the Farmers Home Administration acknowledged that returns of that magnitude were excessive and generally typical of the program, the accounting office said.
 
'Instant Millionaire'
 "With a $92,000 investment in two projects, an Fm.H.A. developer can become an instant millionaire," said Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House subcommittee.
On top of those large typical profits are added earnings that are frequently reaped through fraudulent or otherwise abusive activities, the investigators said. The accounting office said examples of such activities were inflated construction costs and diverting project funds to the developer's personal use.
The Agriculture Department's office of inspector general has been uncovering such abuses for years, the accounting office said, with the result that 35 indictments and 26 convictions have been returned against developers and project managers since 1987.
"Fraudulent and abusive activities exist because sufficient internal controls and trained staff are not present or available to detect and prevent these activities," said Judy A. England-Joseph, one of the G.A.O. investigators who testified today.
Another witness was La Verne Ausman, the head of the Farmers Home Administration, who said that the problems were being spotlighted largely through the inquiry of the agency's own inspector general and that officials were acting to strengthen the management of the program.
But Mr. Dingell, the subcommittee chairman, said that in one recent case a supposedly trustworthy developer in Alabama had admitted to fraud totaling $500,000 only after watching a preacher on late-night television.
"I applaud the impact of this television preacher," Mr. Dingell said, "but regrettably I do not think Fm.H.A. can depend on the good Lord alone to activate the guilty consciences of too many of their corrupt developers."

HEADLINE: The Los Angeles Law: Use It

 BODY:
Stirred by the Los Angeles riot, politicians grope for ways to create jobs for angry inner-city residents. Jack Kemp, the Housing Secretary, pushes to give tax breaks and regulatory relief to companies that put their plants in ghettos. Two Democratic Senators, Paul Simon and David Boren, propose giving public sector jobs rather than handouts to long-term welfare recipients.
Though the sponsors deserve credit for groping, their proposals are neither new nor particularly practical. But Congress need not despair. It has already enacted a law that can give hope, and work, to alienated poor people in wastelands like south-central Los Angeles. It is called the Family Support Act of 1988 and all it needs is the money it was meant to have from the start. 
 Enterprise Zones: Three dozen states have tried them, without notable success. Tax breaks and regulatory waivers cannot compensate for the danger of doing business in areas of extremely high crime, extremely low skills and miserable public services.
There's no evidence that such zones, even if backed by Federal tax breaks, would generate many start-up businesses. They could, however, attract business from nearby neighborhoods, perhaps also poor. But no matter how they work, before long all legislators would want some of the subsidy for their districts -- quickly dissipating the money. That's what happened with the Model Cities program of the Johnson and Nixon years.
Guaranteed Public Employment: Cutting off welfare grants to able-bodied malingerers certainly sounds like sensible public policy, but ultimately it's not credible. Congress won't punish the children of sluggards and drunkards who don't show up for work, any more than it will deny them food stamps and let them starve.
The idea of creating huge numbers of public sector jobs runs smack into a contradiction. If the jobs are meaningful -- building bridges, rehabilitating homes -- then the workers must be trained and, if organized labor has its way, paid prevailing wages. That's hugely costly in dollar terms. But if the only creatable jobs are menial, like many CETA jobs in the Carter years, that's politically costly: taxpayers become enraged.
The problem often for alienated, jobless people in the inner cities is not that there aren't jobs. If that were the problem, transportation or relocation subsidies would be the answer. The problem is that many aren't equipped, emotionally or educationally, to hold stable jobs. They need training. They need help finding work. And once they find it, they need child care and medical insurance.
These are exactly the goals of the 1988 Family Security Act, sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. But Congress has appropriated only $1.5 billion a year in matching funds, nowhere near the $6 billion needed. And states, strapped by recession, have had to let the Federal funds sit unused. No wonder the law's impact has been disappointing.
It could be encouraging. A California study by the respected Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation shows that where the law has been used, welfare rolls and outlays are both down. The gains aren't huge but head in the right direction. In short, there already is a Los Angeles law. More Federal financing would mean more saving, in dollars and lives -- and not just in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Riots' Ground Zero: Street of Hopelessness

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 141

 BODY:
At the crossroads where the violence began with a racial beating two weeks ago, and where it came full circle with a showy arrest before dawn on Tuesday, the return to the routines of life today seemed a sign of returning hopelessness.
Surrounded by burned-out buildings, the people who live here spoke with anger about a society that writes them off as hoodlums and gangsters and responds with more arrests to what they see as their cry for help.
 
Onset of Violence
 "If you're a poor person, nobody listens to you," said Charles Johnson, 55 years old, as he boarded a bus to his work as a house builder. "I know it's my neighborhood that's burning, but if I've got to do this to make you listen, I've got to do it. A lot of people are crying out, reaching out." 
 What they found, in the single most visible response to the riot, was a huge police presence on the block that was the scene of the first beating, a raid of two houses here, and the parading of some of the young men of the neighborhood before television cameras as the villains of the day.
Not everyone here is a gang member. Not everyone here likes Damian Williams, who was arrested personally by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates himself. But many people here said they shared with Mr. Williams a sense of victimization by the system. These are the people the nation has seen in miniature through the eye of a helicopter, dancing in victory as they beat and clubbed a white man they pulled from his truck at the start of the rioting on April 29.
But viewed from the sidewalk on a quiet morning, the people who live near the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues can be seen walking their children, tending their rose gardens, making repairs on their cars.
In dozens of conversations with people around the block, residents voiced little sympathy with the police. Although a number condemned the recent looting and burning and gang violence, a picture emerged of a community at war with its peacekeepers.
This morning, as daily life took on its normal rhythms, there was a strong sense of injustice over a legal system that many people here say favors white people at the expense of blacks.
"We always end up in jail; we do a little something and we go to jail for a long time," said Anthony Dawson, 20, an unemployed high school dropout whose life is dedicated to spraying his nickname, "Punker," on freeway signs.
 
Double Standard Is Seen
 "It's not like the white people," he said. "They just railroad the black people for some crazy reason, like we are animals or something."
Like others interviewed today, he drew a parallel between the acquittals of four white police officers in the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King, a motorist, and the arrests on Tuesday of four black men in the beating of the truck driver, Reginald Denny, who was released from the hospital today.
"If it was white people, they wouldn't be so hard on them," he said.
Some people asked why so much attention was being paid to the beating of a white man by blacks and so little to the 58 people who were killed during the rioting, most of them black and Hispanic people.
Some asked why the vivid videotape of the beating of Mr. King, a black motorist, on March 3, 1991, was not enough to convict the white policemen, but the videotape of their black neighbors was taken to be such conclusive evidence. The questions were echoed throughout the diverse black community here.
"If they convict the boys, you can see all hell break loose," said George Hammond, 51, a monitor at a halfway house for prison inmates. "How can they say those four officers are innocent and these four are guilty? Why is Chief Gates out there making arrests now? Why didn't he walk Officer Powell to jail?" He was referring to Laurence M. Powell, one of the four police officers who beat Mr. King. "It seems like there are different ways of doing things, depending on whether you're black or white."
Eddye Melaragno, 59, a retired elementary school principal, who is also black, said: "At least one child is killed every week in South-Central and they don't even call the F.B.I. One white person is hit, and they call out the force. It's a double standard."
Ms. Melaragno said: "This is making people schizophrenic. You can't approve of violence, but you can't approve of what the Federal Government is doing either."
Explaining why she had stopped working in South-Central Los Angeles, she said, "Simply, I couldn't stand the depression, coming down and watching people fail, seeing kids go through school and knowing they're not going to make it."
Here in the heart of the South-Central section, some of Mr. Williams's neighbors on 71st street have enclosed their lives in their small bungalow-style houses in an attempt to blot out the despair and the violence outside.
"I just try to keep my own business to myself," said Willie Mae Ben, 60, who has seen this street transformed from poor and quiet to poor and violent.
"When anything goes on, I just stay in my house watching TV," she said as she tended the garden outside her small, pristine house. On the night of April 29, it was the fires in her own neighborhood that she watched on television.
Just down the street, with its carefully tended rose gardens, Mr. Williams's mother, Georgina Williams, a nurse, said, "If my son is going down the street, as God is my eyewitness, when he sees someone picking through the trash can, he comes home and asks me for money to give to them."
A deeply religious woman, she said she felt no bitterness, but only love for Chief Gates, and she offered a prayer for him to recite: "Oh, God, in the name of Jesus, come into my heart and save me. Forgive me for my sins. You hear me, Devil, I'm through with you. I'm through with sin."
At the bus stop, on the corner where her son is accused of having beaten Mr. Denny with a brick, a neighbor, Jason Thomas, said Mr. Williams was a well-known gang member. "He was a guy that was respected by the people in the neighborhood for not being a coward," said Mr. Thomas, 18. He said Mr. Williams participated in gang activities like drive-by shootings and drug dealing, adding, "That's what all the younger kids look up to."
But as violent as such people may be, he said, it is the police who strike fear into his neighborhood. "When you go out in the street, the old people say, 'Watch out for the police,' " Mr. Thomas said. "They don't say, 'Watch out for the guy on the corner.' "
At Fred and Deryl's Auto Body Shop, a group of men talked in ever louder voices of this crossroads in the city's history.
"We're like a dog on a chain," said Deryl Curl, 23, a co-owner of the shop. "You hit us with a stick and you step back, and you hit us with a stick and you step back again, and finally that chain is going to break and you've got a frightened dog in the corner."
"What's he going to do, stand up and fight for himself or keep on letting the police hit him in the head, beat him with a club," he said, evoking images of the videotaped beating of Mr. King that are also images of reality for many of the young men who live here. "Ain't no justice being done when white men can beat up on a black man and it's O.K., but not when black men beat up on a white man," he said, pacing back and forth in an excess of energy.
"And all they do is say to you: 'Stop rioting. Be peaceful.' " he said.

HEADLINE: White House on Conflicting Paths As It Agrees to Protection for Owl

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The Bush Administration issued a plan today to restrict logging on 5.4 million acres of ancient forest that is home to the northern spotted owl, but at the same time it moved to narrow the protection for endangered animals and plants.
The complicated and contradictory actions came after years of scientific study and angry political struggles in the Pacific Northwest over the balance between economic development and the preservation of rare species on Federal land. 
 Even as it moved to preserve the owl and comply with the Endangered Species Act by making its plan public in Portland, Ore., the Administration moved on two more fronts here today to attack the 19-year-old law and allow more logging in the Pacific Northwest. The Administration is sending the clearest signals yet that it hopes to weaken the act's prohibition against considering economic factors when weighing the fate of endangered species.
In effect, the Administration put itself in the unusual position of complying with the strictest environmental law as it sought to undermine it. Today's moves in Washington to allow logging were largely symbolic, at least in the short term, because Federal judges have already barred logging in most of the ancient Northwest forests pending lawsuits filed by environmental groups. Moreover, any effort to change the Endangered Species Act is likely to founder in Congress, where support for it is strong.
 
A Day of Maneuvering
 Today's maneuvering began here today when a specially convened Cabinet-level committee voted 5 to 2 to waive the requirements of the endangered species law and allow logging on 13 federally owned tracts of timberland in Oregon that total 1,700 acres.
It was only the second time since the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973 that the committee had waived the requirements, and the first time since 1979, when the panel approved a dam in Wyoming after developing a plan to build an artificial wetland for the endangered whooping crane.
After the 5-to-2 vote today, the Administration proposed an amendment to the Endangered Species Act that would offset the plan released in Portland and allow logging on about two million acres.
In a report accompanying the proposed amendment, the Interior Department acknowledged that its enactment virtually insured that the owl would eventually disappear across much of its range. The amendment also proposed to alter the endangered species law by allowing economic considerations to be taken into account when loggers want to cut trees on land that is home to the owl.
Administration officials would not explain why they took all three actions at once, and what message they intended to send. The timing took supporters and critics alike by surprise.
Mark Rey, executive director of the American Forest Resource Alliance, a timber industry group in Washington, said: "What happened today is symbolic of why the act doesn't work. You have to go through all these byzantine procedures and processes to get to the point where you can make a decision which makes little difference."
 
To Die in Congress?
 Democratic leaders said the amendment proposed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to allow timber cutting on two million acres is almost certain to die in Congress after it is introduced next week by Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican of Washington.
"The tragic result of the Lujan plan would be the extinction of the spotted owl over large parts of its range," said Representative Bruce Vento, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-sponsor of a proposal that would ban logging on almost nine million acres.
The plan released in Portland could take effect within 60 days if Congressional legislation is not enacted or it is not challenged in court. The plan was prepared in large part by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a unit of the Interior Department. All Federal agencies are required by the Endangered Species Act to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service if any of their proposed actions would damage the habitat of endangered or threatened species. Putting the plan into action will depend in large part on the Fish and Wildlife Service's allegiance to it, officials at the Interior Department said.
Mr. Lujan said today that he intended to uphold the plan, which he said would cost 32,500 workers their jobs, even as hoped to change the endangered species law with his Congressional proposal. "We can preserve and maintain the owl at less than half the cost in jobs," said Mr. Lujan.
The Endangered Species Act is up for renewal this year, and it is not clear whether it will be strengthened or weakened by Congress.
Environmental leaders argued that Mr. Lujan was vastly overstating the number of jobs that might be lost. They said that automation, the timber industry's move from the Northwest to the South, and changes in how logs are handled -- tens of thousands of trees are exported each year from the Northwest instead of milled into lumber -- contributed to the loss of almost 30,000 jobs in the 1980's. They said neither President Ronald Reagan nor President Bush complained about those lost jobs, nor has the Bush Administration ever estimated how many new jobs would be created in the tourism, fishing, and other industries if the forests were protected.
"What the Administration did today shows a callous disregard for the law and a cynical play for votes," said Jim Owens, a director of the Western Ancient Forest Campaign, an environmental group in Washington.
The Administration's action today followed more than a decade of struggle between the timber industry and environmentalists over the fate of the great forests of spruce, Douglas fir and redwood that once stretched in a green band from Northern California to the Canadian border. From 1960 to 1990, almost four million acres were was logged in Oregon and Washington.
 
A Natural System in Decline?
 Environmental scientists became alarmed, arguing that the biological health of the ecosystem was in decline and that more than 100 species of plants and animals that once lived in abundance in the forests were threatened with extinction. Timber industry employees and executives scoffed at the warnings and contended that the big trees, most of them on Federal ground, were a national resource that supported thousands of families and provided lumber for construction.
In July 1990, the northern spotted owl was designated a threatened species that required the Government to take special action to save its habitat inmillions of acres of old forests. The identification of the owl touched off lawsuits by environmentalists who charged that the Interior Department and the United States Forest Service were not protecting the owl or its habitat.
When court orders in 1991 barred the Government from cutting the timber, timber industry workers, industry executives, and community leaders appealed to the White House for help. Administration officials have previously expressed misgivings about the Endangered Species Act, saying it has been misapplied to block economic development. Not until today, however, has the Administration
taken direct action to weaken the law.
One of the actions today was protested by William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is one of seven members of the Endangered Species Committee, popularly known as the "God Squad" because it has great power over whether a threatened species survives or dies. Mr. Reilly joined with another member, Tom Walsh, the general manager of the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation Disrict in Portland, in voting against exempting the Government.
In voting for the exemption, Mr. Lujan joined Edward R. Madigan, the Secretary of Agriculture, Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council on Economic Advisers, Dr. John A. Knauss, the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Michael P.W. Stone, the Secretary of the Army.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Asks U.S. Congress to Seize 'Historic Moment' and Aid Russia

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev pleaded for economic recovery aid for Russia before the leaders of Congress today, hearing warm personal praise but no guarantee that special help will be forthcoming.
"This is a historic moment and a historic opportunity," the former Soviet leader declared, addressing Senate and House members in a special gathering in Statuary Hall. "It should not be allowed to slip by." 
 With the Administration's aid proposal thus far stalled in the face of considerable opposition and preoccupation with domestic issues, Mr. Gorbachev arrived as something of a revered private citizen intent on some difficult election-year lobbying.
Speaking as the Kremlin leader who helped end the cold war and presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev said Russia would soon face a deepening of its post-Communist crisis as higher energy prices took hold at the most critical point of the democratic and free-market changes being attempted by Moscow.
 
'Most Difficult Stage'
 "We're now at the most difficult stage of these reforms," Mr. Gorbachev said. "In fact, we still haven't reached the bottom of the crisis. The peoples of Russia are courageously bearing up under these burdens."
The shape of long-term Russian-American relations could be at stake in Congress's decision on the need for urgent aid now, he cautioned. He made a particular point of stressing that, for all the cold war polemics, "the Russian people never felt hostility toward the American people."
"When Russia emerges from the present crisis, the national memory will forever remain cognizant of the magnanimity displayed by Americans at this moment of difficulty," Mr. Gorbachev declared after predicting a rich free-market future for Russia and other former Soviet republics, one that he said early allies would best be able to share.
On the eve of his return home from a two-week tour of the United States, Mr. Gorbachev heard himself welcomed warmly by Congressional leaders as a historic figure who had won the faith and affection of the American public in his campaign to achieve large-scale nuclear disarmament and thereby allow his nation to attend to its tattered economy.
But the praise did not immediately translate into votes for the Russian aid proposal that is stalled in Congress. After Mr. Gorbachev's speech, the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, called his plea for aid "impressive." But Mr. Gephardt said: "We're a long way from having the climate to pass it. We have urgent economic needs in the United States."
The Bush Administration proposed participation in a multinational package estimated by proponents at $24 billion in loan guarantees and aid.
The estimated United States share of the package would be $4.35 billion, mostly in increased loan authorizations. It would also offer cash in sharing in a multinational fund totaling $6 billion to help stabilize the ruble. Mr. Gorbachev has been emphasizing the urgent need for this in his American speeches by cautioning that Russia's coming rise in energy prices will likely be the most critical test yet of the ruble's survivability.
There has been little immediate enthusiasm for the aid package in Congress, which is wary of voting aid for foreign countries while constituents at home struggle through an election-year recession. Congressional leaders offered no promises on passage of the aid package after the former Soviet leader's speech.
A crowd of about 400 lawmakers and aides gave Mr. Gorbachev a standing ovation after his speech in which he also predicted ever closer American-Russian relations in an ever more shifting global scene.
Mr. Gorbachev departed Congress for a private White House dinner and other stops, with the measure's fate remaining unclear. In the House, some Democrats have been talking of trying to make it part of a legislative trade-off with the Administration to secure liberalization of unemployment benefits.
Mr. Gorbachev's speaking in the smaller Statuary Hall rather than the main chamber was a reflection of the fact that he no longer has any state power and that Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin will visit here next month and be accorded more elaborate protocol.
Mr. Gorbachev said tonight at a news conference that contrary to upstaging Mr. Yeltsin's appearance, he thought he had contributed to his cause by explaining Russia's needs to the American public. He repeated that he would continue to support his old political rival so long as he is pursuing democratic reform.
Beyond the aid plea, Mr. Gorbachev's address seemed an exercise in his new role as proprietor of the private Gorbachev Fund, for which he has been enlisting affluent American patrons during his tour. His love of speaking on wide-ranging global themes was evident as he presented an overview of his impressions of post-Communist world politics.
He urged Russia and the United States to take special efforts to see that the four republics of the former Soviet Union with long-range nuclear weapons carry out the Soviet-American strategic nuclear disarmament treaty. The danger no longer was in a feared superpower exchange, he said, "but rather that control over these weapons will be lost" to smaller nations.

HEADLINE: Gap Net Rose 11% in Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Gap Inc. said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 11 percent. The company has fared better than many others in the recession, though it has been unable in recent months to match the strong sales rate it had in 1991.
The Gap, based in San Francisco, said its earnings rose to $45.3 million, or 32 cents a share, for the period ended May 2, compared with $40.9 million, or 29 cents a share, in the comparable quarter of 1991. Sales rose 20 percent, to $588.9 million from $490.3 million. 
 The Gap said it was satisfied with the results, especially because its first-quarter profit for 1991 was 93 percent higher than its earnings in the similar 1990 period. But Wall Street, whose support of the Gap has wavered in recent months, was unhappy with the first-quarter results. The Gap's shares lost $3.625 yesterday, to $37.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Some investors bailed out of the Gap's shares after the company said it was unlikely to keep up the pace of sales and earnings growth it had in 1991. The company, known for its moderately priced casual wear, is still considered one of the top retailers by securities analysts, however.
At the end of the latest quarter, the Gap operated 1,236 stores -- 850 Gap, 151 Banana Republic and 235 Gap Kids outlets -- compared with 1,130 last year.

HEADLINE: Filing Is Expected to Affect Banks More Than Property

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Office rents, building prices and bank balance sheets in the United States already reflect such a weak property market that the bankruptcy filing of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. is unlikely to cause much further harm, real estate and banking experts said yesterday.
But the filing is more likely to affect several major New York banks than the area's real estate investors, some experts said. 
 Lawrence J. White, a New York University professor of economics, said he expected the news to damage the prices of bank stocks. "It knocks a big hole in the balance sheets," he said.
But Frank R. DeSantis Jr. a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that the Chemical Banking Corporation and Citicorp had already recognized likely losses on their Olympia & York loans.
"They both absorbed O.& Y. in the first quarter," he said. "Clearly there will be lost interest. But I don't think this is going to be that material."
Citicorp has loaned Olympia & York or its subsidiaries about $500 million, Mr. DeSantis said, and Chemical has loaned about $250 million. J. P. Morgan is also a lender.
"They've been playing hardball," he said, explaining that if the banks feared serious losses from Olympia & York's problems, they would have been far more flexible in negotiations to reorganize the company's debts.
Banking analysts said that Canadian banks, which have extended an estimated $3 billion to Olympia & York, have already suffered far more than their American counterparts. Their shares have fallen sharply as Olympia & York's financial condition worsened, dragging the entire Canadian stock market down.
Had Olympia & York, New York's largest commercial landlord, filed for bankruptcy two years ago, the effects might have been cataclysmic, experts said. But real estate values are already low enough to cushion the impact of the company's fall.
In the United States, meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange has been setting new highs, although New York's commercial real estate has not recovered. Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that in the New York office market, "The disaster was already so widespread that this doesn't hurt much more."

HEADLINE: City Council Gives Horses Freer Rein

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
After intense lobbying by the horse-drawn carriage industry, the City Council voted yesterday to allow carriage drivers to operate their rigs around much of Manhattan and not just through Central Park.
The vote, to amend a 1989 law that restricts the carriages to the park for most of the day, followed months of battling that pitted the tiny carriage industry against animal lovers and those who feared that expansion would create traffic hazards. 
 After the 32-to-18 vote by the Council, aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was leaning toward vetoing the amendment, which would also expand the carriages' hours of operation. To override the veto, the supporters of the amendment would need the votes of two-thirds of the Council, or two votes more than the amendment received yesterday.
 
A Raucous Debate
 In a raucous debate before the vote, Council members invoked George Washington, Edmund Burke and Rodney G. King. They weighed the relative hazards posed by dog and horse droppings. And they scrambled to assert their credentials as lovers of animals, the Irish (who own or drive many of the carriages) and jobs.
Supporters and opponents of the amendment packed the gallery of the Council chamber, cheering their champions and booing and hissing their foes. After the vote, one woman in the gallery stood and stuck her tongue out at the carriage-driver camp.
Several Council members said they hoped that the same energy that went into yesterday's debate would be applied to issues affecting greater numbers of New Yorkers. There are only 68 city-licensed horse carriages in New York City.
The amendment was hotly debated because animal-rights advocates had made it a test of Council members' concerns for animals, while supporters of the amendment contended that the survival of the horse-carriage industry was at stake.
In addition, Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens, suggested that some opponents of the measure were biased against the Irish.
That prompted many Council members to go to great lengths to emphasize their support of the Irish. "I love the Irish," declared Israel Ruiz, a Democrat from the Bronx, once he finished describing how much he liked riding horses. "I have a lot in common with the Irish."
Noach Dear, a Democrat from Brooklyn and a sponsor of the amendment, said that he owed the Irish a great debt because they had supported the founding of the state of Israel. He also confessed that though he did not own a cat or a dog, he was sympathetic to animal-rights causes.
Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said she supported the amendment out of concern for both horses and the carriage drivers' jobs. "If these horses are not working," she said, "they become dog food."
Carriage drivers said they were delighted with the vote. "Tonight I come to work very happy," said John Vallona, a 22-year-old Italian immigrant, as he stood beside his carriage on Central Park South last night.
Patrick McIlroy, an Irish immigrant who was helping harness a horse at the Bicentennial stable on West 37th Street, said, "Business has definitely been hurt, especially with the recession. It doesn't help when you have people trying to take the bread away from your table."
 
More Appeal to Tourists
 The carriage drivers say they can increase their earnings with longer hours and increased areas of operation because this would have more appeal to tourists and others who hire the carriages. To out-of-towners enchanted with the city, to couples enchanted with each other, a ride in a horse-drawn carriage is as much a part of the New York experience as that first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty or that first trip to the top of the Empire State Building.
The lopsided vote surprised both supporters and opponents of the amendment, who were uncertain of the outcome going into yesterday's debate, although it is extremely rare for a bill, once passed by a Council committee, to fail on the floor.
Kathryn E. Freed, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposed the measure, said: "There was a lot of pressure. Some people switched at the last minute." She said Mr. McCaffrey's raising of the Irish issue contributed to the pressure.
Aides to the Mayor did not detail his objections to the amendment. "The bill is under review, but he casts a negative eye toward it at this moment," said Martha Hirst, the Mayor's chief legislative representative. "He's simply saying, 'I'm coming down on the side of restricting the horses.' "
A veto of this amendment would be the Mayor's third, and the first of legislation passed by the expanded City Council.
Horse-drawn carriages are now restricted to Central Park during daytime and forbidden to operate at all during the weekday rush hours of 7 to 10 A.M. and 4 to 7 P.M. They are excluded from midtown from 7 P.M. to midnight.
The amended law would shave an hour off each of the rush periods, forbidding the carriages to operate from 7 to 9 A.M. and from 4:30 to 6:30 P.M., Monday to Friday.
Under the amended law, the carriages could roll throughout Manhattan, with some exceptions: They could not operate from 7 A.M. to 12 midnight between 42d and 23d Streets and Third and Ninth Avenues. On most afternoons and evenings, the carriages would be banned from the area bounded by 42d and 57th Streets and Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue, and from the area bounded by 60th and 65th Streets and Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues.
The 1989 law doubled the fare for a carriage ride to $34 for the first half-hour and $10 for each additional 15 minutes. That fare is unchanged by the Council's vote.
The lopsided vote surprised both supporters and opponents of the amendment, who were uncertain of the outcome going into yesterday's debate, although it is extremely rare for a bill, once passed by a Council committee, to fail on the floor.
Kathryn E. Freed, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposed the measure, said: "There was a lot of pressure. Some people switched at the last minute." She said Mr. McCaffrey's raising of the Irish issue contributed to the pressure, as did what she called lobbying and public-relations efforts by a group called Putting People First.

Carriages are forbidden to operate ouside the park on weekdays from 7 to 9 A.M. and from 4:30 to 6:30 P.M.
 
Carriages may operate throughout Manhattan, with the following exceptions:
 
Between 42d and 23d Streets and Third and Ninth Avenues, carriages are not allowed to operate from 7 A.M. to 12 midnight.
 
Between 42d and 57th Streets and Avenue of the Americas and Eight Avenue, carriages are not allowed to operate ...

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Census Reveals a City of Displacement

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
A grim statistical silhouette of poverty and displacement is emerging from new Census Bureau data, which show the inner-city black population of Los Angeles jostling for living space with a vast inflow of Hispanic and Asian immigrants.
This pattern, occurring across the Los Angeles basin, is strikingly evident in the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles that exploded in violence and flames two weeks ago. 
 Always poor, most of these areas became poorer over the past decade as middle-class and working-class black families fled westward to areas like Inglewood, whose middle-class white residents were in turn moving elsewhere.
 
Poverty and Change
 Since the 1965 riots in the South-Central neighborhood of Watts, the language spoken in the poorest neighborhoods has begun to change from English to Spanish and newly arrived Asians have bought neighborhood commercial establishments.
"If you take the past 27 years, I would challenge you to find any other place of equal poverty that has experienced such dramatic economic and demographic change," said Alan Heslop, a senior research associate at the Rose Institute, a demographic research firm in Los Angeles.
An examination of four census tracts, each of which has 4,000 to 7,500 people, shows that they share one characteristic: swift and overwhelming demographic change. Of the four, three are in neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles that were overtaken by violence on April 29 and 30. The fourth is in Inglewood, a separate municipality bordering South-Central Los Angeles that is home to many middle-class blacks and was less affected by the rioting.
Among the half-million residents of South-Central Los Angeles, one person in three lives in poverty. By contrast, the national poverty rate in 1989, the year covered by the Census figures, was 12.8 percent. Among California's 29.9 million people, the rate was 12.5 percent.
But a pattern found in many major urban areas is duplicated here. As the statisticians focus more closely on the Los Angeles basin, the rate begins to climb: among the 3.5 million residents within the borders of the city of Los Angeles, the poverty rate in 1989 was 18.9 percent.
 
Heavy Immigration
 As poverty became more concentrated in the city, immigrants poured in at such a rate that half the population was bilingual and 38 percent were born outside the country. One Los Angeles resident in five entered the United States in the 1980's; in California as a whole, the comparable rate is one in nine.
Immigration pushed the proportion of the city's Hispanic population from 27.5 percent in 1980 to 40 percent a decade later. During this period, the Asian population nearly doubled, the city's white population increased by 1.3 percent and its black population decreased by 3.5 percent.
The census tracts analyzed below, chosen with the advice of Javier Menjares, a demographer with the Southern California Association of Governments, are not exact microcosms of the communities around them, but they offer clear snapshots of what happens to communities when normally glacial demographic changes surge through like a tornado.
 
The Heart of Koreatown
 Census Tract 2124, where census takers counted just fewer than 7,200 people in 1990, lies north of the Santa Monica Freeway. Five years before the Watts riots, this 72-acre area several miles above the center of the 1965 disturbances was 98 percent white; by 1980, one person in four was Asian, one in three was Hispanic. By 1990, 72 percent of the population of this corner of what is now called Koreatown had been born outside the country. More than half of the current residents are Hispanic; one-third are Asian.
"The areas where Asians have congregated tend to be rental, lower-income," said Leroy Hardy, also a senior research assistant with the Rose Institute. Indeed, nearly 90 percent of the housing units in the census tract are rental.
The unemployment rate for the area, 4.8 percent in 1980, was nearly 10 percent in 1990, compared with 8.4 percent for the city as a whole.
The pattern of school enrollment and educational attainment for the area, however, has not shifted nearly as much as the racial mix. In 1960, when it was a working-class white neighborhood, about 54 percent of the residents above the age of 25 had completed high school; the figure now is 49 percent.
 
Watts
 Between 1960 and 1990, one-third of the black population of Census Tract 2427 left this predominantly black community. From 3,352 blacks in 1960, the tract lost 175 blacks by 1970, 600 more by 1980, and 350 more by 1990.
The shrinking of the black population was the least of the changes. An area whose population was 17.7 percent Hispanic in 1980 took in at least 500 immigrants over the 1980's. An Hispanic population that numbered 565 in 1980 grew to 1,720 people in 1990 -- 45 percent of the population of Census Tract 2427.
Vacant housing, which represented 8.2 percent of the housing stock in 1980, declined to 4 percent in 1990. But the area's economic profile improved only slightly; a 1979 poverty rate of about 45 percent was measured 10 years later at 38 percent.
 
Florence and Normandie
 The intersection where the rioting began April 29 is one of the centers of the decaying sprawl of South-Central Los Angeles, but statistics show it to be better off than many of the surrounding neighborhoods. Relatively speaking, that is. If the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles have a poverty rate of 32.9, this tract stands out with a poverty rate of only 21.4 percent in 1989. That was a marked improvement over 1979, when the rate was nearly 30 percent.
At the same time, more Hispanic people were moving in and the number of people living in each household was increasing. A decade ago, the census tract's population of 6,622 people was 88 percent black; that figure dropped to 73 percent by 1990, while the total population counted dropped to 6,300 in 1990.
Hispanic people, who can be of any race, increased from 10 percent of the population to nearly 28 percent.
In 1980, 29.9 percent of all the households in census tract 2374 were headed by women; 38.2 percent were married-couple households. By 1990, both the percentages had declined slightly; the number of "non-family" households grew.
 
Inglewood

What happened to the black residents who left Watts and Florence-Normandie in the 1980's? While blacks were emptying out of those areas, Inglewood, a middle-class community just west of the city line near South-Central Los Angeles, was losing its white population and gaining black homeowners.
During three decades of metamorphosis, the population of Census Tract 6007 on the border of Inglewood and Los Angeles first contracted, going from 6,540 people in 1960 to 3,904 people in 1980. It then grew to just under 5,000 people in 1990. Three decades ago, 98 percent of the population was white; in 1990, 84 percent of the residents were black.
But over the 1980's, demographic factors reflecting stability all improved as the neighborhood completed its racial transformation. Homeownership peaked in 1990 at 70 percent; in 1960 it had been 62 percent. In 1960, two-thirds of the area's residents had high school diplomas; in 1990, the figure was 87 percent. The poverty rate in 1990 was 6.3 percent, up from 3.8 percent in 1980.

HEADLINE: Subway Felonies Decline In First 3 Months of Year

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Serious crime in New York City's subways continued to decline significantly during the first three months of this year, the transit police reported yesterday.
The police said that felonies declined by 13.9 percent in January, February and March compared with the first three months of 1991. Sharp reductions were recorded in most categories of serious crime, including robberies, assaults and larcenies. 
 The release of the crime figures came the same day that leaders of the transit workers' union announced that the membership had overwhelmingly approved a new contract.
Felonies on the subway have been declining for 18 straight months, the transit police said. In 1991, 15 percent fewer felonies were committed on the subway than in 1990.
 
More Arrests Credited
 Michael F. O'Connor, the transit police chief, contended that more aggressive policing strategies had contributed to the decline in crime. He said that the police were arresting more people and that they were concentrating not only on serious offenses but also on crimes like fare evasion and disorderly conduct.
There are also 700 more transit police officers than there were in January 1990, said Albert W. O'Leary, a transit police spokesman. Because of Mayor David N. Dinkins's Safe Streets, Safe City program, there are now 4,300 transit police officers, compared with 3,600 officers two years ago, Mr. O'Leary said.
Chief O'Connor said the additional officers and the department's aggressive tactics had produced a significant increase in arrests for crimes in the subway system. During the first three months of this year, the transit police arrested 9,443 people, for offenses ranging from homicide to fare evasion. During the first three months of 1990, 5,386 people were arrested for subway crimes.
Between January and March of this year, there were 1,558 robberies in the system, 32 percent fewer than the 2,278 robberies reported during the first three months of 1990, the transit police said. There were 257 assaults between January and March of this year, compared with 335 assaults during the corresponding period in 1990.
There were four rapes and six homicides on the subway during the first three months of this year, compared with six rapes and seven homicides during the comparable period in 1990.
 
Contract Is Approved
 In a related matter, the transit workers' union said New York City's 32,000 subway and bus workers have overwhelmingly approved a new 38-month contract.
The leaders said they believed that the strong support for the pact in the mail balloting, which was conducted over the last two weeks, indicated little backing within the union for a call by a dissident group for a job action during the Democratic Convention in July.
By a vote of 17,147 to 2,507, the transit workers ratified a contract tentatively approved two weeks ago by the union's executive board and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In March, the union's rank and file had rejected a contract proposal by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1.
The reconfigured contract called for a 2 percent raise, retroactive to May 1, 1991, when the last contract expired; a 2.5 percent raise on Sept. 1, and an additional 2 percent raise on May 1, 1993.
The M.T.A. had said previously that the new pact would not increase its labor costs and would not require an increase in the $1.25 bus and subway fare.
The first contract, which was approved by the M.T.A. and the union's board in January, entailed a 4.5 percent increase this year and an additional 2 percent raise next year. It also featured a one-time payment of $1,000 to cover inflation since last May.
Sonny Hall, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, attributed the overwhelming approval of the revised pact to two factors: the removal of the $1,000 payment, which many workers had opposed because it would not be used in the calculation of future raises and pension benefits, and a better effort by union leaders in selling the package to the membership.
 
A Different Choice
 But union leaders also probably influenced the outcome of the vote by changing its terms. In the first vote, in March, the leaders asked members whether they approved or disapproved of the contract. This time, the leaders offered a different choice: members were told to choose between the revised contract or binding arbitration.
One of the union's dissident groups, called New Directions, had advised members to take neither choice and instead to write in "none of the above." Mr. Hall said that only 23 such write-in votes were cast.
"We're pleased as punch," Mr. Hall said of the results.
"It just shows that transit workers can disagree with leadership," he said, "but that when leadership sits down and debates with them, they can listen and respond."
Mr. Hall had contended for months that the contract was the best he could obtain in the midst of a severe recession. After the members rejected the first proposal, the union's medical benefits fund came close to bankruptcy. Mr. Hall had threatened to call a strike if his members lost some medical coverage, although he never specified when he would ask workers to walk off their jobs.
Approval of the revised contract means that members will retain existing health benefits, union and transit officials said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Challenger;
Clinton Offers National Education Plan

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 14

 BODY:
Saying that the struggle to improve economic and social conditions in America has been impaired by failing to make education a top priority, Gov. Bill Clinton today called for a renewed commitment to schools and job training.
In a speech delivered at a distressed public college in East Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton outlined an education plan that called for Federal college tuition assistance, job training for high school dropouts and graduates who choose not to go on to college and legislation that would allow parents to choose which public school their children will attend. 
 "We know we have real gaps in American education," he said. "Opportunity gaps and responsibility gaps which are more important to our national security today than the missile gap that played such an important role in the Presidential election of 1960.
"The education opportunity gaps between ourselves and the rest of the world and among our own people are immense."
 
New National Goals
 Mr. Clinton said his administration would set new education goals, including a plan to increase high school graduation rates to 90 percent of enrolled students, "meaningful" national examination standards for students and teachers and increased Federal spending on programs to reduce class size and expand preschool opportunities.
His remarks today, which were essentially a repackaged version of the education speech he has delivered at schools and colleges throughout the country this year, featured sharp partisan attacks on President Bush.
As has become Mr. Clinton's habit in the weeks since he began transforming his campaign into a general election effort aimed at stressing the failures of White House policy, he faulted the Administration for not living up to promises Mr. Bush made as a candidate in 1988 and during an education summit with governor's in 1989.
"America needs an education President who shows up for class every day, not just once every four years," he said. Mr. Bush, he said, has cut funding for bilingual education, job training, literacy programs and college aid.
"The President's education plan amounts to a form of trickle-down education that won't help America anymore than trickle-down economics has helped us in the 1980's," he said.
Mr. Clinton's speech was received warmly by the audience of several hundred students and administrators at East Los Angeles College, a two-year school where recent tuition increases made the audience especially receptive to his assistance proposal.
Mr. Clinton also used the opportunity to link his education proposals to the problems of inner-city crime that have preoccupied elected officials and California voters since the Los Angeles riots.
Recalling a 1989 visit he made to a South-Central Los Angeles school, the Arkansas governor said the students he talked to then "were most worried about being shot going to and from school."
"Those kids are now in ninth grade," he said. "I have often wondered in the last few days, after what happened here, how many of them wound up in gangs, whether they looted, whether they're still alive. . . . We need to make something of the lives we're wasting."
 
Tuition Plan Is Popular
 Mr. Clinton's most popular proposal, judging by the applause he typically gets from audiences around the country, is a plan to replace the existing Federal student loan programs with a program that would allow any student to borrow money for college if the student promised to repay the loan either by committing to pay a small percentage of income over a period of time or by agreeing to join a national service program as a teacher, police officer or other public servant for reduced pay.
Such a plan, his aides have estimated, would cost about $8 billion by its fourth year. Mr. Clinton has said he would pay for this and other priority programs -- including health care and deficit reduction -- by instituting cost controls and trimming defense spending.
Mr. Clinton drew heavily upon his experience as governor of Arkansas and parent of a 12-year-old public school student to illustrate his commitment to improving education. Recalling his own education, he said he had used loans and scholarships and had worked six jobs to go to college and law school.
"What bothers me so much about America today is that there are so many people who are being left out of that opportunity channel," he said.
Mr. Clinton repeated his call for allowing parents to choose the public schools their children should attend, an approach he has championed in Arkansas. But he said he "unalterably opposed" the proposal favored by the Bush Administration that would allow parents to use vouchers to send their students to private schools if they wished.
 
A Bad Time for Cuts
 "Now is not the time to further diminish the financial resources of schools when budgets are being slashed by states all across America," Mr. Clinton said, "when the Federal Government has restricted its commitment to education."
Mr. Clinton has delivered formal speeches on foreign affairs, economic policy and the environment to stress the substantive differences between his campaign and the President's and to try to put behind him the constant discussion of character questions that had dominated his campaign.
He said he did not want to spend the bulk of his speech today blaming Republican administrations for the failures in education. But in the end, he was unable to resist taking repeated aim at President Bush, who declared during the 1988 campaign that he would be the "education President."
Of his own education reform package, Mr. Clinton said: "I'll work day and night to get it passed, unlike our current President, who often proposes and then leaves it to someone else to dispose or not to act at all."

HEADLINE: Jackson Journal;
Again, Hope Fails at a Shopping Mall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., May 14

 BODY:
When the Jackson Mall first opened more than 20 years ago, it was the most celebrated monument to retailing in Mississippi. Shoppers from as far as Alabama and Louisiana flocked here to the department stores and trendy boutiques of what was then the largest mall within a 400-mile radius.
But today the 53-acre mall, in what is now the city's black community, is mostly shuttered, its vast parking lot empty, a symbol of the decay that plagues the nation's inner cities. A plan that would have converted at least a part of the Jackson Mall to industrial use recently collapsed amid a debate that had economic, political and racial overtones, and that, to many, underscored this community's deep racial polarization. 
 As larger malls developed in more affluent sections of the city, the Jackson Mall slowly died. By the mid-1980's, the major anchors, J. C. Penney Company, Woolco and Gayfers department stores, pulled out. The smaller retailers quickly followed.
Last fall, Thomas H. Espy, an entrepreneur whose past ventures had ranged from funeral homes to a company that made grass seed pellets for cattle, announced plans to convert the mall's old Woolco store into a latex-glove plant. Mr. Espy, the 47-year-old brother of Representative Michael Espy of Mississippi, said the plant would employ more than 200 workers within two years and pay an average of $7.40 an hour. Mr. Espy had raised $3.3 million of the $7 million start-up cost.
But the Hinds County Board of Supervisors, by a 3-to-2 vote along racial lines, overturned a bond issue that had been approved by a previous board. The three white supervisors opposed to the bonds said the county had no business guaranteeing start-up ventures with taxpayer money.
Mr. Espy, who is black, said the board was too blinded by his color to help create decent jobs in this economically troubled part of a county.
"I feel I'm the victim of discrimination," he said. "And I believe that if I had been a white businessman the factory would have been open for business by now."
Mr. Espy was not alone in bemoaning a missed opportunity. The Jackson Redevelopment Authority, the city's urban renewal agency, had predicted the plant would have attracted more business to the site.
"Other companies were responding when they thought the glove factory would be set up at the mall," said Lloyd Montgomery, director of the agency. "For a moment it had sparked something, and people seemed to be interested in moving their projects to the mall."
But Hershel Wilbourn, a supervisor at the time of the vote earlier this year, said the plan was rejected because, "we didn't feel we could obligate taxpayers that way."
Mr. Wilbourn said the bond issue "isn't about race at all," but rather about "trying to make sensible economic policy."
But many blacks here say the county board has often given tax breaks and other incentives to business ventures. "The fact of the matter is that race plays a prominent role in the affairs of this city," said James Covington, president of the Central Mississippi Minority Business Development District. "In this case it is keeping the city from going forward."
Mr. Espy said he plans to pursue his project 90 miles north in Grenada, Miss., where he said local authorities are pursuing a similar bond issue. As for Jackson, he said: "I did everything I thought I was supposed to do. I raised the money. I did the paperwork. I jumped through all the hoops. If I, the brother of a United States Congressman, can't get this done, what chance does the average black businessman have?"

HEADLINE: Dinkins Set To Lift Curbs On Pretoria

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that at the request of Nelson Mandela, New York City is prepared to lift sanctions against South Africa, provided that the country establishes an interim government that will draft a new constitution for a new nonracial Government.
Mr. Dinkins's announcement, which came after a mayoral delegation returned Wednesday from a three-day trip to South Africa, gives support to the African National Congress at a time when it is holding talks over the setting up of such an interim government. And it allows the Mayor to try to address business executives who have been pressing him to lift the sanctions, which prohibit the city from contracting with companies that do business in South Africa. 
 Mr. Dinkins insisted yesterday that he did not send the delegation to South Africa to allay concerns of local business interests. He said the A.N.C., of which Mr. Mandela is president, had asked New York City to go to South Africa to clarify its position on sanctions now that an interim government appeared to be at hand.
Yesterday Mr. Dinkins made public a letter that the delegation brought back with it, in which Mr. Mandela said that as soon as the interim government was established, "we will issue a call to you and other heads of government who have helped our cause to assist in building our economy."
"We have much in common," he added. "It is for this reason that we invited you to send a delegation to meet with us during this critical period to discuss reintroduction of trade and investment from the people and corporations in your city as soon as we have an interim government."
 
Lynch Explains Invitation
 Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who led the delegation, said yesterday that the A.N.C. had issued its invitation to insure that there would be no delay in the lifting of sanctions once the A.N.C. requested it. New York is one of more than 130 American cities that have maintained sanctions despite the lifting of Federal embargoes by the Bush Administration. Because the city's sanctions are the strictest in the country, any decision to lift them is expected to be followed by other governments.
Mr. Lynch said: "Once the interim government is established, the A.N.C. will be a part of it and that government will have to deliver something to the people in terms of economic help, so there cannot be any delay in lifting sanctions and that's why they asked us there to confirm our position."
Donna Katzin, director of South Africa and International Justice Programs for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, agreed. "There will be great expectations for the new government and the economic aid provided by the lifting of sanctions will be vital," she said.
Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that he would ask the City Council and city pension systems to end all current sanctions on doing business in South Africa, except those that apply to munitions and weapons-making companies. Those would be retained until the South African military and police forces were brought under the control of the people, the Mayor said.
 
Holtzman Has a Reservation
 City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, who as a trustee of the city's pension funds has a vote on whether to end sanctions, said in a statement yesterday that she believed they should not be lifted until there was one person, one vote in South Africa. But Ms. Holtzman said that "if the A.N.C. signals that it wants the lifting of sanctions when an interim government of national unity is installed, then I will give very careful consideration to such a proposal." The city, which controls $43 billion in pension funds, has avoided investing them in companies doing business in South Africa.

HEADLINE: Businesses' Inventories And Sales Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Businesses increased their sales by five-tenths of 1 percent in March, the Government said today. But they also built up their inventories by four-tenths of 1 percent, which puzzled some analysts.
If the stockpiling was voluntary, it could reflect optimism over the economy by businesses replenishing their shelves. But if it was involuntary, it could mean a lack of customers, causing goods to pile up. 
 'It's either very good news or very bad news," said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities in New York. "If firms are confident about the future, if they believe the new surge in consumer buying is for real, then it is a good sign.
"But if firms misgauged demand and wound up with inventories they didn't really want," he added, "then this is going to force cutbacks in production and either push us back into recession or keep the recovery very weak."
 
Key Ratio Unchanged
 The inventory-to-sales ratio in March was 1.49, unchanged from February but down from 1.51 in January. The ratio means it would take 1.49 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the March sales pace.
The Commerce Department said business sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $547.9 billion, although the pace was slower than the 1.5 percent advance in February, when sales increased to $545.4 billion. Sales last fell in December.
But inventories crept up to a seasonally adjusted $816.3 billion after remaining unchanged in February. Businesses let their stockpiles fall in January after a four-month buildup.
Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Fuji Securities in Chicago, said the inventories-to-sales ratio at 1.49 was "still relatively low." Fuji economists have said the ratio jumped to 1.74 during the last recession in 1981 and 1982.
The Commerce Department said sales by both manufacturers and wholesalers rose in March -- up nine-tenths of 1 percent at factories and 1.3 percent at the intermediate level -- but retail sales slumped 1 percent.
Still, the department reported on Wednesday that retail sales apparently bounced back nine-tenths of 1 percent in April.

HEADLINE: The Prime of 'Wall Street East';
A Renaissance May End Downtown Brooklyn's Dark Ages

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The time passed long ago when the streets of downtown Brooklyn bustled with trolleys and elevated trains, when the Dodgers had their business office at Montague and Court Streets and when Brooklynites, in fedoras and white gloves, swarmed the penny arcades, stately theaters and grand old department stores like Namm's and Frederick Loeser's.
But now, after decades of deterioration turned it into a gritty, fading remnant of itself, downtown Brooklyn has regained a bit of the verve that, to some, once made it the center of the center of the world.
 
A New Business Hub
 
 Even as New York City reels from a recession that has stalled projects and left an office glut in Manhattan, a flurry of construction projects -- worth $2.5 billion in all -- has given downtown Brooklyn a revived identity as the city's third business hub, after Wall Street and midtown Manhattan.
Modern towers have etched new pinnacles in the borough's aging skyline, and stores and restaurants have opened in the canyons below. The streets rattle with new construction and stir with thousands of new workers. Amid the shabby shops, dilapidated buildings and rubbly lots that remain, downtown Brooklyn has begun to assume a sleek corporate air.
"When they told me I was coming to this store, I thought, 'Huh, Brooklyn,' " said Paul Hinksman, manager of the Au Bon Pain restaurant that opened this month in MetroTech. "I didn't expect this. It's almost Manhattanish."
In a borough that has always struggled under the long shadows from across the East River, the redevelopment, anchored by MetroTech, a $1 billion commercial and academic complex, has been heralded as nothing short of a renaissance.
As Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said, "The dream of a whole new downtown is being created."
 
Weighing the Costs
 While few people oppose the revival, it raises many of the issues that have confronted cities across the country as they try to address changes in industry and manufacturing and stanch the flow of corporations to the suburbs.
Some people wonder if the revival's costs, in tax abatements and other incentives from the city, have been too high. The city has spent $166 million in capital improvements in the downtown area since the mid-80's, and MetroTech incentives alone were $329 million.
Others fear that the influx of new workers will increase congestion. And there is worry that a polished corporate downtown, with all its new jobs, might leave the rest of the borough behind.
"You do have to ask the question of who benefits from this," said John H. Mollenkopf, a professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center who has studied the politics of urban renewal. "What is the benefit to the Farragut Houses, right next door? What is the benefit to Fort Greene? Are there going to be positive impacts on the neighborhoods around it or is it just a commercial enterprise?"
 
An Alternative to New Jersey
 The budding new downtown was conceived a decade ago to not only to revive a beleaguered area, but to create an alternative for corporations thinking of moving back-office operations to New Jersey or Connecticut or beyond.
With its proximity to Manhattan, its confluence of transportation links and its cheaper costs, downtown Brooklyn -- bounded loosely by the approaches to the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, and Atlantic Avenue and Court Street -- was in many ways a natural location for a new hub.
But the projects' developers and borough officials, backed by City Hall and a 1983 study by the Regional Plan Association, envisioned something even greater. They dreamed of creating a high-technology center for financial and information services that would rival Silicon Valley in California -- one that could even lure foreign investment.
The nucleus of this new downtown -- called "Wall Street East" in radio commercials produced by the Brooklyn Union Gas Company -- has been MetroTech, a four-million-square-foot project created by a partnership between the city's Economic Development Corporation, Polytechnic University and a developer, the Forest City Ratner Companies.
It is far too early to tell how successful the redevelopment will be, but after years of fits and starts caused by resistance and litigation, uncertainty and recession, results have begun to appear.
In 1989, Morgan Stanley & Company moved into 19-story Pierrepont Plaza, the first office tower built in Brooklyn since the 1950's.
A year later, the Securities Industry Automation Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York and American Stock Exchange, moved its headquarters into the first new building in MetroTech.
In 1991, Livingston Plaza, a 12-story, 500,000-square-foot building, opened and is now the headquarters of the New York City Transit Authority.
Since then, three more buildings have opened in MetroTech, including Polytechnic's $42 million library and research center in January and a 23-story tower that in February became the new headquarters for the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.
Chase Manhattan Bank, lured to choose Brooklyn over New Jersey by a $234 million incentive package, the city's largest ever, has begun moving the first of 6,000 workers into one of the two buildings it will occupy there.
 
More Projects in Works
 Even as the Manhattan real estate boom of the 1980's has gone bust, with vacancy rates in midtown hovering between 15 percent and 20 percent, 95 percent of MetroTech has been leased. And in recent months, two other major projects have received big boosts.
The Brooklyn District Attorney's office announced in February that it would be the anchor tenant in Renaissance Plaza, a 31-story office tower with a Hilton Hotel as its base. For many, the Hilton, downtown Brooklyn's first major hotel to open since the 1930's, will be the final validation of Brooklyn as a business and commercial center.
And last month, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced that he would spend $7.8 million to jump-start Atlantic Center, an interminably stalled $530 million retail and housing development on top of the Long Island Rail Road Terminal at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues.
"It's like a tidal wave," the Borough President, Howard Golden, said. "It just took off, and it has not stopped yet."
In all, the $2.5 billion being invested in redevelopment is going to about five million square feet of new office space that has already drawn 5,000 new workers to downtown Brooklyn. By the end of the decade, officials predict, there will be 30,000.
 
'Spillover' Effect Seen
 While the developments may never return downtown Brooklyn to its former eminence, they have begun to transform it.
The streets around MetroTech are cleaner, and the new workers keep them bustling through the day and into the evening. In the 84th Precinct, which covers the downtown area as well as Brooklyn Heights, felony crimes, including robbery and assault, fell 23 percent from 1989 to 1991 -- a decline Deputy Inspector Jeremiah Quinlan attributed to the vastly greater number of people.
As boosters and developers have always predicted, the large developments have had a spillover effect on nearby downtown businesses. Several new shops have opened along Willoughby Street and in Fulton Mall, the sometimes struggling shopping strip just south of MetroTech, and others have spruced up their stores.
Moreover, Mr. Golden said he would allocate $500,000 in his borough budget for the new fiscal year to install scores of colorful, stranger-friendly road and street signs (which James Gardella, an aide to Mr. Golden, called "an antidote to the saying that 'only the dead know Brooklyn' ").
While the costs of the redevelopment have been high, City Hall contends the benefits of keeping companies like Chase far outweigh them. But a mayoral task force committee recently criticized the city for devoting nearly three-quarters of its capital budgets for economic development in the city to downtown Brooklyn while Manhattan's offices stand empty.
In the neighborhoods around downtown Brooklyn, the redevelopment has raised different concerns.
Carol Locke, an English teacher who lives in Boerum Hill, said the new towers, with their sleek corporate look, have made the area overly dense and replaced or overwhelmed many older buildings, which had given the downtown a certain historic romance.
"There's not too much to be romantic over anymore," Ms. Locke said.
She and other residents also fear that the projects will drive up rents and property costs and that the influx of workers will further congest the streets and overwhelm the subways and buses.
Residents' biggest concern, though, is that downtown Brooklyn will become an isolated bubble, shut off from the rest of the borough.
In part to avert such criticism and in part to satisfy the agreements they struck to win incentives from the city, the newly arrived companies have proposed job-training, work and scholarship programs for Brooklyn students.
"We want to go beyond the look of the area," said John V. Scicutella, the vice president of operations and systems for Chase, which, when it completes its move to MetroTech will become the borough's largest private employer. "We want to get to the guts of it."

HEADLINE: New Claims For Jobless Benefits Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 10,000, to 424,000, in the week that ended on May 2, the Labor Department said today, reflecting the fragile state of the economic recovery.
The running four-week average of new filings -- viewed as a more accurate gauge of the labor market -- also rose for the first time since late March, to 411,500 from 409,500. 
 Economists said the figures were disappointing, since they had expected initial weekly jobless claims to fall to 410,000 in the latest reporting week.
"I think these numbers tell us we have a fragile recovery at best in the works," said Anthony Chan, senior economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc. He said the rise in the four-week average was "consistent with the inflation data."
"It's telling us the recovery is subdued," Mr. Chan said. "It's not a gung-ho recovery."
 
Stocks Decline on the News
 The stock market declined broadly after the report, as investors apparently reached the same conclusion. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.10 points, to 3,368.88, and declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The report also influenced the credit markets in early trading, sending prices of most securities up, because a slack economy would give the Federal Reserve room to ease credit further. But traders were more restrained later, because analysts tended to minimize the report's significance, saying it had been distorted by the Los Angeles riots. [Page D15.]
The Labor Department said it had revised its figure for initial claims in the week that ended on April 25 downward to 414,000 from the 415,000 reported previously.
It said the biggest increases in new claims in the week that ended on May 2 had been reported by North Carolina, New York and California. California said its unemployment claims had risen to 3,475, partly because its offices were closed for one day the week before.
The jobless situation may have been even worse than the report showed, because California also estimated that 2,600 people would have claimed jobless benefits in its 13 local offices in South-Central Los Angeles, but were unable to do so because the offices were closed for two days during the riots.
 
Fed Official Disappointed
 Lawrence Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve, told reporters before addressing a House Banking subcommittee that he found the report on jobless claims disappointing.
The Labor Department said North Carolina, with 5,578 new claims, had cited layoffs in its textile, apparel and furniture industries. New York cited service industry layoffs that contributed to its 4,954 new jobless claims. Michigan said its 2,485 new jobless claims resulted from layoffs in the auto industry.
Officials in Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey and Wisconsin reported decreases of more than 3,000 in new jobless claims.
The department said 14 states had reported increases, 37 declines and 2 no change.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 23.10, to 3,368.88, on Jobless Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market declined broadly yesterday after the Government reported yet another rise in initial claims for unemployment benefits.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.10 points, to 3,368.88.
Declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,180 to 549 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Volume on the Big Board came to 200.4 million shares, up from 175.9 million in the previous session.
 
Expecting Slow Recovery
 The market reflected expectations for a slow economic recovery. Recent economic data show little threat from inflation, which should help stocks, but offer little hope for enough economic growth to stimulate investors.
Reaffirming that sentiment, the Labor Department said yesterday that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose to 424,000 for the week ending May 2. It was the second straight weekly rise. Some economists had forecast claims at 410,000, down from 415,000 in the previous week.
In addition, many investors were apparently putting off buying stocks, speculating that the Federal Reserve might ease rates again as insurance against a backslide in the economy. Such a cut could help stock prices.
Another negative for the market is that while the Dow set a record closing high of 3,397.58 on Monday, it only briefly passed the 3,400 mark. And other, broader market indexes have not matched the Dow's performance, which adds to the downward pull, market analysts said.
 
Gains for Inventories
 Even the good news of better-than-expected business inventories did not support the market. The Commerce Department said yesterday that inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent, above the one-tenth of 1 percent that economists had forecast.
The Nasdaq composite index slid 5.92 points, to 576.46. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.72 points, to 227.72, while the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.96 points, to 391.79.
The most actively traded issue on the Big Board was Advanced Micro Devices, down 1 7/8, to 15 5/8, after a rival company said it would cut prices on an advanced computer chip.
Other active issues included the Gap, down 3 5/8, to 37 1/4, after analysts lowered the company's 1993 earnings estimates, and the Limited, down 1 1/8, to 21, on poor earnings, released earlier this week.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
A small claim turns into a brouhaha over welfare, individual rights and judicial freedom.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
The fight between Judge Eugene Kenny and Debbie Rivera began in a Jersey City courtroom. Then it went before the state's Chief Justice, Robert N. Wilentz. From there it moved to the airwaves, to the newsstands and to the supermarket checkout counter. Now it is once more back in court, this time in Newark.
Along the way, a small claim against a Union City check-cashing store has grown into an allegory about welfare, individual responsibility and judicial freedom. Ms. Rivera, a 27-year-old unwed, unemployed mother of three, has become a symbol of the underclass. And Judge Kenny, who spent his long legal career in obscurity, has become a folk hero -- first in New Jersey and now through the unlikely auspices of The National Enquirer, thoughout the country. 
 Round 1 of the case took place in March 1991, when Ms. Rivera appeared before Judge Kenny in the small claims section of Hudson County Superior Court. She said she had been shortchanged $340 when cashing her welfare check, and that unless things were righted, she and her children faced eviction.
The 76-year-old Judge Kenny, who had retired six years earlier but was recalled to help reduce court backlogs, ruled against Ms. Rivera. But he did not stop there. Instead, for the next five minutes he lambasted her: for having children out of wedlock to increase her welfare payments, for not holding down a job, for living off the largesse of state taxpayers. "People are being inundated around here, taking care of all these children," he said, reducing Ms. Rivera repeatedly to tears. "Money doesn't come out of the sky, does it? I'm getting fed up with it. A great many people are fed up with it, too."
"It was humiliating," Ms. Rivera recalled. "I've never gone through anything like that in my life." So she began Round 2, filing a complaint with court officials. When Judge Kenny refused to apologize, and after hearing a tape recording of the hearing, Chief Justice Wilentz directed that Judge Kenny be re-retired. That brought a howl from Judge Kenny.
"One of the great evils of the Age in which we live is the lack of Spine in those in authority," he wrote. "Are the Judges of New Jersey to be nothing but a collection of Wimps and Caspar Milquetoasts?"
In an interview, Judge Kenny stressed that he bore Chief Justice Wilentz no ill will. "He snatched me from obscurity and made me famous," he said. "But all you have to do is mention the word 'racism' and they go into orbit mentally."
For Judge Kenny, such interviews have become a way of life. In Rounds 3 through 6 he spoke to The New Jersey Law Journal, The Star-Ledger of Newark, The Record of Hackensack and the Asbury Park Press. In 7 through 21 he appeared on 14 television and radio talk shows, sometimes jointly with Ms. Rivera. His rhetoric got hotter. "Here's a woman who would climb into bed with anybody with a pair of pants on and have kids; she's good for another five or six," he told one questioner.
Judge Kenny has been blessed with all the blue ribbons of celebrity. People stop him on the street. Oprah called. He got a death threat. He has received a scrapbook full of letters, calling him a breath of fresh air, touting him for the Supreme Court.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, for verbalizing what millions of people feel in their hearts," wrote Willard Andrews of Franklin Lakes, N.J. Another note came from Mrs. Henri Bendel. "Someone finally spoke out," she wrote from Sutton Place South. "Thanks. Hope you don't have to pay too great a price." A third letter was perhaps most representative. "I am 100 percent in agreement with your position on Debbie Rivera," this man said. "Chief Justice Wilentz has rocks in his head."
Then, in May 1991, The National Enquirer came calling. Judge Kenny, a Reagan Republican who still likes his Masses in Latin, is not your everyday National Enquirer reader. "I used to laugh when I saw their headlines -- 'ELVIS FOUND ON THE MOON,' " he said. But when an Enquirer reporter asked, he vented his spleen still more. His splenetic comments were promptly repackaged into a first-person article, replete with terms like "free ride," "lazy," "deadbeats" and "leeches."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Calls for Federal Effort To Contain Health-Care Costs

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In an address aimed as much at the Presidential candidates as at the medical school graduates sitting before him, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo yesterday called on the Federal Government to contain health-care costs and provide universal medical insurance.
At a Carnegie Hall ceremony, he told graduating members of the New York University School of Medicine's class of 1992 that the nation's poor, elderly and unemployed would never receive adequate health care unless the Government intervened. "Even if they did all New York State is doing, states acting alone could not tame the health-care monster," he said. "It is no longer a question of choice. We must have a national plan." 
 In a speech thin on details, Mr. Cuomo made clear he was primarily concerned with outlining issues he would like the Presidential candidates to address this summer.
 
Agenda for Debates
 But aides said Mr. Cuomo was also trying to set the agenda for coming Albany debates on health-care policy. In January the Cuomo administration plans to propose a package of bills to expand primary care for the urban and rural poor, said Michael J. Dowling, the state's director of health, education and human services.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Cuomo said the Federal Government could control medical costs by capping health-care charges, just as New York State sets top rates hospitals can charge for most services.
In addition, costs could be contained by simplifying and computerizing billing systems and by avoiding "excessive" use of expensive advanced technologies, he said.
Accusing private health insurance companies of denying coverage to "poor people who get poor-people diseases," he said the Federal Government should provide insurance to anyone who could not get it otherwise.
Mr. Cuomo urged the graduates to consider careers as general practitioners in inner-city and rural areas instead of training to be specialists. "Reform will happen with or without the support of the doctors," he said. "But reform of the system won't work as well as it could unless you, the doctors, are actively involved."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Easing Is Seen as Less Likely

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mostly lower in slow trading yesterday, as chances faded for any reduction soon in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board.
The reason the market shifted its opinion about an imminent Fed move was a report late yesterday showing that money growth surged in the week ended May 4. 
 The report, issued by the Fed, showed that all three monetary aggregates posted big increases. The money measure that the Fed tracks most closely, M-2, rose by $9.8 billion, reversing declines recorded over the previous two weeks.
With the latest rise, M-2 growth is now back above the 2.5 percent level, which is the low end of the Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent for the year.
Traders and Fed watchers have been paying close attention to the weekly money numbers recently, largely because last month the Fed cited weak money growth as the reason for its most recent cut in short-term interest rates.
 
No Easing Seen Before June
 Yesterday's spurt in money growth "eliminates the possibility of any easing before early June," said David M. Jones, a senior vice president and economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, primary dealers in government securities.
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on Tuesday. While an immediate move to cut rates now seems unlikely, Mr. Jones and other analysts expect that at the meeting the committee will give the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, the leeway to cut rates further, should conditions warrant.
"The F.O.M.C. will give Greenspan the discretion to ease," predicted Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. That is particularly likely, Mr. Liro said, if money growth falls below its target levels again or fresh evidence emerges that the economy is fading.
Mr. Jones added, "The fear the Fed has is that if they don't keep money within their target range, it raises the possibility that the economy will go into another sinking spell, as it did last year."
 
Signal on Federal Funds Rate
 The Fed, whose open market operations on Wednesday heightened speculation that the central bank may be on the verge of lowering short-term rates, did nothing yesterday to encourage such thinking.
Instead, analysts said the Fed sent a strong signal that its target for the overnight Federal funds rate remained at 3.75 percent: the central bank added reserves to the banking system when the Federal funds rate was trading at 3.8125 percent.
"The Fed clearly indicated that funds are still at 3.75 percent," one trader said. "If anybody doubted it before, they shouldn't any more."
Despite the Fed's signal, expections during most of the session remained strong that the Fed would move soon to cut short-term rates. Traders said that demand for shorter-term notes and bills was strong for most of the day.
But price gains that had been in place were wiped out after the money-supply figures were released.
During early trading, prices of most securities were somewhat bolstered by an unexpected rise in initial unemployment claims during the week ended May 2. The increase was the second in succession, but analysts tended to downplay its significance because of the riots in Los Angeles.
Indeed, Mr. Liro and others said the effect of the riots on claims data would probably make interpretation of those figures difficult for the next several weeks.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10117/32 , down 9/32 , to yield 7.86 percent, compared with 7.84 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 1012/32 , down 5/32 , to yield 7.34 percent. The 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 101, down 2/32 , to yield 6.63 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, up 1/32 , to yield 5.10 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged late yesterday, after being lower for much of the session.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.58 percent in late trading, unchanged from Wednesday. And six-month bill rates were also unchanged, at a late rate of 3.68 percent.
In the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said activity was light and prices of most issues were unchanged.

Tax Credits of $8.5 Billion Received by 22 Drug Makers

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The General Accounting Office said yesterday that 22 American drug makers received $8.5 billion in Federal tax credits in the 1980's under a plan designed to increase employment in Puerto Rico. But, the report said, the tax credits were more than double the amount the companies spent on employee payrolls in Puerto Rico.
The report by the Congressional agency, in addition to raising questions about the wisdom of the tax-credit program or its application, is expected to add fuel to Congressional attempts to limit the steep increases that have been made in recent years in prices of prescription drugs. A tax credit exempts business income from taxation. 
 The G.A.O. said the pharmaceutical companies received an average of $70,788 in credits per employee in Puerto Rico in 1987, for example, compared with an average of $10,593 granted other industries. The reason is that other companies hire more employees in proportion to the tax credit. The average credit per employee in the electrical and electronics industries, for example, was $16,450, the report said.
 
Proposal to Reduce the Credit
 Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, and Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, said the report provided a clear illustration of the validity of their proposal to reduce the Puerto Rican tax credit for companies that raise drug prices faster than the general inflation rate. Prescription drug prices rose by 3 percent in the first quarter of 1992, while the Consumer Price Index rose 1 percent, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said the Pryor bill would "change free-market incentives that have caused the pharmaceutical industry to flourish." The tax credits, he added, "have provided a powerful stimulus" for Puerto Rican development, which has benefited both the island's economy and the mainland's.
Spokesmen for the drug industry did not dispute the numbers in the report, but they said that the picture was incomplete and that the tax credits had helped the Puerto Rican economy as Congress intended. They said the G.A.O. analysis had omitted an estimated 4.7 additional jobs per employee, which the drug makers said were indirectly supported by pharmaceutical industry spending.
 
Johnson & Johnson Leads List
 The G.A.O. report said that Johnson & Johnson had the largest tax savings, an estimated $1.12 billion in credits for the 10 years. SmithKline Beecham was next with $987 million, followed by Abbott Laboratories, $860 million; Pfizer, $759 million; Upjohn $750 million, and Merck $749 million.
It added that Pfizer, with 500 employees in Puerto Rico, had tax savings of $156,400 per employee in 1989, followed by Merck, 953 employees and $110,493 per worker in credits; American Home Products, 1,000 employees and $80,600 per worker; Eastman Kodak's Sterling Drug unit, 350 employees and $77,143 per worker; Bristol-Myers Squibb, 1,440 employees and $74,097 per worker, and Upjohn, 775 employees and $58,452 per worker.
"This G.A.O. report proves that we squander billions of precious tax dollars on an industry which needs little help from the Federal Government," Senator Pryor said, citing 11 years of strong profits in pharmaceuticals. Senator Cohen said the Puerto Rican investment credit "has become a tax incentive that rewards the spiraling escalation of drug prices."
 
Effort for the Pryor Bill
 Mr. Pryor, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, and Mr. Cohen, the ranking Republican on the committee, plan to press for approval of the Pryor bill, committee aides said. The Senate voted in March against passing the measure as an amendment to the tax bill.
Commenting on the G.A.O. report, Pfizer said it now "employs over 700 people in Puerto Rico, and for each one of these employees it is estimated that four additional jobs have been created." Pfizer said its average payroll cost per employee was about $41,000, including nonstaff employees. The company added that it had invested $90 million in Puerto Rico in the last three years.
Merck said that in addition to its 950 employees in Puerto Rico, it had 400 contract workers there, so the average tax credit per employee would be $86,000, not $110,493.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rebounds as Traders Focus on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded yesterday against most major currencies in light trading as the markets continued to focus on the outlook for interest rates.
Gold prices ended higher after rising overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338 a troy ounce, up $2.40 from Wednesday's close. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $337.35 an ounce, up $1.75. 
 Currency traders said technical factors were largely responsible for giving a slight boost to the dollar after Wednesday's selloff. But they said the markets remained concerned about the state of the nation's money supply and the interest rate outlook here and in Germany.
 
Rise in Money Supply Reported
 After the close of most currency trading yesterday, the Federal Reserve reported that the money supply had risen a larger-than-expected $10.5 billion during the week that ended on April 27. That compared with an increase of $5.9 billion reported for the previous week.
"Everyone is focusing in on interest rates now," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. "The feeling is that they will go lower" if the money supply shows weakness.
A drop in rates would hurt the dollar, because dollar-denominated securities would become less valuable to investors.
Traders dumped dollars on Wednesday on speculation that the Fed might lower rates because inflation remained mild. The Government reported on Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index had risen a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in April, the same as the month's Producer Price Index.
Concerns about higher German interest rates, because of continued labor unrest in that country, also worked against the dollar, traders said.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 129.87 yen, down 0.43 yen from Wednesday's price. It was quoted later at 130.20 yen in London and 130.15 yen in New York, up from 129.60 on Wednesday.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared with Wednesday's levels. Sterling fetched $1.8215 in London, up from $1.8135, and $1.8215 in New York, down from $1.8275.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6115 German marks, up from 1.6090; 1.4730 Swiss francs, down from 1.4795; 5.4125 French francs, up from 5.4005; 1,213 Italian lire, up from 1,210.25, and 1.20295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20395.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Issues Entwined, Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE explosion of violence in Los Angeles and its spread to other cities have done what economic arguments and moral preachments had failed to do: force the nation's attention on its festering problems of race, poverty and jobs.
What sort of explosion will it take to make the nation see that it cannot neglect its international responsibilities? America cannot choose to deal with either its domestic or its international problems; the two are bound together in this post-cold-war era. 
 Thus far, the peace dividend is being paid in lost jobs and incomes in many countries. Theoretically, there is no reason that this must be so: a peace dividend should permit a nation to spend more on welfare-enhancing consumer goods and services and on productivity-raising investment. But that happens only if a nation's workers are prepared and trained to take new jobs and if a reallocation of financial resources helps create those jobs.
In the absence of such shifts of human and physical resources, strong economic pressures to maintain high military spending, and to sell weapons wherever buyers can be found, will continue.
The dangers of both nuclear and nonnuclear proliferation are fed by economic interests. The United States has just imposed a two-year ban on exports to a Russian arms agency and to the Indian Space Research Organization because of a transfer by Russia to India of sensitive technology with military applications.
At a meeting in New York this week, Andrei I. Kolosovsky, Russia's Deputy Ambassador to the United States, said this transfer of military technology was for peaceful purposes. But he added that Russia would continue to make "normal military sales" to other countries, just as the United States, China, Israel, Czechoslovakia, Sweden and others were doing.
Mr. Kolosovsky attributed Russia's continuing high rate of military spending to its "military-industrial complex," using the same phrase President Dwight D. Eisenhower employed in his farewell address. The diplomat said that his country's military-industrial complex achieved its strength through its efficiency and its ability to create jobs and earn foreign exchange and capital.
Nevertheless, he said, it is crucial for the world to achieve "a general curbing of military sales" to ease tensions between nations and to further economic development.
The United States showed just how this could be done after World War II. It slashed military spending and stepped up private domestic investment, while aiding the war-ravaged countries. And the world economy entered the longest and strongest period of economic growth in history.
The situation that confronts the United States and the rest of the world today is radically different from the one it faced at the end of World War II. The United States itself is not in a position to supply the kind of capital that it once did, nor are Germany and Japan. And even as a new world economy emerges, new disintegrative threats are evident: the struggle for resources, especially oil; national and ethnic strife unleashed by the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the danger of a splitting apart of the world trading system.
America has assumed the leadership role in fighting to preserve the open world trading system that it largely created after World War II. In its efforts to liberalize agriculture, it is trying to open the world up not only to its own agricultural exports but also to those of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the third world.
The outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations will determine whether the world economy keeps moving forward or breaks into hostile trading blocs.
The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted from economic and political failures, rather than from direct military actions by its enemies. In the post-cold-war environment, threats to any nation's economic interests are being seen as a greater danger than threats to its territorial integrity. But even if the dangers of territorial conquest have diminished, other dangers persist, such as local or regional wars, ethnic and nationalistic violence, terrorism, spreading drug use, environmental hazards that could poison the human race and the possibilities of an economic collapse that could sow political revolutions and wars, as economic breakdowns have done in the past.
Maintaining an adequate defense of United States national interests will continue to provide significant costs on the Federal budget, even after making relatively optimistic assumptions about the reduced Soviet threat and the negotiation of future arms control agreements. A stable world order will require a strong military power capable of enforcing contracts and keeping the peace, although security, as we have learned, does not depend on military strength alone. A lasting peace will depend on strengthening the economy, both at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: Senate Kills Liability Limit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The Senate today rejected a 10-year effort by manufacturers and other business groups to limit the ability of consumers to collect punitive damages in cases involving faulty products.
On a 53-to-45 vote, the Senate turned down a measure by Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin, to establish nationwide standards on how much consumers can recover in suits against manufacturers. 
 It was unclear what effect the Senate vote would have on further attempts to change the nation's product liability laws; some senators said they had voted against the measure on purely procedural grounds, while others had opposed it on the merits.
Republicans tried to attach the measure championed by Vice President Dan Quayle to a Democratic bill that would require states to let people register to vote when they apply for driver's licenses, unemployment benefits or welfare.
The measure would deny a plaintiff the ability to collect all the pain and suffering damages from a manufacturer of a faulty product if other factors were involved in the mishap.
It would also eliminate the contingency fee system in which lawyers agree to represent plaintiffs in product liability suits for a percentage share of any settlement or jury award. Plaintiff consumers would have to pay the legal costs of defendant manufacturers if they lose the case after rejecting an earlier settlement offer.
Supporters contended the measure could reduce manufacturers' insurance and other costs by hundreds of millions of dollars a year and make their products much more competitive in world markets.
Opponents, led by trial lawyers and consumer groups, said there was little evidence that juries had awarded plaintiffs unreasonable damages in such suits. But, they said, the measure would intimidate victims into giving up their constitutional right to have a jury hear their case.

Profits Decline at Hanson

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, May 14

 BODY:
Hanson P.L.C., the British industrial conglomerate, said today that its second-quarter net profit fell 20 percent despite a sharp rise in sales.
The company said it earned 227 million, or $395 million, in the three months that ended March 31 compared with 285 million a year earlier. Sales rose 18 percent, to 2.4 billion, or $4.11 billion, from 2 billion a year earlier. 
 Earnings per share came to 38 cents per American depository receipt, compared with 48 cents in the quarter last year. A.D.R.'s are securities traded on American exchanges representing shares in foreign companies.
Hanson's American operations include SCM Chemicals, Peabody Coal, Beazer, Farberware Cookware and Gold Fields Mining.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson's North American operations, said: "Recently we have begun to see some signs of recovery in North America. But we anticipate this process will be slower than in other recent recessions and we remain cautious in our production planning until more concrete evidence of a sustained upturn occurs."

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
The two most important weeks of the spring auctions in New York ended on Wednesday night, and the mood was one of great relief. Given the current economy, things could have been worse -- much worse. After the slump of the last 18 months, the market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art -- the bread and butter of both Sotheby's and Christie's, the world's largest auction houses -- began inching its way back to life. While total sales were less than the auction houses' estimates, the number of new bidders and the enthusiasm in the salesrooms showed a marked change since the November sales.
"It came as almost a shock," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York. "But the message is clear: it's still a delicate market. Buyers are looking hard at estimates. And people must not be too optimistic about prices' rising in the near future. The same low figures must continue." 
 While buyers eagerly fished for bargains, many star works sold for strong prices. At the Impressionist and modern sales, dealers were as surprised as the auction-house experts as they watched works by artists like Chagall and Miro, Toulouse-Lautrec and Renoir -- the first to be dumped when the market crashed in 1990 -- sell at or above their estimates. "Many were fresh to the market and came at good prices," said Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's. Highlights of the week included: successful estate sales, a new interest in contemporary artists who made their reputations in the 1980's, excessive prices for works on paper and marginal interest in works that had only recently been on the market.
Totals for the last two weeks showed Christie's running almost $11 million ahead of Sotheby's. Christie's spring auctions made a total of $74.4 million, which was less than its pre-sales estimate of $80.5 million. Sotheby's made $63.4 million, well below its low estimate of $79.7 million. While neither house did as well as it had hoped, experts at each contend that in a poor economy, estimates are especially hard to gauge. After the shaky sales in November, it was difficult to predict exactly where the market stood.
"There's still money out there," Mrs. Brooks said. "American collectors -- some old, many new -- created the enthusiasm for buying." At the sales of Impressionist and modern art, American collectors were major buyers.
At Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday evening, sales totaled $33.8 million. Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern art was in two parts. On Monday evening, the collection of the interior designer William A. McCarty-Cooper was sold in an auction that totaled $21.5 million. The next evening, Christie's featured a general sale of Impressionist and modern art, which fetched $30 million.
Gone are the days of the $82.5 million picture of 1990. In the last two weeks, when an entire auction made $33.8 million, as Sotheby's did on Wednesday night, the sale was considered a success.
The highest price paid this spring was $7.7 million for Braque's "Studio VIII" from the William A. McCarty-Cooper collection, which was sold at Christie's on Monday night. But that was an exception. In November anything more than $1 million was a hard sell, but now there is active bidding for works that fetch about $2 million. At Christie's sale on Tuesday, Chagall's "Bouquet of Flowers," from 1937, was the most expensive picture. It sold to Scharf Fine Art of Manhattan for $2.8 million, just above the low estimate of $2.5 million. Sotheby's priciest painting was Renoir's "Portrait of Jean Renoir," which an unidentified South American collector bought for $2.3 million.
Gone are the speculators who made news in the 1980's, furiously snapping up what one dealer described as "pretty colors across a crowded room." This spring the salesrooms had a different feeling. They were full, but by no means as packed as they were in the boom years. The social voyeurs and movie stars, who made auctions into television spectacles five years ago, had vanished. Instead, serious collectors and world-famous dealers gathered to watch, to bid and to buy in a bargain-hunter's paradise. "It felt like sales in England in the 50's," said Michael Findlay, who heads the department of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's. "The auctioneer knew every face in the room."
But in the discreet 90's, both auction houses' telephones were in constant use. Buyers no longer wanted to be seen. Indeed, Sotheby's and Christie's shop-at-home service became the favored way to buy art. Telephone bidding wars occurred in every sale.
"Buyers were black and white," said Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads Sotheby's department of contemporary art. "If they wanted something, they went after it hammer and tong." If they didn't, bidding ground to a halt.
Enthusiasm and price were inextricably bonded. With the exception of a few stunning works, buyers tended to stop bidding at the auction house's low estimate. And estimates at both houses were substantially lower than they had been six months ago. Now David Nash, head of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art, estimates that price levels have sunk back to what they were in 1985-86.
One problem that auction houses face coming out of a slump is finding good properties. Few sellers willingly put works on the block. As a result, the auction houses had to rely on getting property or consignments from sellers who needed to liquidate their art assets.
This spring, estates helped bring to the market works that hadn't been up for sale for 30 to 40 years. "Estates give us flexibility that's important in this economy," Mr. Burge said. Since estates usually have high taxes to pay, auction houses have the luxury of putting unusually low reserves on works of art. (The reserve is the minimum price, agreed upon by the seller and the auction house, at which a work of art will sell.)
By far the splashiest estate sale was at Christie's on Monday night, when important works from the collection of William A. McCarty-Cooper were on the block. Mr. McCarty-Cooper, who died last May at the age of 53, was the companion and adopted son of Douglas Cooper, the world-renowned authority on Cubism. Besides the record-breaking Braque, more than 45 exceptional works on paper by artists including Picasso, Braque, Gris and Leger were up for sale. Many went for high prices. Picasso's "Man With a Lollipop," estimated at $600,000 to $800,000, was sold to an unidentified American collector for $968,000. "If these drawings had gone in a bull market, they would have gone for 10 to 20 percent higher," Mr. Findlay said. "They brought out the real hard-core collector."
It was a strong spring for drawings. At Sotheby's, two interesting drawings' collections fared well. Those belonging to Sidney E. Cohn, a New York labor-relations and entertainment lawyer who died last summer, sold for high prices on Wednesday evening, as did 15 Impressionist drawings in the same sale that until recently belonged to the Manhattan dealer William Acquavella. Although many came with high estimates, bidders were not intimidated. Matisse's "Seated Woman in a Romanian Blouse With Embroidered Motifs," with an estimate of $800,000 to $1 million, was sold to an unidentified bidder for $1.1 million.
 
Distress Sales
 The casualties at the sales were works that had come on the market not so very long ago. In this category was "La Loge," by Renoir. This 1874 work depicting Nini, a Montmartre model, sitting in a box at the opera with Renoir's younger brother Edmond, was on the block at Christie's Tuesday night. The work was last at auction at Christie's in New York in May 1989, at the height of the Impressionist market. Hermann Schnabel, a German collector and fertilizer manufacturer, bought it for $12.1 million. This time around, Christie's estimated it would bring $6 million to $8 million. But bidding stopped at $5.2 million, and the work went unsold.
Buyers came from all over the world this spring. There was even some Japanese bidding, something that had totally disappeared last fall. Besides activity from American collectors, Europeans, South Americans and Mexicans did their share of shopping. At Christie's and Sotheby's, both British-based, electronic boards at the head of salesrooms translate currencies during the bidding. Christie's electronic board has room for only six currencies. Traditionally, they always have shown British pounds, French francs, Swiss francs, Deutsche marks, lire and yen. This spring, Mexican pesos were added, reflecting the arrival of Mexicans in the market.
What was dropped to make room? The pound.

It Gets Bigger, Weirder and Tenser

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Sex, Death and God in L.A.
Edited and with an introduction by David Reid
Illustrated. 356 pages. Pantheon Books. $23.
"In the strange new post-modern imperium we live in," writes David Reid in the introduction to this new anthology, "Los Angeles, at the very least, has become the American city the world watches for signs and portents." 
 Given the riots that rocked Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney G. King verdict, those words seem especially prescient. Indeed, "Sex, Death and God in L.A." includes several essays that help illuminate the racial and class tensions that have been escalating recently in Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles in these essays is a vast and troubled megalopolis, a city in which "the imagination of disaster," as Mr. Reid calls it, is less a literary conceit than a mirror of a daily reality, defined by racism, crime, unemployment and rampant alienation. It is a Los Angeles that stands in shocking contrast, like a grainy black-and-white photo juxtaposed with a lush color lithograph, to the Los Angeles depicted in this volume's other pieces -- pieces that dwell on a more popular image of the city as La-La Land, home of movie stars, new-age gurus, crackpots, hustlers and wannabes.
The selection of essays in "Sex, Death and God in L.A." is so eclectic that one suspects that Mr. Reid wants to startle the reader into an appreciation of the city's shocking diversity. Ruben Martinez's fierce, poignant portrait of a Hispanic community stands in sharp contrast to a satiric portrait of Hollywood by Jeremy Larner that will remind readers of Michael Tolkin's novel "The Player." Similarly, Eve Babitz's tart, funny piece about encounters with "yoga jocks" and tango aficionados is juxtaposed with a tough yet lyrical memoir by Lynell George, an L.A. Weekly writer who reminisces about growing up in a neighborhood where "best friends played fatal games with loaded guns" and students in junior high school "went to more funerals than weddings."
In one of the book's more timely essays, Mike Davis, the author of a critically acclaimed study of Los Angeles titled "City of Quartz," provides the reader with a quick, devastating portrait of a part of Los Angeles, ravaged, in his view, by both deindustrialization and mindless redevelopment.
Unemployment among the city's blacks, Mr. Davis points out, has risen by nearly 50 percent since the early 1970's. Jobs were lost not only to the recent wave of factory closings, but also to the rise of "a third-world sector within the regional economy, based on the minimum-wage labor of immigrants without citizen rights."
"With 78,000 unemployed youth in the Watts-Willowbrook area," Mr. Davis goes on, "it is not surprising that there are now 145 branches of the rival Crips and Bloods gangs in south L.A., or that the jobless resort to the opportunities of the burgeoning 'crack' economy."
According to Mr. Davis, Los Angeles "makes no contribution from the general city revenue for social programs for the poor" and has instituted "no housing planning or social policy" to accommodate the rapid influx of new low-wage residents. In the last decade, a million immigrants have moved into older black and Chicano neighborhoods, he says, and as a result, "a dense, continuous ring of slum housing" has sprung up around Downtown Los Angeles.
In a very different sort of essay, the architectural historian Thomas S. Hines argues that the city's "spirit of experimentation" has helped foster "pioneering manifestations of architectural thought and practice" in Los Angeles.
"Four highly vulnerable concepts," he explains, "best categorize this development: first, the idea of 'Craftsman' or 'Mission Modernism' as epitomized in the work of Irving Gill; second, the concept of 'Romantic Modernism' as exemplified primarily in the Los Angeles buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright"; third, "the idea of Machine Modernism, or as they liked to call it, 'Rational Modernism,' as illustrated primarily in the work of Richard Neutra," and fourth, "the movement that some have labeled 'Mineshaft Modern' or 'Deconstructivist' as exemplified in the work of Frank Gehry and his school."
Though Mr. Hines's essay provides a succinct and accessible introduction to these architects' work, he frequently veers away from the subject of their impact on Los Angeles. A similar discursiveness characterizes Mr. Reid's own essay on religious movements in the city, which is filled with lengthy digressions about Krishnamurti and Aimee Semple McPherson.
In finishing this volume, the reader can't help but wish that its scope were broader, its reach a little longer. One misses older pieces of fiction -- by Nathanael West, Raymond Chandler, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Christopher Isherwood -- that capture the mood of the city; and one wonders why pieces by more contemporary writers like Joan Didion, Leon Bing (the author of "Do or Die," a chilling portrait of gang life in Los Angeles), the architectural historian Reyner Banham (the author of "Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies") and the historian Kevin Starr (the author of "Inventing the Dream: California Through the Progressive Era") weren't included as well.
As far as it goes, however, "Sex, Death and God in L.A." is a provocative and involving book -- the sort of book that makes you want to read more about Los Angeles, the sort of book that compels you to think about the mind-boggling disparities -- social, economic and cultural -- that exist within the boundaries of Los Angeles and so many other American cities.

Letter From Germany

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
Bill Clinton will not be happy to hear what German political and business leaders say about him. Nor will George Bush be thrilled.
German thinking on these two men is almost a non sequitur: We still very much need U.S. leadership, presence and strength. We're worried about America sinking economically and turning inward. We don't think Bush will do anything to turn this situation around. But we're against Clinton. 
 Yes, Germans prefer the familiar devil. They are also profoundly grateful for Mr. Bush's support on reunification.
But Mr. Clinton comes to the Germans with two big strikes against him. First, they fear he will bring the Carter foreign policy team back to Washington. Jimmy Carter's international record may look better in retrospect to Americans, but most European and Asian leaders still see his tenure as the dark ages of American naivete. Second, they see Democrats as protectionists. To Germans, mistakenly, Bill Clinton equals Representative Richard Gephardt, the symbol of Democratic get-tough trade policies.
The only thing even well-informed Germans know -- and like -- about the Arkansas Governor's world view is his aid program for the former Soviet Union. As for Ross Perot, they regard him as a King Kong cartoon, a peculiarly American figure who inspires terror or amusement.
As much as Germans fret about America, they worry far more about themselves. Germany has rarely managed internal turmoil as well as its Western neighbors, and it is going through a particularly difficult patch at the moment with labor strikes.
For centuries, the Romans fought to keep the German barbarians at bay. Now the "barbarians" are struggling to fend off latter-day "Romans" from Eastern and Southern Europe who they feel will plunder their homeland. Political leaders ineffectually try to navigate between the public's sense of guilt and anger about these foreigners. Meanwhile the situation ripens for right-wingers who simply want to throw the aliens out.
As explosive, and far more complicated, is the absorption of 17 million eastern Germans. Bonn has undertaken the largest welfare program in history. The commitment is to bring Easterners to economic parity in a decade. Its American equivalent would be lifting the bottom 20 percent of society to middle-class status by the year 2000.
The enterprise will be heartening and ugly. Karola von Braun, a Berlin political leader and niece of the rocket scientist, tells this story of exploitation. Businesses are firing blue-collar West Berliners and hiring East Berliners at about half the salary. New jobs at lower wages are also going eastward. No one feels good about this; neither easterners working for less than their counterparts, nor westerners losing jobs.
The culture clash makes economic matters worse. United Germany remains two Germanys. For 40 years, the West went democratic. Meantime, tens of thousands of East Germany's political elite continued Nazi-like ways as Communists. Even now they occupy the choicest apartments in eastern Berlin and eastern Germany and hang like a dark cloud over their countrymen. These nasties are justly hounded by former dissidents, idealists who also harangue western Germans with unwanted cries of justice and equality.
And the western Germans are paying the huge equalization bill -- by borrowing and going very deeply and dangerously into debt. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has only recently begun to acknowledge that he underestimated the costs. But neither he nor other politicians have the stomach to raise taxes or cut spending.
German pols flee from facing their voters with hard choices with the same deer-like agility found now in almost every Western democracy. "We have no federal or state elections for 18 months, so there is a slight possibility of doing something in this time," explained Otto Lambsdorff, the brash and formidable leader of the Free Democratic Party. "But then we have 19 elections in one year, and nothing will be accomplished." A melancholy observation about elections and democracy.
Leaders fear voters' greed and ignorance; and voters are losing confidence in their leaders' ability to govern. This is the real danger in Germany and elsewhere. Thus democracy doth make cowards of us all.

The Hand That Shakes Digital Up

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 14

 BODY:
At the Digital Equipment Corporation, the financially troubled computer maker, power struggles have long been a way of life. But if the clash involved Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's founder and president, the outcome was always a foregone conclusion.
Last year, John Rose, a 16-year Digital veteran who spent several years leading the company's catch-up efforts in the personal computer market, was stunned to discover that Mr. Olsen had created a competing group that was pursuing a vastly different strategy for the company. 
 In fact, the group was proposing that a personal computer designed and built in Taiwan would become Digital's predominant personal computing product. Mr. Rose tried to start discussions about what the right approach for the company might be, but he was rebuffed by Mr. Olsen.
"I never got to go before the executive committee," said Mr. Rose, who left Digital in March.
The episode was quintessential Digital under Mr. Olsen, who has a penchant for squaring off competing activities to spur innovation. "If you don't have competition pressuring you, you just won't move," Mr. Olsen said.
For decades, that strategy has worked. But after a total of $400 million in losses over the last nine months -- the worst financial performance by the company in its 35-year history -- the spotlight is casting the Olsen style in a different light.
Among the more puzzling developments were two major restructurings in three months. Now many people are questioning whether the 66-year-old Mr. Olsen knows what is needed and whether he is an obstacle rather than a catalyst for yet another recovery at the company.
Mr. Olsen, intent on bringing Digital out of its malaise, is angry, at his management as well as the press and stock analysts, for quizzing him on what is going on. He is reportedly delivering long, angry sermons at executive committee meetings and threatening to sell Digital to General Electric if things do not get better.
 
Widespread, Complex Problems
 Many Digital executives say the company's problems are widespread and complex. The company has solid products but is paralyzed by a lack of a clear strategic direction and strong management. Morale is low, with impending personnel cuts: 10,000 jobs have already been eliminated and up to 15,000 more will go starting July 1.
On top of that, many customers have become confused by too many products and shifting messages from the company about its commitment to important strategies and products.
"In the 1980's Digital had a clear message," said Stephen Smith, a computer industry analyst at Paine Webber in New York. "These days they are throwing a lot of balls in the air and seeing if they can catch one. They've gone from one architecture to multiple architectures, from a single operating system to multiple operating systems. They seem rudderless right now, and customers are very confused."
The company's board, which has never openly opposed Mr. Olsen, is concerned over the financial situation and is paying close attention. Within the last few weeks, John F. Smith, Digital's senior vice president of operations, presented a new cost-cutting plan to the board.
In addition, the company has been without a chief financial officer for several months since James Osterhoff left in frustration last year. One internal candidate said the board had pushed for an outside replacement. Mr. Smith said such a replacement would be named in a few weeks. So far, the company has narrowed the field to two outside candidates.
 
Loss of Talented People
 Mr. Olsen's autocratic style has caused dozens of talented people to leave the company over the years, but as revenue and profits grew, outsiders did not much care.
But some Digital managers say his intimate scrutiny keeps the senior management focused on internal politics rather than on the competition, which is grabbing chunks of Digital's markets in work stations and mid-range systems.
In a recent interview, Mr. Olsen said that two years ago he recognized that the company was too caught up building computers and not solving needs of customers.
The poor economy and a misplaced focus on what the customer really wants are to blame for Digital's falling revenues, he said. "We were selling computers, while the customers wanted solutions to business problems," he said. "You can see at DECworld that we've addressed that."
At DEC World, the company's impressive three-week exhibition of its wares that is winding up Friday in downtown Boston, is a showcase of the company's innovative technology and solid product line.
To outsiders, Mr. Olsen gives his usual assurance that all is well within Digital. The former research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who co-founded Digital with $70,000 in borrowed cash, has displayed an uncanny knack for pulling Digital out of wrenching dilemmas in the past while single-handedly guiding the company to become a $14 billion international giant, the nation's No. 2 computer company. More than once, Mr. Olsen has withstood calls for his resignation only to emerge stronger than ever.
 
Drop in Business Brings Big Loss
 "Business doesn't have to drop very much in order cause a big loss," Mr. Olsen said. "This is something people -- often analysts of all people -- don't fully understand. If you make 10 percent profit and your business drops 10 percent, you've wiped the whole thing out."
To return to profitability, Mr. Olsen is pushing for change. Digital is whittling away at its number of product offerings, trying to make selling easier for its sales force and simpler for its customers. Also, portions of Digital's sales force will soon be receiving some commissions as an incentive, a dramatic change from the company's longstanding policy of paying salespeople straight salaries.
But is it enough to get Digital back on track? Mr. Olsen says organizational shake-ups are good for the company, but insiders point dejectedly to a growing list of recent high-level Digital departures, especially William D. Strecker, former vice president of engineering and leading player in shaping product strategy. In the most recent reshuffling -- the company's second in three months -- Mr. Strecker lost another power struggle with Mr. Olsen.
Though he remains at Digital in the new post of chief of technology, Mr. Strecker is no longer leading the company's technical development. Mr. Olsen said this was good time for Mr. Strecker, who is 48 years old, to take some time off and figure out what he wanted to do. Mr. Strecker declined to comment on the matter.
Mr. Strecker is understood to have opposed Digital's move into mainframe computing three years ago, which Mr. Olsen championed. Digital's VAX9000 mainframe reportedly cost more than $1 billion to build, arrived late to the market and has been a financial disaster for the company.
Mr. Strecker reportedly pushed hard for Digital to form an alliance with Apple Computer last year, but Mr. Olsen opposed such a move. Apple eventually made an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation instead. Mr. Strecker, believing Digital needed a key alliance with a major player in desktop computing, then pushed hard for the agreement recently completed with Microsoft Corporation.
Digitial insiders say Mr. Olsen strongly opposed that alliance, too, but that Mr. Strecker refused to back down. The alliance was officially signed in April, with Mr. Olsen happily introducing Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, to the crowd at Digital's DEC World exhibition two weeks ago. The hard push toward Microsoft cost Mr. Strecker his engineering job, his associates say. "The Microsoft deal was the straw that broke the camel's back," said one executive.
Digital's problems appear to be as complex and confusing as its legendary matrix organization, in which layers of management disseminate mountains of data seeking consensus within Digital. All of this takes time and can be derailed by a word from Mr. Olsen.
To Mr. Olsen, "I have a simple set of management rules."
"I set up everything so that it runs automatically without me," he said. "When things run ideally, I have nothing to do. And then in those areas which aren't working well or need changes, I am not at all embarrassed to get involved in great detail, extreme detail when that is what is necessary to solve a particular problem."
He insists that the huge jobs cuts resulted from more efficient methods of building and servicing products and had nothing to do with the recession. "These are not jobs that will ever come back," he said.
Mr. Olsen refuses to make company policy based on newspaper articles or consultants' opinions. "I always have a model of the company or portion of the company I'm working on and am clearly going in a direction," he said. "It always takes longer than I expect, because changing people takes longer than I think it would."
Mr. Olsen said those within the company who were disgruntled were only those like Mr. Rose who left after the showdown on Digital's personal computer strategy. "When you get into trouble is when people want to hang on to the way we used to do things," he said. He said that one failure at Digital was not moving managers around enough to learn how to be senior executives.
Mr. Olsen insisted that he was not possessive about Digital. "It's a professional job," he said. "It's never been my company. From the start, we said we will only run it as long as we're the best."
Most Digital employees remain intensely loyal to Mr. Olsen. William Johnson, vice president of marketing, said that although there had been delays in the introduction of products, particularly one that links computer systems, he did not blame Mr. Olsen.
"We were a year and a half late offering a TCPIP product," Mr. Johnson said. "That wasn't Ken's fault. That's what he pays me for. When I look at our senior staff, it's very formidable, but I can't think of anybody, inside or outside, who could take over who is as dynamic as Ken is."
Mr. Olsen said he had no intention of turning over the reins to anyone else. Critics say he has effectively blocked any rising stars within Digital from gaining broad enough management skills to replace him.
Whether Mr. Olsen is able to lead Digital out of its current morass remains to be seen. Critics say it will be a difficult task. Mr. Olsen remains upbeat. "We've lived through many recessions," he said. "This is just one more."

HEADLINE: FLIGHT OF HAITIANS SUDDENLY RESUMES

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREAT ABACO ISLAND, the Bahamas, May 15

 BODY:
Haitians have suddenly resumed the flight from their country aboard small boats in numbers that surpass the surge seen in October in the aftermath of a violent military coup.
With an average of almost 250 people a day being plucked from the seas off Haiti in recent weeks, the number being temporarily housed at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba has risen to about 8,500, from a low of 2,000 in March. On Wednesday, one of the busiest days yet, 903 Haitians on 11 rickety vessels were plucked from the seas. 
 When relatively few Haitians were found at sea in March, officials thought the exodus had crested. But now, exasperated officials see new urgency in diplomatic efforts to restore Haiti's elected Government.
Diplomats from the Organization of American States are to meet Sunday in the Bahamas to discuss Haiti.
Officials seeking to explain the resurgence in refugees point to the dramatic deterioration of living conditions in the island nation, in large part because of a hemisphere-wide trade embargo imposed last November to punish the coup leaders.
Some officials also complain that while the Coast Guard has stopped Haitian vessels from reaching the United States, a sizable portion of those picked up have been admitted to pursue grants of asylum, thus encouraging many others to risk the voyage.
Others stress the calm seas and favorable winds, which may encourage more Haitians to risk voyages in often frail and leaky boats. The authorities say that they have no estimate of how many have drowned and that none have made it to the mainland of the United States.
In an interview on Thursday, a senior State Department official estimated that the combined costs of the settlement at Guantanamo and the Coast Guard's interdiction had risen to over $60 million since the Sept. 30 coup. Immigration officials said their costs stood at over $6 million.
"The level of exasperation is high," one immigration official said, "not simply out of frustration with the results but because this is beginning to cause a serious money crunch. The figures are rising rapidly, there is no end in sight and none of this is budgeted."
In order to handle the latest surge, the Immigration and Naturalization Service recently sent 40 staff members to Guantanamo to determine which Haitians would be allowed into the United States.
In addition to budgetary problems, the flight of Haitians has fueled tensions between the agencies involved.
Facing criticisms and lawsuits in the United States from advocates for the refugees, the immigration service has sharply increased the number of Haitians it qualifies to pursue claims for political asylum. Close to a third of the 29,000 Haitians who have fled since the coup against the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide have been approved for entry into the United States.
 
Defining 'Political Refugee'
 State Department officials say the high ratio of Haitians being allowed into the United States is acting as a magnet, encouraging others to claim political persecution and flee their country.
"We feel the rate of those being screened in does not reflect the reality," said a senior State Department official. "These numbers are extraordinary and are out of line with the situation on the ground in Haiti.
The official said the State Department had stepped up its efforts to monitor human rights in Haiti, citing a survey of 2,000 Haitians who had given political motives for their flight but had been returned to Haiti. There was "no evidence that these people are political refugees," the official said.
The Pentagon has also begun to chafe under the refugee burden, complaining that the use of the Guantanamo base was a source of friction with the Cuban Government and an unsustainable strain on the resources of the base and the Coast Guard.
 
Coast Guard as Magnet
 Both immigration and State Department officials complain that the Coast Guard, by setting up a battery of ships just over the horizon from Haiti, have encouraged the exodus.
"They have gone from being a deterrent to becoming a magnet," said one official, who said the extremely flimsy boats now being used suggested that the refugees expected to be picked up quickly.
In order to relieve the pressure on Guantanamo and further discourage the exodus, officials from several agencies said new thought is being given to encouraging another country to set up a processing center for Haitians.
 
Other Forms of Pressure
 At the same time, the United States is stepping up diplomatic pressure on Haiti's provisional Government to accept an international settlement that would set the stage for the return of the Father Aristide as President. The provisional Government, backed by the military, has rejected such a settlement and has ruled out Father Aristide's return.
At the meeting Sunday of the Organization of American States, diplomats say, the United States and other countries will urge harsher measures against Haiti's leaders, including a restriction of air traffic, a tightening of the trade embargo aimed especially at oil sales and a request to European nations that they also halt trade with Haiti.
Officials concerned that such measures might also speed the flight of refugees say increased humanitarian assistance may also be required.

HEADLINE: EMPIRE IN TROUBLE;
Big Canadian Developer Trying To Confine Bankruptcy Damage

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
After fighting a losing battle to avoid bankruptcy in Canada, Olympia & York Ltd., the world's largest real estate developer, pressed its lenders yesterday to allow it to keep control of its prized properties in New York and London.
Olympia & York's strategy is to try to retain as much of its empire as possible to lay a foundation for a restructured and financially viable company, all accomplished without the complexities and risks of a lengthy bankruptcy proceeding in the United States, which could take control of Olympia & York out of the hands of the Reichmann family of Toronto. 
 In London yesterday, Olympia & York's directors met with bankers to seek assurances that the ill-fated Canary Wharf development in London, a $3 billion office and retail project, would not be forced into the British equivalent of a bankruptcy liquidation.
For now, bankers said, they would not try to seize the complex, which is under construction, and would continue to provide money for work on the site near the London docklands. "No one is taking a precipitate action at the moment," one banker said. [Page 38.]
As financial markets awoke yesterday to the news that Olympia & York had finally succumbed to bankruptcy in Canada, stock markets in London, Toronto and New York calmly accepted what many people had viewed as an inevitable step in the closing chapter in the late 1980's real estate crisis. [Page 39.]
Falling real estate prices, which began years ago in Houston and Dallas, and rolled across the country to Boston, New York and Washington, as well as to the west, had claimed the developer, whose sheer strength and wealth had allowed it to withstand the downturn the longest, despite debts of $18.5 billion.
 
Working With Banks
 In the United States, the company is now in the process of presenting long-term plans to each lender on its New York buildings that it hopes will win the support of its principal banks, which include the Sanwa Bank, Nomura Ltd. and Sumitomo Ltd., all of Japan, as well as First National Bank of Chicago and J. P. Morgan of New York.
Among the things it is seeking from the banks are a moratorium on all principal payments on its mortgages on New York buildings, one banker said. The banker said it is also seeking an agreement that the bankers and the company's bondholders will accept whatever income is generated from nearly 23 million square feet of office space in New York City and not move to take possession of the buildings when revenues fall short of the interest payments due.
Olympia & York officials say that values will improve on the New York properties, and that if the banks leave the properties in Olympia's hands, their loans will be repaid eventually.
The company is also one of New York's top taxpayers, and its next property tax payment, about $75 million, is due on July 1.
Olympia & York argues that the value of all its New York properties, which include the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan, exceeds by more than $1 billion the $5.9 billion debt on them. But many bankers are skeptical about property values, after having lived through several bruising years of falling prices during a national real estate recession and because some Olympia buildings have not been appraised in years.
One example is 55 Water Street, between Broad Street and Old Slip. Olympia said in 1986 that the building was worth $742 million, but several real estate experts estimate that it might bring only about $200 million at today's depressed prices. The building is one of the company's biggest problem properties in New York.
"We believe there is net value in the New York portfolio," said an executive of the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We could do a Chapter 11 filing, and that would buy time and get us financing, but we do not want to take that route."
Still, some real estate experts were skeptical. "This is a multinational real estate restructuring, and we haven't had one of these," said David Shulman, head of Salomon Brothers' real estate research. "Nobody knows what will happen. They are basically spinning out of control right now."
Olympia & York will also have to persuade the banks to contribute more money to properties that back their loans in New York because in some downtown buildings it must pay for costly asbestos removal and various improvements if the properties are to continue attracting tenants.
Although the company is also trying to avoid a bankruptcy proceeding in the United States for its American subsidiaries, it is trying to take advantage of the more debtor-friendly rules of American bankruptcy law.
Several of the Canadian subsidiaries filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on Thursday in New York in addition to their filings in Toronto. These companies are the Olympia & York SF Holdings Corporation, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., O.&Y. (U.S.) Development Canada Ltd. and O.&Y. Equity (Canada) Ltd.
The Canadian system, by contrast to that in the United States, is less biased in favor of debtors. By filing first for Chapter 11 protection for five of its main Canadian companies with American assets, Olympia & York hopes to get the American courts to take the lead in the restructuring of its Canadian arm. The Canadian companies that filed for protection in Toronto have a total debt load of $14.9 billion (Canadian), according to the court documents.
 
Falling Prices
 Olympia & York is only the latest and by far the biggest company to fall in a global real estate deflation and credit tightening that began in the Southwest United States in 1986, rolled across the country and eventually spread to Canada, Britain, France and Japan, among others.
Although the Reichmann family of Toronto, which owns Olympia & York, is believed to have enormous stores of wealth safely outside the reach of most of its creditors, their cash crisis, which began earlier this year, represents the fall of the bluest of the world's blue-chip real estate companies.
It was commonly said even after the company initiated a restructuring of its debts and ran to banks across the world for emergency loans that if Olympia & York could not survive this real estate downturn, no developer encumbered with debt was immune.
On Thursday real estate executives saw the fruition of the disaster that many said was planted in the 1980's with huge overbuilding of office space around the world and wildly inflated real estate values spurred by a flood of institutional money bidding up the prices of office buildings.
Although Olympia & York's vast array of office and retail properties in the United States and its Canary Wharf project in London are not in bankruptcy, the fall of the parent company and its entire Canadian arm shows the severity of the problems that have trampled office developers across the world.
 
Disputes Are Feared
 It remains to be seen whether the company can keep its lenders from fighting among themselves and moving separately to seize collateral in the United States, much the way things went in Canada. If that happens, a Chapter 11 filing is a near certainty.
"No one could have predicted the massive downturn that we've seen in this market and in London," said a senior official of Olympia & York who insisted on anonymity. "Look at the natural-resources side, which was designed to be countercyclical to the real estate market because generally when real estate prices go down oil goes up. Who could have predicted that they both would have been on the same roller coaster going down?"
Indeed, a recent study showed that property lenders, by refusing to roll over maturing loans and demanding that borrowers repay, reduced by about $2.4 billion the amount they lent to the industry last year.. Lenders have traditionally allowed developers who are up to date on their borrowings to roll over their loans or have given them an opportunity to refinance with other lenders, but now sharply fewer lenders are financing real estate.
Olympia & York's cash needs are considerable. The estimate for keeping the Canary Wharf project going just through the end of 1993 is $650 million.
"Who could have predicted that the real estate markets worldwide were going to collapse?," the Olympia & York executive asked. "Who knew that the Japanese were going to be out of this business in a year? The world just took directions that none of us could have predicted."
 
The Leading Bank Lender
 Among the main bank creditors who will shape Olympia & York's future are Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest single bank creditor with about $750 million of loans. This bank's hard-nosed dealing with Olympia & York eventually hurt Olympia's ability to keep its Canadian arm out of bankruptcy court and that was surprising to many analysts because for many years the bank had been a staunch supporter of the company.
Paul Reichmann, the chief strategist for the company, was a member of the board of Canadian Imperial and resigned because of conflict-of-interest problems only when the restructuring began. Canadian Imperial blocked several large new loan proposals to the company, demanded that Olympia & York provide recent financial data rather than year-old figures, and aggressively resisted the company's strong-arm tactics.
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, is a key American creditor in the negotiations and it has a total of almost $500 million outstanding to Olympia & York and its subsidiaries. William Rhodes, senior Citicorp executive who made a name for himself negotiating many of the Latin American debt workouts, is playing a central role in coordinating the moves of some of the bank lenders on New York properties as well as Canary Wharf. Along with Royal Imperial and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Citicorp has run many of the creditor meetings.
Among the other banks with large exposures to the company are Royal Bank of Canada; Credit Suisse of Switzerland; Credit Lyonnais of France; Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Sumitomo Bank, both of Japan; Bank of Nova Scotia, Lloyds Bank of Britain, and the National Bank of Canada.

HEADLINE: ALEXANDER'S SHUTS ALL ITS 11 STORES; PLANS LIQUIDATION

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The death knell rang for another big New York City retailer yesterday as Alexander's Inc. closed its 11 stores and filed for bankruptcy protection. The budget department store company, merchant to successive waves of struggling immigrants since 1928, said it would reopen the stores for a close-out sale, then cease operations.
The company, which has not turned a profit on its retail operations since 1987, will continue to try to sell or lease its stores, some of which occupy prime real estate locations like the one occupied by the flagship store at 58th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. 
 Alexander's demise will hurt the New York economy. The 5,200 employees will lose their jobs, and a significant amount of square footage will flood a real estate market already glutted with empty retail space. The Daily News, in which Alexander's was the second-largest advertiser, will also be hard hit.
 
Shift to Real Estate
 Over the last decade, Alexander's managers and owners became more interested in developing the company's real estate and allowed the retailing business to decline, failing to address ever-intensifying competition from new discount stores and price wars that made department-store merchandise less expensive.
At many locations, the Alexander's stores sit in shopping centers where the presence of other large stores may help diffuse the loss. But the damage will be felt strongly in the Fordham Road section of the Bronx, where the Alexander's on the Grand Concourse has anchored a thriving shopping district of smaller shops and ornate movie theaters. Alexander's bought that store, its second, in 1933 and made it the flagship of its chain until the company finally moved into Manhattan in 1963. [Page 27.]
 
Outposts in the Suburbs
 When its customers began moving out of the city, Alexander's moved with them, establishing beachheads in White Plains and Paramus, N.J., offering middle-class shoppers quality goods at bargain prices.
"With its passing, the Bronx loses one of its distinctions, because even though it moved its headquarters to Manhattan, in the minds of many Bronx residents, it was always a Bronx store," said Lloyd Ultan, a professor of history at Fairleigh Dickinson University who has written four books about the Bronx.
The end of Alexander's highlights the extraordinary difficulties the retail industry has had in the New York area. Some of the proudest names in the business have closed in the last decade -- Gimbels, B. Altman and May's, as well as Ohrbach's, S. Klein and E. J. Korvette. Others, including Bloomingdale's and Macy's, filed for bankruptcy, but survived.
"This is not just an individual story about a retailer fallen on hard times but another very sad part of the difficulties of the whole retail scene in New York City," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the Labor Department.
In its heyday in the 1930's, the Alexander's at Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse boasted more sales per square foot than any other retailer in the country. It was one of the last department stores to cater to the needs and wallets of New York's struggling immigrant and working-class shoppers. It served the Jewish, Irish and Italian communities of the Bronx and northern Manhattan until the mid-1960's when the ethnic makeup of the borough began changing.
Its founder, George Farkas, who named the stores for his father, developed the strategy of finding a niche between discount houses selling hardware and housewares and full-service department stores. "Dad went right in between with decor and ambiance, but with style, fashion and price," Robin L. Farkas, the company's chairman, said at the time of his father's death in 1980. "It had not been done that way before."
With the opening of a third store, in White Plains, Mr. Farkas stayed open in the evening, which no other Westchester County department store did at the time.
 
In Decline Since Mid-1980's
 But the company, which sold stock to the public in 1968, has been in decline since the mid-1980's. In its last five years, only when the company sold stores did it have a profit. And sales have dropped to $430 million last fiscal year from $525 million in 1988. Mr. Farkas said losses of the last two years reached $40 million and were expected to continue.
"Alexander's retail business is not viable, and there is little prospect of turning it around," Mr. Farkas said. "It is simply no longer capable of producing the cash flow necessary.
From its unkempt facade to the cheap, no-frills merchandise it sold, Alexander's stood out in the industry, where glitz, glamour and excess predominated.
But in the last decade, the value of real estate increased geometrically, and Alexander's had several pricey pieces of property, including its Roosevelt Field store in Garden City, L.I., and the stores on Lexington Avenue and Fordham Road.
Because high-stakes real estate seemed far sexier and more lucrative than discount retailing, the company neglected retailing. At the same time, an increasing number of competitors -- Kmart, Conway, Conran's and outlet stores -- started chipping away at Alexander's sales.
"For a long time, Alexander's was the alternative to the department stores," said James Posner of Posner Associates, a retail consulting firm. "Now people have lots of alternatives, and Alexander's hasn't given them any reason to continue to shop there."
Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a statement, "This is a sad day for New York City." Mr. Dinkins said he was particularly concerned about Alexander's employees, "the vast majority of whom are people of color and half of whom are women."
Alexander's stopped paying its bills in March, when it announced that it could not meet some requirements of its loan agreements. Since then, it has received little new merchandise.
In its filing with the bankruptcy court, Alexander's listed assets of $183.7 million and liabilities of $95.7 million. Bankruptcy experts say the value of Alexander's real estate insures that its banks, suppliers and even its shareholders are likely to recoup their losses in the long run.
"The trade creditors are, of course, sad to see another good retailer leave the New York scene, but our expectation is that the suppliers will receive 100 cents on the dollar," said Andrew H. Tananbaum, president of Century Factors Inc., a financing company that is one of Alexander's creditors.
Despite its difficulties, the company's board had opted to keep the stores open while Financo, an investment house, shopped them around. The company's two largest shareholders, who between them own more than 50 percent of the stock, are Citibank and Interstate Properties, a New Jersey real estate developer.
 
Too Little Money Coming In
 But too little money was coming in, and Alexander's filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code early yesterday morning. The company had been expected to ask for bankruptcy protection last Friday, but the company's directors could not agree on a strategy and delayed the filing.
Investors were not frightened by the prospect of bankruptcy. On Thursday, Alexander's stock closed at its highest price in several months: $12 a share. Trading in the stock was suspended yesterday.
But real estate brokers were wringing their hands yesterday at the thought of hundreds of thousands of feet of more retail space added to the already depressed market. In the heady days of the 1980's, Alexander's was the object of desire for developers like Donald J. Trump, the Bass brothers of Fort Worth and Mr. Roth, who bid its stock up to more than $75 in an effort to buy its properties. The battles these glamorous millionaires fought for control of the proudly plebeian store chain were the top subject of brokers' gossip for years.
"Now who needs that real estate?" said Robert Futterman, senior vice president of Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc., a retail real estate company. "When I heard the news first thing this morning, I thought that's the absolute worst thing that could have happened in my market."
The store closings will also swell the ranks of unemployed department store workers in the city. Employment at the city's department stores has dropped 40 percent in the last decade, from 52,000 to 33,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The decline has accelerated in five years, when more than 20 percent of the workers in local department stores have lost their jobs.
"I've been involved 34 years in the retail business in this city, and I've never seen it this bad," said Lenore Miller, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. "I don't know where all those people are going to go." Alexander's employees were not represented by a union.
At The Daily News, which is also in bankruptcy, Les Goodstein, vice president of advertising, said the newspaper had been aware of the chain's problems for some time and planned for reduced advertising revenues. "We have budgeted very conservative estimates through the remainder of this year," he said.

HEADLINE: WORKING NIGHTS: A Special Report;
Lives Upside Down to Help a World Go Round

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DULUTH, Ga.

 BODY:
At 11 P.M., or 1 A.M. on the many nights she must work overtime, Allison McClure stops at her mother's house to retrieve her 3-year-old daughter, Mia, take her home and put her back to bed. Then she packs Mia's bag for nursery school, does the ironing, cleans house and takes a shower. "I'm in bed by 3 or 4," she said during her 9-to-9:30 P.M. "lunch" break at a mail processing center.
Then she gets up at 6:45 A.M. "I get her up. I fix her breakfast, I feed her and I take her to school. I'll lie down for about an hour and a half, and then I'm up. Any business I have to do, I try to fit in between then and the time I have to be at work at 3." 
 Ms. McClure is a shift worker. Thirty years old, paid around $30,000 a year, she is hard at work for the United States Postal Service when most people take it easy or sleep. Because of her personal obligations, she said: "I never sleep eight hours. Sometimes you get tired, so you have to push yourself."
She has jet lag without the jet, and she has it all the time.
Ms. McClure and millions of others who work unconventional hours have become objects of concern to psychologists and occupational-health specialists. While some people, like police officers, nurses and factory workers, have always worked unconventional hours, more and more do now. And among them new strains have developed as two-earner families and single working mothers have displaced one-earner, married-couple families.
Typically, statisticians define shift workers as people who spend less than half of the daylight hours on the job or who work some hours in the morning and some at night. Others put in long, dawn-to-dawn shifts or rotating schedules -- days one week, nights the next. Growth in shift work, like the growth in part-time and temporary jobs, is a part of a sea change in the labor force that has to accommodate a global economy that runs around the clock.
Shift work accounts for a quarter to nearly half the jobs in the fastest-growing occupations. It is built into 8 of the 10 occupations that the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts will add the most workers in the next decade: sales clerk and cashier in stores, nurse, nursing aide, truck driver, janitor, waiter and fast-food worker. Shift work, of course, also breeds shift workers. They work in convenience stores, supermarkets and gas stations that stay open long after dark to serve other people who work long after dark.
No one knows just how many shift workers there are. The last time it looked, in 1985, the Census Bureau found 20 million, or a fifth of the work force. It counted them again last year, but the results will not be reported until later this year.
Donald I. Tepas, an industrial psychologist at the University of Connecticut, said, "Our society is demanding more and more round-the-clock operation at all levels, from the working-class blue-collar guy to doctors in hospitals and financiers."
 
The Burdens
Too Little Sleep, Too Many Cares
 Occupational-health experts find that shift work exacts a toll beyond just losing sleep. Years of research, assembled in a recent study of shift work and health by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, show that shift workers typically suffer from insomnia and chronic fatigue. They have more trouble with their health and dispositions than other workers, more marital problems, more strains rearing children.
Night workers, the study says, complain inordinately of gastrointestinal disorders, including peptic ulcers. It says that pregnant shift workers, according to some limited research, suffer more miscarriages, premature births and lower birth weights than women who work regular hours.
The Congressional study says the health effects of shift work become more acute with age, raising concern about the baby-boom generation, which is now the largest part of the work force and whose oldest members are approaching 50. Timothy H. Monk, director of a University of Pittsburgh program that studies workers' hours, said he wondered how employers will manage with older, less malleable workers, "when they don't have enough young people to shuffle."
Many foreign governments regulate shift work, but in the United States, neither the Government nor the institutions that support workplace regulation, like labor unions and advocacy groups, have fully addressed the issue.
 
Grogginess Can Be Deadly
 In the interest of public safety, Federal agencies regulate shift work in public transportation and in a few other areas, like operating nuclear power plants, where a groggy employee can endanger a community. But no one protects the community when a groggy employee hits the road for home.
For many people, shift work is all they can find. But for others, it holds some advantages. It permits couples with young children, for example, to hold two jobs, with one working while the other is home.
Night work also often pays more than day work in the same job. In addition to base pay of about $10 to $16 an hour, postal workers get a 10 percent bonus for hours they work between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M.
 
The Workplace
Dazzling Light In Sea of Dark
 Ms. McClure's mail-processing center, 33 miles north of Atlanta, provides a window on one of the nation's larger concentrations of shift workers. It is a 643,000-square-foot, single-story building surrounded by fields and trees at the end of a rolling suburban road. At night it looks eerily alive, with its truck-loading bays, largely windowless walls and parking lots basking in white artificial light. It is a glistening, modern factory in all respects except that it doesn't make anything.
About 1,700 people work there, and 1,400 of them are shift workers, starting their jobs sometime between 2 P.M. and 1 A.M. Thanks to their toil, many letters mailed in Atlanta one day can be picked up, processed, loaded in trucks and delivered the next day.
Of nearly 200,000 postal employees assigned to mail-processing work nationwide, Phillip Tabbita, an official of the American Postal Workers Union in Washington, estimated that 75 percent work afternoons and nights, up from about half in the 1960's.
David C. Lamb, the head of human resources, procurement and finance at the processing center, said the work "is all predicated on service standards."
"Our last collections are between 4 and 6," he said, "which means we really can't start until after that time."
 
Second by Second
 Inside the building, the people like Ms. McClure, Kathy Sanders and Kenneth Beasley sit at sorting machines that shoot letters past their brows at a mesmerizing rate of one per second.
In that second, the workers must read the letter's ZIP code and tap the last three digits on their keyboards, dispatching the letter to the appropriate delivery bin. Some workers say they periodically nod off or lose their rhythm and start making errors.
For workers here, the greatest stress occurs in trying to meet the daytime demands of their families -- caring for children or preparing meals that they often cannot be home to eat. Ms. Sanders, 32, usually works from 5 P.M. to 1:30 A.M. During her 9-to-9:30 break she was having lunch -- popcorn. She has two boys, 4 and 1. Her husband is a road manager for entertainment groups, so he is away a lot.
"I have kind of dozed off at the wheel going home, but only when I have to work until 3:30," she said. "I like the hours because they're convenient for getting my kid to school and picking him up. But I don't get to spend any time with him other than on the weekend."
 
The Workers
Relationships Are Worn Down
 Donna Jones, the divorced mother of a daughter, 3, and a son 16, seems a happy, spirited woman, darting about the lunch room. But she feels the pressure. "My little girl has hair to here," she said, touching her hip. "I try to keep it braided. My son, it was bad for him. He used to beg me every day, 'Momma, quit the job. You don't have to have a job.' I told him, 'This job is keeping you in the jeans you're wearing.' "
Ms. Jones said her marriage was solid until she started working nights. Her husband worked for the Postal Service, too, from 4:30 A.M. to noon. She was getting home then about 7 A.M. He would want to talk as soon as he got home, she said, and she would want to sleep. "He still wanted me to be like I was before, making meals, taking the kids to school. It was hard."
No one monitors changes in family relationships here, but clearly the work is murder on marriages. "When young women come here to work," said Mr. Beasley, a steward for the postal workers' union, "you know what the older women say? They say, 'Honey, if you've got a man, you're not going to have him long.' "
Mr. Tepas, at the University of Connecticut, said that among the groups he has studied the percentages of night-shift workers who are divorced, separated or single are higher than for other workers.
 
Life as a 'Zombie'
 Catherine Skolte, 24, got divorced last October. Before, she would get home at 9 A.M. She said that if she was beginning her two days off then, her husband, who worked regular hours, wouldn't let her sleep. "I'd get stuck staying up 24 to 36 hours," she said. "I would be a zombie. When I would decide to get a rest, he'd get mad."
The workers' health problems are insidious. Alana Farino, who works from 10 P.M. to 6:30 A.M. on the letter-sorting machine, said her eyesight is beginning to fail. Deborah Peterson, who works with her, said she is getting asthma, perhaps from paper dust. Michele Barr, a 25-year-old sorting clerk and an asthmatic before she started working here, said her asthma attacks are more frequent now.
Some people drive themselves to exhaustion. Tom Ditzenberger, 45, works from 3 to 11:30 P.M., driving an electric cart here, and, like some other workers, he has another job. He delivers The Atlanta Constitution to about 250 homes.
"It takes me an hour to get home," Mr. Ditzenberger said. "Normally I get a cup of coffee, sit down, watch the news, set my alarm, lie down on the couch, snooze if I can and get up at 2.
"I leave at 2:30, go to the warehouse, put the papers in plastic bags and I'm on the road by 4. I'm done by 5:30, and by then I'm really out of it. I turn the phones off, close the curtains and go to sleep. I'm up by 11:30." He said he took the second job so he could pay for his truck.
Linda Brown, the nurse at the center from 2 P.M. to 10:30 P.M, said: "They're throwing their bodies completely out of kilter. I see a lot of people walking around in a fog."
Lancy Rocker, the nurse who follows Ms. Brown on what the workers call the "zombie shift," said she sees a lot of workers with stomach problems. "They have real short patience," she said.
 
The Inner Clock
Trying to Fight Ancient Rhythms
 Research supports much of what the nurses and the workers say. Mr. Tepas cited two studies he had done, one of 1,400 Midwestern urban employees of a variety of industries and one of 2,000 employees of factories in small Midwestern towns.
"People who work at night sleep less than anybody else," he said. "On their days off, they cannot make up the loss. We call it chronic sleep deprivation, or sleep debt."
David R. Liskowski, who directed the Office of Technology Assessment project, says shift workers are sabotaging powerful biological processes that are controlled in part by the rotation of the earth. The brain, in response to changing amounts of light and dark, instructs the body to start cooling off at night and warming up at dawn. It commands changes in digestion, breathing, the heartbeat, sleeping, waking and the secretion of hormones.
The cycles of day-to-day changes are known as circadian rhythms. And shift work, like flights across time zones, can upset the rhythms, sending conflicting messages about when to sleep and when to stay alert.
 
Vital to the Economy
 The Congressional study said shift work in the United States is almost entirely undocumented, as well as unregulated. But because shift work is vital to the economy, Mr. Tepas said, "The issue is not whether it should be done but how to do it right."
Some countries restrict the hours people can work at a stretch at night. They mandate extra hours of rest after a long stretch of night work or allow breaks for a nap during a shift. In France, the Government pays 50 percent of a night worker's cost of equipping a home to block out daytime intrusions. Australia requires an extra week of vacation for night workers.
 
The Adjustments
Making the Best Of Odd Hours
 Many postal workers here say what troubles them most is drowsiness driving home. Kathy Wasson, 41, said she is content and healthy now working 3:30 to midnight. Once, on a shift starting at midnight, she fell asleep driving to work.
She slammed into the back of a pickup truck, wrecking her car. She suffered only bruises.
It is close to impossible to find anyone who truly likes the latest shifts, those beginning after 11 P.M., but some say they thrive starting work in the afternoon. They tend to be single or married to people who keep similar hours. They like beating the crowds and shopping when most people are asleep or at work.
A few workers on even the latest shifts say they have found ways to keep families intact and bodies sound. They say they do it by paying heed to their circadian rythms. Biologists say the rhythms can be adjusted to make night people of day people, particularly when they sleep in dark rooms in the day and work in bright light at night.
 
Fooling One's Body
 Rick Harris, a 45-year-old supervisor of the letter-sorting teams, said 20 years in the Air Force taught him that self-control is needed. "I learned in Vietnam that you can fool our body clock for maybe 24 hours," he said. "But you have to discipline yourself."
On weekends, Mr. Harris said, he stays up most of Saturday, when he arrives home around 7 A.M., to be with his wife, who works days during the week, and their children, who are 7 and 12. He goes to bed at 8 P.M. and sleeps 12 hours. Then on Sunday, before his biological clock can put him on a daytime cycle, he starts working back into his weekly routine.
"I go to bed at 5 P.M., take a nap and get up at 10," he said. "I get on my computer until 2 or 3, and then I go back to bed." He sleeps another 12 hours and is then ready for dinner with the family and the start of his shift at 10 P.M. "You have to put your priorities right," he said.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Officer Will Be Tried Again Over Taped Beating

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 15

 BODY:
Sixteen days after violent racial disorders broke out over the acquittal of four white Los Angeles police officers on most charges in the beating of Rodney G. King, a judge today ordered one of the officers to stand trial again on the single unresolved charge in the case.
He left open the crucial question of where the trial would be held, but strongly hinted that he preferred to return it to Los Angeles. 
 The judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, who presided over the original Superior Court trial in suburban Simi Valley, said he granted the District Attorney's request for a new trial for the officer, Laurence M. Powell, mainly on the ground of the evidence presented at the first trial. That included a videotape of Mr. Powell delivering most of the 56 baton blows that struck Mr. King, who is black.
 
Simi Valley Trial
 "Based upon my view of the evidence presented in the just-concluded trial," he said, "I find that the interests of justice require that there be a second trial in the case of People v. Powell." The trial must begin by the third week of July unless both sides agree to a delay.
The jury acquitted Mr. Powell on April 29 on two counts, assault with a deadly weapon and falsifying a police report, but deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of acquittal on a third count of assault "under color of authority." If convicted, he faces up to six years in prison.
Today's ruling opened yet another chapter in the stormy case that has convulsed this, the second largest city in the nation, and rocked police departments nationwide since the amateur videotape of the beating was broadcast in March 1991. The case became the focus not only of charges of excessive force by police officers against blacks but also of whether American courts are colorblind.
Legal experts said that the trial judge had the discretion to approve or deny a new trial after any mistrial, but that a judge would be particularly inclined to order a new trial in a serious or high-profile case. Requests for retrials are usually denied only in minor cases and when the original jury was strongly leaning toward acquittal. The District Attorney's office said that it would be very unusual for the Superior Court to deny a request for a new trial.
In the first trial, after the state's Second District Court of Appeal granted a change of venue away from Los Angeles, Judge Weisberg moved the trial to Simi Valley in Ventura County, a conservative suburban area where a jury that had no black members stunned the city and nation by acquitting on almost all charges. The verdict set off rioting that left 58 dead and nearly $1 billion in property damage.
Judge Weisberg's ruling appeared to have eased the tensions that have been smoldering for two weeks here since the police, the National Guard and Federal troops put down the wave of arson, looting and killing that followed the verdict. "To retry Powell is a beginning of a vindication of the wrong," said Patricia Moore, a black City Council member in Compton, a city adjoining South-Central Los Angeles that was also swept by rioting. "Some mechanism needed to be in place to ease the pain and disappointment. He's going to be retried. That says a lot for the system."
At a news conference after the hearing, District Attorney Ira Reiner, in a tough fight for re-election, said the prosecution strategy would be "essentially" the same, relying mainly on the videotape. He declined to say whether the prosecutors would call Mr. King as a witness. He did not testify at the first trial.
Mr. Powell's lawyer, Michael P. Stone, said he doubted his client could get a fair trial anywhere in California in the aftermath of the riots and the widespread publicity, much of it deriding the jury. "Getting a fair trial in the state of California is going to be problematic," he told reporters. "Getting a fair trial in the county of Los Angeles is next to impossible."
Judge Weisberg has been criticized for moving the original trial to Ventura rather than a large urban county demographically similar to Los Angeles. In court today, he bridled at suggestions that the court or jury was responsible for the rioting.
"A single criminal trial cannot cause or solve the major social and economic and other social problems that exist in society," he said. "It's not the function of a criminal trial, a single criminal trial, to deal with such issues, and a trial cannot solve those issues."
From the bench, Judge Weisberg cited several factors influencing his decision to order a new trial, including the likelihood of different trial tactics, witnesses and arguments, and the lack of what he called the "distraction" of the three other defendants and the charges against them. But "over and above that," he cited "the nature of the evidence that was presented to the jury in the just-concluded trial." He did not mention it, but it was assumed he was referring to the videotape.
 
Questions on Location
 The big legal question is whether the judge can move the second trial back to Los Angeles County. On July 23, 1991, the appeal court ordered it moved because of political turmoil in Los Angeles. It cited a dispute between Mayor Tom Bradley and Chief of Police Daryl F. Gates, efforts by the Police Commission to remove the Chief, and pressure for a vote on a city charter amendment limiting the Chief's term. Judge Weisberg said at the time that he selected nearby Ventura County, which is only 2 percent black, largely for reasons of convenience and costs.
The change-of-venue order remains in place. While Judge Weisberg clearly has the authority to move the trial to another county besides Ventura or Los Angeles, trial lawyers said today it was unclear whether he could move it back to Los Angeles. Judge Weisberg scheduled a hearing for May 22 for the lawyers to argue whether the court has the authority to transfer the case back. He noted that the political situation had changed since last year and that the vote on the charter amendment would take place on June 2, well before the new trial could begin.
He also asked prosecution and defense lawyers to discuss whether the recent publicity over the rioting had been so widespread that it would affect the court's ability to select a jury in any county.
California law allows a judge to set aside an order to change venue on the ground that the conditions that required the change "no longer apply."
 
Fair Trial in Los Angeles?
 Charles R. English, a criminal defense lawyer with the Santa Monica firm of Chaleff, English & Catalano, said that he knew of no precedent for a case like this. If the judge rules that it can be heard in Los Angeles, he said, the defense could appeal, arguing that it violated the appeals court ruling and that even under new circumstances the defendant could not get a fair trial here.
When the change of venue was first ordered last year, a number of other counties were considered, including urban ones like Alameda, which contains the heavily black City of Oakland.
Mr. Reiner, the District Attorney, said that he thought a jury could be found here and that the second trial would be prosecuted by the two lawyers who lost the first one, Alan S. Yochelson and Terry L. White. He said their loss was "a reflection of the point of view of that jury" rather than any prosecutorial short-coming in what many lawyers have described as an open-and-shut case.
"I hope they do as good a job as the first time," he said. "They did a superlative job."

CLOSEOUT FOR ANOTHER RETAILER
The death knell rang for another major New York City retailer as Alexander's Inc. closed the doors at its 11 stores and filed for bankruptcy protection. The budget department store company, merchant to each wave of struggling immigrants, said it would reopen the stores for a close-out sale, then close for good. Its demise will have a significant impact on the New York economy: about 5,200 people will lose their jobs and the vacant stores will enter a real estate market glutted with empty retail space. Page 1.

NEW YORK CITY
DINKINS REJECTS OVERHAUL OF SHELTERS 
 Mayor Dinkins effectively rejected the sweeping overhaul of the city's troubled shelter system recommended by a mayoral commission, saying his administration would study its key proposals over the next 18 months. He did endorse other ideas from the commission, including a pilot rental subsidy program for 200 homeless families and a heavier reliance on nonprofit groups to run shelters. Page 1.
 
FACE TO FACE WITH THE MAYOR
With their battling deputies out of the city, Mayor David N. Dinkins had what was described as an "upbeat" meeting with Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez as they grappled with several budget issues that have strained the relationship between them. While nothing was firmly resolved on the fiscal questions, Mr. Fernandez seemed to appreciate the chance to make his case directly to the Mayor. Page 27.
 
LANDLORDS GUILTY OF BIAS
A Federal jury has found two Brooklyn landlords and a Brooklyn realty company liable for discrimination against black and Hispanic renters, in a suit that lawyers said could make it easier to prosecute racial steering cases. Page 26.

A BOND PLAN FOR NASSAU
Torn, like many other local governments, between adopting crippling service reductions or wrenching tax increases, Republicans and Democrats in Nassau County have reached a consensus to do neither: they want to sell up to $100 million in bonds instead. Nassau's deficit-borrowing plan would be the largest in the state since the Municipal Assistance Corporation sold $5.4 billion in bonds to bail out New York City during the 1970's. Page 29.
 
LAYOFF TROUBLES IN YONKERS
Garbage went uncollected and police calls backed up in Yonkers today, apparently as a result of a work slowdown to protest layoffs of city workers. Even more workers would be laid off under a new budget presented by Mayor Terence Zaleski that would reduce the city work force to its lowest level since 1985. Page 29.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush on Tightrope in Pittsburgh, Juggling Politics and Compassion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, May 15

 BODY:
President Bush collected $350,000 in political donations at a lunch with wealthy supporters today, then sped several blocks to a nearby slum for a show of Presidential concern about the inner city.
The juxtaposition of the two meetings, barely five minutes apart, served to underscore the balancing act that the President must perform in an election year, hoping to present a compassionate response to the urban problems symbolized by the Los Angeles riots, while at the same time seeing to political necessities. 
 Meeting with community leaders in Pittsburgh's Hill district, where unemployment exceeds 40 percent and the drug trade is rampant, Mr. Bush was told, politely but urgently, that the neighborhood desperately needs more Federal spending on social programs.
Mr. Bush assured the dozen or so leaders that their comments had made him "more sensitive" to the cities' needs. Signs that a sprinkling of protesters waved along the Hill district streets said as much. "What took Bush so long to get here?" said one.
 
'We're Trying Very Hard'
 Asked about that perception, the President said that the poor "are not looking for blame," adding, "They want to get something done, and we're trying very hard." Mr. Bush's stop in Pittsburgh was divided between a 90-minute meeting with supporters who paid $1,000 a plate to dine and shake hands with the President, and an hourlong meeting with about a dozen ministers, civic officials, anti-poverty workers and one local barber.
Mr. Bush sought to bridge the two occasions by abandoning his standard speech for fund-raising events, which attacks Congress as the source of most national ills, and talking instead about inner-city zones with tax incentives to encourage business development, Federal job training programs and policies that would expand home ownership.
The day's most moving words came not at the fund-raising event but at the later meeting in the Hill district. There, a well-dressed mix of black civic leaders and white bureaucrats gave Mr. Bush brief lectures about the Federal effort to rehabilitate drug-ridden neighborhoods.
The last speaker was a Hill district barber, Napoleon Buice. In a halting voice, he told Mr. Bush: "There's people out in the Hill. There's drug addicts out in the Hill, that need help. And there are intelligent boys out there who don't have any hope."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Exits on a Kennedy Theme

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 15

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev completed his two-week tour of the United States today with a renewed plea for aid to Russia and praise for the United States as a nation that faced its own problems and set an example for the world.
The former Soviet President's last two public appearances were heavily laden with tributes to President John F. Kennedy, who he said had led the way to an end to the cold war in 1963 with his disarmament speech at the American University. 
 At a luncheon at the John F. Kennedy Library, Mr. Gorbachev said he had been impressed during the national soul-searching over urban policies by Americans who let their "thoughts go out to those whom the American dream, for the moment, has passed by."
"As long as this society can remain dissatisfied," he said, "as long as it does not give in to complacency, we can remain confident that America will overcome its difficulties."
He made the same point again later, before a flight back to Russia tonight, at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he also praised the "longstanding American tradition to be responsible to the hardships of other people and other nations."
"Russia needs support," he added, asking for American assistance, as he had Thursday in a speech to Congress.
 
Praise From Senator Kennedy
 Mr. Gorbachev's tributes to President Kennedy were a constant theme. At Harvard he said the United States perhaps needed "a John F. Kennedy and his legacy." At the library he said Kennedy had inspired his own disarmament efforts. There he was introduced by the late President's brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Senator Kennedy said the cold war had finally come to an end with the demolition of the Berlin wall. "The defining moment for our time," he said, "and perhaps for our century came on that historic day in November 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev said, 'Let the wall come down.' "
Mr. Gorbachev told the 300 guests, from Boston's worlds of business, politics and academia and from the Kennedy family, that President Kennedy's disarmament speech on June 10, 1963, had amounted to a "serious intellectual breakthrough."
He quoted Kennedy as saying then: "Peace need not be impractical and war need not be inevitable. Contacts among nations need not be transformed into an exchange of threats."
Mr. Gorbachev said those comments pointed the way to the end of the cold war even though, he said, Kennedy himself was somewhat inclined to that period's philosophy of "total confrontation."

HEADLINE: EMPIRE IN TROUBLE;
Teetering Giant Worries New York City Officials

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Olympia & York is New York City's biggest commercial landlord and one of its top taxpayers, and while none of its New York buildings are included in the Canadian bankruptcy filing, the real estate empire's troubles have raised shivers at City Hall.
The company's next property tax payment, about $75 million, is due on July 1, and city and Olympia officials said they were exploring whether some or all of that payment might be delayed, and what the conditions might be. For example, under a new payment schedule, Olympia could pledge that if it failed to make payments it would not contest efforts by the city to take possession of the properties involved, though the city would far sooner collect taxes than own real estate.
 
Quietly Exploring Options
 For weeks, Olympia & York's top New York executives and city officials have been quietly exploring how the city might help a company it had relied on for $142 million in property taxes last year -- 2 percent of the city's total. The possibilities range from rescheduling payments to creating new tax incentives that could help Olympia and other landlords with holdings in Lower Manhattan. 
 "Olympia and York is a very important property owner in the City of New York, and a very important taxpayer, and as a result the city would want to be as helpful as it possibly can under the circumstances," Barry F. Sullivan, the Dinkins administration's new Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development and the former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, said yesterday.
Unlike some other big New York landlords, Olympia is not delinquent on any of its property taxes, but in the depressed real estate market, not all of its buildings generate enough cash flow from rents and other income to meet expenses. Senior city officials said the company had put out feelers in January, asking what would happen if its payment arrived late.
Both sides refused to elaborate on their talks, and city officials said it was not clear how much flexibility the law and sound practice would allow. They also stressed that their ability to help was limited by the complexity of Olympia's holdings, concerns about whether the United States subsidiary might also have to file for bankruptcy protection in the United States, and whether City Hall could end up competing with Canadian creditors for claims on Olympia's New York properties.
Olympia's top New York executives, John E. Zuccotti and Meyer S. Frucher, have long experience dealing with city and state government. Mr. Zuccotti is a former first deputy mayor under Abraham D. Beame, and Mr. Frucher was president of the state authority that oversaw the development of Battery Park City and is a longtime adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Zuccotti did not return a telephone call yesterday, and Mr. Frucher declined to comment. They had breakfast with Mr. Sullivan on Wednesday at the Vista International Hotel in Lower Manhattan, across the street from Olympia's World Financial Center complex, to review the situation.
Besides rescheduling tax payments, Olympia could be helped if the city reshaped its Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program to provide tax breaks to landlords in the Wall Street area who renovate their property. More than three-quarters of Olympia's buildings are in Lower Manhattan.
The city has also been studying whether tax incentives should be granted to owners who convert office property in Lower Manhattan to residential use. While none of Olympia's buildings would qualify, the company could benefit if excess office space were removed from the market.
Finally, some city officials said, the city could lease space for some of its own offices in Olympia buildings near City Hall. In the last two years, the city has taken advantage of the depressed market to find premium office space at favorable rents.

HEADLINE: Japan to Aid New Market Economies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 15

 BODY:
Japanese leaders told Vice President Dan Quayle today that after months of coaxing by the Bush Administration, they would lend and invest as much as $400 million in private enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe. But Japan again refused to send substantial aid to the former Soviet republics until four disputed islands are returned to Japanese hands.
Japan's announcement came at the end of a four-day visit here by Mr. Quayle, a trip intended to repair the damage from President Bush's ill-fated trade mission to Tokyo in January and refocus attention on a "global partnership" between the two countries. While both sides declared the trip a success, they also conceded that the most vexing economic issues facing the two countries were deliberately kept off the agenda. 
 The package Japan announced oday included as much as $300 million in loans and $100 million for equity investments in new businesses in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. The United States has committed $1.34 billion to the region this year. According to the State Department, $589.6 million of the American aid is in grants, while $747.8 million is in the form of loans or other assistance.
 
A 'Turning Point'
 Mr. Quayle hailed the Japanese plan as a "turning point" in efforts by the United States and Japan to coordinate aid outside Asia. "Eastern and Central Europe is about the farthest place from Japan as you can get," he said this morning at a breakfast meeting with American correspondents based here. "They have no cultural, they have no historic ties." Yet Japan, he said, has come to recognize that the region has been "much of the catalyst" for democratic changes around the world.
Nonetheless, Japan's contribution is bound to fuel the growing unease here that "global partnership" really means that Japan finances international initiatives for which Washington has run out of money.
Mr. Quayle faced many questions along those lines during his stay. And he repeatedly denied that the Bush Administration's vision for the post-cold-war alliance between the two countries was to use Japan as a silent dispenser of cash.
"If the conventional wisdom in Japan is that global partnership means Japanese dollars and U.S. leadership, it is wrong," he said. "Prime Minister Miyazawa doesn't believe that, I don't believe it, and President Bush doesn't agree with it."
Nonetheless, Japanese officials said today that until several months ago they had little intention of providing such large-scale funding to Eastern Europe. But the United States began pressing for a major contribution, and the negotiations grew particularly intense with the approach of Mr. Quayle's visit, his fourth since becoming Vice President. "Everyone wanted a big score," a member of Mr. Quayle's entourage said.
Japan continued to hold out on the question of aid to Russia and other former Soviet republics, despite growing criticism from France and Germany that Japanese intransigence could doom the effort to convert the republics to viable market economies. In a sharply critical speech at the United Nations earlier this month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said that Japan must "assume a larger share of the West's common responsibility" to assure that the reforms take root.
Mr. Kohl's comments clearly irritated the Japanese, who are trying to get the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to press the Soviet Union to return what it terms the "Northern Islands." The islands, part of the Kurile chain, were seized by the Soviets in the last days of World War II, and arguments over their ownership have prevented the signing of a formal peace treaty.
Mr. Quayle reiterated American support for Japan's claims, but neither endorsed nor criticized Japan's tactic of withholding aid, saying it was "an internal Japanese decision."
The ostensible purpose for Mr. Quayle's trip was to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Okinawa's reversion to Japan, after it was taken in one of the last and bloodiest battles of World War II. Japan seized upon the anniversary as a chance to reaffirm the security relationship between the two countries. Mr. Quayle, who is well liked here and has visited Japan more than any other senior official of the Administration save for trade negotiators, picked up on the theme, scarcely even mentioning cars, closed markets or any of the other issues that dominated Mr. Bush's visit.
 
A Piece of Advice
 At one point, however, Japan's Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, could not resist adding a jab on the topic, asking Mr. Quayle to tell American companies that they should spend less time complaining to the White House and more time investing in Japan. Mr. Quayle did not argue with him, Japanese and Americans present at the meeting said.
And while Mr. Bush was joined in January by automobile executives who railed against impediments to entering the Japanese market, Mr. Quayle met up with Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and other Nixon Administration officials who oversaw the return of Okinawa.
Mr. Quayle also announced that the United States would return to Japan 590 acres of Okinawan territory that is currently used for American bases on the island, where two-thirds of the 56,000 American troops in Japan are stationed. He also said that the United States would cease live-fire exercises on a range in Okinawa that have been the source of local protests, and that the United States would "reinvigorate talks" over the return of additional land, including areas near the port of Naha, Okinawa's largest city.
In a further effort to quell trade troubles, he and Kozo Watanabe, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, announced a "manufacturing technology initiative" under which 100 to 200 American engineers and shop-floor supervisors will travel to Japan to study manufacturing techniques.
"We're coming over here and learning how you do it," he told a group of students on Wednesday at Keio University, one of Japan's leading private universities. "Things have changed dramatically."
Details of the aid plan were scarce today, but Japanese officials said that of the $300 million in loans from the Japan Export-Import Bank, $100 million will be dedicated to Czechoslovakia and $100 million to Hungary. The loans would be extended to government banks and other lending institutions, they said, and then disbursed at commercial rates to small businesses.
About $100 million would flow through the Japan International Development Organization, which mixes the funds of some of Japan's biggest corporations with government money. The organization makes direct equity investments in overseas enterprises, oftentimes including joint ventures.
Japan said its aid would be coordinated with "enterprise funds" from the United States, Government money directed toward private businesses by nonprofit groups, usually headed by American investment bankers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Climbed 0.5% During April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Industrial production rose by five-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Government said today. It was the third strong advance in a row, and analysts viewed it as the latest sign that the economy had turned around.
"It provides some further evidence that the economic recovery is now becoming established," said Norman Robertson, an economist with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
 Lynn Reaser, an economist with the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, concurred, saying: "It's another sign that the economic recovery is taking hold. In contrast to 1991, when the economic recovery stalled in the latter part of the year, it appears that the recovery this year has more staying power."
 
 
Operating Rate Also Rose
 The Federal Reserve report also showed that capacity utilization -- the operating rate of factories, mines and utilities -- rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to 78.7 percent.
The report showed that the growth in industrial production was widespread, "led by a sharp rise in auto production."
Even without the automobile component, output rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers, said that "suggests that the recovery is sustainable, although the pace should be moderate."
The Fed also revised upward, to four-tenths of 1 percent, its initial estimate of March production. That was twice the gain first reported.
Production in April was 2.5 percent above that of April 1991.
Most analysts said the report, together with a big jump in the money supply after two weeks of decline, would almost certainly put on hold any further Fed cuts in interest rates.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy panel, meets Tuesday. Before the latest reports, some analysts had predicted it would ease credit further to make sure the economy did not stumble again as it did in 1991.
Following the Persian Gulf war early last year, industrial production rose through the summer, only to level off last fall, then drop through January. It has picked up since.
Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose five-tenths of 1 percent in April.
Output of generally expensive durable goods, including autos, appliances and industrial equipment, was up eight-tenths of1 percent. Production of non-durable goods, like textiles and chemicals, increased three-tenths of 1 percent.
Mining output rose eight-tenths of1 percent, but utility production dropped two-tenths of 1 percent.
The Fed said its industrial production index in April stood at 108.2 percent of its 1987 base, up from 107.6 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Trucker Who Rarely Backs Down

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEEHAWKEN, N.J., May 15

 BODY:
The New Jersey waterfront has a reputation for producing tough guys and rough talk, and a personal fortune approaching one-quarter of a billion dollars hasn't smoothed all the edges off Arthur E. Imperatore.
The 66-year-old trucking magnate, who has emerged as a central figure in New York's newspaper delivery dispute, has a way of going from prickly to generous to prickly in the span of a sentence. "I'm a very hard-nosed guy, but I truly like people," Mr. Imperatore said with a winning smile, just before his voice fell into a growl, "or I truly don't like them." 
 Making money in short-haul trucking required business acumen and attention to detail, assets widely acknowledged as Mr. Imperatore's strengths in an industry noted more for its muscle than for its finesse. But if getting his way meant squaring off on a loading dock with an uncooperative driver or screaming curses jaw-to-jaw with a labor organizer, Mr. Imperatore never hesitated. "The trucking industry," he is quick to remind the uninitiated, "is not to be confused with Sunday school."
 
A Fistful of Incentives
 Many years ago, when he and three older brothers were starting out in business with a small fleet of beat-up trucks, his temper was legendary. Once, confronting employees who were lounging when he thought they should be working, he pelted them with a fistful of coins and a stream of curses. "If you want my money for nothing, take it," he sputtered. "Take it all!"
Mr. Imperatore smiled at those memories and said he had mended his ways. Most of his temper has been reined in by mellowing age and a contemplation of life that he said he had little time for as a young man obsessed with work and success. "I was almost out of control," he recalled during a five-hour interview on the pavements of gritty towns like West New York, North Bergen and Weehawken, the haunts of a lifetime on the New Jersey side of the Hudson.
But anyone who confuses this moderation with softness on issues he deeply cares about, like his clash with the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, would be cruelly mistaken, he warned.
"I'm a kind of local hero around here," he remarked after stopping to shake hands with a hot-dog vendor and inquire about the man's mother. "The people know I made good in a corrupt industry, and I came out of it with a whistle-clean reputation."
Many people who know Mr. Imperatore were reluctant to be interviewed about him. Even those who consented and had nice things to say refused to be quoted by name.
 
Accused of Being Stalking Horse
 "He's everything he says he is: hard-working, hard-driving and very good to his employees if they produce for him," said a high-ranking industry official. A dissident teamster who also insisted on anonymity said, "He has a reputation of being dictatorial, but he also prides himself on taking care of his drivers."
Members of the deliverers' union contend that Mr. Imperatore, whose Imperial Delivery Service bought wholesale distributors in Westchester County and on Long Island, is a stalking horse for The New York Times. The ultimate aim of the distribution deals, they assert, is breaking the union to clear the way for the opening of The Times's $450 million printing plant in Edison, N.J.
Mr. Imperatore secretly prepared to take over the wholesale operations and quickly moved to dismiss the deliverers' union members after they rejected a labor contract offered by Imperial that would have reduced the union's power and virtually eliminated overtime pay.
Union drivers picketing Mr. Imperatore's distribution centers in New Rochelle, N.Y., and East Farmingdale, L.I., said the replacement drivers hired to continue delivering The Times were non-union "scabs" Mr. Imperatore recruited months earlier from as far away as Oklahoma and Texas.
Imperial's purchase of the two operations legally ended existing labor contracts and allowed the company to build a new work force.
 
'They Could Never Push Me Around'
 The rise of Arthur Imperatore, the man in the middle of this bitter dispute, is a classic rags-to-riches tale with highly individualistic touches printed in every chapter.
The way he tells the story, he was working as a door-to-door salesman after his military discharge (he was a bomber navigator in World War II who never flew a combat mission) when his brothers started a moving and storage business using Army-surplus trucks. He chided them for spending more time drinking beer than developing the business, and was invited to help run things. Soon he was in charge, and he has been giving orders ever since.
"We've made hundreds of millions of dollars in a nickel-and-dime industry, and it was tough work," he said. "There was no 1980's type of speculation money made here. It was a case of constantly making improvements and never compromising on what's right.
"And I did it by never knuckling under to the thugs; I never compromised with the scum," he said, smacking a fist into a palm for emphasis. "I have a scorching integrity." He fired off a string of blunt words about organized crime figures and corrupt union bosses and added, "They could never push me around."
Mr. Imperatore -- the family name, which he pronounces im-PER-a-tor, dropping the final vowel, is Italian for emperor -- said that after a rocky start in the 1950's that involved wildcat strikes, his principal company, the A-P-A Transport Corporation of North Bergen, has maintained good relations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which now represents 967 company drivers and loading-dock workers. Most of the rest of the 2,200 employees are nonunion, said Burton Treborg, A-P-A's vice president for labor relations and administration.
Harold Petsch, the business agent of Teamsters Local 617 in New Jersey, which represents the drivers at A-P-A, did not return several calls seeking comment on Mr. Imperatore and his relationship with the union.
A-P-A owns more than 3,500 tractor-trailers and other vehicles and operates 31 freight terminals around the country. Until the recession, the company had a reputation as the most profitable in the industry relative to its revenues, which in 1991 were $150 million, the owner said.
"A-P-A has always had a reputation as a very profitable and highly effective company," said William M. Legg, a managing director and trucking analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons of Baltimore. "They were very conservative in the 1980's and maintained their market while other trucking companies tried to outgrow their infrastructure and got hurt."
Mr. Imperatore said he had enjoyed good employee relations at A-P-A for decades, but added that he knew his entry into New York's tangled newspaper delivery system would probably create sparks.
It happened in a circuitous way. Mr. Imperatore has been leasing trucks to The New York Times since 1985. Without much fanfare, his Imperial Delivery Service bought two wholesalers several months ago: Westfair Newspaper Distributors, which serves Westchester County, N.Y, and Fairfield County, Conn., and the Newspaper Distributors Company, which serves Long Island.
 
Talked With Times About Wholesalers
 Mr. Imperatore said he completed the purchases -- for more than $17 million -- only after informal but extensive talks with executives of The Times. Times officials, he said, took part in introducing him to the owners of the wholesalers and in negotiating his purchase of them.
Walter E. Mattson, the president of the New York Times Company, confirmed much of Mr. Imperatore's recollection of his relationship with The Times. "We had been very happy with the quality of his trucking operations for us and found him to be a man of great integrity who was committed to his employees," said Mr. Mattson. "He was also able to deal with the unions effectively."
The Times Company encouraged Mr. Imperatore when he expressed interest in entering the wholesale distribution business, Mr. Mattson explained, adding, "He was exactly the kind of guy who would be a great addition to the business." The Times, he said, told Mr. Imperatore of an opportunity to buy a Peekskill, N.Y., distributing operation as a start.
Mr. Imperatore formed Imperial Delivery Service and bought the Peekskill company in December 1989. Imperial officials then set about learning the trade and training a work force with the idea that the skills developed there could ultimately be applied to operations elsewhere in the metropolitan area, Mr. Imperatore explained.
In Peekskill, Mr. Imperatore's company signed a contract with Teamsters Local 917, in New York City. The agreement, he said, gave the local jurisdiction over any newspaper operations Imperial conducted within 200 miles, an area that would blanket New York and its suburbs.
In anticipation of his move into New York this spring, he recruited about 125 drivers over the last five months in case he had to replace roughly 260 full-time and fill-in drivers working under the union contract.
Some, billeted at several hotels near the East Farmingdale distribution center, said they were from as far away as Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Several said they had been unemployed. One driver wore a black T-shirt hand-painted with a drawing of a rig from Arizona. Another said he was a bus driver from Philadelphia.
"I ain't no teamster," said one of the drivers testily in the lobby of the Comfort Inn. "I'm a rebel. We ain't here for no union. I wouldn't ever be here with no union."
 
Childhood Home Behind Fruit Stand
 The trip across the Hudson from an impoverished childhood to the towers of Manhattan has been a lifetime voyage for Mr. Imperatore. One of his earliest memories, he said, was the view from his father's fruit stand on Palisade Avenue at 51st Street in West New York. "I could see them building the Empire State Building, floor by floor, in 1930."
His family, with 11 children, was crammed into an upstairs apartment behind the fruit stand. A brother, Andrew, still lives there.
"Only seven persons could sit in chairs around the table at supper," Mr. Imperatore said. "Some of us had to sit on the ironing board."
Andrew said, "Arthur could never sit still," as his brother's body and trailing voice banged down the stairs after a whirlwind visit. "He could never stop. He was always on the move."
Mr. Imperatore retains considerable energy. He is forever picking up bits of litter on his properties, muttering under and over his breath about a sloppiness he cannot abide and is constantly after his employees to correct. He said his insistence on neatness was part of a strategy to engender respect in the workplace. "Visual surroundings have an impact on people," he said. "Give them a dysfunctional place and they become dysfunctional."
The A-P-A complex is landscaped and spotless. In addition to garages and maintenance sheds, there are an administration building, tennis courts, hobby rooms and a recreation center. The center, which Mr. Imperatore says cost $750,000 in 1973, houses a full-length basketball court, swimming pool and jacuzzi, weight rooms and an aerobics center.
 
'Honest Workman' In Reverent Oil
 In the entrance to the company's nerve center is a shrine-like alcove bathed in soft light that shelters an oil painting called "The Honest Workman." "See that look," Mr. Imperatore said with a nod at the portrait. "We modeled 15 different men to get that look." The expression on the face is something between a Mona Lisa smile and a smirk. "That look says to me: 'Listen, boss. I did a good day's work. And if you don't appreciate it, you know what you can do.' "
Nothing, however, prepares a visitor for the building's executive conference room on the second floor.
"I had it rebuilt three times before I was satisfied," Mr. Imperatore said with a sweep of an arm toward a 16-foot hand-carved table and 10 matching chairs, trimmed in gold and metal-studded leather, standing on an Oriental rug. The walls are covered by gold-trimmed woodwork and rich green Italian silk; a fireplace anchors one end of the room and ornate balustrades the other. Adjoining the room is a glass-roofed atrium filled with plants and a fountain topped by a crouching Venus and, on a lower tier, pipe-playing fauns.
A-P-A's basic principle, Mr. Imperatore said, is that good job performance earns job security.
The company hires only 1 of 50 applicants who go through a long screening, training and probation. For decades A-P-A has subscribed to newspapers in cities where it operates. Articles on arrests are clipped, and the names of suspects go into a cross-indexed computer file. Job applicants whose names turn up presumably begin the hiring derby at some disadvantage.
 
Scrutiny as Intensive As the Vacations
 Drivers and dockworkers who make the grade are brought to North Bergen for interviews with A-P-A's president, Armand Pohan, who is Mr. Imperatore's stepson; Mr. Treborg, and the director of operations. Mr. Imperatore stopped interviewing applicants after turning day-to-day operations over to Mr. Pohan in 1983 and becoming chairman of the board, but he still prides himself on knowing the first names of many workers.
"Nothing comes closer to a marriage than hiring a teamster," Mr. Imperatore often observes. "And it's easier to get a divorce than to try to remove a teamster from a job."
A-P-A has fitted its trucks with recorders that log everything from fuel consumption to stops and starts, measuring performance against company standards. If too many sub-par trips show up on a driver's record, his supervisors may conclude that he is not functioning at the peak level Mr. Imperatore demands. Bad performance can lead to warnings, probation and lengthy arbitration talks to seek dismissal.
Top performers are declared "A-P-A Aces" and get bonuses and other incentives. Sometimes Mr. Imperatore takes the entire staff to places like Las Vegas and the Bahamas.
But he can also be overbearing, and a local joke holds that A-P-A stands for "Always Please Arthur."
Before his venture into newspaper distribution, he spent much time in the last decade planning to build a high-rise "Venice on the Hudson" on a 367-acre tract in Weehawken that he bought in 1981 for $7.7 million. Zoning problems and a weak economy postponed his ambitions and he is using the site as a public recreation area that includes a driving range; his ferry service, which carries 9,000 people to Manhattan daily, and a marina where he docks his 141-foot motor yacht, "Imperator."
Mr. Imperatore has been relatively untouched by stories of scandal. The licensing of his ferries in 1987 came under a cloud when Anthony R. Ameruso, the New York City transportation official, later admitted he had invested in a company associated with Mr. Imperatore's development concern. Mr. Ameruso resigned and was convicted of perjury in connection with his testimony anout the investment. Mr. Imperatore denied any knowledge of the investment.
Local residents who battled the high-rise buildings had mixed emotions about the man who was their adversary.
"He's not someone who sets out to deliberately hurt others, but he's very paternalistic and thinks he knows what's good for everyone," said James Dette, a civil engineer. "He fails to treat others as adults. He wants things done his way."
Ruth Elsasser, president of the Weehawken Environmental Association, said: "He's a very colorful figure who fights hard for what he wants. But in all our fights I never knew him to use underhanded methods."

HEADLINE: ISRAELI CHARGES PRESSURE BY U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 15

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in a published interview today that the United States was trying to force Israel to yield nearly all the territory it had captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Other senior Israeli officials have issued similar charges in recent months, including one Shamir aide who said Israel would be returned to the "borders of Auschwitz" if it went back to its pre-1967 frontiers. 
 But this was the first time the Prime Minister made the accusation, although he has criticized the Bush Administration for trying, in his view, to dictate the course of negotiations on Israel's occupied territories in the Middle East peace talks.
 
Finds U.S. More Rigid
 "The United States really wants to return us to the 1967 borders with minor border adjustments," he told the newspaper Haaretz. "The difference between this Administration and its predecessors is that it shows determination in implementing its position, while other administrations trusted that the issues would be resolved in the course of negotiations."
Nonetheless, even though he has complained that the United States had ceased to be an "honest broker" and was tilting toward the Arabs, Mr. Shamir added that "until now they have behaved acceptably" in the talks between Israel and Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
Like much of the world, the United States has called on Israel to yield territory in return for guarantees of peace with its neighbors. But it has not suggested that Israel give up every inch of land under its control in the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, whose annexation by the Israelis is not recognized by Washington.
 
Cards Close to the Chest
 In any event, Mr. Shamir told Haaretz that he personally was "not capable of surrendering territory," saying that the future of the territories was to be negotiated by his successors. Elections are scheduled June 23, and the outcome is very much in doubt.
"After the violence is stopped and the emotions are calmed a bit, it will be possible to think about an agreed solution," he said. He said he had "all kinds of ideas" about a permanent solution, and added that he had discussed them in the 1980's with George P. Shultz, who was then Secretary of State.
"But I don't want to publicize these ideas," he said, "because if we begin discussing them, we will not achieve any immediate progress."
 
Fragile Relationship
 His remarks highlighted new tensions in American-Israeli relations: This week the State Department reaffirmed its support for a 1948 United Nations resolution that Palestinians say gives them the right to return to Israel and to be compensated for lost or damaged property. The issue is of paramount sensitivity for Israelis of all political leanings, who say that a flood of Arab refugees would overwhelm them and ultimately destroy Israel.
In the interview, Mr. Shamir said Israel should start looking more to Europe for support and not rely solely on Washington, which gives this country $3 billion a year in economic and military aid.
"But Europe still isn't the United States," he said. "From a strategic standpoint, the United States is the only superpower. Europe hasn't reached unity, and it will take time until it does."

HEADLINE: Florio Says He Will Veto Republicans' One-Cent Cut in Sales Tax

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 15

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio said today that he would veto a bill to roll back the state sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent.
His decision sets the stage for a showdown with the Legislature's overwhelmingly Republican majority. An effort to override a veto may be in jeopardy because of weak support among Senate Republicans. 
 "As much as I would like to sign a penny rollback of the sales tax, I cannot sign this one," Mr. Florio said. "We simply have not been given any information. I cannot assure you that the penny rollback would be a good deal, because the Legislature hasn't met its obligation to tell you how you would be affected."
Mr. Florio, a Democrat, intended to make the announcement during his weekly radio address on Saturday, two days before the deadline for action on the bill. His aides gave copies of the Governor's text to some newspapers with the stipulation that the information not appear until after Mr. Florio's taped address was broadcast.
When word of Mr. Florio's plans leaked out to Republicans, among others, the Governor's office lifted the embargo.
Mr. Florio said he would sign the veto on Monday and return the bill to the Legislature with a list of conditions it must meet before he would support a rollback. The conditions include passage of a balanced budget that maintains school aid, homestead rebates, aid to N.J. Transit to keep fares stable and money to municipalities to prevent property tax increases.
The Governor said the Republicans also must promise to stabilize college tuition, provide adequate money to protect the New Jersey Shore and support programs for children, the blind and the physically disabled.
Republican leaders have not disclosed what programs they would cut to cover the revenue losses from the sales tax reduction. That has caused apprehension among the party's rank and file, especially in the Senate, where as many as six Republicans who voted for the bill are wavering in their support of an override.
New Jersey's fiscal year begins July 1. After several missed deadlines, Republican leaders said this week that they would present their budget by early next month.
Mr. Florio had warned the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, and the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, both Republicans, that he would not support the sales tax rollback unless they specified the cuts they intended to make.
Mr. Haytaian announced at the beginning of the week that he would convene the Assembly on May 21 for a session to override a veto. He commands a 58-to-22 majority in the Assembly, where the override is expected to pass easily. The bill to roll back the sales tax passed the Assembly by 54 to 21 on March 23, with solid Republican support.
On Thursday, Mr. Florio invited Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Haytaian to the executive mansion in Princeton, Drumthwacket, to discuss the budget.
 
Response 'on the 21st'
 "Once again they would not say what they plan to cut," Mr. Florio said. "It is sad to say, but the degree of fiscal irresponsibility is startling."
Mr. Haytaian said the Governor would get the Assembly's response "on the 21st."
"The sales tax cut is going to take effect July 1," he told The Associated Press.
But the combative Assembly Speaker had an immediate reaction to Mr. Florio's charge that the Republicans were being irresponsible.
"Has it been responsible for him to present us with a budget three years in a row where the revenue figures are wrong, where we have built-in deficits, where we have one-shot gimmicks to close deficits?" Mr. Haytaian said. "Is that the height of responsibility? I don't think so."
In the Senate, chances of an override are more tenuous, even with a Republican majority of 27 to 13. The rollback proposal passed the Senate on April 2 by a 28-to-1 vote, with a lone Republican, Senator Henry P. McNamara of Wyckoff, opposing it. Most Democrats abstained, but two of them, John H. Adler of Cherry Hill and Raymond J. Zane of Woodbury, sided with the Republicans in voting for the rollback.
Mr. Zane said today that he would not support an override attempt unless the Republicans made public their planned budget cuts and he agreed with them.
Mr. Adler said he was undecided on how he would vote.
"I voted for the rollback when it was presented, and I continue to believe that we really need to downsize the government," Mr. Adler said in an interview. "This particular tax has prolonged New Jersey's recession and it unfairly hurts sectors of New Jersey's people."
If Mr. Zane and Mr. Adler rejoined the Democratic fold on the override vote, the Republicans would have to persuade Mr. McNamara to drop his opposition to the bill and to cajole other Republicans whose support is wavering, party sources have said.
"We will have the votes," Mr. DiFrancesco said today.
To override the veto, the Republicans need 54 votes in the Assembly, 4 fewer than its majority, and all 27 of their votes in the Senate.
Campaigning against a record $2.8 billion tax package that the Florio administration rushed through the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 1990, Republicans pummeled the Democrats in last November's legislative elections. Voters elected Republicans in numbers not only large enough to command the Legislature, but to override Governor Florio.
But as they approach their fifth month in power, Republicans have yet to exploit fully their advantage in numbers, allowing Mr. Florio to outmaneuver them politically on the Legislature's attempt to postpone school elections and to block an increase in the minimum wage to a national record of $5.05 an hour on April 1.
Republicans failed on both of those initiatives because of a rule that allowed the Governor to wait 45 days before acting on legislation. By the time Mr. Florio vetoed the bills the school elections had occurred and workers had already started receiving the higher minimum wage.
"The Republicans feel they have to win the first override," said Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican consultant and a political science professor at Rutgers University. "To have the ability and not be able to carry it out will hurt them. It is not nearly effective to say that we promised, we tried to deliver and mean old Jim Florio didn't let it happen, than to say we promised it and we did it."

Mr. Florio worked in his office yesterday at the State House in Trenton. (Laura Pedrick for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: 11 Closings: The Impact Rumbles In Region

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
Standing on the Bronx corner where he has parked his hot-dog cart for 14 years, Vassilios Koulikordis had a view of the Alexander's closing that was much too close for comfort.
Early yesterday, he watched a stream of employees -- people who buy his hot dogs, sodas and pretzels -- walk up blankly to the row of metal gates at the store on the Grand Concourse, the anchor to the bustling and healthy Fordham Road shopping center. Some hugged. All were stunned. 
 "I come this morning I see 20 women, women I know by their first names, crying like little kids," said Mr. Koulikordis, a 41-year-old immigrant from Greece. "Today for me it's a very sad day. I see the gates close, it's like a member of my family passed away."
But Mr. Koulikordis's sorrow was not only for his friends. Since Alexander's opened its first store on Third Avenue in the Bronx in 1928, the chain served as a strong commercial magnet in several of the neighborhoods where it dressed generations of immigrants and their children in style.
Even where Alexander's was one store among many, the closing was yet another sign of business gone bad. And merchants who thrived because they were close to one of the 11 Alexander's in the city and its suburbs could suffer after the chain's death.
"Without this store," Mr. Koulikordis said, "I can't survive."
 
'Secondary Impacts'
 Employees, merchants and experts around the region compared the immediate effects of the closing to the rumble of a small urban earthquake. The damage, they said, would not be confined to the 5,200 Alexander's employees who lost their jobs and yesterday were met instead with locked doors and white signs that read: "Closed for Inventory."
"There are secondary impacts," said Herbert Bienstock, professor of labor at Queens College. "The guy who owns the garage on 59th Street in Manhattan; What is this going to do to him? The same is true in Queens and Brooklyn and the Bronx. There are satellite businesses that depend on them -- liquor stores, clothing stores and restaurants."
And in the hearts of some shoppers and longtime employees -- some of whom knew George Farkas, the dapper and savvy founder who named the chain for his father -- the passing of Alexander's meant the passing of an era in New York City.
"They provided their lower-middle-class customers with the sense of being well dressed, of getting fashionable clothes at bargain prices," said Alan G. Millstein, editor and publisher of Fashion Network Report.
 
Ferrer Is Confident
 The closing was also a lightning-quick lesson in the market economy. Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, for example, mourned the passing of Alexander's in one sentence, then in the next acted as booster to the overall health of the 325 stores in the Fordham Road shopping district.
Echoing the hope both of Alexander's management and a number of economists, he said he felt confident that a new tenant would move into the four-story brick store that now advertises in big red letters: "Uptown It's Alexander's."
Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said he hoped the same for the other Alexander's sites. He said he was concerned less about the flagship store at 58th Street in Manhattan than with the sites in Rego Park, Queens, or in Kings Plaza Shopping Mall and Marina in Brooklyn, where merchants are already worried about the future of the Macy's store there.
"I would hope that because all these areas are dynamic shopping and retail areas that there will be retailers that come in and replace or succeed Alexander's," he said. "I suspect some are already in contact with Alexander's."
Some real-estate brokers, however, expressed doubt that the buildings would be occupied immediately. Alexander's has sold stores in the past, but may have more difficulty now because so many retailers are besieged with financial problems of their own.
But all speculation about the closings was muted by shock at how quickly the decision came to close a New York institution. There had been rumors and layoffs, but few realized how near Alexander's was to the end.
At the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, L.I., one of three stores outside New York City, customers clutching bags of goods they wanted to return lined up to closed doors.
Hardest hit were the employees, many of whom had worked at Alexander's for decades. Aside from their paychecks, they said they would miss the almost old-fashioned sense of family that the corporation tried to foster from its start. The abruptness was almost worse than the closing itself, they said.
"It would have helped if they told us a month ago -- or at least given us a few weeks' notice so we could start looking for other jobs," said Michael Sobol, a sales clerk from Lynbrook, L.I. "They knew they were going to close down, but wanted us here to the end."
In the Bronx, Mr. Koulikordis, the hot-dog vendor, discussed how his cart has supported his family.
Business was already hurt, he said. By lunch he usually sold as many as five cases of soda. Yesterday at noon he said he had sold only six cans.
His worry prompted him earlier to pick up a red pencil from the cart and scrawl a message on a sign on a metal grate. The sentiment stronger than the spelling, his note read: "I hope your open soon. Hot Dog Man."

I see the gates close, it's like a member of my family passed away," said Vassilios Koulikordis, a hot-dog vendor near the Alexander's store on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, of the store's sudden close. He said goodbye to Francis Ashun, a security guard at Alexander's. (Suzanne DeChillo for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Judge Tells City to Obey Charter And Set Up New Budget Office

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court judge has ordered New York City to create the Independent Budget Office, a city agency mandated three years ago by the new City Charter.
In a decision last Tuesday, Justice Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, rejected the city's argument that "hard economic times" justified withholding financing for the agency. 
 Justice Ciparick wrote that city officials "cannot resort to illegal acts" to avoid complying with the Charter. "The critical point is that their actions violate duly enacted provisions of the City Charter."
The budget office was included in the revised Charter approved by voters in 1989, and was to be operating by Aug. 1, 1990. But Mr. Dinkins has not included it in his budget proposals, and the Council has not appropriated money for it.
The Charter calls for the agency to receive no less than 10 percent of the figure allotted to the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget, which is to receive about $29 million in the next fiscal year.
If the city were forced to create the office, it would mean less money for other city operations in a time of tight budgets.
 
Appeal, Comply or Amend
 Peg Breen, a spokeswoman for the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said yesterday that Mr. Vallone had not yet received a copy of the order and that no decision had been made about whether to appeal it. Other options include complying with the order, she said, or amending the Charter.
The ruling was made in a lawsuit brought by the New York Public Interest Research Group and other advocacy organizations. Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the public interest group, said yesterday that the ruling was a significant victory for the community groups, which support creation of the office as a source of "objective and independent" budget information and analysis. The budget is prepared by the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget and sent to the Council, which has its own budget analysts, for approval.
As the budget has grown and become increasingly complex over the years (a $29.5 billion spending plan has been proposed for the fiscal year that begins July 1), some community groups have complained that it is nearly impossible for those outside government to analyze and comprehend the document. They viewed the independent office as a tool for democratizing the budget process by providing an independent source of budget information.

HEADLINE: Duties Set On Canada Lumber

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
The Commerce Department issued a final determination today that the Canadian Government was improperly subsidizing its lumber industry, a finding that puts further strain on the United States' troubled trade relations with Canada.
The department found that permanent countervailing duties of 6.51 percent should be placed on imports of Canadian lumber, but such duties cannot be imposed unless the International Trade Commission, a United States agency, rules that the Canadian subsidies have injured the American lumber industry. 
 Today's announcement, which is an important step toward permanent duties on imported boards, studs and beams from Canada, will help United States lumber companies compete, but will raise prices for Americans buying new houses.
 
 
Anger in Canada
 The announcement angered Canadian officials and lumber company executives, who said they would press Washington to arbitrate an agreement to the dispute.
"We have always said the whole case is contrived," said Tom Buell, chairman of the Canadian Forest Industries Council, a trade association based in Vancouver, British Columbia. "It's the American consumer who is getting dinged."
But Canadian officials expressed relief that the Commerce Department's call for duties was far lower than the 14.48 percent it recommended in March when it made its preliminary finding of unfair subsidies.
"It should help lower the temperature of this dispute," said Derek H. Burney, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States.
 But, at a news conference today in Washington, Mr. Burney added, "Make no mistake, we continue to believe the case against Canada has no merit."
 
Source of Embarrassment
 Today's decision will be a source of some embarrassment for the Bush Administration, because Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada is scheduled to visit Washington on Wednesday. The Commerce Department was originally scheduled to announce the decision next week, but it moved the announcement forward.
The Commerce Department decision came after months of wrangling between the United States and its largest trading partner in numerous areas, including beer and Japanese-brand cars assembled in Canada.
After months of complaining about low-priced Canadian lumber, the American timber industry applauded the decision, but with reservations. "The final determination on subsidies is substantially below the preliminary one, and to that extent we're somewhat discouraged," said Joseph McCracken, president of the Western Forest Industries Association, a trade group based in Portland, Ore. "But at least they've gone through the process on the merits, and you have to congratulate them for that."
 
 
Economic Damage Is Seen
 Home builders were much less sanguine. "Any duty at this time is bad for home buyers and bad for the U.S. economy," said Robert Buchert, president of the National Association of Home Builders. "If the full amount of the duty shows up in U.S. lumber prices, it will add nearly $300 to the price of a house."
The last step in the process, the final determination of whether there was injury, is scheduled for late June by the International Trade Commission.
Canadian officials said they would seek to establish an arbitration panel under the aegis of the 1988 Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada. They are also asking the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization that oversees world trade, to find the American duties illegal.
According to the Commerce Department, the United States imported $2.6 billion in softwood lumber from Canada in the 1991 fiscal year.
 
 
2 Types of Subsidies
 The Commerce Department found two types of subsidies in today's decision. It said that by charging below-market prices for trees cut on public lands, Canadian provinces subsidized their exports by an average of 2.91 percent. The department also found that an additional national subsidy of 3.6 percent came from British Columbia's ban on exporting raw logs from public lands, a practice that forces loggers to sell to local mills.
Canadian officials call this latter finding hypocritical because Washington also limits log exports from Federal lands.
Until the United States decides next month whether to impose a permanent duty, Canadian lumber companies are allowed to post bond showing their ability to pay the temporary duties on their shipments.

HEADLINE: EMPIRE IN TROUBLE;
Huge Project in London Faces Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 15

 BODY:
Canary Wharf, the huge but half-built office project that crowns Olympia & York's global empire, now faces an uncertain future as bankers here consider whether to continue lending money, run the project themselves or bring construction to a halt.
Olympia & York Developments Ltd. persuaded its main construction lenders today not to force the project into bankruptcy for the time being. "No one is taking a precipitate action at the moment," one banker said. 
 The banks also agreed to continue paying out the emergency 21 million, or $38.2 million, that they granted a week ago to enable construction at Canary Wharf to continue until the end of the month.
 
Some Banks Not at Meeting
 But one bank executive cautioned that 4 or 5 of the 11 banks with construction loans to Canary Wharf were not at today's meeting and that their approval was needed for the agreement to hold.
As Olympia & York's largest project, Canary Wharf represents its dream of building a third London business district to rival the West End and the venerable City. Instead, the project has drained the company's financial strength. The opposition Labor Party contends that the ruling Conservatives are planning a de facto bailout by moving many Government offices to Canary Wharf.
Olympia has every reason for wanting to keep the 71-acre project in East London out of British bankruptcy proceedings. Under British law, the creditors would wield much more influence than they would in Canada or the United States. The decision on how or whether to bring Canary Wharf out of bankruptcy or to liquidate it would be largely theirs.
 
'A Harder Sell'
 But analysts and real estate agents said the bankruptcy filings in North America had compounded the project's problems. By underlining Olympia's financial troubles, the filings could make it more difficult to attract tenants. "It has to make it a harder sell," one of Canary Wharf's real estate agents said.
Canary Wharf has lined up tenants for only about 60 percent of the approximately 4.6 million square feet of available or nearly completed office space. The British press loves to dwell on the project's shortcomings, like its still-inadequate road and rail system.
At a morning news conference held on the 30th floor of Canary Wharf's 812-foot tower, Robert S. Miller Jr., a financial adviser to Olympia, said the relatively small number of banks should make it possible to avoid the kind of grab for assets in Britain that forced Olympia to seek court protection from creditors in North America.
 
Banks Evaluating Options
 But bankers said they could change their minds about pushing Canary Wharf into bankruptcy, depending upon how events unfold. "Banks are evaluating all the options in the current situation following the latest move in North America," said Adrian Russell, a spokesman for Barclays Bank P.L.C.
When the 11 banks agreed to lend more money a week ago, they stressed that their purpose was to give Olympia & York and its 100-or-so lenders time to hammer out an all-encompassing plan for dealing with the company's financial problems.
Mr. Miller said that Canary Wharf's bank debts now total about 1.15 billion, or $2.09 billion -- somewhat more than previously estimated -- including 100 million from the European Investment Bank, a European Community institution.
 
500 Million in Loans Covered
 About 500 million, or $909.3 million, is covered by the bankruptcy filing. Those loans, which come from a small group of banks including Canadian Imperial, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, are backed only by guarantees from Olympia itself, meaning that the banks cannot seize Canary Wharf property.
Additional construction loans of 550 million, or $1 billion, are backed by the Canary Wharf buildings. These loans, not covered by the Canadian filing, come from the 11 banks that have also extended the emergency help, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, several Canadian banks, Credit Suisse, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking and Credit Lyonnais.
Desperate to attract new tenants, Mr. Miller and Michael Dennis, the chief executive of Canary Wharf, tried their best today to persuade the public that the North American bankruptcy filings do not threaten the project or brand it a failure. They called the filings "somewhere between a neutral and a positive for Canary Wharf" because, they said, they would give Olympia time to negotiate a long-term debt plan with all its lenders.
 
An Apparent Achievement
 To many visitors, especially those who remember the decaying piers that once dominated the site, Canary Wharf does appear to be a stunning achievement. Nine sparkling office buildings, a shopping complex, and well-appointed walkways and squares now overlook the Thames.
Tenants include Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Ogilvy & Mather, the International Wheat Council, the International Sugar Organization, State Street Bank, KPMG Peat Marwick, CNA Reinsurance and Telegraph, the publisher of Britain's largest broadsheet daily newspaper.
Canary Wharf also has commitments from American Express, Texaco, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, Lehman Brothers International and Credit Suisse First Boston.
The project's main problem is the British recession, which has caused London office vacancies to soar and rental rates to plunge.
 
Juicy Incentives
 The 40 percent vacancy rate at Canary Wharf would undoubtedly be much higher were it not for the juicy incentives that Olympia & York has offered. Real estate agents say incentives like rent-free periods and furnishing allowances have often trimmed in half the official rents of 25 to 35 a square foot, or $45.46 to $63.65. In addition, Olympia & York has been assuming companies' leases elsewhere or even buying their buildings to get them to relocate to Canary Wharf.
Olympia & York executives are hoping that the British Government, which is overflowing its offices in central London, will soon agree to rent large amounts of space at Canary Wharf.
Since the Conservatives were behind the ambitious program to redevelop the derelict docklands, the Labor Party suspects that the Government is planning to pay above-market rates for space to bail out the project. Government ministers say they will do no such thing.
Mr. Miller said today that negotiations with the Government were continuing but that the company was not seeking inflated rents. "The company has not asked for a bailout," he added.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 15.79, to 3,353.09, on Olympia News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market fell broadly yesterday after Olympia & York, the world's largest development company, filed for protection from creditors in Canada and the United States. Banks, which could suffer heavy losses from Olympia & York's troubles, were among the issues hardest hit.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.79 points, to 3,353.09, putting it down 16.32 for the week. 
 Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 208.8 million shares, up from 200.4 million in Thursday's session.
Stocks in Tokyo and London also fell on the Olympia & York announcement.
Another factor contributing to the tumble on the broader United States market, analysts said, was the expiration of stock index futures and options.
 
Decline Less Than Expected
 Although many investors were made jittery by the insolvency news, the market in the United States did not fall as far as many analysts had thought it might..
"The market acted extremely well in the face of Olympia & York," said Dudley Eppel, managing director of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The bond market, meanwhile, rallied on the Olympia & York news and on speculation that the Fed might ease interest rates. Mark Donahoe, managing director for institutional equities at Piper Jaffray Inc., said the bond rally also helped support stocks.
Stock traders, though, shrugged off the latest economic data. The Federal Reserve said industrial production jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in April, the third straight advance. Economists had expected an increase of only two-tenths of1 percent. Investors, many of whom believe the market is overvalued, want signs of real strength in the recovery.
"The market's tired; it's the early summer blahs," said William E. Raftery, an analyst with Smith Barney.
 
Most Active: Citicorp
 The Nasdaq composite index slid 2.03 points, to 574.43. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.41, to 226.31, while the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.42, to 390.37.
The most actively traded Big Board issue was Citicorp, down 37.5 cents, to $19.625. Other bank stocks that were lower on the Olympia & York news were J. P. Morgan, down 62.5 cents, to $55; Chemical Bank, down 50 cents, to $37.50, and Chase Manhattan, down 37.5 cents, to $29.375.
Among other actively traded issues, the Gap Inc. slid $3, to $33.875, after analysts on Thursday lowered the company's 1993 earnings estimates, and Coca-Cola, up 12.5 cents at $43.25.
Among blue chips, International Business Machines slipped 12.5 cents, to $91.625. American Telephone and Telegraph fell 50 cents, to $42.625.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Dips in U.S. Trading; Gold Prices Move Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower in domestic foreign-exchange trading yesterday because of technical factors and the growing strength of the German mark.
Gold prices ended higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.70 an ounce, up 70 cents from the Thursday close. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $338.50 an ounce, up $1.15. 
 The dollar was mostly higher abroad, but fell in New York. Germany's central bank was reported to be buying marks to push up German interest rates as part of the country's tight monetary policy, said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer in New York.
Currency traders were also keeping an eye on the shares of banking companies worldwide to see if they were affected by news that parts of Olympia & York had filed for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Simon said. Trouble in banking stocks could prompt central banks to lower interest rates, which generally hurts the value of currencies.
One positive influence on the dollar was a report issued Thursday afternoon that the United States money supply rose by a larger-than-expected amount. That was viewed as lessening the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 130.60 Japanese yen, from 129.87 yen at the Thursday close. Later, in London, the dollar rose to 130.15 yen. But in New York the dollar closed at 129.80 yen, down from 130.15 late Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8185, from $1.8215 late Thursday. In New York, the pound strengthened to $1.8220, from $1.81875.
In Europe, $1 bought 1.6145 German marks, up from 1.6140 late Thursday. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.6105 marks, from 1.6115 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
A Good Mix: Social Action With Profits

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
When Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said Thursday that he was likely to back Nelson Mandela's request that the city lift economic sanctions against South Africa, he was in line with one of the fastest-growing investment trends: using economic muscle to forge social change, as well as earn a good return.
The Mayor released a letter from Mr. Mandela, the president of the African National Congress, saying, "We will issue a call to you and other heads of government who have helped our cause to assist in building our economy," as soon as an interim government is established. Mr. Mandela said he wanted "to discuss reintroduction of trade and investment." 
 That is coming full circle; for many investors, both individual and institutional, the first notion of socially responsible investing came in the 1970's, when the Rev. Leon Sullivan called upon American business and investors to avoid putting money into South Africa because of its policy of apartheid then. And the notion quickly spread to other causes.
Janet Prindle, a partner in Neuberger & Berman, and Farha-Joyce Haboucha, a senior portfolio manager at the firm, who head its Socially Responsive Investment Services, said that a decade ago socially responsive investors were primarily liberals who avoided putting money into stocks of companies that offended them -- either because of products like cigarettes or alcohol or because their plants polluted or because they had poor records in employing minorities and women.
"Today it's not just hippies," Ms. Prindle said. People across the political spectrum are investing according to the dictates of their own consciences, believing that business has the power to bring about changes in society. "Some yuppies want to be corporate good citizens," she said.
One difference now, Ms. Haboucha said, "is that we don't approach it so much from an avoidance position as looking for companies that are really making a change -- leadership."
One such company, Ms. Haboucha said, is Brooklyn Union Gas. Natural gas is environmentally sound, and the company has a strong commitment to employing women and minorities, she said, along with "amazing support for community programs and special handicapped programs," and it developed natural gas vehicles.
Neuberger & Berman, which manages $21 billion of investments, bases its investment decisions first on fundamental analysis, screening stocks for good return on equity, strong cash flow, low price-earnings ratios and other such standards.
Next, individually tailored social criteria are considered for the 15 clients, including individuals and pension funds, with $25 million in the firm's socially responsive investment program. Nationally, such investments have grown to $625 billion from $40 billion eight years ago, according to the Social Investment Forum, a Minneapolis-based association.
"There isn't a right or wrong," Ms. Prindle said. "People have to decide what is most important to them." For example, she said, some investors shun Philip Morris, which stacks up well in financial analysis, because they dislike its beer and tobacco products. Others love it because it has a strong record of employing women and minorities.
Wal-Mart Stores, on the other hand, passes the social criteria with flying colors, but it is trading at too high a price-earnings multiple for the firm to hold it, she said.
Douglas E. Salvati, manager of Shearson Lehman Brothers' Socially Responsible Investing Program, which has $60 million under investment, has among his current holdings: H & R Block; Equitable Resources, a natural gas company; Mylan Laboratories, which makes generic drugs; H. F. Ahmanson, a savings and loan, and Superior Industries International, which makes aluminum wheels for cars.
He cited as companies to watch because they are "pure plays" from an environmental standpoint: Air and Water Technology, Safety-Kleen, Nalco Chemical and Betz Laboratories. However, he is not recommending them at present because they are overvalued by his financial criteria.
Neuberger & Berman's program is for clients who want professional management for portfolios of at least $250,000. The Shearson program is similar with a $100,000 minimum. However, investors with accounts of any size can work with individual brokers to use social criteria.
Ms. Haboucha recommended a book, "Investing for a Better World," from the Council of Economic Priorities in New York, as a good way to learn more. Also, mutual funds like the Evergreen family of funds in Harrison, N.Y., and the Pax World Fund, Portsmouth, N.H., appeal to socially conscious investors.
"Some people are concerned that a social screen will limit investment opportunities," Mr. Salvati said, "but we have not sacrificed diversification, and our performance has been competitive." Both he and the Neuberger & Berman team said they had generally outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 on their equity holdings.

HEADLINE: Nassau Plans to Borrow To Cover Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 15

 BODY:
Torn, like many other local governments, between crippling service reductions or wrenching tax increases, Republicans and Democrats in Nassau County have reached a consensus to do neither: they want to sell up to $100 million in bonds instead.
Under the plan, the county will ask the State Legislature for permission to borrow up to $100 million for at least five years, shifting the burden of the county's current fiscal problems to future taxpayers, perhaps in a less recession-ravaged era. 
 While 20 other cities, counties and school districts in the state have resorted to deficit financing to pay their bills, Nassau's deficit-borrowing plan would be the largest since the Municipal Assistance Corporation sold $5.4 billion in bonds to bail out New York City during the 1970's.
"Every door you open to get out of this morass or maze, you are confronted by a monster worse than the one you faced before," said Bruce Nyman, a Democratic Supervisor from Long Beach. "This doesn't seem to be getting better. Every time you come up with a solution it makes things worse."
 
The Latest Calamity
 The consensus emerged from private staff meetings during the last few weeks, after the latest fiscal calamity -- a newly disclosed midyear deficit of $130 million in a budget of $1.8 billion -- in a county that is among the wealthiest and most heavily taxed in the nation.
The staff consensus followed months of stormy efforts to fashion political and fiscal solutions to the county's problems in the Board of Supervisors, where, under a weighted voting system, neither party has a ruling majority and government has ground to a halt.
At one point Democrats had sought unsuccessfully to block the Republicans -- who had ruled the county for three-quarters of a century -- from issuing paychecks to political employees. Deals have been announced only to fall apart hours later in bickering and name-calling.
At one point the leader of the Democrats, Lewis J. Yevoli, a supervisor from Oyster Bay, said he would never talk to Joseph N. Mondello, the leader of the Republicans on the board, without a stenographer present. But as the county's problems worsened -- tax receipts fell short, cutbacks saved less than expected -- a small team of budget and fiscal staff members began quiet diplomacy.
 
2-Year Tax Freeze
 The fiscal aides are to present the plan to the Board of Supervisors and the County Executive next week. It would freeze county taxes this year and next, avoid any more layoffs (more than 1 in 10 workers has already been laid off) and stabilize the county's budget for two years.
The board will be given a choice of options to cut the budget further -- including significant employee givebacks. Any remaining deficit up to $100 million -- officials hope to keep it to $35 million to $50 million -- would be made up by deficit borrowing, to be paid back during the next 5 or 10 years. The new borrowing would come on top of the county's current long-term debt of $1.62 billion.
The plan was hailed by both Democrats and Republicans, who have grown fearful of anti-tax sentiment among voters since last November's election.
In fact, much of the current fiscal trouble stems from budget cutting initiated by Republicans on the board. They vowed to slash the size of county government after the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, proposed a budget with a 25.6 percent property-tax increase.
 
Halting Further Layoffs
 But after more than 1,500 full-time and 800 part-time workers were laid off and county legislators faced weekly demonstrations and warnings of catastrophe from county workers, the legislators called a halt to further layoffs, fearing they would cripple county services.
"We are trying to prevent a tax increase next year in this difficult economic climate, without reducing any more services in the county than we already have," said Mario Colleluori, a fiscal adviser to the Democrats and a member of the staff committee.
He said that without any action now, property owners are looking at a tax increase of nearly $300 per home next year. "Supervisor Yevoli is adamantly opposed to any tax increase," he said.
David Vieser, a spokesman for Mr. Gulotta, said: "Everyone is cognizant that the borrowing has to be part of, but not the only exclusive element of, a comprehensive plan to address the county's budget shortfall."
 
Moody's Is Watching
 Officials of Moody's Investors Service, which lowered the rating on county bonds from A1 to A, said they would be watching the move carefully.
Michael Johnston, a vice president at Moody's, said the agency would have serious concerns about deficit financing unless it was part of a "serious plan" to resolve problems.
"It is not the kind of thing we take for granted, especially in the circumstances of the last 24 months, when the performance of the county has been strained at best," he said.
Local business leaders are also wary of the deficit financing plan.
"If it is a multiyear borrowing for a current-year expense, we would certainly oppose it," said James L. Larocca, the president of the Long Island Association. "History shows us those kinds of obligations tend to roll over and over and over."
Mr. Larocca said that instead the county could continue to cut spending to close its deficit.
"It takes political courage to bring government down to the size that the private economy can support," he said.

Wistful Irish Folk-Rock

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
The Saw Doctors aren't afraid to wave the flag. On Thursday night at Tramps, they sang about arriving in Ireland's County Mayo by boat, seeing "where the ocean kisses Ireland" and wishing they could "stay forevermore." A band sidekick strode onstage with a huge green-and-red (the colors of County Mayo) flag, and waved it while the full house cheered. It was only the group's first song.
From there, the Saw Doctors went on to sing about romance, music and homesickness, with the crowd joining in on songs from the band's album, "If This Is Rock-and-Roll, I Want My Old Job Back" (Solid, released in Ireland). Fans also swayed to waltzes, jumped up and down, climbed on shoulders and collided with one another: slam-reeling. 
 Beloved in Ireland and virtually unknown in the United States, the Saw Doctors sold out two shows at the newly expanded Tramps. The six-man band plays Irish folk-rock with a fondness for 1950's and 60's rock- and-roll, from Buddy Holly to the Beatles. Mandolins and accordions tickle the melodies of rocking reels; in chugging mid-tempo tunes, Leo Moran plays twangy low guitar lines recalling Duane Eddy.
Instead of the politically charged anger of the Pogues (from England), the Saw Doctors offer wistfulness, humor and small-town nostalgia. Their songs cite their roots in Tuam, a town near Galway.
The songs are those of regular guys who are more likely to be romantic also-rans than to find bliss. Davy Carton sings in a reedy, earnest voice, recalling first love or asking, "Why do I always want you?" And the details are homey, self-effacing and proudly local. "N17" is about missing a favorite road; a band member held up a green street sign from home.
A few songs address Irish emigration, suggesting "the Pied Piper's come to Ireland and he's living on the dole." Others touch on the strife in Northern Ireland; the band sings about being "freedom fighters with mandolins," adding, "We're looking for some peace." There's no rancor, no blame.
While some lyrics, like those of "Presentation Boarder," are obscure to non-Irish listeners, most of the songs are good-natured, trim and catchy, and the Saw Doctors perform them with appealing fervor, bounding around the stage. Behind the local color is good-humored resilience and a sense of place that outsiders can enjoy along with the bouncy tunes.

What Are The Rules, Exactly?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
New York is basking in the glow of celebration and pushing forward. Chicago, on the run for much of its seven-game series with the Knicks, has finally run out of running room.
The defending-champion Bulls have been backed into a corner and if the situation weren't so desperate it would be embarrassing. 
 No one expected the New York Knicks to be playing basketball in mid-May, and certainly no one expected them to be hounding Chicago and actually closing in for the kill in a seventh game on the Bulls' home court.
The most surprised person of all may be Phil Jackson, the Bulls' head coach, who finds himself searching for an escape hatch out of this second-round nightmare.
Judging from comments he made earlier this week following Game 4 in New York, Jackson might also be searching for an alibi to explain the Bulls' failure to put away a team that they were supposed to sweep.
In the midst of the unbridled passion surrounding New York's success, Jackson, hinting that officials had something to do with Chicago's problems, said that the N.B.A. would probably be delighted to have a seventh game involving two of the nation's three largest markets.
What angered the league about Jackson's comments is not that he said that the N.B.A. wanted a seven-game series, but that he suggested that the N.B.A. might actually be conspiring to force a Game 7 by its choice of referees. "I don't like orchestration, it sounds a little too fishy," Jackson said, "but they control who they send as referees."
Dave Checketts, the New York Knicks' president, complained to the league and Jackson was fined $2,500 yesterday for his comments.
The notion that "we wuz robbed" has long been the anthem of disgruntled fans, players and coaches. What makes this compelling is that the head coach of the defending N.B.A champions implied that referees might be involved in manipulating the outcome of a playoff game for economic reasons.
If that is not a direct slap at the integrity of the game, it certainly helps raise doubts about how much of what we watch is spontaneous competition.
Although Jackson's fine was light, he has done himself and the Bulls a disservice. And he has certainly done New York a disservice by suggesting that the overachieving Knicks needed calculated help from N.B.A. officials to push Chicago to the brink of elimination.
At every turn, it seems, Chicago -- and Jackson in particular -- has insinuated that favoritism or in this case, N.B.A. politics, has played a role in New York's success against the Bulls.
For three years, Chicago complained about Detroit's bruising style of play in the playoffs. The Bulls tried the same tactic this year, but when the Knicks kept muscling, Jackson no longer directed his complaints to the officials but at them.
Obviously, everyone makes money from the playoffs, from owners to vendors to parking attendants. The longer each series lasts the better: A dramatic series usually means higher ratings for networks, and higher ratings mean higher rates charged to advertisers.
But would a league conspire to stretch a series for the purpose of milking it for all its financial worth? That would require the cooperation of players, coaches and, as Jackson hinted, officials. Despite what they say about officials, my guess is that most fans feel that referees do about as well as they can under difficult circumstances.
Officiating is a learned craft and a subjective art. On virtually every play, an N.B.A. ref could make a call. There is always some sort of holding, hitting, bumping or three-second violation to chose from.
Maintaining a flow is essential, so what becomes important in officiating is timing. When is a foul a foul? What is good defense? What constitutes brutality? Officials can determine the outcome, and perhaps this is what has frustrated Jackson as he's watched his Bulls get shoved around by a New York team that seems convinced that Chicago cannot shove back.
The Bulls are in a corner, but officiating didn't put them there. They are in a corner because Pat Riley devised an effective system of rotating toward Michael Jordan when he drives, blocking his path, cutting off his passing lanes, keeping him on the perimeter, making him work at both ends of the court.
Chicago is in a corner because the Knicks have tested the depth of Scottie Pippen's resolve and so far Pippen has failed the test.
The Bulls are in a corner because New York has backed them into one. It's a little late in the game to cry foul.

HEADLINE: One Investor's Guide to Making Money

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
After two decades as an investment adviser to the rich, Michael Stolper has developed principles of investing -- and specific portfolios using mutual funds -- that are intended to move middle-income people into the ranks of the affluent.
Aside from the way money compounds over time, which financial experts often call the eighth wonder of the world, there is nothing magic in the approach that Mr. Stolper spells out in his new 266-page book, "Wealth: An Owner's Manual" (Harper Business, $20). 
 Indeed, more aggressive approaches to investing could produce greater returns for people with the time, discipline, knowledge of financial markets and risk tolerance to engage in active portfolio management.
But most Americans have not assembled large portfolios because they lack one or more of these attributes. Mr. Stolper's book can help people overcome these deficits: his advice is readily understandable, and his plans are feasible, provided people have enough self-control to spend less and save more.
Mr. Stolper, 46 years old, received bachelor's and master's degrees in finance at the University of Oklahoma. He worked for six years as a broker at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles before founding Stolper & Company in San Diego.
He said he became convinced that the best way to serve clients was to direct them to professional money managers. Today, he is helping guide more than $3 billion in investable assets for some 400 clients.
"The best thing money is going to do for you is make your life a little more pleasurable and give you some security," Mr. Stolper said. "Time and compound interest are probably far more influential than being sophisticated."
Thus, he recommends two investments -- common stocks and Treasury securities -- and suggests avoiding complicated instruments like collateralized mortgage obligations, options, collectibles and junk bonds. "Most investments that your average adolescent can't get on first pass are probably inappropriate," he said.
In a new newsletter, Mutual Fund Monthly ($49 for 12 issues; the address: 525 B Street, Suite 1080, San Diego 92101), that he started for middle-income investors, Mr. Stolper has put together four portfolios using mutual funds that invest in his favored holdings of stocks and Treasury securities.
The same four appear in each issue of the newsletter, with updated figures on how the funds in each portfolio have performed. Diversification is "the core element in any investment program," he said. "Blending mutual funds provides an additional level of diversification." He said he had chosen exemplary fund managers whose "funds are unlikely to rise or fall at the same pace, a phenomenon that is annoying in bull markets and comforting during periods of declining stock prices."
Despite that disclaimer, the performance of the portfolios in the bull market of recent months has scarcely been disappointing. The most conservative of the four portfolios is one Mr. Stolper calls Sanctuary, because it is intended for risk-averse investors like retirees. If $1,000 had been invested in it on Jan. 1, 1991, it would have grown to $1,227 on April 30, 1992. That is a 22.7 percent return, or 16.6 percent over 12-month period that ended April 30.
His Harvard 2010 portfolio, intended to provide for the college education of a child in 10 to 15 years, would have grown to $1,456, for a 45.6 percent return over the 16 months, or 32.5 percent over the last 12 months.
 
Smallest and Greatest
 The Sanctuary and the Harvard 2010 portfolios showed the smallest and greatest returns, respectively, among Mr. Stolper's four plans.
Mr. Stolper said that the portfolios are "not for action junkies," because "your best investments are the ones that involve the least intervention -- they have a high shelf life." Market timers would disagree, but few people, including investment professionals, are actually able to make the right calls for quick in-and-out trades.
A primary reason for writing the book and starting the newsletter, Mr. Stolper said, was to counter the abundance of what he called irresponsible advice in other publications that promise rewards without risk. Finance does not work that way, but the risks can be limited by balancing one against another.
"Part of what I wanted to communicate was how to integrate consumer finance with passages in life," he said. "Most people want to get to where they can sleep through the night, and if that conflicts with optimal economics, it is time to twist the financial dials" to give a greater sense of security.
The secret to investing in a mutual fund, he added, is to find competent and honest managers "with long histories of repetitive successes."
 
 
 
BRUSHING UP ON FINANCE
 Investing is only one aspect of getting one's financial house in order, and there are many books that can help consumers with this and other aspects of personal finance. Here are some of them.
THE COMPLETE FINANCIAL GUIDE TO THE 1990'S: by Gary L. Klott (Times Books/Random House, $22.50). Covers a host of subjects, including the job market, paying for college and retirement, taxes, real estate, borrowing and investing.
THE PRICE WATERHOUSE BOOK OF PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING: by Stanley H. Breitbard and Donna Sammons Carpenter (Henry Holt, 1988). Now out of print, this is one of the best sources for getting a sound understanding of personal finance.
KIPLINGER'S INVEST YOUR WAY TO WEALTH: by Theodore J. Miller (Kiplinger Books, $21.95). The editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine explains the basics of the stock and bond markets and covers such topics as choosing a broker or investing in mutual funds.
HOW TO MAKE YOUR SHRINKING SALARY SUPPORT YOU IN STYLE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE: by Michael K. Evans (Random House, $23). The chairman of Evans Economics, an econometrics advisory company in Washington, provides a basic education for a relatively aggressive approach to investing, one that, with diligence, can pay off.
THE DEAN WITTER GUIDE TO PERSONAL INVESTING: by Robert M. Gardiner (NAL Books, $4.99). The former chairman of Dean Witter Financial Services gives basic explanations for a variety of investments, from the common to the esoteric.
THE BOND FUND ADVISOR: by Werner Renberg (Dearborn Financial Publishing, $24.95). A journalist looks at bond funds, the most popular of the mutual funds.

HEADLINE: Why I'm Not Marching in Washington

BYLINE: By Charles Millard; Charles Millard, Republican-Liberal, is a member of the New York City Council.

 BODY:
New York City should receive more Federal funds. But you will not see me marching in Washington today to make that point.
What's more important is that while the city would benefit from additional Federal finances, its largest problems lie closer to home. With a budget of $30 billion, the city ought to have properly maintained, clean streets -- with more police officers on them -- safe and effective schools and health care for the needy 
 Instead, the city's Department of Transportation, which gets Federal funds, has dug up 14th Street for necessary repairs, hurting businesses and causing congestion, only to announce that, after the work is completed, the Transit Authority will rip up portions of it for other work.
We raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars to put more police officers on the streets, but we cut police department civilian personnel, resulting in an increase of officers behind desks. Sanitation department employees work a half day for a full day's pay and get a $17 to $23 bonus because they spend the half day on two-worker instead of three-worker trucks. Our public schools spend nearly three times as much per pupil as parochial schools, yet the parochial schools are safer and provide better education. With this management, when Federal funds are limited, can Washington can really consider our city a good investment. Would you invest in a corporation run this poorly? I wouldn't.
The marchers are likely to point out that the Government's financial contributions to New York City, as a percentage of the city's budget, shrank from 1980 to 1990. But Washington's share of those budgets became a smaller slice of the pie, in part because the city profligately expanded the pie. It added 50,000 employees to the payroll, giving us 575 municipal employees for every 10,000 residents, compared to 344 in San Francisco, 199 in Philadelphia, 146 in Chicago and 145 in Los Angeles.
Critics who say the Bush Administration lacks an urban policy are misguided. It has long recognized that existing approaches are wasteful, and has proposed new ones that invest in people. It wants to eliminate outmoded programs such as job training that provides few marketable skills, and the bureaucracies that surround them. Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has advocated helping the urban poor to own their apartments or manage their housing projects. He has energetically supported the creation of urban enterprise zones, which offer tax incentives to create businesses in blighted areas.
Home ownership, tenant management in U.S.-owned or subsidized housing projects and entrepreneurship in enterprise zones all encourage creativity in business development and provide people with a stake in their community and power to improve their environment. They seek to reduce poor people's dependence on the Government to manage their housing and provide their incomes.
Although proposals for enterprise zones have been part of G.O.P. urban policy since the early 1980's, the House Democratic leadership -- and some Republicans -- showed little interest until this year. The Democrats cynically attached the enterprise zone proposal to a tax bill President Bush had pledged to veto. Now after the Los Angeles rioting, when it is evident that bipartisanship is necessary to save our cities, some Democratic leaders -- along with more Republicans -- are expressing genuine interest in these proposals.
So, if the marchers want more funds for housing, I agree. If they seek more for mass transit, I hope they succeed. But if they really want something new from Washington, they should urge the House Democratic leaders to approve an urban agenda that brings useful ideas to the table.

HEADLINE: Now Give Stability a Chance in Lebanon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The resignation of the Syrian-imposed Lebanese prime minister, Omar Karami, and the massive popular demonstrations in Lebanon against the politics of the Taef regime (news article, May 7) raise the question: What comes next? 
 Regardless of who succeeds Mr. Karami, the economic and political situation in Lebanon will not improve because the new "cabinet" will be no different from the previous one. Syria will bring back people submissive to its will whose incompetence and corruption will not alleviate Lebanon's crisis. The members of any Syrian-appointed cabinet will include individuals who are figureheads and effectively controlled by Syria.
To gain from this crisis, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria will seek to control the Bank of Lebanon under a joint governorship between Lebanon and Syria and will force the Lebanese to surrender everything in exchange for bread and "peace."
According to Syrian officials, the Brotherhood treaty signed between Lebanon's Hrawi regime and Syria in May 1991 "supersedes the agreement at Taef and absolves the Syrian army from a required withdrawal [in September 1992] unless Syria and Lebanon deem it in their joint interests." Syria will not redeploy its troops and intelligence network from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley in September. The world community must not wait until then to search for an alternative to Syrian-imposed officials to challenge Syria's intransigence.
The vast majority of the Lebanese people support the legal and legitimate government of Gen. Michel Aoun in enforced exile in France. He is considered the only viable alternative to salvage the country from the continuing economic deterioration and creeping Syrian annexation. Hence, the United States must support a solution that coincides with the wishes of the Lebanese people by restoring the legal cabinet led by Prime Minister Aoun.
The opportunity for a real progress toward stability in Lebanon and the region should not be squandered again. The United States should be encouraged to take a decisive and courageous step toward freeing Lebanon from the Syrian Army and meeting the aspirations of the Lebanese people.

And Bear in Mind
(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)
BLACK WATER, by Joyce Carol Oates. (William Abrahams/ Dutton, $17.) A 26-year-old woman drowns when a senator's car goes off a bridge; but the point of view in this powerfully imagined novel belongs to the victim, whom we are made to know and whose tragedy we are made to comprehend.
VERY OLD BONES, by William Kennedy. (Viking, $22.) The sixth novel in the author's Albany cycle is a sort of excavation into the past of his own career as a writer, where the undoing of gloom and the reconciliation of family members are central themes.
DE GAULLE: The Ruler 1945-1970, by Jean Lacouture. (Norton, $29.95.) This final volume in Mr. Lacouture's monument to the colossus particularly features de Gaulle's foreign policy (alliance but independence) and his theatrical methods of getting his way.
A MAN'S PLACE, by Annie Ernaux. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $15.95.) An autobiographical novel that confronts the author's painful growth into incomprehension as she becomes a French intellectual while her father remains a hardworking shopkeeper.
THE BRIDE PRICE, by Grete Weil. (Godine, $20.95.) Mrs. Weil's beautiful novel, her first to be published in English, interleaves a narrative of King David and his infidelities with her own life as a German Jew who returned to Bavaria in 1947.
INTOXICATED BY MY ILLNESS: And Other Writings on Life and Death, by Anatole Broyard. (Clarkson N. Potter, $18.) Urbane, lyric, witty and gracious essays written mostly in his last 14 months by a former editor of The New York Times Book Review.
THE SHRINE AT ALTAMIRA, by John L'Heureux. (Viking, $19.) A stark, cleanly told novel of guilt and redemption following a hideous act of child abuse; the climax is unspeakably terrible.

HEADLINE: Everything Under the Sun

BYLINE: By Howard W. French; Howard W. French is the Caribbean bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:

A CONTINENT OF ISLANDS
Searching for the Caribbean Destiny.
By Mark Kurlansky.
Illustrated. 324 pp. Reading, Mass.:
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.
$22.95. 
 ANYONE possessing more than a cursory familiarity with the disparate collection of nations that dot the Caribbean might sense that Mark Kurlansky had his work cut out for him with "A Continent of Islands: Searching for the Caribbean Destiny."
Mr. Kurlansky, who has reported on the Caribbean for The Chicago Tribune and other publications, seeks to create a coherent whole from a collection of colorful and far-flung geographic scraps, and he begins by introducing the unwieldy label "Caribbeans" to link peoples who almost unfailingly identify themselves by using their own countries' names.
Despite this and other unifying efforts, which are often built around fine descriptive passages and telling anecdotes, many readers and longtime visitors to the area may come away from this enterprising work as convinced as ever that the Caribbean is not a continent. For the book's vivid cataloguing of diversity in a region composed of sixteen independent countries, three French departments, five British colonies, two hard-to-define United States possessions and six semi-autonomous members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands suggests that the "Caribbeans" remain many peoples, their destinies perhaps as varied as their origins.
Decades of failed or still frustrated attempts at regional integration, some of which the author himself discusses, stand as testimony to this fact. So do cultural realities that, perhaps more than ever, make the Caribbean's inhabitants identify more often with people in Madrid, London, Paris, Amsterdam or New York than with one another.
The flaws of his organizational conceit aside, Mr. Kurlansky provides a highly readable introduction for anyone who cares to delve more deeply into the Caribbean and its cultures than any travel guidebook would permit. He brings an exuberance to his material and offers interesting discussions on topics ranging from the environment and AIDS to emigration, the condition of women and economic development.
To illustrate, for example, a timeless theme like the movement of people out of small nations that cannot support them to richer lands with greater opportunities, the author visits Santigron, a vanishing village in Suriname whose population has dwindled from 13,000 two decades ago to only about 300 now. "I don't want to go to Holland and have a car and a color television" as most of his neighbors have done, one of the remaining villagers touchingly explains. "I want to have those things here."
The book's greatest rewards come when Mr. Kurlansky moves beyond the merely topical to provide rich insights into the region's cultural makeup and historical legacy. He is particularly strong on matters of race and religion.
Illustrating the flip side of immigration, the expatriate life awaiting all those who leave behind their snug native surroundings, the author interviews the celebrated St. Lucian poet Derek Walcott about the uncomfortable discovery of another country's notions of race. "I live in America," says Mr. Walcott, a resident of Brookline, Mass. "In America I'm a black man, steadily from day to day. I don't think about it, but you encounter a glance."
DISCUSSING the struggle among religions, both more or less indigenous and imported, for which the area has been a battleground par excellence, Mr. Kurlansky describes a Roman Catholic priest in Haiti who condemns his voodoo counterparts, known as houngan, for delivering "a message of fear, never of liberation." But the next passage goes on to provide samples from a Catholic catechism, which hardly sound liberating: "Question: 'Who is the principal slave of Satan?' Answer: 'The principal slave of Satan is the houngan.' "
Then there is Knolly Clarke, an Anglican priest in Trinidad who speaks with frustration about the limits of his church's appeal to a people with still-strong African roots. "Our people believe in the reality of evil," he says. "People come here and ask me for a charm against evil." But the Anglicans do not dispense charms.
While Mr. Kurlansky's "Caribbeans" may have failed to forge anything resembling a cultural or political whole, he illustrates, in anecdotes like these, what is arguably an even more important point. In their various ways, all of these peoples have taken what they would from masters, colonizers and missionaries, and fashioned societies that are very much their own.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
In Boston, A Blend of Wit And Pathos

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
THESE HAVE NOT BEEN FLUSH times in the art world, and they've been particularly rough on the Museum of Fine Arts here. Largely because of a costly expansion program in the 80's, combined with serious lack of foresight, the museum has incurred multimillion-dollar problems. It has laid off dozens of employees and entered into an agreement to rent parts of its collection to a new museum in the Japanese city of Nagoya. Less controversially, and like an increasing number of museums around the country, it has also begun to stress exhibitions based on its own collection instead of expensive loan shows.
Richard Artschwager's smart, and in places unexpectedly affecting, exhibition is an example. On view through July 26, it is the last installment in the museum's Connections series, overseen by the curator of contemporary art, Trevor Fairbrother. For the series, artists were invited to juxtapose their own works with works from the collection. 
 These in-house presentations have proved to be one of the few positive byproducts of the recession, but they are by no means foolproof. The Museum of Fine Arts also has on view an ill-conceived and crass exhibition called "Crosscurrents," which ends today. The gussied-up display, complete with faux columns and canopied benches, includes about 100 of the institution's European and American Impressionist paintings, insensitively and simplistically placed side by side to prove what most visitors already know: that Impressionism was an international movement. Post-Impressionist works are included, apparently to make the event bigger and more glamorous.
The real purpose of "Crosscurrents," of course, is to exploit the popularity of the Impressionist loan extravaganzas that museums like Boston came to rely on to help pay for their expansions, but which they now can hardly afford. During the 1970's and 80's, museums attracted visitors by stressing temporary spectacles at the expense of their own holdings. Now they are paying the consequences with desperate shows like this one, which masquerades as a blockbuster.
The aim of Connections is entirely different. Like similar series at the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and elsewhere, it has been consistently stimulating because it promotes focused, fresh thinking about the permanent collection. (Where else would one see fifth-century Japanese bells fruitfully paired with a 14th-century Sienese panel painting?) And because the collection is linked with the work of the artist who puts the show together, it is presented not as something stodgy but as vital and alive.
Of course selecting the right artist is crucial. In the 69-year-old Mr. Artschwager, the museum chose someone who has spent three decades using unlovable industrial materials like Formica and Celotex to question the notion of the exquisite art object. His works are ironic and intentionally hard to place since they blur the boundaries between furniture and sculpture, painting and photograph, Pop and Minimalism, abstraction and representation. Not surprisingly, he has been an influence on many artists of the 70's and 80's.
Mr. Artschwager's choice of works for this exhibition is characteristically eccentric and obscure. The goal sometimes seems to be to point out the banality of museum installations in which objects are placed together merely because they are related in size or color. To this end, Mr. Artschwager has hung a minor French still life between the two parts of his own "Untitled (Diptych)" (1963), and put a brightly colored Monet landscape beside "Pig/Pig" (1984), with its streak of acid blue.
He has even suspended a 19th-century landscape directly in front of his "Garden II" (1974), a black-and-white painting that becomes like a shadow of the landscape, while the one work blocking the other also sends up the idea of compare and contrast.
The installation could hardly be more different in certain respects from the Connections show Brice Marden put together a year ago. Mr. Marden's presentation, like his work, was consistently elegant. There are works here that exult in their ugliness. Mr. Artschwager's gigantic chair of oak, Formica and steel, with its obscenely patterned cowhide upholstery, can bring to mind a trap about to snap shut. His "Contemplation" (1991) consists of a hulking table with bulbous chrome cutlery and Formica legs that seem to be melting into the base on which they rest. Between "Chair/Chair" and "Contemplation," he places a garish near-life-size Chinese earthenware figure from the 11th century.
Mr. Artschwager insists that a viewer consider a work not only for its content but also as an object on a wall or floor. The show, in two adjacent galleries, is arranged as if it were installation art, with idiosyncratic gaps between groups of works, the empty spaces sometimes punctuated by one of the artist's signature lozenge-shaped "blps." A lot of attention is paid to the sculptural implications of the rooms and in particular to corners. In one corner, a small hinged door hangs next to a big Ellsworth Kelly canvas whose curved outline echoes the shadow that the open door casts on the wall. On the other side of the painting is one of those tiny "blps," a comical David to Mr. Kelly's Goliath.
Despite its deadpan humor, the installation demands serious and careful observation. And with patient looking, works by Mr. Artschwager that seem at first glance simply chilling can reveal themselves to be tinged with a peculiar melancholy. His strange objects put into sharp relief the distance between mass production and individual craftsmanship. And just as he can revel in ugliness, Mr. Artschwager can also imply a respect for the mundane materials he favors, not as kitsch but as plain-speaking things that have voices of their own.
In one case, he places a painting of flowers by Courbet and his own monochrome "Sailors" (1972) on each side of a big Formica crucifix, as if to simulate a war memorial. In another part of the exhibition he creates a sequence of three works, the first a late-18th-century painting of two children, the next a severe image of his own called "Men's Dormitory" (1966), the last a Lamentation by the 16th-century German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder. The grouping describes a downward spiral from youth to death.
The last ensemble of works in the show sums up Mr. Artschwager's blend of wit and pathos. He hangs his own tear-shaped "Glass Drop" (1969) beside a beautiful fresco fragment of the head of a cherub, painted by a follower of the Italian Renaissance artist Correggio. This sentimental touch is undercut by Mr. Artschwager's wry sculpture in the shape of an exclamation point. He leaves a viewer off balance and looking at things anew -- which is precisely what one wants from a series like Connections.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Brighton Beach;
Revising (Again) a Plan for the Baths Site

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN Florida it was easy. A decade ago, it took the developer Stephen Muss, president of Alexander Muss & Sons, based in Miami Beach, only six months to win approval for his 750-unit Towers of Quayside in North Miami.
Now the Brooklyn-born builder is in his sixth year of trying to win New York City's approval for a large-scale residential redevelopment called Brighton by the Sea on the 15-acre site of the Brighton Beach Baths in Brooklyn. If built, it would give Brooklyn its first market-rate high-rise waterfront development in a generation. 
 His third plan for a residential rezoning is working its way through the city's public land-use review process. The two others were withdrawn, the second after an unfavorable vote by a City Planning Commission of diminished membership during the transition between mayoral regimes two years ago. A hearing before the City Planning Commission on the subsequently revised plan is scheduled for June 10.
On May 6, the revised plan had a public hearing before Borough President Howard Golden, a new step in the review process established by the City Charter revision of 1989. It brought out the nature of the latest revision. It also brought out supporters and opponents -- the latter unswayed by the reduction in the number of apartments and the elimination of a Florida-style health club -- and, for the first time at a public hearing on the plan, it brought out Mr. Muss himself.
"I just wanted to establish in your mind, Mr. President, that I am a 'Brooklyn boy,' " he said. He grew up on Ditmas Avenue and East 22d Street, went to public school on Glenwood Road and graduated from Erasmus Hall High School.
The third Brighton Beach plan, like the second, is the work of Costas Kondylis Architects of Manhattan. It provides 1.8 million square feet of residential space (down from two million in Plan 2). Instead of 1,730 apartments there are 1,600. The first plan had 2,096.
The number of buildings remains constant at five, forming a wide V oriented toward the beach as before. But the shapes have changed. Instead of straight towers they now dip down in steps toward the water. Two buildings drop from 28 floors at their peak to 22 floors; two others drop from 24 to 18. The effect is to provide more apartments with better views, plus more open space between buildings, the developer says.
The principal tower, closest to Brighton Beach Avenue, is 29 stories. It has been sited closer to the avenue, behind two new small parks rather than retail space as in the earlier plan. The sight lines have been straightened so passers-by on Brighton Beach Avenue will get unobstructed shorefront views. The developer would provide 1,700 spaces of covered on-site parking.
One major change is the dropping of an elaborate 44,600-square-foot public health club. Instead, there will be an "accessory" health club, for tenants only, of 34,200 square feet, built mainly below the level of the central court. From the boardwalk, therefore, no structure will obstruct views of the landscaped court and its walkways.
All the comparisons are between Plans 3 and 2. There was also a Plan 2A, submitted as an amendment to Plan 2 in a vain last-ditch effort to salvage success at the Planning Commission the last time around.
At the four-hour hearing in Borough Hall,36 individuals spoke in favor of Plan 3, saying it would help Brighton Beach and construction employment, and 21 spoke against it. Neighborhood opposition leaders objected to a "superblock without access to the waterfront" and "high-rises that would tower over the neighborhood." Fear was expressed that the Coney Island sewagetreatment plant would be overtaxed.
One opponent, Irwin Fruchtman, a former New York City Buildings Commissioner, predicted that the development would not be built even if approved. "The developer won't build at all," he said. "He'll only increase the value of his land six times."
Actually, the developer will only increase the land value if he is correct in assessing the market attraction of the site for residential development at the prices he will have to charge. That would trigger construction. A developer's belief in the future of the market is essential for continued residential renewal citywide.
MR. MUSS, for his part, says he will move ahead to develop plans and test the sales market expeditiously if the revised plan is approved. Final plans would be not be ready before the summer of next year if the plan wins final approval within four months. "There could be changes in the market by then," he said. "The New York market ebbs and flows like the rest of the world."
The market test would involve preconstruction sales for a single tower, the one at the waterfront end of the site of Coney Island Avenue. The strength of sales would determine how soon other buildings would follow. Mr. Muss also said he would hope to find an investment partner. That could be another New York builder.
He does not intend to sell the land without developing it, he said. If there is no market to build, he said, there is none for the land either. But construction could be done in five phases over time, rather than all at once.
Mr. Muss, who is 63 years old, is one of the 37 grandchildren of Isaac and Annie Muss. Isaac Muss was a carpenter who arrived in the United States in 1898 and built houses in Brooklyn in the 30's. All six of his sons went into the real estate business. One was Hyman Muss, whose son, Joshua, now runs the Muss Development Company in Forest Hills, Queens.
Another was the late Alexander Muss, Stephen's father, who built in New York and Florida. His final New York development was the 28-unit co-op at 733 Park Avenue, at 71st Street, probably the highest of high-end co-ops when it came on the market in 1969 as a housing recession was beginning.
Unable to find buyers at what were then imposing prices -- $250,000 for full-floor apartments of 3,000 square feet -- Mr. Muss rented the apartments with purchase options. Renters typically exercised the option in 1977, after the market had turned upward again, at prices by then pegged about 10 to 15 percent above the option prices, Stephen Muss said. In the late 70's outsider prices for these apartments were about $2 million, he said.
From 1952 through 1968 Alexander Muss & Sons built 20 subdivisions with about 20,000 houses under the name "Country Village" in Queens and New Jersey and on Long Island. The firm also built about 4,000 multifamily units. In 1962 operations shifted to Miami Beach. The five buildings of Seacoast Towers were built on Collins Avenue in Miami Beach, with 1,400 apartments.
Stephen Muss went on independently to build 1,200 apartments in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States in Miami Beach, North Miami and Key Biscayne. And in 1978 he bought the 1,206-room Fontainbleau Hotel with financing from Equitable, and did a $100 million reconstruction. It is now the Fontainbleau Hilton, the "largest oceanfront convention meeting space in the world," Mr. Muss says. In Brooklyn he is acting as a principal in Alexander Muss & Sons, in which sisters who are also Alexander Muss's heirs have a stake.
The latest development plan is expected to win the support of Borough President Golden, who spoke in favor of promoting market-rate housing growth at the hearing, although there may be a request for adjustments.
The Brooklyn office of the Department of City Planning has been instrumental in the revisions of the current plan. Some planning commissioners may yet seek to leave their imprint on it as well. But the chairman of the Planning Commission, Richard L. Schaffer, endorsed the basic concept of utilizing the land for high-rise housing.
"It is a large site that has immediate access to mass transportation," he said. "It is a good site for major residential development."

HEADLINE: Recession Is Ravaging Architectural Firms

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
EMPLOYMENT in the architectural industry in New York City has dropped 23 percent in the last two years, forcing firms to alter fundamentally -- and perhaps forever -- the way they do business.
"It will never be the same again," said Michael A. McCarthy, a partner in Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, one of the largest firms in New York and the nation. "Beginning work in this city in 1964, I've had the chance to see a lot of ups and downs. This one, to me, is without a doubt the worst." 
 John Burgee and Philip Johnson ushered in the new era of commercial architecture in the 1980's with their A.T.&T. headquarters on Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets.
"Our major practice, the one that we were known for, was high-rise buildings," Mr. Burgee said. "It seems that that building type has not only slowed down, it's vanished. It's not a matter that competition has gotten stiff. It has disappeared."
A. Eugene Kohn, a founding partner of Kohn Pedersen Fox in Manhattan, said he believed "this recession has been more extreme than most and did more damage to architectural firms."
Now, having shrunk, firms may decide to stay smaller. Rather than opening new offices in distant cities or hiring experts in special building types, they may rely increasingly on alliances with other firms. And rather than adding full-time staff when work comes in, they may continue to hire temporary employees.
For want of high-profile skyscrapers, more architects may try their hand at hospitals, jails, courthouses, schools, laboratories, public housing or mass-transit projects -- commissions that some might have spurned a few years ago as involving too much bureaucracy or specialization and too little creativity or money.
"Developers collected architects the way they collected art in the 80's," said Jerry A. Davis, managing principal in the New York office of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, which is based in St. Louis. "There's been a realization on a lot of firms' parts that they need to begin adjusting the focus of their practice."
They will also be competing for work farther and farther afield. "One of the best things about New York is that it has three airports," said John Belle, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle.
Young architects will find that the traditional entry provided by drafting jobs has been foreclosed by computer-assisted design. Thwarted by the economy and technology, they may foresake traditional design work entirely for careers in real estate, government, teaching, construction, environmental preservation or nonprofit organizations.
Although some practitioners think they have detected the germ of recovery in recent months, the picture still looks bleak. The number of jobs in architectural services in New York City dropped to 6,482 last September from 8,424 in September 1989, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
The developer of 565 Fifth Avenue, at 46th Street, is promoting the 30-story structure as "the only Manhattan office building scheduled to be topped out this year." And unless the New York Exchanges Headquarters gets under way in TriBeCa, there may be no major commercial construction in the foreseeable future. Long-delayed developments include Times Square Center, by Mr. Burgee and Mr. Johnson, and Columbus Center, on Columbus Circle, by Skidmore.
New York City is not alone in its distress. As a rough gauge of the situation, the American Institute of Architects keeps track of classified newspaper advertisments for architectural positions. By this measure, employment demand has dropped in almost every major city. But it has plummeted in the Northeast. The number of positions advertised in Boston, for example, fell 89 percent from 1987 to 1991.
"There's a shaking out of offices," said Richard Brooker, a principal in the Architects Collaborative, of Cambridge, Mass., and San Francisco. "Some have gone right to the edge. Some have survived. The recession has caused people to re-look at how you practice architecture."
"WE are never going to reach the employment levels we demanded in the 80's," said Martin D. Raab, senior managing partner of Haines Lundberg Waehler in Manhattan. "We are never going to be fully employed at the level we've been turning out students. Last year, we lost 4,000 jobs and gained 4,000 students."
Or put another way: "About 80 percent of the class doesn't know what it's doing for the summer -- people are planning on flipping burgers or waiting tables." That was the assessment of Neil Platt, who has just finished his first year in Columbia University's graduate architecture program.
"I had a thesis class last year of six students," said Michele Bertomen, an assistant professor of architecture at the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip, L.I. "At least three of them still haven't found work in an architectural firm and they're extremely well qualified."
Even those with jobs are affected. It can devastate morale to watch coworkers depart.
"You get the sense that only in rare instances are they going to be able to find a new job," said Gerald B. Olanoff, who has worked in the Burgee firm and at Davis, Brody & Associates. "There's also the uncertainty about your own position. It gets everybody down and depressed. And it makes the office a tense place."
Mr. McCarthy said: "We've cut back by more than 50 percent. That has to have a tremendous impact on the creative talent of the city. It will be like 1973-74, when a large number of people left the profession or left New York entirely. There will be some degree of brain drain.
"We don't see a way out, a real turning point, until the end of the decade," Mr. McCarthy said. "If you're talking about no significant work until the latter half of the decade, you're talking about a situation that is somewhat similar to the 1930's."
In New York, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has shrunk to 200, from a peak of 425 at the end of 1988. Nationwide, the firm employs 700 people, down from 1,600 in 1988 and a high of 2,000 in 1981. Kohn Pedersen Fox is down to about 290 people, from a high of 350 in 1988 and 1989. Beyer Blinder Belle is down to 50 people, from 150 two years ago. Haines Lundberg Waehler has actually grown to 210 people, from 170 people two years ago, but is still 20 percent smaller than it was in the 80's.
Mr. Burgee's office has shrunk to 30 people, about half its former size. In a separate development, the firm has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code as a result of a $16 million judgment against it in favor of a former partner. A financial program is being prepared to allow the firm to continue operating.
Traumatic as it has been, the shake-up in the profession does not signify a complete collapse. "With all of the gloom and doom, I don't know any firms that were around five years ago that aren't here today," said Paul Segal, of Paul Segal Associates.
And there are even advantages to the wrenching process of streamlining -- at least from the principals' perspective.
"IT'S high time," said David M. Childs, the chairman of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. "We've cleaned house and it's been extremely healthy. We've been forced to make decisions we knew we had to make five or six years ago that we didn't want to make or didn't have time to make."
The recession, Mr. Kohn said, prompted Kohn Pedersen Fox to explore new kinds of buildings and technology, overseas ventures and smaller but architecturally challenging commissions. "The negative is obviously the sadness of letting go of very good people you care about," he said. "But the chance to rethink the structure and the philosophical approach of your firm is a good thing."
"We're in a new business," said Richard Roth Jr., chairman of Emery Roth & Sons, a 94-year-old firm. "We saw the handwriting on the wall that architecture is not going to be the bread and butter of the 1990's, so we formed an interiors company" -- Emery Roth & Sons Interior Design/Facilities Management. The new company will probably generate 35 to 40 percent of all income for Emery Roth this year.
Leon Moed and Raul de Armas, two longtime partners at Skidmore, left last year to form their own eight-person firm, Moed de Armas, with an office in downtown Manhattan. Mr. Moed believes that the small firm "is where the world is heading."
"From a client's point of view, first and foremost, he's confident that the principals are totally aware and in command of his project," Mr. Moed said. "Because of this intimacy, there's a certain efficiency. That isn't to say all of this doesn't rely on a network of professionals that you can involve on a selective basis."
The formation of strategic alliances is coming to play an ever more important role, in and out of New York City. "What we find ourselves doing a lot lately is teaming up," said Perry K. Neubauer, the president of the Architects Collaborative. Typically, his firm will do the design work and then a local architect will do construction documents.
Such alliances can be critical at a time when architects are stumbling over one another in a search for what little work there is. Much of it comes from government.
"Everybody is in everybody else's pea patch," Mr. Brooker said. As a result, local authorities are pressured by local architects not to do business with out-of-state firms. "There's a kind of Smoot-Hawley tariff act going on," he said.
Alliances are made to overcome not only geographic limitations but also shortfalls in expertise. "In order to win large government projects," Mr. Kohn said, "you almost have to associate with other firms. Rather than hiring expertise, you associate with firms that have it."
"A lot of commercially oriented firms are now trying to scramble around to develop an understanding and expertise in the institutional market -- health care and criminal justice buildings," Mr. Davis said.
And with good reason: "Those firms that have specialized in the health-care industry have tended to be healthiest," Mr. Raab said.
Institutions seem to offer another bright -- or brightening -- spot for architects.
"We do buildings for colleges and universities, and those seem to be happening," said Frances Halsband of the firm R. M. Kliment & Frances Halsband. "We're talking to a few people who are doing little projects in the arts and museum world. House clients have started to call us. That's a very good sign, that people are willing to look ahead and imagine themselves building houses."
Lenore M. Lucey, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, said: "Within the last few months, things have started to move. It's moving like an iceberg, but it's moving. In general, there is a sense that while this year will not be a good year, it will begin to get better. A few firms have actually told me they're hiring."
There are, however, some permanent constraints on employment growth. One of these is computer-assisted design, known as CAD.
"Not only can we do more production work with CAD," Mr. Belle said, "but CAD will also make offices think much more carefully before they staff up -- if they have the opportunity to staff up."
Despite such obstacles, the profession still attracts newcomers. Ms. Halsband, who is dean of the school of architecture at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, said "more students than ever are applying."
"It's surprising, and I guess reassuring, that students don't seem to plot a whole career choice because of something going on this minute in the economy," she said. "Another piece is that many grown-up students are coming back to go to graduate school. The theory is that if things are slow, it's a good time to learn more."
One prospective graduate student, Stuart Magruder of Manhattan, majored in architecture as an undergraduate at Princeton University but decided not to continue his studies and took a job in advertisingToday he is thinking about a master's degree.
"It may be the best time to do it," he said, "going to school now and getting out in a couple of years, when the oversupply of office space will probably be leveling out a bit. I look at it as an opportunity."

HEADLINE: Groundwater

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Stephen Hess, president of the developers' Association for a Better Long Island, is correct in saying in his letter on May 3 that groundwater can be protected by cluster development with covenants guaranteeing perpetual open space for the rest of the property. But location, type and overall development density are much more important. 
 For example, within the nine designated watersheds (Special Groundwater Protection Areas)that supply all of the Island's aquifers, the fast-disappearing open spaces are so vital to the quality of the groundwater that the Long Island Regional Planning Board has recommended five-acre residential zoning for the remaining large undeveloped tracts. These areas, about 25 percent of the Island, are the major precipitation recharge areas to the aquifers.
Five-acre zoning is already in place in several Nassau villages (Brookville, Matinicock, Mill Neck, Muttontown and Upper Brookville), and in four Suffolk towns (Brookhaven, Easthampton, Southampton and part of Southold). Five-acre zoning has also been upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals.
Open spaces in the Special Groundwater Protection Area watersheds are as important to the groundwater and ecnomy of Long Island as the Catskill and Croton watersheds are to New York City's reservoirs and economy. Clustering should be employed whenever a large tract is developed within a Special Groundwater Protection Area in order to preserve Long Island's water supply; with the number of units per cluster limited to the number based on five-acre zoning of the overall property. If developers and environmentalists can agree on this, cooperation can replace obstructionism, and the Island's economic recovery can begin.

HEADLINE: Finding Those Who Owe Child Support

 BODY:
The article "State Hunts 300,000 Who Owe Child Support" (April 26) reports that there are in New Jersey alone "some 300,000 parents who owe an estimated $1.3 billion." Incredible!
Now that tests are capable of positively identifying a child's father, why don't we use them to do just that? With his Social Security number on nationwide computers, a percentage of his salary could be withdrawn and sent directly to his children -- no matter what state he is employed in. 
 Knowing that such action will be taken might motivate men to assume more responsibility for birth control -- something women have been demanding for years. It should also assure more children the birthright of being wanted and help achieve the touted goal of zero population growth.
The article indicates that the New Jersey Division of Economic Assistance plans to stop attempts at collection after three years of failing to locate the delinquent parents. Why? These deadbeats might one day win the lottery. Does the I.R.S. have such a moratorium?

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Cleaning Up on Pollution

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
After years of hypothesizing among economists and utility experts about the wonders of emissions trading, the Wisconsin Power and Light Company last week became the first utility to announce that it had actually sold pollution credits.
The company, which expects to build up the credits by exceeding Federal cleanup goals, sold the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Duquesne Light Company the right to emit an additional 25,000 to 35,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, the main ingredient of acid raid. In buying the credits, which can be used starting in 1995, the T.V.A. and Duquesne are in effect buying more time to install cleanup equipment or switch to cleaner fuels. 
 For Wisconsin Power, it was a case of doing well by doing good, but not for the first time, said Erroll B. Davis Jr., the president and chief executive of the utility's parent, WPL Holdings Inc. The company, based in Madison, is far cleaner than the average utility because of Wisconsin's strict environmental laws and its own determination to cut emissions.
For example, Wisconsin Power recently opened what it says is a first-of-a-kind plant to turn old tires into a fuel supplement for coal-burning electric plants. Six pounds of shredded tires are burned with each 94 pounds of coal. The rubber has about 25 percent more energy content per pound than coal and is a cheaper source of heat. Rubber also burns hotter than coal, and raising the boiler temperature helps cut some emissions, Mr. Davis said. "The only ones objecting are the mosquitoes, because we are eradicating part of their breeding grounds," he added, referring to abandoned tires.
Mr. Davis, 47, who has degrees in finance and engineering, came to Wisconsin Power in 1978, after stints at Xerox and Ford. He has been president since 1987.
The sale of the emissions allowances will have a modest effect on the company, adding between $10 million and $20 million to annual revenues of more than $1.3 billion. But Mr. Davis said the sale underscores Wisconsin Power's efficiency of operation.
"There is little we can do in the utility industry that represents sustainable, competitive advantage," he said. "We have to be as aggressive, creative and quick-moving as possible to sustain that advantage."
"I don't know what we will come up with next," he added, "but I'm not going to accept the responsibility of being the sole creative person here." Mr. Davis said his object was to "create an atmosphere that empowers people at lower levels to do things differently. That's very different from what you'll find in most of this industry."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
The Risky Business of Selling Short

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Do you believe that health-care stocks are still too pricey? That interest rates will spike, pushing down bond prices? Or that the stock market will stumble badly?
Mutual fund investors who saw trouble ahead in the financial markets once had no choice but to park their money in money-market funds. Now there is a way to stay invested and still profit from market declines: selling mutual funds short. 
 Short selling, an investment technique traditionally used by people who trade individual stocks, is available for fund investors from Jack White & Company, a discount brokerage based in San Diego, and Fidelity Investments in Boston. To sell short, you borrow shares from your broker and then instruct the broker to sell them. If the market drops, you buy shares on the open market at a cheaper price, replace the borrowed shares and pocket the difference as profit.
In selling funds short, the borrowed fund shares come from a pool held by the broker for other customers. Brokers reserve the right to require short sellers to cover their positions at any time. With actively traded stocks, that rarely happens. But because the supply of fund shares is limited to inventory held by the broker, this risk is higher with funds than with individual stocks.
Fund investors who want to sell short have to set up margin accounts, which lets them invest money borrowed from the broker. At both Fidelity and Jack White, investors need cash or securities equal to at least 50 percent of the value of the shares sold short. After that, collateral in the account must total at least 30 percent of the value of the shorted shares. If the value of the borrowed shares rises substantially, the broker may ask for additional collateral.
Investors who sell stocks short are wagering that a single company's fortunes will decline. A mutual-fund manager's goal is to avoid losing money, no matter what happens in the market. Thus, in selling funds short, you are betting not only that a market segment will decline but that a particular fund will not effectively counteract the decline.
That is a big bet, which Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, calls "a dumb idea." He said, "Investors are better off picking a package of stocks and shorting them instead."
Both Jack White and Fidelity concede that short selling is risky. Today Mr. White says that half of his firm's short-sale business comes from professional investment advisers; the balance involves "particularly active investors." At Fidelity, short selling is confined to fewer than 200 active investors.
Fidelity was first on the market with a short sales program in late 1987; the program was closed in November 1989 because of a lack of interest, said Judith McMichael, a Fidelity marketing manager. Because of customer demand, Fidelity revived the program, which it began actively marketing at the end of March, she said.
With a total market value of all outstanding short positions equal to $10 million and 158 transactions in April, short selling constitutes a minute part of Fidelity's total $2.5 billion business in the 10 Select Portfolios for which short selling is available.
The Fidelity Select Portfolios that are available for short selling include American Gold, Biotechnology, Precious Metals and Minerals and Food and Agriculture. Fidelity Select funds focus on narrow market sectors. Investors pay the usual brokerage commission for their sales but are exempt from the 3 percent front-end charge. Funds are priced hourly from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.
At Jack White, there are roughly 110 funds available for short selling, in more than 13 fund groups, all of which are no-load funds. Like regular fund investors, short sellers get the price at the close of the day.
Jack White has an inventory of $50 million worth of fund shares available for short sellers. While short sales account for less than 10 percent of the company's total no-load fund transactions, Mr. White says the program, set up about two years ago, is growing rapidly. As investors continue to move away from individual securities in favor of mutual funds, the "trend toward short selling will continue," he said.
Clearly, short selling is not for novices. At Jack White, typical short sales are $50,000 transactions. Fidelity cautions that the program is designed for aggressive investors.
What makes short selling so risky? While stock prices can fall only to zero, limiting your loss to the amount that you invest, there is no limit on how high share prices can rise. In fact, most mutual funds refuse to sell securities short because the technique is considered too speculative.
Which funds are good candidates for short selling? Obvious bets are sectors that have run up tremendously in value. The health-care sector was the big winner last year, rising 74.4 percent. While the stocks stumbled in January, some analysts say they have more room to fall. Another expensive sector is financial services, 1991's second biggest gainer, up 60.6 percent.
Investors who want to bet that interest rates will rise can short bond funds. In all cases, pick funds with volatile share prices because they will probably react most sharply to market declines.

Running Out of Maneuvering Room 

With $18.5 billion in debt, a worldwide real estate slump and its $7 billion Canary Wharf project in London largely unrented, Olympia & York, North America's largest developer, did not have much room to maneuver. Still, under the guidance of Paul Reichmann, the family-owned enterprise held on for two months while it negotiated with creditors. Last week, it all caved in. Bondholders, tired of waiting to be paid, threatened to seize Olympia's First Canadian Place Tower in Toronto. To prevent that, Olympia and 29 of its companies filed for protection under Canada's bankruptcy laws. Its companies with American assets filed under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Having its properties protected"will permit more time to focus on the long-range issues" of debt renegotiation, said Robert S. Miller Jr., Olympia's financial adviser. That still leaves bondholders wondering when they will be paid.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Remaking T.W.A., in a Week
 
In between buying three paintings at Sotheby's last week for $1.5 million, Carl C. Icahn, chairman of the bankrupt Trans World Airlines, reorganized operations. Not only did he renegotiate an agreement to sell 40 landing slots and three gates at Chicago's O'Hare to American Airlines for $500 million in zero coupon bonds, but he also announced that T.W.A. would change its route structure. To keep ticket prices low, T.W.A. will send passengers through "mini-hubs," he said -- smaller airports like Minneapolis, Atlanta and Midway in Chicago -- instead of major hubs like O'Hare. And rather than buy new planes to replace its geriatric fleet, Mr. Icahn will lease planes for short periods of time. "You use the planes for the summer and then give them back," he said.
 
A Match Made in Hollywood
 
MGM Pathe Communications and the bankrupt Orion Pictures Corporation are both on Tinseltown's disabled list. MGM has a boffo distribution channel and lots of money (it is controlled by Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank) but no films to sell. Orion has 10 unreleased films but no money to distribute them. Though its film "Dances With Wolves" was a hit at the box office last year, Orion filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code two months ago; it owes creditors $500 million. Last week, MGM said it would bid for Orion. Though three other studios have made offers -- Savoy Pictures Entertainment, New Line Cinema and Republic Pictures -- analysts like an MGM-Orion combination best. "The financial capability of the backers is what makes the difference," said Jeff Logsdon, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles.

Softer Suds -- in Name Only
 
People buy high-test brews, like malt liquor, to get more tipsy, anti-alcohol activists say. The Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau doesn't mind the extra alcohol in these products, but it's not happy when brewers give them macho-sounding names, since it believes this encourages consumption. Two months ago the bureau stopped the G. Heilman Brewing Company from selling a potent malt liquor under the Power Master name. Last week Heilman said it would soon start marketing a new malt liquor called Colt 45 Premium in Philadelphia. Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the bureau, said the agency would not prohibit sales of the renamed suds. That was dismaying to the activists. "I'm outraged," said Alberta Tinsley Williams of the Coalition Against Billboard Advertising of Alcohol and Tobacco, in Detroit. "We will appeal to store owners not to carry the brand," she said.
 
If you think Power Master is too blatant, how about Black Death? That's a Belgian beet-based vodka whose ads feature the rock star Slash of the heavy-metal group Guns 'n' Roses. Its trademark is a coffin and a skull. Last week Black Death U.S.A., the Los Angeles based importer, said it would change its product's name to Black Hat. The trademark will remain.
 
Is Alexanders the First Domino?
 
Retail sales may be up slightly across the country, but that hasn't helped Alexanders, the department-store chain for budget-minded New Yorkers. After losing $40 million in the last 24 months, Alexanders filed last week for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. It will close its 11 stores in New York. "Alexander's retail business is not viable, and there is little prospect of turning it around," said Robin Farkas, the company's chairman. Reverberations may spread through New York's financial community. Donald J. Trump, the embattled real estate developer, owns 27.2 percent of Alexanders. Those shares were pledged to Citicorp as collateral for some of his loans.

A Run on Guns in L.A.
 
Even before the riots, Los Angeles was an armed camped. In the last five years, more than 500,000 handguns were sold legally there. But since the riots, weekly sales have increased by 50 percent, to their highest level in more than 20 years. More people are taking gun training courses too. "I always thought if there was a serial rapist or murderer loose my business would go up, but nothing beats a race riot," said Sean Collinsworth, the owner of Deadly Forces, a gun training service in Los Angeles. "People are really scared."

 
 
INTERNATIONAL


Japan's Corporate Paternalism
 
In Japan, companies are not just economic entities, they are social institutions. For that reason, though Japan's economy is in recession, its unemployment rate is not expected to creep up much past 2.1 percent this year. But if the recession persists, economists worry that even the most honor-bound employer may have to lay off workers. "If this does continue next year," said Sadahiko Hidaka, head of a Tokyo metal fabricating company, "we would have to start thinking about layoffs."
 
The Halfhearted Capitalist
Though he was one of the last people in the Soviet Union to turn in his Communist Party card (he didn't do it until after last summer's aborted coup) and though he never really came to believe in private property, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former President of the Soviet Union, was feted like a capitalist prince last week during his tour of the United States. Not only did he address the Economic Club of New York -- "The Government of Russia has carried its reforms to the edge," he warned -- but he also visited the New York Stock Exchange, squired around by former President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Gorbachev hobnobbed with business leaders to raise $3 million for the nonprofit Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow. And how did one of Moscow's diehard socialists travel? On a Forbes magazine jet named the Capitalist Tool.
 
Road Service for $143 Million
 
NASA's astronauts resorted to the old heave-ho when their high-tech capture bar failed to snag Intelsat's trailer-sized communications satellite. They managed to pull the satellite into the shuttle Endeavour's 60-foot cargo bay, where they attached a small rocket motor to send the satellite into the correct orbit. But the itemized bill for this space call was steep. NASA charged Intelsat $93 million for the launch plus $50 million for parts (labor was included). Intelsat was happy to pay.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Making Weak Banks Pay More
 
When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voted 3 to 2 to raise the premiums it charges banks to insure their accounts, it was a break with tradition. For the first time, weaker banks will be charged more than stronger ones. Healthy institutions will pay 28 cents for every $100 in deposits, instead of 23 cents. Weak banks will pay an additional 3 cents for each $100. The added cost may be enough to cause some banks to close, the industry argued. The regulators countered that the fund lost $11 billion last year and has a deficit of $7 billion. "We're trying to close a widening gap between revenues and expenses," said William Taylor, chairman of the F.D.I.C.

Why Inventories Are Up
 
"It's either very good news or very bad news," Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities in New York, said after the Commerce Department reported a gain of 0.4 percent in inventories last month. If the nation's companies restocked their shelves because of sales, it's good. But if they misgauged demand and ordered too much, it could lead back to recession, he said. So which is it? It's still too early to tell.
 
The Well-Mannered C.P.I.
 
With businesses still struggling to emerge from the recession, merchants are more concerned about moving the goods than raising prices. That's why the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was so well behaved last month. Prices at the consumer level moved up a slim 0.2 percent, the department said last week, the same as producer prices. With inflation practically nil, the Federal Reserve may be tempted to bring down interest rates in an effort to squeeze more growth out of a feeble recovery. "The Fed has to be worried that this recovery doesn't have enough steam to carry it through the second half of the year," said Lyle Gramley, of the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Let Them Buy
 
Under its chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, the Federal Communications Commission has rule relaxation on its mind. It has eased the rules governing radio station ownership, and last week it said it wanted to do the same for TV. The F.C.C.'s proposal would allow a company to own 24 TV stations, up from 12. It would also allow companies to own a VHF and UHF station in the same market.

The voice of Imar Hutchins picks up speed when he begins to talk about FreeForm Academy, the educational venture he will immerse himself in full time after he graduates from Morehouse College in Atlanta this afternoon. "Privatization is coming in public education. We want to see a network of hundreds of FreeForms. A national system." The 21-year old senior laughs a little at his own sincerity but continues: "I wake up in the middle of the night and think, 'I have a vision. I have to go to work.' "
Mr. Hutchins and his classmates at the elite, predominantly black men's college are taking their fervor into the wider world during troubled times. The economy is bestirring itself but the job market for new graduates is the worst in decades, according to several surveys. And, two weeks ago, just as seniors were settling in for their last experience with the ritual torture known as final exams, the anomic images from Los Angeles exploded across their television screens. 
 A protest by Atlanta students, including several from Morehouse, against the Rodney King verdict evolved into a confrontation with the police. "In a way it was a good thing it was finals," said Marshall Norwood, 21, another graduating Morehouse senior, "because people had to calm down and study."
However it looks on television, a few students sharing a few moments of common cause in the streets does not an unruly mob of looters make. The young men of Morehouse, which numbers Martin Luther King Jr. and Spike Lee among its graduates, have little in common except some demography -- race and youth -- with many of the men who figured so prominently in film footage of L.A. and who populate white stereotypes of black behavior. But as they leave campus to start work, seniors say they know that race confuses some whites and that they face expectations their young white counterparts do not.
"We do get lumped together," Mr. Norwood said. Mr. Hutchins agreed: "The image that predominates is not a positive one." Similarly, the class valedictorian, Terrence Liddell, also 21: "It is always a factor, being a black male," he said. "We will always encounter people who see us as a threat."
Mr. Hutchins is realistic about the power of race as a leveler. He is a well-established member of the middle class whose great-grandfather was a college graduate. "If I walk into a department store, they don't know what school I go to," he said. "I face the same suspicion as any other black man."
If that realization is a sobering companion, the students view the imminent changes in their lives with the mix of dread and excitement of any frisky new graduates. "This will be a testing period," said Mr. Liddell. "I'm not afraid of change, just wary."

ONE thing the students seem unfazed by is the prospect of working in white-dominated environments. "I love to find out about different types of people," said Sean Allen, a 21-year-old economics major. Like other students, Mr. Allen, who in a few weeks will begin work at Cargill, the agricultural products company, credits Morehouse and his parents for providing the solid footing he needed to view achievement as a challenge not a burden. "Every day I see 3,000 young black men striving to make something of their lives," he said of his school. "Being a Morehouse student, I am constantly looked at and evaluated. It makes me do my best."
But even before Morehouse, his parents prodded him to focus on his goals: "My mother said, 'Life is short. You don't have time to procrastinate,' " he said. "Those who know what they want get what they want."
It is hardly surprising that these students are doing better than many in the class of 1992 nationally: they are at the top of their class. Mr. Liddell is moving to New York to begin Merrill Lynch's two-year training program for financial analysts. Mr. Norwood is returning after two internships to the Atlanta office of Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, to work full time. Mr. Allen will divide his time between Minneapolis and the cornfields of Iowa as he learns commodity trading at Cargill.
Mr. Hutchins expects to open the doors of the first FreeForm, his day-care center/ private school for children aged 3 to 9, in September. Like a true entrepreneur, he confidently predicts explosive growth of a chain of academies, along with software and publishing ventures, over the next five years.
All have been pursued by several prospective employers and when they talk of graduate and professional schools, they mention Harvard, Yale and Stanford. A sense of opportunities abounds, but so does a sense of caution: "I like to think I'm not the next Rodney King," Marshall Norwood said. "But I am at risk. All black men are."
 
 
 
WHY MOREHOUSE GETS THE BEST
 Sean Allen, Imar Hutchins, Terrence Liddell and Marshall Norwood could have gone virtually anywhere in the country -- they had acceptances from schools like Stanford, Cornell and Berkeley. But they chose Morehouse, a small college that has dedicated itself for 125 years to educating the best and brightest young black men. "I have no regrets about Stanford," said Mr. Liddell, the class valedictorian. "I would have performed just as well. But I would have been a number."
Both Mr. Norwood, who is from Atlanta and went to a predominantly white high school, and Mr. Allen, who is from racially and ethnically diverse Sacramento, Calif., wanted the experience of being at an all-black school. "I wanted to be in touch with myself in going out to the work force," Mr. Allen said. "If you know yourself, you can deal with a lot of the negatives out there."
The students seem to have the resources to ride out "negatives" like the Rodney King verdict. "You can't base any lasting effort on emotion," said Imar Hutchins. "I don't get caught on a roller coaster of highs and lows. If you allow yourself to be subjected to expectations, you will not be effective."

HEADLINE: All About/ECU's;
A European Currency Inches Toward Acceptance

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The ECU is a currency in waiting. Although it is slated to become the single currency of the 12-member European Community by 1999 at the latest, the European Currency Unit is still little known outside European financial circles. It is not a legal currency yet. In fact, there are no ECU bills, and the only coins are for collectors.
Yet since it was created in 1979 as a basket or weighted combination of the values of the 12 currencies of the European Community, it has slowly become a player in international financial markets. There is a growing ECU bond market that is used by Governments, international organizations and companies around the world. There are a commercial paper market, ECU bank loans, checks and credit cards. 
 Even though there are no ECU notes being printed, invoices, bills and other payments can be denominated in ECU's, which are currently worth about $1.25 each. The same is true for commercial paper or bonds.
The ECU is becoming an attractive way to reduce currency risk. Since the ECU is a basket of currencies, it is less likely to shift in value. For borrowers, the costs can be lower in ECU's than in their own currencies.
 
Selling the ECU
So Far, It's Hardly a Household Name
 The man out front on the ECU is Jean-Francois Pons, the Director of Monetary Affairs for the European Commission in Brussels. Mr. Pons, a French civil servant, must monitor the progress toward the introduction of the ECU as the single currency, seeing that the required hurdles are cleared along the way. And he must make a wary world comfortable with the currency. In short, he is the ECU's top salesman.
"For people in the street the ECU is something new," Mr. Pons said of Europeans. "And here," he added during a recent visit to the United States, "even in the financial circles, the ECU is not very well known."
Though the ECU was created more than a decade ago, the path for its transformation from currency crown prince to legal tender for Europe was not set out in a firm agreement until the meeting of European Community leaders at Maastricht, the Netherlands, last December. The road to a single currency will still be difficult. "It can always fall apart," said Mr. Pons. "But, really, I do not believe so."
The agreement calls for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute on Jan. 1, 1994. The institute will coordinate monetary policy among community members. Before the end of 1996, the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission will decide whether interest rates, inflation and budget deficits have converged enough in member countries to allow a move to the single currency.
If the convergence has taken place, the European Council -- the leaders of the Governments of the 12 community members -- can set a date for moving to the single currency. If no date is set by the end of 1997, the agreement states, the move will take place on Jan. 1, 1999. When the currency is in place, a new European Central Bank will take over in conducting monetary policy for all community members.
But there is a wrinkle in the Maastricht agreement. It does not say when existing currencies will be phased out. Its only word on the timetable is "rapidly." Mr. Pons said that the phase-out could take a year or two and that if it did, there could be a lot of confusion. For example, what do you use in a slot machine?
 
The Bond Connection
Helping to Lower Borrowing Costs
 The numbers show that the ECU is already taking on the character of a currency. It is now the second most widely used currency in the primary international bond market after the dollar. The total amount of ECU bonds outstanding rose 67 percent in the last two years. The total of ECU's kept for reserves by central banks jumped 76 percent in the same period. Bank lending was up 27 percent in the 12-month period that ended last September.
The most prominent use of the ECU is in the bond market. It is used by Governments, like Italy and France; by international institutions, like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, and by companies.
American companies use the ECU because it can help them lower their costs of borrowing. Johnson & Johnson sold a 150 million ECU issue of five-year notes earlier this month. Two elements made the ECU bond market attractive, said Eugene D. Barron, assistant treasurer. One factor was that investors in Europe are willing to pay a little more for a prominent company's name and its high credit rating. The second was that at the time Johnson & Johnson was able to exchange its ECU notes for dollar-denominated obligations at favorable rates.
But while the market is attractive and much more liquid than in the past, it still experiences growing pains. With Johnson & Johnson's success, other companies and institutions have decided to go the ECU route. The result has been a flood of issues but not enough investor demand to absorb them easily. Mr. Barron said that if he had been raising money last week, he would not have gone to the ECU market.
In addition, the market is not for companies with lower credit ratings. For example, Citicorp also went to the European bond market two weeks ago but issued bonds in dollars, because borrowing in ECU's would have cost too much. The ECU market "is not a deep market, and it is volatile," said Steve Greene, who manages the funding desk for Citicorp. "It is not cost-effective for lower-rated issuers to issue in ECU right now."
 
Wary Americans
The Finex Exchange Finds Few Takers
 Will the ECU catch on in the United States any time soon? It does not seem so. The use of the ECU has not spread much beyond companies that are veterans in international markets, judging from the activity at the Finex, the Financial Instrument Exchange in New York. Finex, a division of the New York Cotton Exchange, has been offering a futures contract on the ECU versus the dollar since 1986, and it recently started offering an options contract. Both are used to hedge against currency fluctuations.
After a flurry of interest in 1986, with trading of about 100 million a day in ECU's, the interest in the Finex futures contract plummeted almost to zero after the October 1987 stock market crash and never recovered. About $125 million, at the current rate, is being hedged through the options.
Americans are not interested in the ECU, said Richard Jaycobs, the managing director of Finex, because "historically, American companies are woefully provincial about foreign exchange and foreign exchange risk."
Mr. Jaycobs used his father-in-law, Chris Nicholson, an importer of motorcycle parts, as an example. Mr. Nicholson told Mr. Jaycobs that "I let the person I am dealing with cover the risk." But Mr. Jaycobs said this means Mr. Nicholson is paying a premium he could avoid if he hedged the risk himself.
"What we are trying to do is to educate companies," he said. "If we do not do that, we cannot be competitive."
 
 
 
ECU CHECKS, BUT NO BILLS YET
 As it exists now, the ECU is voluntary. If you can get someone to accept a payment in ECU's, it is legal to do so. But you cannot force someone to accept the ECU as payment until it becomes legal tender.
The European Commission helps to support the currency's use by doing its budget in ECU's and paying 20 percent to 25 percent of its bills in ECU's. Those who are paid can convert the ECU's into a local currency.
Jean-Francois Pons, the Director of Monetary Affairs for the European Commission, carries ECU checks, and if he wanted to, he could get an ECU credit card. There are some hotels where he can pay his bill in ECU's. Firestone uses the ECU to do its internal pricing in Europe. European railways use the ECU to work out cross-border payments. Amadeus, a four-country European airline reservation system, denominates its commercial bills in ECU's.
But Mr. Pons has no ECU bills in his wallet. There are none yet. And he does not carry ECU coins, which are now made just for collectors. But two contests are being held to design the ECU currency, and one is being sponsored by the European Parliament.
Naturally, choosing the design will be tricky. As with most matters involved in melding the many sovereign egos of Europe, each country may want to retain some of its identity in the new currency. One solution that has been suggested, Mr. Pons said, is to have individualized ECU bills. One side would have the Europewide ECU design. The other side would have a different face for each member nation.

HEADLINE: Which Way Out?;
The Civil Rights Battle Was Easy Next to the Problems of the Ghetto

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, many Americans feel some shame about the inner cities and most have at least some desire to see them improve.
But the country has watched passively for more than a generation as its urban cores have devoured the people who live there. And Washington politics last week offered little reason to think that things are about to change. 
 Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was racing about with plans for what he calls a conservative War on Poverty and a second civil rights revolution.
"This is my way of redeeming my existence on this earth," Mr. Kemp told a group of reporters at breakfast on Friday. "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis, but I am here now and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do."
But until recent days, Mr. Kemp's enthusiasms made him an outcast in his own Government. And for more than a decade, the more persuasive politicians have been telling themselves and the voters that the slums simply cannot be fixed. In Ronald Reagan's famous phrase: We fought a war on poverty "and poverty won."
Stasis, of course, is the norm in American social policy, and innovations -- a New Deal or a Great Society -- are the exceptions. The first was forced by catastrophe. The second was born during unparalleled prosperity. Neither fortune nor misfortune so abounds today.
Some Americans dream of seeing another Martin Luther King, Jr., step forward and offer deliverance. And yet the problem of ghetto poverty is, in some ways at least, a harder one to fix: the more Dr. King himself ventured into the slums, the more his movement faltered. Civil rights could be conferred by an act of Congress. What stroke of Presidential pen could abolish teenage pregnancy, patch the family, chase out drugs, or bring back good jobs?
Budgets are busted, movements are missing, and all the solutions seem open to question. If black leadership has fractured, so has white leadership. And reformers get little encouragement from the White House. President Bush speaks resoundingly about what is or is not a racial quota, but he has had little to say about the sorrows of the inner city. Hanging over the broken political edifice is a thick cloud of doubt about Government itself. It cannot even insure banks without losing hundreds of billions of dollars; how can it conquer poverty?
But to some it seems an odd moment for America to feel impotent. Communism falls. Apartheid follows. Why should the comparatively small problems of the American cities seem beyond solution? "If democracy can work in Eastern Europe," Mr. Kemp was insisting last week, "it can work in east L.A."
The riots were barely quelled when political gridlock seemed assured. Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, set off a Washington titter when he blamed the Great Society for the flames.
 
On Slippery Common Ground
 Fearful of adding to the public disgust with politicians, both parties gathered at an unusual White House meeting last week and pledged to work together. But it quickly became clear just how tenuous was the show of unity.
Even with White House backing, the emergency aid bill only squeaked through the House. Republicans opposed it by more than 2 to 1, attacking it as a reward to rioters; some Democrats denounced it as too mild a palliative. The more telling activity may have been in the nation's gun shops , where record numbers of people waited to arm themselves.
America has always stood out among industrial democracies for its aversion to social policy: Germany enacted widows' pensions and other forms of social insurance 50 years before America followed with the New Deal.
James Patterson, a historian of social policy at Brown University, cites several reasons. In part, he argues, it stems from the country's success ethic, the undergirding assumption that anyone can make it. In part it comes from long traditions of localism, which hold that the poor are their neighbors' problem.
Perhaps most of all, the aversion to Federal activity grows from the country's unique diversity -- racial, ethnic and regional. People support programs when they imagine the beneficiaries look a lot like themselves.
"To put it bluntly," Mr. Patterson said, "an awful lot of people oppose programs for the poor, in the past and now, because they think they benefit undeserving black people."
Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat among Mr. Kemp's heroes, was arrested 40 times in the 1960's and beaten without mercy. So it meant something last week when he said that desegregating the South was a modest goal compared to saving the underclass.
"It was easier to go and sit in at a lunch counter all day and let a lighted cigarette get put out in your hair," he said. "It was easier to march across the bridge in Selma and get tear-gassed."
The civil rights crusaders did in some ways face an environment more conducive to change. They had an expanding economy whirring beneath them, giving the whole society a confidence about the future it lacks today. They could coax support from Federal officials who were open to change. And since segregation affected all blacks, the movement could more easily harness the passion and talent of the middle class.
Segregation could be framed in pictures of school girls and police dogs; the images of today's underclass tilt toward gold chains and guns.
The awful 81-second bludgeoning of Rodney King seemed to have that old power of firehoses in Birmingham. Yet its moral force somehow blurred: he was a criminal suspect with a record, not a preacher. While it riveted the country, it failed to move a jury.
 
A Dream of a New Dr. King
 The last years of Dr. King's life were spent wrestling with these same questions: how to devise a solution to ghetto poverty and harness the political will to do so?
"He was baffled," said Senator Harris Wofford, then a King adviser and now a Pennsylvania Democrat. Senator Wofford said that during their last conversation, Dr. King even speculated about torching the worst slum in America, as a way of dramatizing its cruelty. "In the end, I don't think he would have done it," Senator Wofford said.
Those who dream of a new Dr. King often forget how reviled the old one was. And the lack of mythic successors is, at one level, a measure of his success. It is jail cells that produce Kings and Havels and Mandelas; enfranchisement produces congressmen and mayors, ordinary actors in the banal processes of politics. It is not just leadership that is lacking, but also and perhaps more importantly, the country's faith in Government itself. This has been eroded by its own failures in Vietnam and Watergate, by its mixed record in social policy, and by two decades of concerted efforts by conservatives to discredit it.
"To go from the Johnson landslide to the Reagan landslide in 16 years is a pretty fundamental shift in attitude about the role of Government," said Clayborne Carson, a historian at Stanford University.
The complaint that "there are no ideas," is deeply believed. But it is only partly true. Many social service models do seem tired. No one can claim to have the solution to teenage pregnancy and drug abuse. But the country basically knows how to shelter and provide health care to its citizens. Money is the stopper here.
Employment and welfare policies fall in between: no strategy promises to end dependency, but many have a chance at reducing it. Job-training efforts have broad support. So do calls for tax credits for the working poor and better child-support collection.
In Mr. Kemp's case, skepticism about Government bureaucracies and confidence about solutions both abound: In his plans for tenant management and ownership of public housing; for vouchers that let parents send their children to the public or private school of their choice; for tax breaks to lure businesses toward the slums.
Every idea has its weaknesses and enemies, but innovations always do. The New Deal and the civil rights movement -- each in its day was called the work of subversives. "What's missing is the coalition to put the ideas together," said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist.
If the history of American social policy offers any lessons, it is that breakthroughs will not come without strong Presidential effort.Here, argues Roger Wilkins, a historian at George Mason University, the charge that President Bush has neglected the poor gives him a unique opportunity.
Just as Richard Nixon had the anti-Communist credentials to go to China, he says, it is Mr. Bush who could lead the nation back to finish the work within its ghettos.
"There's one man in America who could make it happen," Mr. Wilkins said, "and his name is George Bush."

HEADLINE: Keeping the Seawolf Afloat;
In Battle of Budget, Democrats Defend Military Hardware

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BEFORE the Soviet Union imploded, the great divide between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans was defined in large part by their clashes over guns vs. butter. Now,in an improbable role reversal, Congressional Democrats are challenging the Bush Administration to build more tanks and fighter jets.
This new stance has lent an ironic coloring to the battle over the construction of two Seawolf nuclear submarines, which each cost nearly $2 billion. The Pentagon says there is no need to build the ships, which were designed to track the Soviet submarine fleet, because a hostile Soviet Navy no longer exists. But Connecticut's Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam Gejdenson, both passionate liberals who spent much of the 1980's opposing the Reagan defense buildup, have coalesced a bloc of Democrats and New England Republicans to guarantee the Seawolf program. 
 This week, a House-Senate appropriations conference committee is to decide on budget alterations that will preserve either one or both submarines. Mr. Bush lobbied personally to cut both, but by this point in the budget process he is all but powerless to stop the Seawolf.
Mr. Dodd and Mr. Gejdenson argue that both Seawolfs are needed to preserve the nation's security and technological edge -- and to save 10,000 jobs in Groton, Conn. New York Democrats made that pitch to salvage financing for the F-14 fighter plane built by Grumman Corp., Long Island's biggest employer.
Several California Democrats are partial to the B-2 bomber, the Stealth warplane designed to circumvent Soviet radar, built by Northrop in Los Angeles, while Midwestern Democrats struggle with the Pentagon to preserve funding for the KC-135 transport aircraft built by Boeing in Wichita, Kansas. Texas and Pennsylvania Democrats want more V-22 Ospreys in their states.
The wrangle over defense spending is a subtext to a larger philosophical question about the role of government in hard times. Democrats say they have no choice but to protect defense-related jobs because the Administration won't replace defense expenditures with social spending. They argue that the country needs a program that would pump tax dollars and incentives into converting defense-related production to high-tech industry.
Some Democratic lawmakers are warning their colleagues that their appearance of opportunism is bad for the party and the nation. "If the Democratic Party has any theme it ought to be bringing to this country," said Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, the Democratic chairman of the House Budget Committee, "it is the theme of reordering our priorities and that the time has come to invest in our society. I'm afraid we have failed to deliver on that theme."
 
Principal and Politics
 But because members of Congress are elected in part to guard the parochial interests of their constituents, there is no end to waste. In 1991, Mr. Panetta himself attempted but failed to save Fort Ord, a military base in his district that the Pentagon ordered closed.
Only a year ago, Representative William L. Clay, Democrat of Missouri, put principal above politics by supporting the Pentagon's decision to cut funding for the F-15 Eagle fighter by $627 million, even though that action would shut down McDonnell Douglas operations in his native St. Louis. He said that taking any other position would be "immoral." But after strong local protests, Mr. Clay has altered his position and become a booster of the aircraft. Along with other Missouri Democrats, he is lobbying lawmakers to support a proposal being considered by the Administration to build 72 more F-15's and sell them to Saudi Arabia.
Republicans typically join Democrats to save military projects in their respective regions, but the Democrats have opened themselves to the charge of hypocrisy because of their record on defense spending. Just a few months ago they heralded the peace dividend as the answer to the nation's fiscal and social woes.
Calling Senate Democrats "born-again submariners," Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who opposes the Seawolf, said on the Senate floor, "I can only hope that at some point they suddenly develop an equal passion for the overall defense of our nation and weapons systems that are not made in their state."
In what could have been a line stolen from a Democrat, Mr. McCain, who enthusiastically supported the Reagan buildup, added, "The cold war is over and so are the cold war defense budgets."
Representative Gejdenson, whose district includes the Groton shipyard, said he understands that the nation must cut defense spending. But he contends such a program would drive districts like his into a downturn unless the government creates an industrial policy to diversify local economies. He proposed that the government build a magnetic-levitation bullet train between Boston and Florida, and guarantee purchases of high-definition television and computer systems to encourage American companies to develop such technology.
"There are better things to choose to build," said Mr. Gejdenson, referring to the Seawolf. "But the worst thing to do is to choose not to build anything."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Surge of Incumbents Opts Out

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
With 55 voluntary departures and seven involuntary ousters in primary contests, the House of Representatives has already guaranteed itself more new members next January than at any time since 83 freshmen were elected during the 1982 recession. The postwar mark of 118 in 1949 is clearly within reach.
 Seven Senate retirements may matter less, but critics of Congress, within and without, are chortling over the impending House changes, hoping to see a new tone and purpose. And surely the freshmen will pronounce themselves perk-free. Some skeptics, like Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution, foresee a freshman class that "perfectly represents the electorate, with lots of anger and self-pity and not a clue as to what to do." 
 But the hundreds of hopefuls might well consider the range of retirement reasons as a measure of the place they want to work. The House Bank is plainly an element in the turnover, but many departing members with lots of overdrafts had other reasons, too. For example, Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, had 515 overdrafts, but in this country most of his fellow 71-year-olds have already retired.
 Gus Yatron, a Pennsylvania Democrat with no overdrafts, had bypass surgery last year and a district that was being carved up in anticipation of his retirement.
 Perhaps the most instructive retirement of all is Vin Weber's. The Minnesota Republican, with 125 overdrafts, said he was not running because he didn't want to be part of a mean-spirited personal campaign devoid of national issues. But the reason such a battle was not worth it was his expectation that the House itself - hamstrung by the budget, divided government and general ill-temper - would continue to be like the campaign he spurned in its avoidance of the nation's real problems.

HEADLINE: Big Bankruptcy Dampens Hopes for Real Estate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The decision by Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the world's largest real estate company, to seek bankruptcy protection in Canada last week is unlikely to have an immediate effect on New York City's already distressed real estate market. But the long-term impact could be devastating.
The danger, developers and money managers say, would come if Olympia & York's New York portfolio is broken up by creditors and sold at fire sale prices, reducing the value of comparable properties. And if rents are slashed to attract tenants, other landlords would be forced to follow suit. 
 In any event, the bankruptcy filing certainly dampens any hopeful talk of a real estate recovery.
 
 
A 'Pall' Over Lending
 "It puts a pall nationally over any commercial real estate lending by banks or insurance companies," said Kenneth Lipper, chairman of Lipper & Company, an investment-banking and money-management concern in Manhattan. "The uncertainty and the notion that we haven't plumbed the bottom yet will discourage any budding aspiration or intention to re-explore or re-examine this market."
But others think the crisis at Olympia & York, which is owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto, may not make a palpable difference. That is because banks and other institutions are already unwilling to lend, property values are depressed and tenants are wary about taking space.
Some developers, owners and brokers believe the shock wave hit months ago, when the gravity of the Reichmanns' problems became apparent and banks began to set aside money to cover potential losses.
William Zeckendorf Jr., a New York developer whose father built and lost a real estate empire, said: "Whatever bad effects we were going to see have already been taken and discounted. In the long run, I think they're going to work the situation out."
Bruce Ratner, a developer who is active in downtown Brooklyn, sounded the same theme: "The banks have been accounting for it. The markets have been accounting for it.
"The banks were already skittish, so it won't have much of a real effect on lending. Those markets have been closed for better than a year. The banks weren't lending to any of us."
But Mr. Lipper, who was New York City's Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development in the 1980's, does not buy the worst-is-over theory.
"Obviously, it didn't come as a surprise," he said. "You could see the tidal wave coming. But still, when it hits, it breaks a lot of houses. Yes, it was discounted. But you never know the full impact until it hits the shore. And now it's hitting."
 
 
Biggest Effect in New York
 In the United States, New York is likely to bear the brunt of whatever happens to Olympia & York, the city's largest commercial landlord.
Nowhere else in America do the Reichmanns have the presence they have in Manhattan, where they control 14 buildings and more than 22 million square feet of office space. (To put the 22 million-square-foot portfolio in perspective, if it were packaged in structures the size of an Empire State Building, eight would be needed.) They also own one or two buildings in each of another 11 American cities.
"It's here and in Toronto where the issues are," Mr. Ratner said. "I don't think this will have any significant effect in areas where they have one or two buildings."
But David S. Solomon, a New York developer who has had financial troubles of his own, said Olympia & York's bankruptcy filing would have a "profound effect, because of their international reputation, because of their extraordinary success, because of their ability to think forward and not miss market opportunities."
He said it was "too early" to predict the consequences of Olympia & York's action, since it was not clear whether the New York properties would also be forced into bankruptcy.
 Protracted bankruptcy negotiations might actually soften the blow to the market by delaying the properties' ultimate disposition.
The developer Donald J. Trump noted: "Those buildings and structures may be tied up for years. And as much space as they have, New York is such a huge city that it's still a small fraction. It will not have any effect on New York or real estate in New York."
Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president and managing officer of the CB Commercial Real Estate Group, noted that many buildings were already in bankruptcy in New York.
As to the effects of the Reichmanns' troubles on the market, Mr. Swerdlow said: "Values are frankly so depressed already that I don't see this having that much of an impact. And the banks are out of the lending business for real estate, so you can't say they're going to pull out."
A similar sentiment was expressed by Donald Schnabel, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley, a real estate brokerage. "Somebody who had concerns two days ago will have concerns today," he said. "The concerns may be heightened, but I don't think it changes much."
Mr. Schnabel added: "The hidden issue that's difficult is what will happen to management. By that, I mean, who runs the buildings, who's keeping the buildings, who's minding the store?" Even a landlord who may stand to benefit from the confused picture at Olympia & York takes no comfort from the situation. "I'm sorry about it, and it's too bad," said Lewis Rudin, a leading builder and owner.
"It might help us in renting," he acknowledged. "People can come to us. We can make decisions. We have funds to fix up the space. We don't have to go to banks. That side could be a plus.
"But on the other side, it doesn't make our industry look good. I don't like to benefit from some other guy's problem."
It is possible that Mr. Rudin and other owners will not benefit at all.
"There are some major tenants who've been in the market and who were close to making decisions," said James A. Austrian of Austrian Roth & Partners, a real estate consulting concern in New York. "They just may go back to a higher altitude and start circling again, because there is a chance that there will be a fire sale."
Mr. Lipper discerned other potential problems. Mortgage holders desperate for cash might try to lure buyers with extremely low asking prices. Low sales prices, in turn, would force a reassessment of other comparable commercial properties.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: California;
Politicians Warily Gauge the Effects Of Los Angeles's Rioting at the Polls

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 15

 BODY:
For a week or 10 days after the riots that ravaged some parts of this city and terrified people in others, conventional electoral politics was swept from Californians' minds. The candidates fell silent, convinced that the voters would pay no attention whatever they said.
Now, with the state's June 2 primary election only a little more than two weeks away, the war of words is resuming among the contestants in the Republican and Democratic Presidential primaries and those seeking the nominations in not one but two Senatorial races here. Commercials are appearing on television, rallies are starting to attract lunchtime crowds, and a few bumper stickers and yard signs are evident, even in the fire-scarred neighborhoods of Los Angeles. 
 The political experts are still not sure exactly how California's political climate has been affected, and how long-lasting any changes might be. "We have to wait until the embers cool a bit more," said Joseph R. Cerrell, one of the most experienced strategists in this part of the country. Like many of his fellow Democrats, he recalled with trepidation that the Watts riots of 1965 helped to elect Ronald Reagan Governor the next year.
In particular, it is unclear what kind of political weather the state will be having this fall, when California's 54 electoral votes will constitute the biggest prize in the nation for President Bush and his rivals.
In addition, the political reaction of Los Angeles and California as a whole may say a good deal about that of the country. As David Reid writes in the introduction to his new anthology, "Sex, Death and God in L.A.," this "has become the American city the world watches for signs and portents."
 
Strong Conservative Words
 Conservative Republicans have spoken in the least guarded terms. Representative William E. Dannemeyer, who is running against John Seymour, the incumbent, in a Republican Senatorial primary, endorsed the verdict in the Los Angeles police brutality case while almost all other politicians were condemning it.
Bruce Herschensohn, who is seeking the Republican nomination to run for the other Senate seat, now held by Alan Cranston, a Democrat, said there was only one underlying cause for the riots: the looters and arsonists were "rotten."
And Patrick J. Buchanan, running hard in the Republican Presidential race here even though Mr. Bush has clinched renomination, has blamed much of the disorder on Mexicans' "coming into this country illegally and helping to burn down one of the greatest cities in America."
"If I got a third of the vote in the Republican primary in California," Mr. Buchanan said this week in advocating the construction of new ditches and fences along the border, "Mr. Bush would be building that fence in July and August."
More surprisingly, one of the leading Democratic Senate candidates has also decided to take a law-and-order approach in the aftermath of the riots.
 
A Liberal's New Approach
 Representative Mel Levine of Santa Monica, locked in a close race for the Democratic nomination to succeed Mr. Cranston, who is retiring, began broadcasting a 30-second commercial this week whose theme was spelled out in the words, "A democratic society can't tolerate mob rule." The advertisement says nothing about poverty or racism, as might be expected from a liberal like Mr. Levine, but instead blames the trouble on "a failure of political leadership."
"The leadership of the Democratic party," he told The Los Angeles Times in an interview on Wednesday in an obvious attempt to distance himself from the burdens of incumbency, "has spent more time explaining away the root causes of these problems than trying to provide public safety for the people who live in the inner city."
There is no question that the riots have cut deeply into the public consciousness, especially in Southern California, which casts 60 percent of the votes in the state. Not only was the loss of life great, but this time, the looting and burning were not confined to the inner city, spilling north of the Santa Monica Freeway into areas bordering some of the city's most affluent.
Along with economic stagnation, smog, traffic and other vexations, the riots also contributed to the erosion of the American dream that Los Angeles once represented: sunny, new, full of limitless opprotunity.
Only half of those questioned in a recent poll here said they would recommend to an out-of-town friend who was offered a job in California that he or she take it. And in the same survey, 4 of 10 Angelenos said that after the rioting they would never again feel as good as they once did about the city.
 
Strategy Could Backfire
 Shanto Iyengar, a professor of political science and communications at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the relationships between politics and the news media, sees "a cascading series of effects" of the riots on public thinking that will be hard for candidates to address in slogans and short sound bites for the television news.
"I believe that the coverage of the actual events stirred calls for law and order and sales of handguns," he said. "But look at local TV news now, and you'll see much more thematic material, much more searching for antecedent causes and solutions. That will push the public in the other direction, and that could mean that Levine's making a terrible mistake."
William A. Carrick, a leading Democratic consultant, also expressed doubt that 1992 would provide a rerun of the 1960's in politics here.
"People see this in the context of a decade of neglect of the domestic agenda," he said. "Of course they want safety, but they see real, festering problems, too, and nobody's going to score a lot of points with a simplistic approach."
A number of things may change the way these riots are viewed, as compared with those in Watts.
Watts blew up toward the end of three decades of almost unbroken Democratic control of the White House, marked by intense social activism. The disturbances that began in South-Central Los Angeles came after two decades of largely Republican control with much less Federal attention in social issues.
In addition, this region's longtime symbol of law and order, Chief of Police Daryl F. Gates, has been almost completely discredited, according to polls showing him with an 80 percent unfavorable rating among all voters. Mr. Bush campaigned with him in 1988, and Gov. Pete Wilson did so in 1990, when his magic was intact; both avoided him during Los Angeles visits this month.
 
Portents in a Poll
 One of Representative Levine's main Democratic rivals, Representative Barbara Boxer of Los Angeles, has described the riots as "the fires of neglect" by Republican administrations. But her television advertisements promote her as a woman fighting for abortion rights and as "a fighter for change," without any comment on the riots. The third Democrat, Lieut. Gov. Leo McCarthy, has broadcast no commercials so far. The contest is very close.
If Mr. Herschensohn, and his view of the looters as "rotten," are a fair test of the effectiveness of law-and-order appeals in the aftermath of the disorder, they appear to have had little impact. In a California Poll in March, he won the support of 28 percent of registered Republicans; in a new survey after the riots, between May 6 and 9, his support in a similar group was essentially unchanged at 29 percent.
Mervin Field, who heads the poll, says the riots' most important political meaning may be "as another sign of failure by the established political order." If so, that may have helped Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate for President, who leads in Mr. Field's latest three-way survey with 37 percent to 31 percent for Mr. Bush and 25 percent for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee.
 
Gains for Challengers?
 The riots might also help Mr. Bush's and Mr. Clinton's challengers here, Mr. Buchanan and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., unless too many voters consider the nominating fights over.
Kurt Lohbeck, Mr. Buchanan's Southern California coordinator, said the riots "are a tangible demonstration of the breakdown Pat Buchanan has been talking about all year." Mr. Brown, speaking at City Hall on Thursday at almost the same time as Mr. Clinton was talking about education in East Los Angeles, tied his remarks squarely to what happened in the South-Central region.
"When our second-largest city explodes in riots and insurrection not seen since Civil War days, something is profoundly wrong," the former Governor said, criticizing Democratic leaders in Congress for appropriating money for the military and foreign aid but not for the cities. "The usual tepid response of photo opportunity and budget crumbs won't work any more."
Mr. Brown, whom polls show within hailing distance of Mr. Clinton here, has taken youths from the riot area on his campaign plane as a symbol of his commitment to the cities.

HEADLINE: Russians Not What They Used to Be in Laos, Too

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM

DATELINE: VIENTIANE, Laos

 BODY:
A senior Russian diplomat received a visitor at his modest embassy with a rueful smile. "You are probably the last to visit us here," he said. "We are moving to our big new embassy today."
The new chancellery was designed for a relationship that no longer exists. While there was a Soviet Union, it was this impoverished country's main source of economic, technical and military sustenance. "Now our relations are at bottom," the diplomat said. 
 When the new embassy was designed, Soviet diplomats, military advisers and technical specialists here, together with their families, numbered 5,000. Today, the diplomat said, 400 remain, and most will leave when work on the new building is completed.
Military and civilian aid has been canceled. Since Communist Laos came into being in 1975, Moscow provided Laos with hundreds of millions of rubles in grants and loans that it did not expect to be repaid. "Now we are looking for aid ourselves," said the diplomat, who insisted on anonymity.
In addition to providing development assistance, three hospitals, several schools and technical installations, the Soviet Union trained 7,000 young Laotians in its schools and technical institutes. Other Eastern European countries trained thousands more.
"We prepared a mass of specialists, but gave no thought to where they would work," the Russian said. "We trained railroad engineers for a country that has no railroads."
Products of Soviet or East German education can be found in many places in this somnolent capital, few practicing the art or science they studied. The waiter spent six years learning printing technology in Leipzig; an English-language interpreter at the Foreign Ministry studied East German law for six years; an automotive technician trained in Rostov-on-Don drives a taxi.
"Some of our aid was useless," the Russian said. The Soviet Union built a truck-rebuilding and repair garage at Savannakhet in the southern panhandle. It was capable of rebuilding 1,200 trucks a year, when there were fewer than 1,000 in the entire country.
The diplomat found the highest paradox in the Higher Party School, an institution of all Soviet-oriented countries, where party functionaries of leadership potential received their ideological backbone. "We gave them their party school last November, when it was finished, and we ourselves no longer even had a party," he said.
The Russian found some consolation in the fact that his American colleagues are also rattling about in an embassy that is far too big for present needs. It dates from the period when the United States was to Laos what the Soviet Union became in its succession -- the power behind the throne.
Today, the three countries that once formed French Indochina are for the first time since the last century free of the domination of countries far to the West. Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia are free from the decisive role that France, then the United States and finally the Soviet Union played in their destinies.
Laotian officials are still waiting for the United States to follow through on President Bush's announcement last November that he would raise relations to full ambassadorial status with the only Indochinese country that did not break with its former enemy. For now, Charles B. Salmon Jr., is heading the United States Embassy without the rank of ambassador.

HEADLINE: Raid on Indian Casino Inflames Issue of Self-Rule

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT McDOWELL, Ariz., May 16

 BODY:
Pounding drums and piercing chants echo a spirit of defiance that blazes in the desert night on the Yavapai-Apache reservation here. A sense of showdown looms as clear as the moon over Red Mountain.
This was the site of confrontation on Tuesday, when Federal agents seized gambling machines at the tribe's casino, only to be prevented from leaving the reservation by a blockade of vehicles driven by angry Indians. The standoff ended when Gov. Fife Symington negotiated a 10-day "cooling-off" period. 
 The deadline expires Friday, and the Governor says he doubts that any settlement on gambling can be reached so soon. The Indians say they will not permit the Federal authorities to remove the gambling machines, which have buoyed the tribal economy and sharply reduced unemployment.
"They will not do this to us," vowed Gilbert Jones, a tribal leader. "This time, they will not get away with it."
 
'These Are Sovereign Lands'
 The dispute, which has riveted the attention of tribes around the country, has raised an issue that goes far beyond gambling and cuts to the core of a centuries-old struggle: self-rule of Indian lands.
"There is a lot of anger in Indian country over this," said Tim Giago, the editor of The Lakota Times, an independent Indian newspaper in South Dakota. "The Indian nations are sick and tired of being treated like children. These are sovereign lands. Why in hell should these lands need the state's permission?"
For decades, Federal law barred tribes from running gambling machines on reservations. But under a Federal law that took effect last Monday, a reservation can offer gambling machines or any other form of gambling if it is legal elsewhere in the state, or if the reservation negotiates an exemption with state officials. Arizona has refused to sanction the video gambling machines here.
Although the Yavapai-Apache tribe has not filed suit, tribes in at least six states have sued over the new law, charging that officials have refused to negotiate in good faith, as the Federal law requires. At least eight states have also filed suit, challenging the authority of the law.
 
Gambling as Major Industry
 With few other economic opportunities, Indian reservations across the country have turned gambling into a major source of revenue for tribes.
More than 200 tribes have gambling operations that generate an estimated $2.5 billion a year, Charles Keechi, chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, told The Associated Press this week.
In addition to providing jobs, the casinos have helped to pay for social programs, tuition and housing for tribal members. A Sioux tribe near Morton, Minn., for example, which draws 20,000 customers a week, has used the gambling profits to finance all college costs of tribal members. It also offers a $30,000 "loan" to each elderly member to use for a new house or for home improvements. The tribe asks recipients to repay 10 percent of the loan but does not enforce the request.
"We're finally getting the income that gives us financial independence," Mr. Giago said. "We are told, over and over: 'Get off welfare. Cut the umbilical cord to the Government.' But when we try to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, we're slapped back down."
 
A Volatile Issue
 Mr. Giago said he feared violence if Federal agents returned to Fort McDowell to remove the poker machines forcibly.
Governor Symington agreed. "We could be headed for a real crisis and showdown," he said. "This is just the fuse that leads to a larger keg of dynamite. Let's face facts: What we're dealing with here is the terribly emotional issue of sovereignty on these lands."
Before the raid, the casino at Fort McDowell was bringing in about $2 million a month. The reservation is still legally running its bingo hall, but the video machines generated about 70 percent of the casino's profits. Since gambling was introduced on the reservation in 1984, unemployment has fallen to about 5 percent from 30 percent, said Clinton Pattea, the chairman of the tribe.
"This is our chance for economic development," Mr. Pattea said. "You know, we keep telling the Federal Government, 'We're not subordinate to the wishes of the state government. We are a sovereign land.' "
In the early 1800's, the Yavapai tribe had about 6,000 members and occupied 10 million acres in central Arizona. But in the 1870's, the Yavapai were rounded up under Federal relocation orders and forced to move to an Apache reservation in San Carlos, Ariz. Many Yavapai died during the trek.
About 800 Yavapai-Apache members live on the reservation here, which was created in 1903 on a former military installation. The 25,000 acres of desert land is dotted with cactus, mesquite and cottonwood.
 
'I'm With the Indians'
 In addition to its gambling business, the reservation owns a sand and gravel pit and raises hay and alfalfa. But gambling yields the overwhelming percentage of income. Almost all of the customers are white, many from nearby Phoenix.
"I'm with the Indians on this," said Bob Jones, a 70-year-old retired Army master sergeant, as he sat before eight bingo cards with his wife, Janette. "They're just trying to make a living. They're not harming anybody."
He added: "You know, first the white man came to take their land. And now he's after their money."
The seizure of the video gambling machines threw about 75 people out of work, about half of them Indian. One of them, Rose Thomas, had worked in the sandwich concession for $5 an hour.
Her husband, Delano, had gone to vocational school to learn the skills of operating heavy machinery. "My job was the family's only income," said Mrs. Thomas, who lives with her husband and two teen-age children in an old yellow trailer here. "Now what are we supposed to do?"
 
Nightly Powwows
 The video poker and pull-tab machines are locked inside moving vans on the casino parking lot, where a powwow has been held each night since the Federal raid to show strength and unity. Indians from around the country and a few whites have come to watch the chants, dances and speeches.
The seizure of the gambling devices here, along with raids on casinos at five other Indian reservations in Arizona, were ordered by Linda Akers, the United States Attorney. She said that the tribes had been notified more than once that the gambling machines were illegal. She also said she had no choice but to stop the gambling because the state and the Indians had not negotiated an agreement. "I try to enforce the laws across the board," she said. "And these casinos were operating outside the law."
Miss Akers, who was appointed by President Bush in 1990, said she had not decided whether to order another raid if the issue was not resolved by Friday's deadline.
Governor Symington, a Republican, has scheduled a meeting for Thursday with Indian leaders to discuss the issue. He has consistently opposed casino-type gambling in the state.
Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who was a sponsor of the law on reservation gambling, faulted both the tribe and the state for the failure to negotiate an agreement.
The Senator said he regretted that gambling seemed to offer the only hope of economic salvation for Indians.
"One of the tragedies," Mr. McCain said, "is that more acceptable businesses" refuse to locate on Indian land. He added: "So what do the reservations get? Gaming and waste sites."
 
A Roar of Defiance
 When the Federal agents arrived here soon after dawn last Tuesday, word spread fast, said Mr. Pattea, the tribal chairman. By the time the video poker machines were being loaded into the moving vans, a parade of cars and pick-ups had blocked the narrow entrance to the casino.
Moments later, a line of other vehicles, including a dump truck and front-end loader, surrounded the vans, with a dozen or more of the Federal agents trapped inside the circle.
As the blockade formed, a few Indians started to clap, then more joined in. As it became apparent that the agents were blocked, a roar went up.
Mr. Pattea went to the scene with a bullhorn and asked the people to disperse. A shout came back, "We're not moving."
Some Indians said they had finally outsmarted their foes, after generations of struggles.
"You could look around and see all these smiles," said Roddy Pilcher, the 36-year-old manager of cash and operations at the casino. "And people have been saying, 'We're going to win this one.' "

HEADLINE: Washington Marchers Demand Attention to the Cities

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Warning that the riots in Los Angeles were a symptom of widespread anger, tens of thousands of city dwellers marched through the capital today to demand that President Bush and Congress focus their attention -- and money -- on the cities.
As high school bands played marching tunes and buses arrived from cities along the East Coast, politicians, labor leaders and civil rights advocates criticized the Government. They said that while the Defense Department had received money for major weapons programs throughout the 1980's, Federal aid for urban programs was cut by almost two thirds to less than $15 billion. 
 "We don't want to have to burn our cities," said Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore. He said that he and several mayors were forced to go to Congress "tin cup in hand" this week as lawmakers were discussing building new B-2 Stealth bombers. "This is all about turning the national leaders around," he said.
Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said, "We have not had an urban policy in a number of years, and while we have squandered hundreds of billions of dollars on every conceivable kind of convoluted fashion, we have left our cities with their increasing burden of the homeless, jobless, hopeless and helpless."
 
Banners Call for Action
 Carrying banners that read, "Bail out neighborhoods, not banks," and "Health care for people, not profits," the marchers walked from Capitol Hill to the Washington Monument. Their messages reflected their frustration and their belief that while the Federal Government has money to prop up the wealthy, the foreign allies and the military, it cares little about the urban poor.
But the impact of the rally was diminished by the fact that it attracted far fewer people than its organizers had predicted. Only 35,000 people took part, according to the United States Park Police; the organizers had predicted more than 100,000.
Most of the people who attended the march were members of labor unions or were there as a result of the efforts of nonprofit organizations involved in social causes, from helping the homeless to the elderly. Many of the marchers were poor and unemployed. Typically, they woke up before dawn to travel to the rally.
There was little official Republican presence at the march. When asked to respond to the demands of the marchers, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, who was with the President in Texas, said: "I don't know anything about it. We have marches every weekend."
 
Rodney King's Words in Song
 In the shadow of the Washington Monument, the crowd grew more festive. Peter Yarrow, of the singing group Peter, Paul and Mary, played the guitar and sang a song he composed based on the words that Rodney G. King had used when he asked that the people of Los Angeles cool their anger at the acquittal of the police officers who had beaten him. "People, I just want to say: You know, can we all get along?" Mr. Yarrow sang, and the crowd joined along.
But even as some in the crowd threw Frisbees and baseballs on the sloping lawn, the words from the stage grew more impassioned.
"The flames that rose in Los Angeles have died, but dust from the city's ashes remains on each of us," said Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York. "We knew how close we were to the fire, and we must stop the anger and the pain before it is too late."
 
'Listen Up, America'
 Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat who represents the Los Angeles district that suffered the most from the rioting, chanted: "Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. Listen up America." She added, "No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. Listen up, America."
Plans for the march began months before the Los Angeles riots, but organizers and politicians say it has become enmeshed in the negotiations between President Bush and Congress over a response to the disturbances in Los Angeles. The Bush Administration appears ready to invigorate its efforts to promote an urban policy anchored by a plan for developing inner cities with tax breaks for businesses willing to invest there.
Congressional Democrats would like to push a much more ambitious program, emphasizing creation of jobs with public works programs.
Both Democratic leaders and Administration officials have publicly called for conciliation, but their ability to reach a consensus proved limited on Thursday, when the House could only narrowly pass a modest program of disaster relief grants and small business loans for Los Angeles and Chicago. Most House Republicans voted against the measure, with those from rural areas arguing that rioters would interpret new financing and programs as a reward for their violence.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who attended the rally, said the march would help urban legislators make their case, because "the squeaky wheel gets greased and cities haven't squeaked in a while."
He said the somewhat disappointing turnout was a symptom of the "anger and apathy in the cities," adding, "People in Brooklyn say, 'Nobody's going to listen to me.' "
Mr. Schumer also noted that urban people had less money and fewer ties to organizations than more privileged suburbanites, who are more likely to march on the capital to promote their interests.
 
Motivated in Manhattan

Those here were the highly motivated. Some said they had marched in the capital before for civil rights or against the Vietnam War.
"I wanted to make a statement, to change the priorities of the country," said Pat Caldwall, 60 years old, director of a private senior citizens center on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She and three friends carried a long sheet painted with the words: "Cut the military budget. Save our cities. Save our kids."
Jay Weaver, 53, an elementary school teacher from Baltimore, said: "The Federal Government is supposed to protect the states. If the foreign countries want Federal aid from our Federal Government, then let them become the 51st state and pay taxes to our Federal Government the same as we do."
Speakers at the rally were long on oratory but short on specific proposals, while their allies in Congress in the crowd agreed that they need to come up with strategies that differ from those tried in the 1960's and 70's.
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, tried to place the verdict in the King trial in the context of a broader moral crisis gripping the country.
"It's not just 12 jurors and a verdict, but 12 years of politics and exporting jobs overseas and losing jobs at home," he said. "What good does it do to protect oil in the Middle East and lose your soul in the Far West? If the Government can spend $8 million for Desert Storm, then it ought to spend eight times $8 million for the storm raging in the ghettoes."

HEADLINE: Briton Confident on Vote for European Union

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 16

 BODY:
Prime Minister John Major remains confident that the House of Commons will ratify a controversial treaty on European union despite the latest withering blast against the growing power of the European Community and Germany by his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, according to his aides.
With the debate set to begin on Wednesday, Mrs. Thatcher warned in a speech to business leaders and diplomats in The Hague on Friday that the more federal, centralized European Community envisioned by its executive commission in Brussels and by most Continental governments would bring "insecurity, unemployment, national resentment and ethnic conflict." 
 "Germany's preponderance within the community is such that no major decision can really be taken against German wishes," she said, so the best way for other countries to counterbalance it was as a loose confederation of sovereign states, not as a federal European union.
Mr. Major, who will begin a six-month term in the presidency of the 12-nation community in July, did not respond directly to Mrs. Thatcher's warnings. He has been steadily marking off a course on Europe that diverges from Mrs. Thatcher's almost as sharply as on domestic policy issues like her per-capita poll tax, which he scrapped soon after he succeeded her in November 1990.
Having won a new term in last month's general elections, Mr. Major thinks Mrs. Thatcher has had her say, according to his aides, and that it's time for Britain to move on from her by now well-known views.
"The Prime Minister wants us to be at the heart of Europe," one aide at 10 Downing Street said. The most powerful symbol of this was the Government's decision to allow Queen Elizabeth II to address the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, last Tuesday. Mrs. Thatcher, who said Friday that the European Parliament was often irrelevant, never allowed the monarch to address it during her more than 10 years as Prime Minister.
Mr. Major has been anxious to prove that he is his own man on Europe as well as in domestic policy. He, too, wants to see Europe evolve more as a confederation than as a federal union, but he seems to favor closer cooperation than Mrs. Thatcher does.
The Queen's speech, approved as a policy document by Mr. Major's Government, was far more conciliatory in tone than Mrs. Thatcher's remarks. "We are all trying to preserve the rich diversity of European countries because, if that diversity is suppressed, we shall weaken Europe, not strengthen it," the Queen said. "Differences of style and opinion are insignificant against the background of the proven commitment of Europeans today to reconciliation and democracy."
Mr. Major tried to assure the House of Commons on Tuesday that the sovereignty of Britain's Parliament was "not up for grabs" in Europe.
But, as The Economist magazine noted this week, Mr. Major has showed no sign of wanting to stop the process of making more and more British decisions in common with his neighbors; Mrs. Thatcher always did.
As one of Mr. Major's aides pointed out, the so-called "Euroskeptic" Conservative ranks in the House of Commons are thinner these days. Not only Mrs. Thatcher but some of the other staunch proponents of British independence are gone, including Mrs. Thatcher's close friend, Sir Norman Tebbit, who also did not run for re-election last month.
But the issue still arouses passion. Some of the remaining hard-line opponents of European union discussed strategy for next week's ratification debate over dinner at the Carlton Club, a Conservative stronghold, this week and said Mrs. Thatcher had expressed their views about the European union treaty negotiated at Maastricht, the Netherlands, last December.
Though the Government's majority in the House of Commons was reduced to 20 seats in the recent election, Mr. Major was not afraid that the ratification bill would fail, an aide said. The opposition Labor Party, divided by a leadership struggle after its defeat by the Tories, decided to ask its M.P.'s to abstain rather than vote against it.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Tells Graduates That Nation Must Face Problems

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, May 16

 BODY:
President Bush preached a doctrine of optimism and self-reliance at Southern Methodist University today, arguing that America is still a rising nation in global affairs and "is certain to remain so, if we refuse to settle for anything less."
But the President drew his strongest response from the 2,433 graduates and their relatives when he conceded the nation's shortcomings, not when he praised its strengths. 
 Mr. Bush was awarded the loudest applause for a stock line in hiscampaign speech, a call for Americans to care for each other more and sue each other less. And his remarks were interrupted by sustained applause when he allowed that "yes, for those of us in Washington, it is high time to get our own house in order."
 
Attack on Naysayers
 The President's speech, the first of three commencement addresses he plans this month, blended his standard campaign comments with an attack on "declinists," who he said were pessimistic about the nation's economic future.
The fashionable view, he said, is that this is "a country overrun by economic predators abroad and crippled by the insurmountable problems at home."
But, he said, "the fact is, America is more than the world's sole military superpower, though it is that. It is more than the world's political leader, though it is that, too. It is also the greatest economic power the world has ever seen, a country uniquely able to provide each of you unparalleled economic opportunity."
Mr. Bush said statistics showed that American workers were more skilled, more productive and better off than any of their foreign competitors, largely because the United States has given them more freedom to take risks and innovate.
But he conceded that "we must deal now with a few alarming trends that endanger our world leadership," including the need for improvement in education, health care, social programs, criminal justice and the labyrinths of the legal and governmental bureaucracies.
Not by coincidence, those issues are at the heart of the six-point legislative agenda that Mr. Bush has begun to push before Congress in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS;
Short-Term Urban Policy

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Two weeks after the Los Angeles riots, the White House remains focused on the short-term goal of moving its existing urban policies through Congress and shows little sign of beginning work on a broader agenda of new programs to revive the nation's cities.
Although Administration officials acknowledge that President Bush's program is not a complete response either to the riots themselves or to more sweeping urban needs, none of Mr. Bush's advisers have been asked to draft major new long-range initiatives or significant new spending for cities, the officials said. 
 A working group led by Clayton K. Yeutter, the White House domestic policy chief, will review proposals for action that Mr. Bush might take later this year, the officials said. The group could become the vehicle for any major new initiative the President might make. But they said Mr. Bush was convinced by his visits to Los Angeles and other troubled cities in recent days that no fundamental change of direction was needed.
Instead, Mr. Bush plans to stick to the proposals he now has on Capitol Hill. He says they have been ignored by Congress and should be given a chance before new legislation is considered.
 
Landing in the Middle
 Thus an internal debate over the scale and content of Mr. Bush's public reaction to the rioting after the verdict in the Rodney G. King beating case has been resolved in favor of middle-of-the-road oratory, with a bent toward themes of law and order. It is this line that Mr. Bush has been delivering in his public appearances since the riots, and aides say there is no reason to expect the President to go further.
Despite continued protests by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who has started to talk of a need to spend more money than the Administration has proposed, officials said, the White House debate was dominated by the budget director, Richard G. Darman, and by Mr. Bush's insistence on holding to the 1992 budget agreement, which permits no increase in the deficit.
"Everybody is together on the basic equation that we have the new programs and we just need to get implementation," said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. He was referring to Mr. Bush's proposals to create enterprise zones in urban areas, press for welfare and education change and use new spending to root out drug dealers and seed neighborhoods with social services.
"There's not a search on for some magic new formula, or a wand that can be waved to right these problems," Mr. Fitzwater said. "Two or three years of work went into the development of our programs the way they are, and our emphasis is on getting Congress to act on them. Our whole focus is on the legislative side."
 
No Single Voice
 The clarity Mr. Fitzwater described within the White House is blurred by the Administration's lingering difficulty in finding a single voice to speak to Congress and the public. Mr. Bush, Mr. Fitzwater and other officials have veered between conciliatory words toward Democrats and sharp accusations that the Democratic welfare programs of the 1960's led to the riots.
Moreover, Administration officials and outside advisers said there was no strong hand in the White House to mediate the views represented by Mr. Kemp and Mr. Darman, leaving the two officials clashing in private and increasingly in public as well.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters on Friday, Mr. Kemp took an undisguised swipe at Mr. Darman, saying that helping the cities would eventually cost billions more than the Administration now envisioned. "I'm not a bean counter; I'm not the director of O.M.B.," Mr. Kemp said. "I'm not going to engage in single-entry bookkeeping."
Behind the policy debate are complex political imperatives. For Mr. Bush, the violence in Los Angeles produced an unexpected and potentially damaging threat just when his campaign staff thought it was finally starting to reverse his political plunge.
 
Debate on Republican Policy
 While the Bush camp has tried to keep public attention on the shortcomings of Democratic-inspired welfare programs, the riots have also begun to produce a debate about 13 years of Republican supply-side economics, policies that Mr. Bush ridiculed in 1980 but on which he has long since staked his political fortunes.
"We left people behind," Mr. Kemp said Friday. "Any economy that moves forward has to go back and bring its weakest elements behind, or it loses its soul. It loses its moral example."
Campaign officials said their planning was focusing on how to meet the clear need to address urban issues without allowing that debate to drown out the President's message on other issues, including the law-and-order themes so important to conservative supporters and the foreign policy questions that Mr. Bush's advisers say they must exploit to defeat his challengers.
White House and campaign officials said that under these pressures Mr. Bush did not have time to craft a significantly new approach to urban affairs. So they seized on his existing proposals as a way of responding to the riots that was, they said, both politically responsive and responsible from a policy viewpoint.
"The bottom line is that you have to produce," one official said. "We put something on the table, and it's good momentum."
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Bush is genuinely committed to new approaches to urban problems, as the President and his advisers insist, or whether the White House is simply going through the motions, hoping that attention will soon shift to other issues.
Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, said this would be tested in large measure by the amount of political capital Mr. Bush chose to expend on his legislative program.
"He doesn't suddenly have to become a born-again inner-city grassroots urban leader," Mr. Butler said. "Nobody would believe that. But he has to say, 'I'm behind this,' and he has to be there saying, 'I'm not going to pull the rug out from under Kemp at the last minute.' Every time Kemp has gone to push major proposals, in the past, the White House has been missing in action."

HEADLINE: Insurers and Lawyers Throw the Dirt Back at Polluters;
Shifting the Burden

 BODY:
In an article on the Forum page on May 3, Eugene R. Anderson and Robert M. Horkovich, partners in the New York law firm of Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, wrote about the high litigation costs associated with the cleanup of toxic waste.
The article, "Why Insurance Companies Say No," cited a recent study by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, which "reported that nearly 90 percent of the money allocated by insurance companies in Superfund claims had gone toward legal and related 'transaction' costs, rather than for cleaning up pollution." 
 Moreover, the authors said, the study found that "42 percent of the outlays made by insurance companies went to fight policyholders' environmental claims."
The authors, whose firm often represents policyholders in disputes on insurance coverage, posed this question: "When faced with large claims for environmental liability, why do insurers run for cover, instead of providing coverage that was paid for by policyholders?"
The answer, they say, is that there are "gargantuan economic rewards for an insurance company that just says no."
The solution? Take the profit out of the pollution controversy, say Mr. Anderson and Mr. Horkovich, by adopting a "pay now and fight later" rule. "Policyholders pay premiums up front," they say. "Insurance companies should not complain about paying claims up front."
The article generated a strong reaction from the insurance industry and from lawyers who represent insurers. Following are some of the letters that were critical of the authors' conclusions.
 
To the Editor:
Implicit in the article is the erroneous assumption that insurance policies issued to industrial policyholders provide coverage for the intentional and ongoing pollution of the land, water and air.
For decades, the oil, chemical and manufacturing industries have saved vast sums of money by not paying for waste treatment. They merely dumped the often hazardous substances they produced out the back door or they hauled them to the nearest landfill.
With the advent of public environmental awareness and the resulting legislation, like Superfund, these polluting companies fought the Government tooth and nail to avoid paying the enormous cleanup costs made necessary by their conduct.
When that approach proved unsuccessful, they desperately sought an alternate means of avoiding the economic consequences of their past practices.
The result has been an attempt to shift from their own shareholders to the insurance-buying public the economic burden of cleaning up the messes they had made.
As these companies know, however, the insurance industry has long held the position (and rightly asserted it in litigation) that the tortious (and often criminal) disregard of longstanding standards for waste treatment and disposal by policyholders relieves the insurers of the obligation to provide coverage for such polluting activities.
A fundamental principle of insurance is that any loss must be fortuitous -- that is, unexpected -- to be covered. In addition, policies issued in the past 25 years contain specific exclusions for pollution coverage.
It is a sad fact that civil litigation (not just environmental insurance coverage litigation) is consuming so many of our resources.
Nevertheless, the record is clear that in those environmental insurance coverage cases tried before juries, the insurance companies have won. Lay people seem to understand what Mr. Anderson and Mr. Horkovich do not -- that a contract means what it says.
Insurance covers accidents, not intentional misconduct. Environmentalists have long been aware that American industry has used its backyard and ours as a national dumping ground. The slick attempt of the oil, chemical and manufacturing industries to shift the burden of cleaning up America to the rest of us should be seen for precisely what it is.
Let the buck stop where it should -- with those who created the present environmental disaster in the first place.

The article generated a strong reaction from the insurance industry and from lawyers who represent insurers. Following are some of the letters that were critical of the authors' conclusions.
 
To the Editor:
The article levels a wholly unjustified attack on the insurance industry. However, it also highlights the wastefulness of Superfund's liability-based system, which is sending hundreds of millions of dollars a year to litigation rather than Superfund site cleanup.
Insurance policies never were intended to cover the cost of this cleanup. However, polluters, many of whom engaged in the long-term dumping of hazardous materials, have used the courts to press unjustified claims for coverage.
For example, when the E.P.A. recently caught a polluter who had deliberately discharged tons of hazardous waste directly into a New Jersey river for 18 years, the company made a claim against its insurer, arguing that the pollution was "accidental." The court decided the company did not have a leg to stand on.
Contrary to the article's assertion, it is neither fair nor feasible to expect insurers to "pay now and fight later." If insurers were to pay polluters' meritless claims, that could undermine their ability to fulfill promises to millions of policyholders expecting legitimate claims to be honored for workers' compensation, products liability, homeowners and auto insurance.
That is why the American Insurance Association, which represents more than 250 of the nation's property-casualty insurance companies, has made reform of Superfund one of its most critical public policy goals. In that effort, we are pursuing ways to rid the program of wasteful litigation expenditures. We support the creation of a no-fault, non-litigation system for activities that took place prior to the 1980 enactment of Superfund.
The association is also striving to work with those affected by and involved with hazardous-waste cleanup -- business, the environmental community, state and local governments, citizen groups, labor, the E.P.A. and Congress.
By working with all parties involved in the Superfund debate and cleansing the law of the components that foment unnecessary, unwarranted litigation, we believe that Superfund will be able to achieve what Congress intended: cleanup of the nation's hazardous wastes.
Insurance companies are saying "yes" to being part of the Superfund reform process, with a commitment to improve the current system.

An Absurd Conclusion

 BODY:
In an article on the Forum page on May 3, Eugene R. Anderson and Robert M. Horkovich, partners in the New York law firm of Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, wrote about the high litigation costs associated with the cleanup of toxic waste.
The article, "Why Insurance Companies Say No," cited a recent study by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, which "reported that nearly 90 percent of the money allocated by insurance companies in Superfund claims had gone toward legal and related 'transaction' costs, rather than for cleaning up pollution." 
 Moreover, the authors said, the study found that "42 percent of the outlays made by insurance companies went to fight policyholders' environmental claims."
The authors, whose firm often represents policyholders in disputes on insurance coverage, posed this question: "When faced with large claims for environmental liability, why do insurers run for cover, instead of providing coverage that was paid for by policyholders?"
The answer, they say, is that there are "gargantuan economic rewards for an insurance company that just says no."
The solution? Take the profit out of the pollution controversy, say Mr. Anderson and Mr. Horkovich, by adopting a "pay now and fight later" rule. "Policyholders pay premiums up front," they say. "Insurance companies should not complain about paying claims up front."
The article generated a strong reaction from the insurance industry and from lawyers who represent insurers. Following are some of the letters that were critical of the authors' conclusions.
 
To the Editor:
The article contains a number of gross distortions of the reality of the business of insurance and how responsible insurers handle claims.
Contrary to the authors' assertions, it would not be accurate to characterize the recent Rand study as establishing that it is more profitable for an insurer to litigate coverage than to pay a claim. While it might be true that 42 percent of insurers' expenditures in the context of so-called hazardous-waste claims were attributable to litigating coverage, consider the following:
* Not all coverage litigation is initiated by insurers. Often it is the insured or policyholder that commences litigation, even in the face of a valid denial of coverage by the insurer.
* A liability insurance policy is not a financial guarantee bond. The policies at issue in this type of litigation contain various exclusions and other restrictive provisions that exist to provide meaningful coverage at a reasonable premium.
If one examines the various judicial decisions in this area in the past 10 years, mixed results would be noted as to whether an insurer or insured was the prevailing party.
If nothing else, that should indicate that the issues relating to this coverage are complex, legitimate and effectively rebut the authors' absurd conclusion that "policy nullification by litigation is an easy way for insurance companies to make money."
* If any insurer would be so foolhardy as to operate under the premise that litigating coverage is the preferred way to handle claims, it need only look to a recent order in a Texas state court for an illustration of the dire consequence of such conduct.
In that case, in addition to finding the insurer liable for what it owed contractually under the policy, the court awarded the insured more than $75 million in punitive damages, more than $5 million in interest and $15.5 million in attorney fees.
Many states, in addition to Texas, have statutes that will allow effective sanction of insurers for any "bad faith" conduct.
In fact, the often overzealous application of these laws, coupled with judiciaries and jurors with a decidedly but misplaced anti-insurer bias, presents a practical deterrent to any unfounded denial of coverage by an insurer.

Why They Don't Say 'Yes'

 BODY:
In an article on the Forum page on May 3, Eugene R. Anderson and Robert M. Horkovich, partners in the New York law firm of Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, wrote about the high litigation costs associated with the cleanup of toxic waste.
The article, "Why Insurance Companies Say No," cited a recent study by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, which "reported that nearly 90 percent of the money allocated by insurance companies in Superfund claims had gone toward legal and related 'transaction' costs, rather than for cleaning up pollution." 
 Moreover, the authors said, the study found that "42 percent of the outlays made by insurance companies went to fight policyholders' environmental claims."

The solution? Take the profit out of the pollution controversy, say Mr. Anderson and Mr. Horkovich, by adopting a "pay now and fight later" rule. "Policyholders pay premiums up front," they say. "Insurance companies should not complain about paying claims up front."
The article generated a strong reaction from the insurance industry and from lawyers who represent insurers. Following are some of the letters that were critical of the authors' conclusions.
 
To the Editor:
In 1980, the Superfund law imposed liability on polluters to clean up their hazardous wastes, whether they owned a polluted site or dumped their waste there or just hired someone else to do it.
The statute signaled a legislative judgment to impose the cost of cleanup on the parties that should have borne the expense of proper waste disposal in the first place.
Congress made a legislative judgment to accept no excuses: if you polluted, you paid to clean up the mess you made.
Nevertheless, instead of cleaning up dump sites, the typical corporate response to virtually all governmental enforcement actions has been protracted, unproductive and expensive litigation.
After Superfund was enacted, industrial polluters invariably attempted to transfer financial responsibility to others. They sued the waste haulers. They sued the municipalities that owned waste sites. They sued each other.
Most of all, however, polluters have sued their insurance companies. During the past decade, polluters have cast themselves in the role of "policyholders" and have initiated a torrent of environmental insurance coverage litigation.
The objective of this litigation is to get the insurance industry to foot the bill for the multibillion-dollar cleanup of the routine contamination that "policyholders" profitably carried out in the three decades before Superfund.
The most troubling aspect of the Forum article is its complete failure to explain why insurers should say "yes" to claims arising out of intentional pollution. Insurers, it seems, should just pay. Why? Apparently because they are insurance companies.
The sad truth is that because of the polluters' appetite for litigation, more than eight years pass on average between the time the Environmental Protection Agency first becomes aware of a hazardous waste site and the time cleanup actually starts. Indeed, the latest available statistics indicate that only 33 of the 1,175 toxic waste sites on the National Priorities List have been cleaned up.
Surely, insurance claims must be judged on the merits. In this connection, it is appropriate to observe that most of the environmental insurance coverage claims that have been litigated to judgment have resulted in a finding that there should be no insurance coverage for the pollution damage at issue.
Thus, for example, a California jury found after an 18-month trial that the Shell Oil Company was not entitled to any insurance for the $2.4 billion in pollution damage it caused by 30 years of intentional pollution at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado. A verdict of no coverage was similarly rendered in a highly publicized insurance coverage trial in a case initiated by the Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company.
The fact is that no liability insurance policy covers the cost of doing business. No insurance policy pays -- or should pay -- to clean up intentional pollution damage.

To the Editor:
The authors' explanation of why insurance companies are reluctant to pick up the enormous cleanup bill for policyholders' pollution never mentions the most compelling reason. It is simply that their liability policies do not provide coverage.
Generally these policies do not cover damages that are expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. Property damage from pollution is often both. Additionally, most of these policies contain specific pollution exclusions.

HEADLINE: With Budgets Cut, Public Officials Seek Private Money

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALL TOWNSHIP, N.J.

 BODY:
Only a year after voters in this community near the Jersey Shore forced cuts in spending by voting against a school budget, education officials are planning to build an elaborate greenhouse for teaching plant biology. But instead of relying on taxpayers, the school board will use a private foundation backed by local businesses.
The greenhouse here is among dozens of programs blooming around the New York metropolitan area and the country as tight budgets force public institutions to seek private financing for activities once supported almost completely by tax dollars. 
 In Westfield, N.J., a private group is seeking to raise $250,000 to renovate a historic park near the center of town. In Connecticut, the United States Surgical Corporation, a medical equipment company in Norwalk, is paying about $190,000 to keep five state parks and forests staffed and supplied. And in Westchester County, the Charles Freihofer Baking Company is underwriting the cost of closing the Bronx River Parkway to cars and opening it to bicycles on certain Sundays in the summer.
Not all private support for local governments is monetary. Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Rahway, N.J., is giving management training to officials of Woodbridge Township.
 
Tiny but Important
 Such private aid, while still tiny compared with public spending, has sometimes been significant. Private funds, for instance, were largely responsible for the recent renovation of Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. Private funds are also important because they are often used for innovative programs, said David Gallagher, executive director of Interface, a public policy research and advocacy group in New York City.
Still, questions are rising about the proper role of business in government and whether private financing favors wealthy areas over poor ones.
There have long been charitable donations to parks, schools and libraries. But public officials and business executives say that such activities are becoming more numerous and more organized as governments tighten their belts. Instead of organizing a bake sale, local school supporters like those here in Wall are beginning to adopt the sophisticated techniques employed by private universities to tap alumni and corporations for donations.
"All of the fiscal constraints that are closing in on everyone these days have caused us to be more innovative and to look for nonconventional sources of funding," said Dr. Francine Farber, supervisor of instruction at Bergen County Special Services, a regional school district in New Jersey that teaches handicapped children.
 
Businesses Tax Themselves
 The district is forming a private foundation to raise money to buy special computer and communications equipment for the children. On Long Island, foundations to support public schools have been formed in Manhasset and Rockville Center, and one is being considered in South Huntington.
Businesses are also levying special tax-like assessments on themselves to pay for sanitation, lighting and security in their neighborhoods.
There are 24 such private business improvement districts in New York City alone, in such neighborhoods as the Grand Central Station area, Times Square, Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and Jamaica, Queens, according to the city's Department of Business Services. An additional 20 districts are in formation.
 
How the Privileged Give
 In New Jersey, there are 16 to 18 so-called special improvement districts, said a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. In Woodbridge, for instance, local merchants and the town government are sharing the $1.2 million cost of a program to improve downtown streets, parking and lighting. Such districts also exist in Philadelphia, Denver and other cities.
While nobody is against private support for school greenhouses, better street lighting and prettier parks, some officials and scholars say that the trend raises concerns.
In education, for instance, private money could widen the gaps between rich and poor districts. And business improvement districts could allow the wealthy to improve their neighborhoods without having to support poorer ones.
"It's another means by which the privileged are seceding from the rest," said Robert B. Reich, a Harvard University political economist.
There are also concerns that businesses are providing public services while avoiding normal politics, said Laurence Alexander, director of the Downtown Research and Development Center in Manhattan, which publishes newsletters on central city issues. "They represent some fragmentation of the ability to make decisions on the basis of what is best for the entire community," he said.
 
Supplementing, Not Replacing
 But defenders of the private efforts say they work closely with governments and school boards and are supplementing public services, not usurping them. The extra funds spent to improve a downtown shopping district, they say, could never be raised as part of a general tax increase.
In any case, the proponents of private financing say the amount of money involved is minuscule compared with tax revenues. The 24 business improvement districts in New York have a combined budget of $24 million, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the city's $29 billion budget.
"There are things that are needed over and above what is in the budget that could really put the cream on your educational system," said John Weaver, the assistant superintendent of schools in Wall, a township of about 20,000 people.
 
Fund for a Greenhouse
 The Wall Foundation for Educational Excellence, which was started last year, hopes to raise at least $100,000 to supplement a school budget of about $25 million.
The school board and the foundation decided to spend as much as half the extra fund on a greenhouse for plant biology and special-education classes. Other money is going to teach parents how to help their children in school and to various smaller projects, including a sculpture being designed by fourth and fifth graders at the Old Mill School.
Last year Wall voters rejected the proposed school budget, forcing a cutback in spending of more than $1 million. That led to layoffs of some teachers and reductions in spending on textbooks, said Diane Noorigian, a member of the board of education.
But she and others said there was never any thought of using the foundation to pay for basic supplies or teachers' salaries, since the foundation could never make a significant difference in the basic budget. "We're not letting the taxpayers off the hook," said Robert Jenkins, a local businessman who is chairman of the foundation's trustees.
Mr. Weaver, the assistant superintendent, said a key to the success of the foundation was the active involvement of business people in the program, and not merely as donors. For example, Steve Barlow, the owner of Barlow Flower Farm here, helped design the greenhouse and will teach horticultural techniques.
Still, local officials and business leaders say private support for public activities is likely to become even more important in the future.
Margaret Sur, a councilwoman in Westfield, N.J., and president of Friends of Mindowaskin Park, which is trying to raise private money to renovate it, said: "It doesn't always have to be what the local government can do for me."

HEADLINE: Francis G. Fitzpatrick, 89, Mayor And Party Leader in New Jersey

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Francis G. Fitzpatrick, whose elections as the insurgent Mayor of Bayonne, N.J., and as Hudson County Democratic chairman signaled the demise of an old-line political machine 20 years ago, died on Friday at Bayonne Hospital. He was 89 years old and lived in Bayonne.
He died of cancer, a family spokesman said. 
 A longtime independent Democrat, Mr. Fitzpatrick was a leader in the move to oust the corruption-riddled party organization, overturning half a century of domination by two legendary political bosses, Frank Hague and John V. Kenny.
Mr. Fitzpatrick's election as the director of the Hudson County Board of Freeholders in 1951 was an early setback to the party regulars, but they regained control and ousted him.
Later he became the Commissioner of Bayonne, the city's top post, then led a campaign to change the city's form of government to a strong mayoralty. He won the first election for the new mayor's post and served from 1962 through 1974. During his terms, urban renewal projects and a new City Hall were built, and the city's finances were stabilized.
 
Appointed to State Post
 The final blow to the old regime came with Mayor Fitzpatrick's selection as chairman of the county party from 1972 through 1974. He won the job as an ally of Paul T. Jordan, the young Mayor of Jersey City, in a reform coalition.
But soon then two strong-minded mayors had a falling out. Their feud and power struggle was resolved only when Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed Mr. Fitzpatrick chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
He served in the state post from 1975 to 1984, and during his tenure the turnpike agency reached record highs in use and record lows in traffic fatalities.
A tough advocate who relished the rough-and-tumble of politics, he called the state Democratic chairman a liar in 1972 and, citing losses in statewide contests, demanded his ouster. The chairman, Salvatore A. Bontempo, declined to comply. Even after Mr. Fitzpatrick assumed his state post, he kept his hand in local political disputes.
Born in Brooklyn, he moved to Bayonne as a youngster and never left. He worked days in oil refineries while studying at night. He graduated from John Marshall College in 1927 and earned his law degree there in 1930. He began working as an administrator in Bayonne government, then went into private law practice in the 1940's.
First elected a freeholder in 1945, he served on that board through 1951.
He was the Bayonne Commissioner from 1959 to 1962.
Surviving are his wife of 57 years, the former Marion Tierney; a son, F. Gerald, of Bayonne, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: High-Riding Hamptons Settle Down, but How Far Down?

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
At the Sagaponack General Store, caterer to the rich and trendy, Mary Spellman is thinking about trying to bolster her business by offering express delivery service of her famous pot pies. Would people really pay $19 for 24-hour delivery of a pot pie -- even hers -- anywhere in the United States?
A few years ago, there would have been no doubt. One magazine described how a desperate yuppie could not persuade another customer to sell him the last chicken pot pie for $200. 
 Down the road, Ed Hollander, landscape architect, said the recession has so far spared his select clientele. "But wait," he piped up moments later. "I have noticed one difference: nobody's plunking down $50,000 to buy their wives weeping beech trees lately."
In ways gentle and savage, the recession has crept the length of Long Island's East End. The grand fortunes, the traditional backbone of the Hamptons, have felt hardly any tremors of the recession, though many felt the stock market crash of October 1987.
The blows rained harder on the people who flocked to the Hamptons in the 1980's to show they had made it. Their arrival fueled a building boom, sending housing prices skyward and creating the illusion of a wellspring of unbridled spending.
 
A Shuffled Social Order
 No one would go so far as to suggest that the economy's jolts have brought the Hamptons to heel. "That's a kind of abstract thought," mused Randy Schindler, publisher of Hamptons magazine.
But an economic Darwinism has shuffled the social order. The free-wheeling spending of years past, when the whiz kids of Wall Street would spring for houses before the walls went up, is over. Humbled M.B.A.s still make the ritual trek here, but they are more often taking time shares, bunking with friends and strangers.
Builders have gone out of business, at least the ones who flooded the market with houses on lots away from the ocean, north of Montauk Highway, counting on the moment's frenzied spending. Now, "For Sale" signs dot the roadside, and prices have plummeted 20, 30, sometimes even 50 percent. Banks have started listing foreclosed properties with real-estate agents, in the hope of getting more than distress prices for them.
A million dollars was once barely enough to buy a vacant oceanfront lot; now it can sometimes get a house on that property. These days, said Tara Newman of South Fork Realty in Sagaponack, $300,000 can buy: "Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, contemporary, north of highway with swimming pool."
A new species that Dan Rattiner, publisher of Dan's Papers in Bridgehampton, calls the "shabby yuppie," pads down Main Street, still wearing designer threads, but window-shopping and eating at home.
"They're still into conspicuous consumption, but they don't have the means to satisfy it," Mr. Rattiner said. "And the places that cater to them know that."
 
Smaller Parties Now
 Ask Mary Spellman, fed up with cooking for customers whose first words are often: "I don't have a lot of money to spend, but I'm throwing a party."
"You're so frustrated, because you want to do something special," she said, sitting in the bench seat at the General Store's window. "Your hands are tied before you even get to express yourself."
Still, the summer crowd has not given up on parties.
"Now, they'll invite 50 of their closest friends, rather than 50 of their closest friends plus 50 others just to show they could throw a party for a hundred people," Mrs. Spellman said.
If mad spending was the 80's badge of success, the 90's have given way to post-disaster survivalism. Call it scavenger chic. Or use the darkly delicious German word "Schadenfreude" for that deep sense of glee at another's misfortune.
 
Gleeful Distress Sales
 The new breed of house hunter squeezes impossible concessions out of desperate homeowners and builders, and often walks away from the deal. Buyers ask less about square feet and wiring, and more about the owner's distress.
"If they'd simply ask if we have any houses in foreclosure, I wouldn't mind," fumed Ms. Newman of South Fork Realty. "But you know they're just doing it so they can brag at some cocktail party about how the bank was banging down the door and they came in and swooped this house off the auction block and got an incredible deal."
Two walls of Ms. Newman's office are covered with snapshots of houses up for sale, their prices ranging upward of $300,000. In the last few years, prices on the glut of contemporary houses speculators built in the 1980's have dropped 20 to 30 percent. Traditional houses take longer to sell, but they have kept their value.
Along Job's Lane, chic shops remain empty. The French shoe designer Charles Jourdan is gone from its choice spot at the corner of Main Street. Elizabeth Arden did not open last year, though its windows remain decorated with closed white shutters and golden drapes. Some shopowners leave in the middle of the night, so residents awaken to the eerie discovery that another one has disappeared. "Thank God Ralph Lauren is still here," Ms. Newman said.
Those who cater to the wealthy shudder at each closing. "You lose the fashionable trade," worried Elaine Benson, owner of the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton. "Then you get the day trippers wearing black socks with white shoes."
 
Wait Until Next Season
 But the stores that leave are not being replaced with five and dimes. Instead, other upscale shops take their places, hoping to ride out one risky season before freer spending takes hold.
There are signs that this summer may pick up: post-office box rentals are running ahead of last year and Ms. Spellman reports early party orders. Then again, each spring for the last few dismal years has been heralded as the Season Things Will Turn Around.
For all the hard-edged indulgence those who serve the rich adopt when speaking of them, hope is measured in flutters of madness. "I did hear about one landscaper who's buying a $75,000 tree," Mr. Hollander, the landscape architect, confided. "He thinks it'll sell this year."

HEADLINE: REGULATOR LOWERS ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF SAVINGS BAILOUT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
After several years of steadily higher forecasts of the cost of bailing out the nation's insolvent savings and loans, a senior Federal regulator for the first time has brought in a lower estimate of the cost to taxpayers.
Albert V. Casey, the head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that oversees the bailout, has told lawmakers in recent days that because of lower interest rates, which bolster the balance sheets of savings and loans, he believes the bailout will cost no more than $130 billion. That is 19 percent less than the Administration's top estimate of $160 billion last June. 
 The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, told some Congressional aides on Friday that Mr. Casey's estimate appeared reasonable.
But some lawmakers and financial experts expressed skepticism about the new calculations. And some suggested that Mr. Casey's numbers were politically motivated, an effort to get a recalcitrant Congress to provide the additional $42 billion Mr. Casey has requested to complete the bailout. The agency's spending authority expired almost two months ago.
 
Doubt About the Estimates
 "Based on past experience, Congress applies limited credibility to Government estimates," said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican and a senior member of the House banking committee. "But if one has some understanding of macroeconomics, it's extremely hard not to be optimistic that the worst is over."
And Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the committee, observed: "The Administration has experienced great difficulty keeping its numbers straight on the savings and loan cleanup, either by design or incompetence. The history of missed projections may make it difficult to restore the agency's credibility."
Some Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill warned that it was too soon to predict the final bill, particularly since the bailout costs could go up if interest rates -- at their lowest point in many years -- rise.
 
A Poor Track Record
 They also noted the Government's poor forecasting track record -- Reagan Administration officials often disputed that any taxpayer money would be needed to bail out the industry, and when Mr. Casey's agency was created almost three years ago, the Administration predicted that $50 billion would be the most the disaster would cost.
Always a difficult political issue, financing the highly unpopular bailout has run up against a brick wall, even though everyone acknowledges that Congress will ultimately have to provide more money. Bickering between the Administration and House Democrats this year, combined with an internecine Republican struggle, has blocked quick passage.
The Administration says the House should provide more money. The Democratic leaders say they will not seek Democratic votes until the Administration enlists strong Republican support, so that the Democrats cannot be singled out as the driving force behind the financing.
The Senate has already approved a financing measure, but there is no sign of the House acting soon. Mr. Casey has met in recent days with dozens of lawmakers, but sometimes when he travels to Capitol Hill, lawmakers seem to have little interest in receiving him and send their lower-level staff members instead.
"If they just give us $42 billion, we believe it will be enough to finish the job," Mr. Casey said in an interview today. "We won't come back for more."
The Bush Administration, which has increased its estimates of the bailout twice since its August 1989 prediction of $50 billion, has not revised its latest figures, clearly concerned about the political fallout that will come if they wind up understating the problem.
"I hope Al's right; I'd hate to go back up to Congress again," said Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, the Administration's point man on the bailout since 1989. "But we won't know the total costs until the last asset is sold."
The Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created in the summer of 1989 to supervise the bailout, spent and committed about $86 billion before its spending authority lapsed. The agency has squirreled away another $2 billion that officials say will only be used for an emergency, like preventing an economic panic.
 
Most Costly Debacle Yet
 The bailout estimates do not include the interest costs of financing the rescue and the costs of what critics have called sweetheart deals made under the Reagan Administration. The General Accounting Office has estimated that these costs would put the bailout at about $500 billion over 40 years, making it the most costly financial debacle in American history.
Mr. Casey denied that his forecast was motivated by politics and the need for more money.
"I have made a living putting my credibility on the line and I don't do it lightly," he said, referring to his previous jobs as the head of American Airlines and briefly as Postmaster General. "The fact that this is an election year has no impact on Mr. Casey. He has a limited life expectancy."
Yet James Barth, a finance professor at Auburn University and a former Government economist who has written extensively on the bailout, said: "They've gotten no money at the same time that we now hear them lowering their estimates. One has to be suspicious."
 
Plans to Retire in '94
 Lower interest rates in the last year have been an enormous windfall to banks and savings associations, as the spread has widened between the interest they pay depositors and what they charge borrowers. It has also made more attractive those loans inherited by the Government from failed institutions that carried older and higher rates.
At the same time, the lower rates have reduced the value of other assets held by the Government, but these costs have been more than offset by the gains, officials said.
The accounting office, which has completed a preliminary audit of the trust corporation for 1991, has decided to report that significant progress has been made in cleaning up the agency's books. Last year, it said the agency's 1990 financial statements were in such disarray that it could not verify them. This year, unlike last year, the accounting office will be able to certify the accuracy of financial statements of the trust corporation.
Lawmakers and experts, while generally agreeing that the bailout costs may be coming down because of favorable interest rates, nonetheless expressed skepticism about the latest projection.
Another senior member of the committee, Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said: "The trouble is we've heard it so many times from other people that you have to take a second look. There are so many unseen costs and unknown problems. On the other hand, it's true that interest rates are lower and the R.T.C. has gotten a better handle on things."

HEADLINE: What to Subsidize in Israel

 BODY:
Settlements: No word has sown more discord between Israel and the United States. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vows to keep building Jewish settlements in the disputed West Bank, whatever the cost. Now his main rival in the June 23 election says otherwise.
Yitzhak Rabin, former Prime Minister and Defense Minister, asserts that money now lavished on these settlements should go instead to jobs and housing for 332,0000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union. 
This promises a real choice in what may be Israel's most important vote in half a generation. But to keep the choice focused, the Bush Administration has to move quickly to end a needless rumpus over a State Department blunder on the "right" of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.
Putting highest priority on absorption of immigrants would honor Israel's Zionist mission and revitalize an economy whose growth sank below zero last year. It would enhance Israel's commitment to Middle East peace talks and open the way to U.S. approval of $10 billion in loan guarantees blocked by a dispute over settlements.
Absorbing immigrants strains a society already burdened with heavy military spending. Jews from former Soviet lands are enviably talented: 40 percent hold professional degrees, five times the rate for Israelis. Yet they must contend with an unemployment rate that has soared to 11 percent. The Shamir Government has failed to turn this human treasure to national advantage. Some disheartened newcomers have gone back to Russia.
Meanwhile, Israel has diverted huge amounts of capital to subsidize 200 settlements housing more than 200,000 settlers, now about 13 percent of the population in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. In Israel proper, a new home typically costs about $60,000. It's a third less in the West Bank, thanks to direct subsidies, preferential mortgages and tax concessions. This does not benefit Soviet Jews, few of whom choose to live among hostile Palestinians.
Beginning in 1967, when Mr. Rabin's Labor Party was in power, security was the avowed justification for the settlements. Mr. Rabin says he supports these "security" settlements but opposes "political" settlements, whose purpose is to assert permanent Israeli dominion over disputed territories. Whatever its ambiguities, Mr. Rabin's position invites bargaining and progress.
Even in straitened times, Americans are ready to help Israel absorb Soviet immigrants through loan guarantees. The snag has been the feverish settlement drive that collides with the express disapproval of successive Presidents.
By contrast, the argument over an inadvertent State Department gaffe is a passing squall. Margaret Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman, stumbled into a mine field by affirming U.S. support for a 1948 U.N. resolution upholding the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel or to obtain compensation. That right, as she added tardily, is subject to direct negotiations -- as is Israel's claim for compensating Jews who fled or were driven from Arab lands.
By promptly restating all of this as U.S. policy, Secretary of State Baker can correct a record now carelessly blurred.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The New World Order

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
When President Bush took this country and others into the Persian Gulf war 16 months ago, he acted in the named of a new world order. This was not just a war for oil, he said; it was the beginning of an age when aggression against the weak would not be tolerated anywhere.
How cynical that promise sounds today. The world is if anything nastier. There are more victims of aggression. And political leaders show no signs of the firmness needed to stop it -- least of all George Bush. 
 The most painful disappointment is in what was Yugoslavia. For nearly a year now Serbia's Communist leader, Slobodan Milosevic, has used his troops and Serbian irregulars to kill and terrorize other ethnic groups in the neighboring republics. And what are the rest of us doing? Essentially standing by and wringing our hands.
The United States, the European Community and the United Nations have tried various devices in the former Yugoslavia. They have sent mediators, stationed truce monitors on-site, dispatched peacekeeping forces. All have failed to stop the bloodshed.
The reason they have failed is plain. Mr. Milosevic and his Serbian allies do not want peace. They want to acquire territory by force. They will not be stopped by exhortation.
The only thing that would have stopped the aggressors was a credible threat of force. And the United States and European Community gave that leverage up at the start, indicating that in any event they would not intervene militarily to stop the slaughter.
Intervention in struggles among ethnic or religious groups is tricky business. It is often not easy to say who are the good guys, if any. In this case, I have no illusion that the other Yugoslav groups are saints. But the Serbs were and are the principal aggressors. "Stop the Serbian aggression," The Economist wrote recently, "and you end the bloodshed."
Moreover, there have been moments when the aggression was so naked that European and American intervention would have been generally regarded as justified. One was when the Serbian forces pounded Dubrovnik, a Croatian city of great historic and cultural interest and no imaginable strategic value.
Another such occasion is here now, in the merciless Serbian attacks on Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Watching the television pictures of shells falling on that city and civilians huddling in fear, I thought that civilization had not advanced since Nazi bombs fell on Rotterdam. Some new world order.
At Dubrovnik last fall there was, and at Sarajevo now there is, a way for the United States and the Community to act effectively without undue risk of being embroiled in military action on the ground. That is to take command of the air.
The Americans and Europeans have plenty of warplanes, based near enough, to do exactly that. We could have said to Mr. Milosevic, and still could: Stop your aggression at once, or our military aircraft will control your skies. Not just over Dubrovnik or Sarajevo but over Belgrade.
The Bush Administration has kept Iraq's warplanes grounded since the gulf war -- although it had to be shamed into enforcing that rule after Saddam Hussein's slaughter of Kurds and Shiites. The threat to do the same to Serbia would surely be credible.
The failure of nerve and imagination in the face of Serbian aggression is Europe's as well as America's. But President Bush raised expectations so high in the gulf war that disappointment naturally focuses on him. What has happened to the man who three days after Iraq grabbed Kuwait said, "This will not stand"?
The Iraqi invasion must have had special connotations for George Bush: echoes of Munich, the personalized devil figure of Saddam Hussein. Or else the difference really was no more than oil.
There is no oil in Sarajevo. But the failure to stop the Serbian anschluss may have large consequences. The world is that much less likely to be able to prevent the ethnic conflagrations that threaten in large areas of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. We might remember that this terrible century began its downward slide 78 years ago in Sarajevo.

HEADLINE: A Lifetime Fighting Racism: Was It Worth It?;
Marginalized Blacks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We concur with the overall intellectual demeanor of "White Poor, Black Poor" by Orlando Patterson and Chris Winship (Op-Ed, May 3), namely: (1) that the social mobility dynamics among African-Americans are no longer homogeneous but rather are heterogeneous; (2) that poverty in America is multiracial and that the multiracial perspective is fundamental to effective policy responses to poverty, and (3) that the old monolithic white supremacist mind-set among American whites has attenuated, allowing more and more of them to embrace integration and biracial identities. We would demur, however, on the way Mr. Patterson and Mr. Winship formulate and arrive at these points. 
 First, we thought they were incredibly harsh in charging Prof. Andrew Hacker's book, "Two Nations," with patronizing characterizations of blacks' marginalization in American life, a charge they extend to liberal analysts generally. To the contrary, we think Mr. Hacker's characterizations are both balanced and accurate, decidedly more accurate than the Patterson-Winship observation that "Some blacks, like numerous whites, may feel marginalized; most do not."
Survey data show, contrary to Mr. Patterson and Mr. Winship, that a majority of African-Americans do feel marginalized in many areas of American life. For example, an ABC News-Washington Post poll (September-October 1989) posited that "black people are not achieving equality as fast as they could because many whites don't want them to get ahead," to which 75 percent of blacks replied "yes." When asked in this same poll whether they experienced discrimination (marginalization) in specific areas, they responded "yes" in the following areas: getting managerial jobs, 61 percent; wages, 57 percent; getting decent housing, 52 percent.
A more recent Newsweek poll (April 20-May 1, 1992) revealed a similar sense of marginalization among African-Americans in regard to the country's justice system, with some 75 percent of blacks saying that the justice system treats blacks "more harshly" than whites.
To support their charge that liberal analysts exaggerate racial patterns in American life, Mr. Patterson and Mr. Winship claim most blacks "live separately from whites . . . because they choose to. This, in itself, is no problem; it's a free country." First, we disagree that high levels of residential segregation are not a problem; rather, we concur with the major analyst of housing segregation, Prof. Douglas Massey of the University of Chicago Population Center, who says "extreme levels of racial segregation have serious negative consequences for black households . . . since residential mobility is a major avenue of social mobility."
The research on housing segregation by him and by the National Academy of Sciences shows that the high level of residential segregation among black Americans is imposed by racist processes, and at the current rate of desegregation it would take 60 years to fall to the moderate segregation rate among Hispanic and Asian-Americans.
Mr. Patterson and Mr. Winship offer a dubious theory of systemic change when they say that "however disquieting to moralists, majorities everywhere are moved to solve fundamental problems only when they find it in their interest to do so." But this does not tell us how a new notion of majority "interest" is arrived at.
We suggest that activist minorities are often the initial carriers of perspectives and options that eventually get transformed into a "majority interest" -- activists like agrarian populists, trade unionists, suffragettes and feminists.
So, contrary to the Patterson-Winship suggestion that the abolitionists' moral exhortations were incidental to the Civil War and the freeing of slaves, we believe the abolitionists were fundamental elements in these processes. So were the civil rights activists, and their liberal and leftist allies, fundamental to the attenuation of the monolithic white supremacist mind-set among American whites.
Mr. Patterson and Mr. Winship would have us believe that this attenuation emerged mainly through the automatic volition of whites, aided perhaps by the hero attachment to high-achieving black athletes, entertainers and artists. We would place more emphasis on the activism of liberals, leftists and perhaps some moderates -- and even on the occasional lower-class urban explosion, like the terrible riots in South-Central Los Angeles.

Dear Sir:
I find it irritating when you talk about fuel "economy" in cars like BMWs. I mean really! Nobody who puts down 50 grand for an inflated German status symbol is worried about how much the gas costs. Somebody should open a line of prestige gas stations to sell them overpriced gas.

HEADLINE: Saigon, in Transition and in a Hurry

BYLINE: BY STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven Erlanger, Moscow correspondent for The New York Times, was Southeast Asia correspondent from 1988 to 1991. He has visited Vietnam often, most recently in Dec. 1991.

 BODY:
Sunday evening in Ho Chi Minh City. At first it sounds like the beginning of "Apocalypse Now," with the growling whumf-whumf of American helicopters prowling across the paddy fields, reconning raw material for the ultimate body count.
But standing outside the Majestic Hotel, at the beginning of Dong Khoi Street by the sinuous Saigon River, these days, one sees an almost stranger phenomenon: countless motorbikes, motor scooters and motorcycles, like enraptured mosquitoes, their little motors revved as high as possible, carrying neatly dressed young men and women in a continuous formation down Dong Khoi toward the river, then up Nguyen Hue and around again, for hours at a time. 
 It seems familiar, merely boy-meets-girl, or boy-shows-off-for-girl, the way American teen-agers used to drag Main Street in their parents' Chevrolets. But many of these young faces look bored, even unhappy, and finally one realizes this is a form of demonstration: gilded youth driving home the lack of entertainment and opportunities in this transitional regime, which still talks of revolutionary socialism but fosters dreams of blue jeans.
Vietnamese recount "The Fable of the Year 2000," wherein a young goat and an old goat meet at a narrow bridge into the future. The old goat says he should go first; age must be respected, and besides, he hasn't much time. The young goat says the old one has had his chance, and "I'm in a hurry." It's true: these kids don't much care about doctrine. Their ideology is "song voi," or living quickly, and they are once more looking to the West for their models.
This tension between young and old, East and West, North and South, socialism and capitalism, is what makes a visit to Saigon, the name once more in vogue for the former capital of what was once South Vietnam, so stimulating. It is especially so for Americans, who left their innocence here.
 
THE COSMOPOLITAN CITY
 Even in the year since I last visited, the changes are extraordinary, at least on the city's surface. Billboards, the graffiti of capitalism, are everywhere: for Sharp, Seiko, Kenwood, Daewoo and Goldstar, for Joy! and Souvenir and Tourism cigarettes and even for Visa cards. (Americans, still limited by Washington's ongoing economic embargo against Vietnam, are the only people unable to use credit cards here.)
But the billboards look down on the old, essentially French colonial city, where you can still take a pedicab, called a cyclopousse, or cyclo, through streets lined with acacia and flame trees, overtaken by motorbikes driven by long-haired young women wearing white trousers and elbow-length gloves to protect their skin from the sun. Cafes serve baguettes and thick cafe filtre; old men wear berets; the schoolboys carry French-style book bags, and only later, at night, sport American-style shades.
The rooftop bars are still brilliant with parrots and tropical sunsets bleeding in the fragrant, humid air. The garden restaurants, still French-influenced, offer everything from crabe farci, lobster ravioli, eel, cobra and venison to, in one establishment, "easy over fried frog" and "snakehead fish in hot sprayed fat" -- which turns out to be superb, lightly fried monkfish. The city's best and most expensive French restaurant, Le Mekong, was begun by a Vietnamese-American who lives in California, but calls himself "Alain."
The streetside stalls for pho, or soup, with their compelling smells of broth and spring onion, still open at dawn. And the dance halls and casinos, the markets and pagodas, the bookshops and junk shops, even the winding river, still provide insights into a place that has absorbed Chinese, French, American, Soviet and, yes, North Vietnamese influences, yet remains true to its own pleasure-seeking heart.
On the River
It is the river that supports the life of this bustling, business-mad city, but it can also afford the visitor a chance to catch his breath.
Just across from the Majestic Hotel, you can rent a small boat with a wooden sunshade for between $5 and $10 an hour, depending on your bargaining skill -- or your cyclo driver's connections. Your pilot will measure out just enough gasoline, stick in the plank rudder, and head out past the flowering, floating weeds and the ancient, rusty hulks that ferry Vietnamese -- some in conical hats and some in pink polyester, with pink polish on their toenails -- to work.
One day, go upriver, past the Russian merchant ships being painted at their moorings, while young men fish and collect reeds on the opposite bank. Take the Thi Nghe channel past the zoo, to see urban life on the river: bathing, clothes- and dish-washing, fishing with large nets on bamboo poles attached to a small dock at the back of the house.
Another day, take the boat into Cholon, Saigon's Chinatown, due west of the city center. Cholon, which means "Big Market," is thick with ornate temples, more richly decorated than their counterparts elsewhere in the city. One of my favorites, always fine in port towns, is the Chinese temple to the Goddess of the Sea, who protects sailors, fishermen and merchants. At 710 Nguyen Trai is Saigon's best example, the Thien Hau, built at the end of the 18th century, with particularly intricate ceramic friezes in the interior courtyard and numerous representations of the Goddess, her servants, her guardians and her bed.
Cholon's secular temples are the markets. On An Duong Vuong Street there is a new one arising, called An Duong Market, which has the first working escalator open to the public since 1975. It's worth a visit simply to watch Vietnamese schoolgirls, hand-in-hand in their pure white ao dais -- the traditional dress of slacks and high-necked tunic, slit high up the side -- take their first ride.
 
NEW ENTREPRENEURS
Vietnam now welcomes tourists and investment from the capitalist world, both East and West, and money is pouring in. Despite renewed inflation, the lives of many urban Vietnamese are improving. Even as their tiny official salaries lose purchasing power, they find new ways of doing business. Teachers, who make the equivalent of about $5 a month, tutor; mechanics open repair shops; doctors make private appointments.
"Life is better and the Government is lighter now," said an old Vietnamese friend, a trader. "Even poor people find money more easily in Saigon than before."
The engine of the change is Asian. Vietnamese who now live or have connections in Hong Kong, Singapore and especially Taiwan, are creating joint ventures with the state or investing in small businesses. So are the Japanese and Thais, taking advantage of low labor costs, prompting some Vietnamese to fear that Asian neocolonialism will exploit them more than the West ever did.
Of course, in a city increasingly devoted to businessmen and tourists, there are inevitably more establishments catering to foreigners. Businessmen who need the most modern communications in the city frequent the Saigon Floating Hotel, moored in the river and symbolically cut off from the city by a pier. Australian-managed and hugely bland, with small rooms and high prices, the Floating Hotel is a place for reassurance. Traverse the pier, and you could almost be in Adelaide.
An open storefront at 42 Dong Du, just off the main tourist drag of Dong Khoi (the former Tu Do Street before 1975, and Rue Catinat for Graham Greene and the French), is an even stranger re-creation. An expatriate bar called "Apocalypse Now," with matte black walls, it offers T-shirts with such messages as "Lift the Embargo Now." The music is from the 1960's, and young Germans who seem to have watched Oliver Stone's movie about The Doors too many times hang about in the haze of strong Southeast Asian marijuana. This is a place for the "Lonely Planet" crowd, named after the popular series of budget and backpacker guides to exotic destinations. Even the new generation of Vietnamese bar girl stays away from "Apocalypse Now," which may be its best feature.
In another indication of official relaxation or exhaustion, "Scarlett," the cobbled-up sequel to "Gone with the Wind," is already translated into Vietnamese, about $1.25 for both volumes. Danielle Steel, too. And in the large bookstore on Nguyen Hue Street, near the river, budding Vietnamese entrepreneurs who know English can buy Rosabeth Moss Kanter's "When Giants Learn to Dance," cover price $10.95, for about $1.80.
There has also been an increase in petty crime -- pickpocketing, camera- and watch-snatching, as well as more open begging, prostitution, drug use and gambling. These were phenomena retarded, after 1975, by the heavy hand of the socialist state. Now all the principal hotels pay the police a monthly cash "supplement" for protection.
 
 
ELEPHANTS, GODS AND PONIES
Some hints for visitors:
Spend a Sunday afternoon at the Saigon Zoo if you want to watch local families. Entrance is about 7 cents, and you get a ticket charmingly printed with a blue-haired monkey. The lions look scrawny, but the tigers are magnificent, and there are falcons and monkeys and creatures of many strange hues, whose names my Vietnamese friends couldn't translate. You can buy sugar cane to feed to the elephants, who will stretch their trunks an amazing distance to snatch it from your hand. There are also, still, skillful makers of silhouettes (for all of 35 cents), who love to speak as much French as they remember.
The guidebooks list dozens of pagodas and temples, but the one not to miss is the Emperor of Jade Pagoda. From the zoo, walk toward the river to 73 Mai Thi Luu. The pagoda, built in 1909, is among Saigon's most colorful, full of carved and painted papier-mache statues of fantastical gods and heroes, ranging from the Goddess of Mercy to Thanh Hoang, the Chief of Hell, and his horse. A bas-relief shows the Guardian Spirit of Mother and Child, to whom women pray and burn incense to assure male children. Phat Mau Chuan De, the mother of the five Buddhas, is also well represented. Above all, be sure to see the graphic Hall of Ten Hells, to know what's in store.
Another day, go to the races on Le Dai Hanh Street -- young boys from the countryside, in silks, ride tiny ponies while their mothers watch. The Saigonese love to gamble, and with the approval of the authorities, who get their percentage, the public may once more bet on the ponies 10 days a month. At this stage, all bets are exactas -- one must correctly chose both the winner and the runner-up. Entrance to the track is 4 cents, and there are windows for bets of from 7 cents to about $1.45, which attracts the high rollers. Hawkers work the crowd, selling fruit, snacks, nuts, individual cigarettes and the Vietnamese version of The Racing Form. Bring a hat for the sun and watch your wallet.
 
 
A WAR REMEMBERED
Americans can still find reminders of their presence, from the concrete airplane shelters standing empty at Tan Son Nhut airfield to the bomb craters, now mostly fishponds, that dot the countryside and the rebuilt De Soto buses that ply Saigon's streets.
The war seems vivid in the Cu Chi tunnels, some 20 miles from the center of Saigon. Two sections of tunnels, one at Ben Duoc, run by the Vietnamese Army, and one at Ben Dinh, run by the local party committee, are now open to the public. The Ben Dinh tunnels may be skipped; the Army exhibit, despite tunnels widened to accommodate Western hips, is sufficiently terrifying.
The Viet Cong dug some 125 miles of carefully disguised tunnels in three levels around and under a large American military base. The tunnels are about 4 feet high and between 21 and 27 inches wide. This was enough space for the Viet Cong troops to run through, but I found it easier to get on my hands and knees. The second level down was deep enough in the earth to leave me clammy and panting.
The Ben Duoc installation includes a newly opened lecture hall, video displays, trained guides and a working toilet. There are souvenirs for sale: North Vietnamese helmets and caps, hammocks, the inevitable T-shirts, oil lamps made from a shell or lighters made from rounds of ammunition -- either M-16 or AK-47. There is also a firing range, where visitors may, for $1 a round, shoot an M-16 or AK-47 at targets representing tigers or antelopes. Even the guides find this a little bizarre.
In the center of the city, the war may be revisited in the two old American embassies, the Museum of the Revolution and the former Presidential Palace, now called Reunification Hall. I find Reunification Hall the most interesting, in part because of its architecture, which is a fine Vietnamese version of Edward Durrell Stone. The interior is also redolent of the 1960's, especially the Entertainment Room, which lacks only lava lamps. Here, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese tanks broke down the gates and the South Vietnamese government surrendered. It is preserved as it was on that day.
The indispensable visit, however, is to the Museum of American and Chinese War Crimes, sometimes known as the War Museum and housed in the building on Vo Van Tan Street once occupied by the United States Information Service. The exhibits are propaganda, but can be shocking nonetheless, even if only for the sight of two young Vietnamese girls kneeling and whispering as they count the many arms and legs of a bottled fetus, said to show the effects of U.S. defoliants.
In October, after Vietnam and its traditional enemy, China, resumed diplomatic relations, the enormous room devoted to 1,000 years of Chinese atrocities was quietly closed. This pleases Anh Duc, a writer of old acquaintance and a party member. "We must look to the future," he said. "A time will come, not very far off, I hope, when the American rooms are also shut."
Americans who once fought here tend, when they return, to rediscover their younger selves, first to mourn them, but usually, then, to forgive. They are helped by the essential sweetness of the Vietnamese, who are nearly all glad to see us. It's easier to win, of course, but the winning has been painful too, and now the need to make a living in a time of peace is more important than old wounds. The Vietnamese are desperately eager to rejoin the world from which they've been isolated too long, by both their own folly, and by ours.

HEADLINE: A Calm After the Storm at Spoleto?

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C.

 BODY:
If the battle-weary staff of the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. had only one wish, it might be to put the turmoil of the last few years behind and get on with the new season, which begins Thursday and runs through June 7. The festival, an explosion of culture that enlivens this gorgeously preserved center of Southern charm every spring, was started in 1977 by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who patterned it after his thriving Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
A longing to move ahead would be understandable, given the pressures that Spoleto employees have endured. In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo blew the roof off the restored 18th-century house the festival uses as its headquarters, drenching files and ruining computers. Some of the performance halls were damaged, too, to say nothing of the rest of Charleston. 
 The 1990 festival went on, but the seeds of another calamity were sown when Nigel Redden, the general manager, clashed with Mr. Menotti, the artistic director. The dispute was ostensibly over Mr. Redden's controversial proposal for a Conceptual art show, "Places With a Past." Actually, it was over control of the festival.
Power struggles are by no means unknown at arts organizations, but they usually take place behind closed doors. Although the Spoleto staff did what it could to keep attention focused on the performances, last year's dispute turned into a war of charges and countercharges that drew attention to themselves and raised questions about the fate of the festival.
The principal casualty was Mr. Redden. In his five years as general manager of the American festival, he balanced the books, set up an endowment and oversaw the festival's avant-garde offerings. But he had grown assertive, openly debating programming with Mr. Menotti, challenging the composer's expense accounts and suggesting that his adopted son, Francis (Chip) Menotti, had too much influence on him, and thus on the festival.
When the board backed Mr. Redden, Mr. Menotti announced that either he or Mr. Redden and his followers would have to resign. Mr. Menotti prevailed.
For the short term, the festival has proved resilient. An administrative structure that was torn asunder has been repaired, and although the dispute put planning for the 1992 festival on hold for several months, Mr. Menotti and his staff have put together a schedule that is only slightly paler than the norm, particularly in terms of avant-garde offerings. The Spoleto staff blames the scaling-back on the recession. How and whether the festival will recover remains to be seen.
Its long-term prospects are a mystery, too. Mr. Menotti has re-established himself as the festival's unassailable central figure. But he is 80 years old, and by bolstering his cult, his followers have erected a roadblock for those who will eventually inherit the festival.
Mr. Menotti's principal ally was Joseph P. Riley Jr., the Mayor of Charleston, who has a considerable interest in keeping the festival prosperous and insuring its future. By the Mayor's estimate, the festival brings $50 million a year in tourism to the city, and it has stimulated year-round arts programs. To tell the board that the festival would not be welcome in Charleston if it forced Mr. Menotti out, as the Mayor did last year, was a gamble. Several board members denounced the move as inappropriate interference.
"I had to act according to my strongest sense of the city and what the festival has meant to it," Mayor Riley said recently. "This is a world-class festival, and it was brought here by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was his vision and his dream. And I felt that to allow the board to get rid of him would not only be morally wrong, but would have doomed the festival to also-ran status. It was my duty to prevent that from happening."
When the smoke cleared late last summer, Mr. Redden resigned, as did 19 of the 46 board members. (Mr. Redden is now a consultant to the Santa Fe Opera and the American Music Theater Festival.) The Mayor calmed the waters by luring the 79-year-old Theodore S. Stern, one of the festival's founders, out of retirement to serve as interim chairman, beginning last September.
Mr. Stern, Spoleto's chairman from 1980 to 1985 and president of the College of Charleston for a decade, commands considerable respect here. He reconstituted the board, expanding it to 56 members, including the Mayor. He put together a committee that will serve as a buffer between Mr. Menotti and the board and the staff in future disputes. And he oversaw the selection of Mr. Redden's successor, Marcus L. Overton.
Mr. Overton, a 48-year-old native of Georgia, became Spoleto's executive director in January. He had been the manager of the Smithsonian Institution's performing arts programs, and worked before that at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and at Ravinia.
Asked what he would like the festival to be in 10 years, Mr. Overton said: "I want it to be whatever it becomes and however it evolves in the mind of Gian Carlo Menotti. I am pleased and proud to say that the Maestro solicits and welcomes my suggestions. I do not have any hidden artistic agenda. I have many things that interest me personally, and from time to time I will present them to the Maestro when it appears that they may fit in, in some way, with his ideas. And my own ego or my sense of status here will not be threatened if he says no."
For the most part, this year's festival fits the mold Mr. Menotti established long ago. An adventurous opera production, Gunter Kramer's staging of Strauss's "Elektra," is balanced by a Donizetti rarity, "Il Duca d'Alba." The dance offerings similarly pit the traditional against the modern. There is one play ("The Gigli Concert," by Tom Murphy), and there is an exhibition of sculpture by Igor Mitoraj, a Polish Neo-Classicist.
Missing are multicultural offerings like those of the festival's early days, when everything from Zulu dance to Indian drama was presented. And although there is some contemporary chamber music, there are no large-scale avant-garde productions along the lines of the Philip Glass-Allen Ginsburg "Hydrogen Jukebox" of 1990 or the art exhibition of last year.
Asked about the festival's blunted edge this season, Mr. Menotti protested that there are some avant-garde events. He pointed to the appearance of the Teatrj Ekspresji, a Polish dance company with modernist leanings, and said that the "Elektra" production "couldn't be more avant-garde."
But whatever its artistic profile, the festival has shrunk noticeably since last year. Its budget is $4.6 million, down about $1 million from 1991, and covering about 20 percent fewer presentations (103 this year compared with over 120 in 1991). The festival staff is projecting ticket sales of $1.8 million, leaving $2.8 million to be raised in donations. The power struggle last year had a detrimental effect on both planning and fund-raising: usually the festival's first prospectus is published in the late fall, but by mid-September, Mr. Menotti -- still awaiting the resignations of his opponents on the board -- had not divulged his thoughts on the 1992 program. And Mr. Redden contended at the time that the board could not raise money without a program to show potential sponsors. These problems should not arise next year, since the board has been stacked with Menotti loyalists, and Mr. Overton, clearly, is committed to keeping the peace.
But peace is not a commodity that has ever come easily to the festival. In 1976, a search committee from Charleston visiting Mr. Menotti's Italian festival saw nudity in some productions and opposed the American festival. It might never have got off the ground if Mayor Riley had not fought the committee's motion to disband and enlisted Mr. Stern's aid in forming a board -- a sequence of events that prefigured the recent battle.
Mr. Menotti was intent on having the festival in Charleston, a city with a historic district that instantly seduces a visitor. Walking through it on a warm spring day, one is taken with both the fragrances of flowers in bloom and the stateliness of the 18th- and 19th-century houses that have survived the assaults of the Civil War and occasional hurricanes.
"I think the main basis for a successful festival," Mr. Menotti said in a recent telephone conversation, "is first of all the scenery of the location. It should be small enough to give a feeling of intimacy and large enough to accommodate tourists.
"And of course, a festival should have a patron saint. Salzburg has Mozart. Bayreuth has Wagner. Now, Charleston has everything. It has the proper atmosphere, intimate and with great warmth. And it has a patron saint, who is much more modest, but is at least alive and very dedicated."
In Charleston, this sainthood is taken quite seriously, and it is difficult to have a 15-minute conversation about the festival without hearing one of the Spoleto mantras: "Maestro Menotti is a genius," or "Who else could have put together a festival like this?"
Others have, actually. One need only think back to Pepsico Summerfare in its final years, when Christopher Hunt presented an amazingly inventive series of both conventional and avant-garde performances in Purchase, N.Y. The festival died in 1989 when its sole sponsor, Pepsico, withdrew its support. And the First New York International Festival of the Arts, though maligned for its sprawling ambitions and unable to find support for a full-scale sequel, was more varied and adventurous than Spoleto.
Mr. Menotti enjoys being provocative, and he has a truly theatrical ability to stage conflicts that keep the festival in the headlines but are rarely serious. Early in its history, for example, he regularly proclaimed jazz unworthy of inclusion. Yet he has never forbidden it, and it has remained an important part of the festival. This year, the season finale, usually a symphonic concert, features the Duke Ellington Band.
Such disputes arise because Mr. Menotti's programming method has always been democratic. From the time of the first festival in Italy, he has surrounded himself with trusted advisers, who scout performers and recommend them to him. Even the music programs, which he might be expected to dominate, have input from others. Mr. Menotti considers their suggestions. When avant-garde productions are involved, he may accept them, then publicly voice his distaste.
"I cannot possibly see everything myself," he said. "And I want the people who work with me at the festival to have creative jobs, not just to be yes men. Sometimes they bring me things I don't like, but when I feel that what these people are doing is worthy of attention and respect, they are welcome in my festival."
That flexibility is what made the ruckus last year over "Places With a Past" so puzzling: Mr. Menotti's protest was characteristic, but his adherence to it was not. "I have the Russian power of 'nyet,' " he said, "but the Conceptual Art show was the first time I ever exercised it."
That he did so was a clue that the fight was not about the show but about backstage issues. Mr. Menotti regarded Mr. Redden's persistent championing of the exhibition, combined with his complaints about Mr. Menotti's expenses, as insubordination. And he considered his suspicions confirmed when the board offered him a contract as director emeritus for life, with bonuses for directing his own operas but also a provision prohibiting him from publicly criticizing the festival.
Board members said at the time that they thought Mr. Menotti, who was approaching his 80th birthday, would be amenable to a reduction in responsibilities coupled with a continued association with the festival. The contract they offered provided for a smooth transition from the Menotti era to a future without him.
In the short term, the festival would probably not have changed much if Mr. Menotti had become artistic director emeritus, since the programming had been a team effort anyway and followed Mr. Menotti's established pattern. And to the extent that Mr. Menotti's patron sainthood is an attraction, a sense of continuity is crucial if it is to survive him. The power struggle and its outcome -- essentially, a bolstering of the sense of Mr. Menotti's indispensability -- makes the possibility of a seamless transition unlikely.
But Mr. Menotti may have had his own ideas about that transition, which the contract would also have forestalled. Several of Mr. Menotti's longtime friends, including some who supported him in the skirmish last year, say Chip Menotti, a former actor now in his 50's, was by no means a peripheral figure in the dispute, that he may have instigated Mr. Menotti's anger and sense of betrayal. The suggestion calls to mind comments Mr. Menotti himself made about his son in John Gruen's 1978 biography, "Menotti."
"I wish he wouldn't be so suspicious of every friend I have," Mr. Menotti said then, "but it is his intense loyalty that makes him so possessive."
Now that Mr. Menotti has fended off the insurgents, the question of succession arises again. Everyone involved with the festival dismisses the possibility of a Chip Menotti regime. But the composer himself leaves the question open.
"When I die," he explained, "I am consigning to my son my artistic patrimony, and I know he will jealously preserve it. No, I don't feel that he could take my place. I don't think he would want to. But I know that he will protect my name, and if they want to preserve my name and my idea of the festival, he would be a very good counsel.
"But maybe when I am gone they won't want a Menotti patron saint. Maybe they will let the Spoleto idea die, and like a phoenix, it will fly with wider wings under another name."
 
 
 
THE BATTLE OF CHARLESTON, SKIRMISH BY SKIRMISH
May 1990
Nigel Redden, general manager of the Spoleto Festival, proposes a Conceptual art show, "Places With a Past," which is to use sites in Charleston as backdrops for works dealing with the city's history. Gian Carlo Menotti, the festival's founder and artistic director, objects to the project's content and cost but says the show can go on if Mr. Redden raises the $800,000 needed to finance it.
 
September 1990
Mr. Redden has not reached the monetary goal, and at a board meeting Mr. Menotti asks that the project be scuttled. Mr. Redden argues to save it, and the board backs him. Mr. Menotti threatens to resign.
 
October 1990
The board offers Mr. Menotti a contract naming him artistic director emeritus for life, a post that would strip him of programming and policy-making powers. Mr. Menotti calls it an affront but does not resign.
 
May 1991
At a board meeting just after the festival's opening, Mr. Menotti delivers an ultimatum: either Mr. Redden and his allies on the board resign or Mr. Menotti will do so himself. Joseph P. Riley, Charleston's Mayor, publicly speaks of reconciliation and privately warns the board that if it forces Mr. Menotti out, it cannot count on future cooperation or support from the city. "Places With a Past" opens to critical acclaim and turns a profit: Mr. Redden has raised $185,000 more than the show costs.
 
July 1991
The board again supports Mr. Redden. About two-thirds of its members sign a letter saying they want the festival's administration to remain unchanged. Mayor Riley names two streets in Charleston after Mr. Menotti and designates Spoleto's headquarters the Gian Carlo Menotti Arts Center.
 
August 1991
Mr. Redden resigns.
 
September 1991
At a combative meeting, 19 board members resign. Theodore S. Stern, one the festival's founders, takes over as chairman.
 
January 1992
Marcus L. Overton, formerly the head of performing arts programs at the Smithsonian Institution, is appointed executive director.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE COLD WAR: Views From Africa;
Stranded by Superpowers, Africa Seeks an Identity

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
Once avidly wooed by Washington and Moscow with large amounts of economic aid and modern armaments, the impoverished nations of Africa now find themselves desperate for friends. In the last three years, superpower rivalry has been replaced by international indifference.
"With the end of the cold war, Africa has lost whatever political luster it may have once had," Michael Chege, a Kenyan political scientist working in Zimbabwe, wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs. There are no compelling geopolitical, strategic or economic reasons "to catapult it to the top of the global economic agenda," he said. "Africans must now take the initiative." 
 The abandonment is vividly evident here in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia and Somalia, which were at the center of the tussle for influence on the African continent in the 1970's, now lie devastated, orphans of the post-cold-war era.
Long pro-American, Ethiopia, a pre-industrial country with 50 million people, joined the Soviet camp in 1977 and was rewarded with Cuban troops and billions of dollars of military equipment. Washington responded by pumping arms and money into the vacuum left by Moscow in neighboring Somalia, a desert strip of six million nomads.
Today, Ethiopia, its 30-year civil war over, holds to a fragile peace with a Government that says it wants to establish a democracy. But it has yet to receive any of the economic aid that Washington has promised. The former Soviet Embassy, once swollen with military attaches and diplomats, is virtually empty.
And Somalia, shredded by a civil conflict fought with the instruments of the cold war, is considered so irrelevant that in April Washington successfully pushed for a sharp reduction in the size of the United Nations peacekeeping force being sent there.
But if the superpowers are no longer much interested in Africa, that also means that African despots can no longer insure their grip on power by playing off Washington and Moscow against each other. In country after country they have fallen. As they go, Africans are demanding democratic government.
A big question of the post-cold-war era is how Africans, dependent since their independence on outside aid, will deal with their political and economic futures as they are left to fend for themselves.
 
AIDS Infects Six Million
 Not only do African countries have to wrestle with economies wrecked by civil war and mismanagement; they must also contend with the world's worst AIDS epidemic, which has infected six million people so far and is devastating embryonic middle classes.
World Bank and American officials insist that the overall sums of aid to Africa have not diminished since the end of the cold war. Young African political leaders agree, but predict that aid will soon drop as richer nations, hard up because of recession and facing competing demands for assistance, turn their attention to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In many African countries, an onerous legacy of the cold war is centralized government control, particularly over economic matters, many experts say.
In an address in Washington last October, George B. N. Ayittey, a Ghanaian who teaches economics at American University, said that while there was "a deep-seated fascination with socialism" across the continent, "the basic problem of Africa is statism."
"Whatever the ideological professions of African governments, most -- even so-called capitalist states -- have been characterized by heavy state interventionism," he said.
Professor Ayittey said the solution for Africa was "a situation in which no individual or group, regardless of religion, race or ideological predilections, can capture the state."
For some Africans, South Africa, which is moving to end white rule, offers a glimmer of hope. These Africans look forward to beneficial economic ties with the only industrialized nation in sub-Saharan Africa as South Africa sheds its pariah status.
 
The Talk Is of Money
 But overall, African intellectuals are not optimistic.
"This is the only region in the world where you have B.C., A.D. and the 21st century," said Abdul Mohammed, the director of the Inter-Africa Group, a new consulting concern based in Addis Ababa. "And in some places, like the southern Sudan and Somalia, it's even more B.C. than it was five years ago because of civil war."
Mr. Mohammed, an Ethiopian, said it would take a long time for the aid-dependent countries to wean themselves from the habit. "The first reaction of governments in Africa across the board is to talk about money -- and the money is supposed to come from somewhere else," he said. "The debate is not about multiparties or economic issues, but money."
 
The Roots
From the Empire Into the Fire
 The height of the superpower competition in the late 1950's and early 60's coincided with African movements for independence from the colonial powers, mainly Britain and France. As the Europeans were tossed out, Washington, Moscow and in some instances Beijing were eager to move in. In the 1970's, the Soviets started deploying Cuban proxies in Africa as Portugal was ejected from its colonies in Angola and Mozambique.
The superpowers saw post-colonial Africa as fertile territory for their ideologies and for the reaping of rich resources at low cost.
Moscow, judging the anticolonial fervor to be a good fit with Marxism, waded in first. In 1960, Nikita Khrushchev embraced African leaders at the United Nations, and Soviet embassies sprouted in barely known African countries.
President Kennedy responded by appointing a high-profile politician, the former Governor of Michigan, G. Mennon Williams, as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, a signal that Washington planned to keep as many African countries as possible out of the Communist fold. Africa was regarded as a dynamic place for talented young diplomats as Kennedy's New Frontier did battle with the Soviets and the Chinese over foreign aid and propaganda.
In Zanzibar, for example, the island in the Indian Ocean off Tanzania, a revolution in 1964 put a Chinese-trained Marxist politician in charge. An aggressive young diplomat, Frank C. Carlucci, later head of the National Security Council in the Reagan Administration, was dispatched to keep the island out of the clutches of Beijing.
 
Kenya Is the Prize
 In capitalist-oriented Kenya, newly independent from Britain in 1963, the Soviets and their East European satellites rushed to open embassies. Washington quickly followed, offering exchange programs in America for Kenyan students to offset the offers from Moscow universities. A prominent politician, Oginga Odinga, was financed by Moscow in his political struggle with the first President, Jomo Kenyatta, a tactic that served to reinforce American enthusiasm for Mr. Kenyatta.
The superpowers' early interest in Kenya was not so much a result of what Kenya had but of where it was located: on the Indian Ocean with the port of Mombasa and near Zaire, Africa's second largest country, rich with minerals in the heart of the continent.
In the former Belgian colony of the Congo, later renamed Zaire, the United States engaged in what are viewed as some of its most nefarious cold war covert actions. Fearful that its first leader, Patrice Lumumba, was too cozy with Moscow, the Central Intelligence Agency decided he had to go, even dispatching a specialist in poisons to plan his death. That plot never took place, but eventually the C.I.A. arranged a coup in which Mr. Lumumba was slain and Mobutu Seso Seko, an army colonel, came to power.
In memory of their African hero, the Soviets established Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow where thousands of third-world students were trained by the end of the cold war. This year, the scholarships were canceled.
President Mobutu was a staunch friend of the United States, and successive American administrations, Democratic and Republican, looked the other way as he looted the country.
 
The Battle for Angola
 Above all, what Washington got was a base for its operations in Angola, a cold war theater of operations as hot as that in the Horn.
When Angola became independent of Portugal in 1975, the Soviets and Americans supported different factions competing for power. The Americans were involved because Angola possessed rich oil deposits, and the Secretary of State, Henry A. Kissinger, argued that a Soviet-dominated Angola would endanger the Atlantic sea-lanes. The Cubans sent thousands of troops to bolster the new Marxist Government and the United States launched a covert action to support the anti-Communist Jonas Savimbi.
Not until last year, with the cold war over, was the civil war settled, with the Soviets and Americans cooperating in achieving the peace.
 
Foreign Aid
 A Story of Failure, Told in Ruins
 It is hard to argue with African economists, business executives and aspiring politicians that the cold war was a debilitating and destructive experience for Africa.
The three decades not only produced wars and dictatorships. Across the continent, the shells of buildings, potholed and overgrown roads, rusting buses and trains, even rotting books housed in leaking libraries attest to the failure of aid from both West and East.
The hospital that the Chinese built on Zanzibar is now bereft of drugs, windows and furniture. The island's economy, which once flourished on cloves and trade, limps along on the proceeds from a few adventurous tourists.
The $400 million railroad that the Chinese built through tropical swamps and forests from Tanzania to Zambia barely functions. In Addis Ababa, at the rundown Soviet-built hospital, the Russian doctors have left and Ethiopian medical graduates prefer to work abroad for better wages.
In Zaire, countless American aid projects from corn plantations to road building have disappeared into the jungle.
Why didn't Western aid work? The present Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, who served in the United States Embassy in Zaire in the 1960's, said the aid was dispensed amid "unsound economic policies -- government ownership of major industries, disincentives for agricultural production and unrealistic exchange rates." Poor economic policies were generally accompanied by repressive political arrangements: the one-party state.
"Why didn't we put more pressure on them for reform?" Mr. Cohen said. "I'm probably a minority of one on this. I don't think it was the cold war. I think it was guilt. Guilt for colonialism.
"The Africans claimed they had their own form of African democracy. It was only toward the end of the 1970's we saw the one-party states were fraudulent. But we didn't want to tell the Africans the truth: democracy and human rights were not on anyone's agenda."
 
The Leaders
The Dying Days Of the Despots
 In 1990 the State Department announced that aid to its old friends in Africa would be conditioned on progress toward democracy.
"The U.S. policy shift surprised African despots and thrilled African democrats," said Mr. Chege, the Kenyan political scientist.
Nowhere has the postwar policy been more evident than in Kenya, where after nearly a decade of one-party rule the Government has allowed the registration of political parties and the once reticent press is more outspoken.
The leader in the campaign to persuade Kenya to open up the political process was the American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone Jr. A journalist who had traveled across Africa on the eve of independence, Mr. Hempstone was for many years a cold war warrior who had made his views known as a newspaper columnist and editor of the conservative Washington Times.
 
Tough Talk From U.S.
 Almost immediately on arriving in Kenya in December 1989, Mr. Hempstone began speaking of the need for political pluralism. Whenever a dissident was arrested or a publication closed, Mr. Hempstone issued a statement condemning the Government.
Such public statements from the Americans -- there were many -- angered President Daniel arap Moi and encouraged the opposition. Mr. Hempstone is the first to acknowledge that his outspokenness would have been impossible during the cold war.
In country after country in the last two years, long-entrenched African leaders have been pushed aside. In some cases, rebels seized on the vulnerability of dictators marooned by their former patrons.
In Liberia, Samuel K. Doe, a favorite of Washington, was slain. In Ethiopia, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, an ally of Moscow's, fled, as did Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia, who worked first with Moscow and then with Washington during his 21-year stewardship.
In other cases, previously untried democratic processes worked. In Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda, President for 27 years, was overwhelmingly defeated in peaceful elections last October that brought to power Frederick Chiluba, a trade union leader Mr. Kaunda had kept in jail. In Benin, a former World Bank official, Nicephore Solo, was elected President. After 11 years of military rule in Ghana, Flight Lieut. Jerry Rawlings has bowed to calls for multiparty politics. Even in formerly Marxist Angola elections are scheduled for later this year.
 
Zaire's Leader Hangs On
 In Zaire, President Mobutu hangs on, despite the end of Western aid. But the opposition reacted joyously when Mr. Cohen issued a statement in the Zairean capital, Kinshasa, last November, saying, "Mobutu has lost legitimacy and should hand over the Government to an opposition-led transition."
The end of the cold war has given the United States an opportunity to be serious about promoting democracy in Africa, but having adopted a pro-democracy policy there it seems to be having difficulty carrying it out.
Six months ago, officials at the United States Agency for International Development started a search for a dozen African countries that were democratic enough to merit especially generous amounts of the $800 million available in foreign aid to Africa. So far, officials say, they have been unable to decide on the list.
Even in Ethiopia, where Washington has praised the fledgling Government's efforts at democracy and aid has been promised, it has yet to arrive. "Washington bureaucracy takes a long time to work," Mr. Cohen said.
 
South Africa
A Pariah No More, But a Source of Aid
 There seems little dispute that the end of the cold war gave President F. W. De Klerk of South Africa the opportunity to release Nelson Mandela from prison and legalize the African National Congress. No longer could it be argued that the congress was being run from Moscow with the idea of turning South Africa into a Marxist state.
For its progress toward democracy, Washington has rewarded South Africa with its biggest hunk of aid on the continent: $80 million distributed among nongovernmental agencies working in social services, housing and education.
With the prospects of a black-controlled government in sight and the industrial might of South Africa still intact, many African nations are looking to it for their economic salvation. African politicians are rushing to Johannesburg with trade delegations hoping a prosperous South Africa will provide the engine for their countries' own development.
 
From Bully to Benefactor
 That, some analysts believe, is tantalizingly possible.
Already South Africa has transformed itself from bully to benefactor. Military aid to the Savimbi forces in Angola stopped in the late 1980's and South Africa permitted the independence of its former colony, Namibia. In Mozambique, the South Africans say, they have severed aid to the rebels.
In both Angola and Mozambique, South Africa has established flourishing trade missions. In Zimbabwe, thousands of people line up daily outside the South African trade mission in the capital, Harare, to apply for business visas. Nine flights a week service the Mozambican capital, Maputo, from Johannesburg.
Mr. de Klerk recently visited several African countries, including Nigeria, whose President, Ibrahim Babangida, is the president of the Organization of African Unity and one of the chief crusaders against apartheid.
Wherever Mr. de Klerk went he preached regional co-operation with South Africa, insisting that trade, not aid, was the future for the continent.
 
The Prospects
Money Is Needed, And It's Not There
 "Many people think Africans are incapable of running things," Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, told Western and African officials at a meeting in his country this month. "And even I wonder sometimes."
Mr. Museveni, who in the mid-1980's emerged as the victor from nearly two decades of civil war and has kept the country in relative peace since, argues that the colonial past and then the cold war prevented Africans from being themselves.
"You often heard the question, 'Are you pro-East or pro-West?' " he said, "the implication being that the interests of the West and the East were the only interests to be considered. Those of us who believed that there was such a thing as African interests as distinct from the interests of East and West found lot of difficulty in getting ourselves understood."
Without the constraints of the cold war, Mr. Museveni talks about a reawakening in Africa. But recent events in Uganda, which is suffering from one of the continent's worst AIDS epidemics and where Mr. Museveni has ordained a "no-party democracy," suggest some of the hazards ahead.
 
Inflation Shakes Uganda
 After making economic progress from 1989 to last year with large amounts of World Bank aid, Uganda suddenly saw inflation roar out of control a few months ago. Thousands of government employees are being laid off from their meager $3-a-month jobs.
At the heart of the crisis, Ugandan officials say, was mismanagement by the recently dismissed Finance Minister, who borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from the Central Bank to pay some dubious military expenses and then ordered new money to be printed.
The World Bank's vice president for Africa, Edward Jaycox, has outlined some "minimally acceptable " requirements for Africa to make it in the world economy. The growth rate of agriculture should be increased from 2 percent to 4 percent, he said, and investment increased from 11 percent of gross domestic product to 25 percent.
To achieve these goals, Mr. Jaycox said, Africa will need a net annual inflow of $19 billion. It is an amount many African and Western economists consider unrealistic in the present international environment.

Once Again, a Troubled Behemoth

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Two years ago as the spring was creeping toward summer, the cause of most of the financial community's nail biting and hand wringing was Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer and casino operator. His banks were impatient. His "trophy" assets were tarnishing and his Atlantic City properties were doing poorly.
But just about the only publicly traded company that shivered when Donald Trump caught cold was Alexander's, the department store chain. Mr. Trump owned nearly 30 percent of the retailer, and the company's shares were buffeted by speculation that he would unload his stake to raise cash. (He didn't, but perhaps he should have; when Alexander's finally filed for bankruptcy on Friday, its shares were trading at about $12, down from almost $50 in May 1990.) 
 Once again, it is late spring, and once again a real estate behemoth is in trouble -- the giant Olympia & York, the vehicle for the Reichmann family of Canada, which filed for court protection from its creditors last week. But this time, the Reichmanns' chill is raising goose bumps at a host of publicly traded companies on both sides of the border, from Santa Fe Pacific and its spinoffs to a scattering of penny stocks.
Indeed, court filings on Friday showed that Olympia & York Developments Ltd. owned securities valued at $3.1 billion -- roughly equal to the value claimed for the company's Canadian real estate holdings, but theoretically much easier to convert into cash.
The contrast between the Trump story and the Reichmann case reflects profound differences in culture, history and market regulation, said Richard Sylla, an economics and financial history professor at New York University. "It is the exception rather than the rule for one large American company to own much stock in another," said Professor Sylla. "Here, the notion is that if you really want to buy the company, you buy the whole thing and merge it into one operation."
But in Canada, the tradition has been for the plutocrats -- the Reichmanns, the Bronfmans, the Belzbergs -- to hold big stakes in other major publicly traded companies, in a maze of cross-ownership that rivals that of "Japan Inc." One Toronto banker estimated that those three families may own as much as a fourth of the market capitalization of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
"You call it antitrust, and we call it 'anti-combines,' but it's the same issue," said William Mackness, the dean of the University of Manitoba business school in Winnipeg and a former bank economist. "Here, it simply wasn't possible to forbid that kind of activity. It was unavoidable by virtue of the comparatively small size of the Canadian market."
The result has been a pattern of investment that makes it difficult to predict where the fault lines will run when a serious tremor like the Reichmann problem hits. The 13-D Research Service in Brewster, N.Y., which tracks investment stakes of 5 percent or more that have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, surveyed its data base on Friday and found nearly 90 separate filings by the Reichmann family since May 1984.
The span of these filings is remarkable. They include, for example, a 1985 investment in Universal Money Centers of Kansas City, Mo., a penny stock in the software business, and a 1987 purchase of Gold Standard, a tiny Salt Lake City gold exploration company.
Bigger fish show up in this net, as well. The Reichmann family owns 82 percent of Abitibi-Price, the Toronto-based newsprint manufacturer. To reassure investors, Abitibi released a statement on Friday emphasizing that Olympia & York's problem "would have no effect" on its own affairs. But speculation is high in Toronto that Abitibi would be the most likely candidate for sale by Olympia & York, and no one can say what that selling would do to the company's share price.
In April, the Reichmanns sold their 9.5 percent stake in Trilon Financial Corporation to a Canadian pension fund, although Olympia & York still holds two seats on Trilon's board. Ken Clarke, president of the Toronto-based Trilon, told Bloomberg Business News at the time that he hoped the news would comfort investors, who had been bailing out to escape the uncertainty surrounding the Olympia & York stake.
The uncertainty is even more excruciating for investors in Santa Fe Pacific and its two spinoffs, the Catellus Development Corporation of San Francisco and Santa Fe Energy Resources. On May 8, the Reichmanns announced plans to sell their entire 18-percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific. Those shares have been registered with the S.E.C. in preparation for sale at the end of the month; last week, luncheons with analysts and potential investors were being convened around the country.
One was held on Friday in New York -- but by that time, the Reichmann unit that owned the stake, Santa Fe Pacific Holdings, had been put under bankruptcy court protection. "They told us that there is no problem in getting the shares sold," said Susan Chapman, senior analyst for Forbes, Walsh, Kelly in New York. "They just said they would need the approval of the bankruptcy court."
There is no reason to think that the court would balk at the sale, since it raises much-needed cash. But Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus are much less liquid than their former parent, and Ms. Chapman said it was unlikely the Reichmanns could sell its stakes in those companies as easily.
The real problem, Ms. Chapman said, is that the Reichmann presence has quickly gone from a plus to a negative. "There was a time when it would have been adverse to hear that the Reichmanns were interested in selling a stock," she said. "It would have sparked speculation that they had lost confidence in mangement. Now their presence isn't even just neutral -- it creates terrible uncertainty." These days, she added, "it would be positive if they would just get out -- if they would make their decision and go, so we could get on with life."

HEADLINE: Confronting School Ills, Alabama Looks to Tax

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., May 16

 BODY:
About a year ago, a General Motors executive told state officials here just how close Alabama had come to landing the company's new Saturn plant, its thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in salaries and tax revenues.
The state's package of incentives had been among the best, the executive said, but company officials lacked confidence that Alabama was committed to a well financed education system that could supply the trained workers needed for the plant. Instead, the executive said, G.M. had chosen Tennessee because of that state's willingness to undertake education reforms and to commit itself to long-term financing to pay for improvements in its public schools. 
 The chancellor of the University of Alabama, Phillip Austin, said the decision confirmed what many in the state had known for years about the effects of low education budgets, racial turmoil in the schools and depending too heavily on low wages and low taxes to enticenew business.
 
$410 Million Tax Package
 With this and other setbacks in mind, the Alabama Legislature is about to vote on sending a $410 million package of state and local tax increases to the voters in the form of a referendum. Most significantly, it would require many of the state's 129 school districts to raise their local property taxes, and it would increase state taxes earmarked for education. Lawmakers will vote on the package on Monday, the last day of the session.
But because lawmakers gained support for the measure by trading benefits to powerful interests, including landlords, utilities and farmers, the package may win approval in the Legislature only to be defeated by voters in an Aug. 25 referendum.
 
Other States Reforming

The effort in Alabama comes as a number of other Southern states, including Mississippi, Tennessee and Florida, have shown a willingness to take the political risk of increasing taxes for education, said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based, not-for-profit policy research group.
"It is clearly a trend," Mr. Newman said, "with a lot of states trying to reform education and working hard at it and putting money into it."
Mark Musick, the director of the Southern Regional Education Board, said there were specific local conditions in each of the states fueling their unusual willingness to increase taxes.
"While it is not uniform across the country and the reasons are different, most Governors and legislators who are now more wary of tax increases believe that if they have to have an increase, the place where that is possible is for education," Mr. Musick said.
In Alabama, there is also a sense of playing catch-up. After long years of trading places with neighboring Deep South states at the bottom of the rankings for education spending and achievement, the state now seems more permanently anchored to the bottom, Chancellor Austin said.
Part of the problem, said Cathy Gassenheimer, director of the statewide education advocacy group A-Plus, was that unlike Mississippi, Tennessee and North Carolina, the state had never elected "a new south Governor" who had a vision that took the state beyond its old traditions and long-established power centers.
Others point to the defection of many white residents to private schools, an exodus that was prompted by integration pressures and has not diminished over time. There remain a large number of overwhelmingly black districts in which there is no broad interracial support for public schools.
 
Antiquated Tax Structure
 Another serious problem is the state's antiquated tax structure, which places an unusually large burden for education financing on the state.
According to James Williams, the director of the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama, a private not-for-profit group based at Samford University in Birmingham, 20.2 percent of per-pupil spending is paid for with local property taxes, less than half the national average of 44.9 percent. Another 66 percent of per-pupil spending is paid for with state taxes; the national average is 48 percent. The remainder comes from Federal funds.
But Mr. Williams said that it was the minimal local tax effort that hurt the state most. Alabama ranked 49th out of 50 states last year in the level of spending per student, ahead of only Louisiana, and 48th in local education spending, just ahead of New Mexico and Hawaii.
The proposed tax package would have a strong impact on taxpayers here, raising the state portion of local property taxes as well as forcing school districts to raise their tax rates. Last fall in local votes on raising taxes for education, 10 of 12 districts defeated the increases -- a result that led state Representative Joseph Campbell, a supporter of the package, to lament that while many business leaders, the teachers' union and affluent voters were likely to approve the tax package, "Bubba isn't".
 
Property Tax Increases
 According to staff studies by Gov. Guy Hunt's study group on tax changes, the package would mean an increase of between 60 percent and 65 percent in the local property tax of most property owners.
As the plan made its way through the Legislature it attracted a lot of baggage from the wish lists of special interest groups. The Alabama Farmers Federation demanded a boll weevil eradication program that Natalie Davis, a Birmingham political scientist, angrily said would provide enough money to "send every boll weevil in the state to Disney World."
Other provisions ease some of the general tax burden on landlords and utilities in exchange for the support of those two powerful groups. And a number of measures that would limit tenure for principals, coordinate higher education planning and alter the way superintendents are picked were removed from the package to satisfy other groups.
 
Package Now Diluted
 "So the package is not really comprehensive reform anymore," said Ms. Gassenheimer, explaining why a month ago A-Plus threw up its hands and halted active lobbying for the package. With all the changes, she and others feared that much less than the $410 million generated by the plan would end up actually going to education. By some estimates, no more than $120 million would actually be spent to beef up education.
The person whom many credit with getting the package this far and making what some see as needed compromises is Speaker Jimmy Clark, a 70-year-old political veteran from Eufala who has threatened to tie up the entire state budget if the Legislature does not pass the education package and send it on to voters.
While Gov. Hunt appointed the study group that made the recommendations that led to the package, he has not taken a leading role, leaving that to Mr. Clark. The Speaker has played political hardball on the issue, noting that he was near retirement and had little to lose.
"Alabama may be the last state to come to grips with this issue because we have a lot of special interest groups in the state that just don't think education is important," said Mr. Clark. "Others just think that there is already enough money if it is just properly spent. But the fact is that there isn't enough money now, and we need better trained and educated people if we are going to grow. Right now many of our people are just unemployable."
Far away from the state Capitol, in places like Sylacauga, people like John Floyd, a former P.T.A. president and executive vice president of the local chamber of commerce, cheer Mr. Clark and other supporters of the package while remaining skeptical about what will happen to the measures when and if they get to the voters.
"If they rely on a vague reference to helping the children, the voters aren't going to buy it," he said. "It has just gotten to the point where people just don't trust government to do what's right."

The Global Village Of Photography

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
AS the European Community ushers in a new era in politics by way of the Common Market, the international photographic community is also bracing for great technological changes. These two forces will be explored at the seventh annual Journees de l'Image Professionnelle, scheduled July 4-6 in Arles, France.
Vincent Bertomeu, the founder of the conference, known as JIP, said that this year's lectures and workshops will focus on electronic imaging, in which pictures are made without film and standard processing and instead are stored on electronic chips and disks. The conference is open to professional photographers and advanced amateurs alike. 
 "Changes in the European economy and photo invention will bring about growth in how we train people," Mr. Bertomeu said. "The revolution will change the direction of photography and those who work with pictures. They will have to produce an increasing number of new images."
Indeed, many photographers in the United States and Europe believe that electronic imaging will increase their ability to do business globally.
Vince Streano, the president of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, which represents some 5,000 professionals, met with Mr. Bertomeu recently to discuss photography's new role in the new Europe.
"We have to rethink our business in terms of Europe and on a global scale," Mr. Streano said. He added that computer graphics and the digital transmission of pictures have made photography more than ever an international business.
There will be 17 workshops and lectures in the conference, including these:
*"The New Digital Generation," a lecture by Mr. Streano and Dick Weisgrau, the director of magazine photographers' group, will offer information from an survey by the group on the present and future of professional photography. The speakers will also discuss, among other subjects, how electronic imaging affects a publication's design; computerized picture data banks; changes in business methods, and copyright protection.
*"Between Classical and Digital," a lecture by the European fashion photographer Frank Horvat, will introduce the use of digital images on a computer.
*Jeff Dunas, a photographer, will demonstrate how Sony's electronic technology can be used.
*The digital still-life workshop will include a discussion on how to shoot for catalogues using new technology.
*A press workshop, sponsored by Kodak, will introduce photojournalists to the new electronic-imaging cameras.
*Another workshop will tell participants how to convert silver pictures, negatives and transparencies into digital images and vice versa.
"When I went to Europe last year, I saw the possibilities of the Common Market as a vehicle for us to reach Europe with our pictures and the new technology," Mr. Streano said. "There are opportunities, and there are dangers."
One of the dangers is a possible disregard of copyright law. "When pictures are transmitted and sold globally," Mr. Streano said, "it is important that users in foreign countries are aware of copyright laws and obey them."
More information about the conference and a registration form are available from JIP, 1 Rue Nicolas Copernic, 13200 Arles, France; telephone: (33) 90.96.44.44; fax: (33) 90.96.47.77. No entry fee is required, but registration forms, along with a passport-type ID photo, are due by June 25. Accommodations can be booked through the Tourist Office, 35 Place de la Republique, 13200 Arles, France.

Straight Out of Brooklyn

 BODY:
WHEN Matty Rich, the director of "Straight Out of Brooklyn," closed his clothing store, Matty Rich's Red Hook, in Park Slope last month, it was a chilling reminder that the recession has felled even the most altruistic of ventures.
For Mr. Rich's store was one of several owned by such notable black directors and actors as Spike Lee and Christopher Martin, stores that were created to infuse some life, and cash, back into the neighborhoods that have inspired their film careers, the neighborhoods they grew up in. 
 "Matty wanted to show the black community that it is possible to open your own business," said Susan Nowak, a spokesman for Mr. Rich. "He wanted people to know that you can be young, black and an entrepreneur. But in these economic times, people just couldn't afford to buy as many clothes. And Matty just couldn't help the store grow because of all the projects that he's working on."
Still, Mr. Rich is marketing a line of trendy sports clothing that he once sold at his store. One shop that is considering his line, called Matty Rich Wear, is IV Plai. That store, in East Elmhurst, Queens, is owned by Mr. Martin (a k a Play of the rap-and-film duo Kid 'n Play). IV Plai is not as high-profile as Spike's Joint, Mr. Lee's store in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, but it is not doing badly. Mr. Martin hopes to sell his line, the Select Group, to major retail stores and plans to open shops in other cities.
IV Plai carries custom-made leather and denim items that are designed by Mr. Martin.
"I love fashion," he said. "And I knew I would give back to the neighborhood when I could."
In fact, the store sits in the old game room where Mr. Martin and his friends used to hide out. "It was a select group of us that we allowed to hang here," he said.
"There is this fear in the entertainment business that you'll end up going back to your old job at Burger King," Mr. Martin said. "I'm going to make sure that never happens."

 BODY:
Finding a place to stay is only one of many choices facing the traveler on a tight budget. Here are suggestions on where to eat, what to do and what not to do from 10 New York Times correspondents in cities around the world.
 Since meals can be had in most of Rio's restaurants for under $50 a couple, why not try the rare restaurant that specializes in Brazil's distinctive regional cuisine? Opened last Nov. 15, on Brazil's Independence Day, Cafe Brasil offers spicy fish soups from the northeast ($10) and black bean and sun-dried beef stew ($7) from Minas Gerais, the native state of Leonardo Braga, the English-speaking owner. To accompany, try a lime juice and rum caipirinha ($1.40) or a passion fruit mousse ($1.25). Far off the tourist track on a quiet side street in Rio's Botafogo neighborhood, Cafe Brasil has a lightly bohemian ambiance of bossa nova music on the stereo and tropical plants hanging from the Mediterranean-tile roof. Cafe Brasil is at 25 Rua Capitao Salomao, Botafogo; telephone 266-6483.Reservations help, but are not a must. For plenty of diversion with no admission fee, head for Rio's Sunday Hippie Fair, where piranha paperweights, Amazon hammocks, fanciful kites and T-shirts depicting voluptuous women in string bikinis are among the wares. Sprawling over Ipanema's General Osorio Square, the daylong fair makes souvenir hunting one stop. A few tips for haggling in the warren of booths selling paintings, belts and bags: cut the asking price by 40 percent, don't flash money and wield a pocket calculator. With Brazil's inflation, $50 should pass through the 150,000 cruzeiro mark any day now. 
Foreign tourists can explore this continent-sized nation with a Brazil Air Pass. Purchased for $440 outside Brazil, this 21-day pass allows nonresident foreigners to fly to five domestic cities beyond their port of entry. For example, after arriving in Rio, a visitor could fly to Manaus, the capital of Amazon tourism, then down to Bahia, the center of African-Brazilian culture, then to Brasilia, the modern capital on the high plains, then to Iguassu Falls , Latin America's largest waterfalls, and finally back to Rio. All this costs less than a $700 Rio-Manaus-Rio ticket, bought in Rio.
 Arriving in a Rio hotel, you will be tempted to follow instructions by the bedside and call home. Be aware that hotel surcharges and Brazilian telephone rates add up to $3 a minute charges for international calls. You can cut the cost to almost $1 a minute by using an American operator to call collect or to place the call on an A.T.&T. or M.C.I. credit card. From just about anywhere in Brazil, an A.T.&T. operator is reachable by dialing 000-8010; an M.C.I. operator is reachable by dialing 000-8012, and Sprint at 000-8016.

HEADLINE: California With a New York Edge

BYLINE: By Hendrik Hertzberg; Hendrik Hertzberg is a senior editor of The New Republic.

 BODY:

AFTER HENRY
By Joan Didion.
319 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $22. 
 JOAN DIDION writes well. More often than not, she writes beautifully. That is the main attraction of her work, and the main reason why her reportorial pieces, whatever their other merits and demerits, afford the pleasures of literature. "After Henry" shows that the author of 1968's "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" and 1979's "White Album" has not lost her touch.
In the three main sections of "After Henry," mostly consisting of material that first appeared in either The New York Review of Books or The New Yorker, Ms. Didion moves easily from coast to coast and back again. Under the heading "Washington," she offers a long, shrewd meditation on the Reagan Presidency, a sharply drawn report on the 1988 Presidential campaign, and a prescient snapshot of the incoming Bush Administration, which she correctly predicts will be shaped by a self-created "situation in which the space available for domestic maneuvering had been reduced to zero." The seven pieces in the "California" section, the book's longest, surest and most varied, explore the psycho-political connotations of elements of Western civilization ranging from Patricia Hearst to brush fires to The Los Angeles Times. "New York" consists of a single essay on what she takes to be the meaning of a famous crime, the case of the 29-year-old investment banker raped and beaten nearly to death as she jogged in Central Park in 1989.
Ms. Didion's strength is her sensibility, which is perfectly expressed by, and in some ways identical with, her style. Cool, precise and ironic, she is a master of the pointed use of quotation marks, deploying them like a pair of surgical tweezers. She is an expert geographer of the landscape of American public culture, and she knows that the lines on the maps most of us use seldom correspond to the real boundaries. She is sensitive not only to the uses and misuses of language (her own words are chosen with great care) but also to the patterns formed by the eddying interplay of politics, celebrity, status anxiety and the media. Above all, she is good at noticing and analyzing what she calls "narratives" -- the stories people unconsciously or half-consciously construct in order to make sense of the public events in which they are caught up, whether as participants or as observers. Some of her best essays are narratives about "narratives": when she covers a story, in other words, the story she writes is the story of the stories about the story.
The Didion sensibility, at once languid and Olympian, falters when its subject is itself. An instance is the title piece, which introduces this collection, a seven-page tribute to Ms. Didion's editor Henry Robbins, who died in 1979 at the age of 51. The piece is much more about Ms. Didion's formerly uncertain sense of self, her unfamiliarity with death and her early insecurities as a writer than it is about Robbins, who is pictured as having reassured her about these frailties but remains otherwise frustratingly indistinct. However genuine her love for her friend, she does not restore him to life on the page.
But her cool eye sees sharply when it surveys the rich texture of American public folly. Her article on the 1988 campaign shows her method at its best. What she has to say about the manipulation of images and the creation of pseudo-events makes familiar territory new again. She fashions an illuminating case study out of an incident in which Michael Dukakis played catch with an aide at planeside. The incident -- "what was referred to among the television crews as a 'tarmac arrival with ball tossing' " -- was designed to be a metaphor for the candidate's regular-guy toughness. Ms. Didion traces its progress through articles by Joe Klein, Michael Kramer and David Broder, until it becomes, "at least provisionally, history" -- and takes its place in the bogus "narrative" of the 1988 campaign.
"It is understood that this invented narrative will turn on certain familiar elements," she writes. "There is the continuing story line of the 'horse race,' the reliable daily drama of one candidate falling behind as another pulls ahead. There is the surprise of the new poll, the glamour of the one-on-one colloquy on the midnight plane, a plot point (the nation sleeps while the candidate and his confidant hammer out its fate) pioneered by Theodore H. White. There is the abiding if unexamined faith in the campaign as personal odyssey, and in the spiritual benefits accruing to those who undertake it. There is, in the presented history of the candidate, the crucible event, the day that 'changed the life.' "
Four years later the names and plot points have changed, but the "narrative" threatens to remain the same if the election again turns on "character." Still, Ms. Didion errs, I think, when she rather airily endorses the hoary radical shibboleth that the "choice among determinedly centrist candidates" that American politics normally offers is "fictive." The new makeup of the Supreme Court, to take one example, is very nonfictive indeed.
This points up a weakness of her national political coverage, which is also a weakness of her sensibility. The story of the stories is indeed a story -- but so is the story itself. Her focus on the swirl of "narratives" is useful as a way of exploring political image-mongering, but surprisingly limited as a way of describing the brute political and social realities against which candidates and ideas must in the end be measured.
Ms. Didion's reporting on California, however, is more firmly rooted in such realities. And she has always been at her most original when she writes about the state she knows best. "The extent to which certain places dominate the California imagination is apprehended, even by Californians, only dimly," she writes in her essay on the Hearst case. "Deriving not only from the landscape but from the claiming of it, from the romance of emigration, the radical abandonment of established attachments, this imagination remains obdurately symbolic, tending to locate lessons in what the rest of the country perceives only as scenery."
Ms. Didion locates many such lessons. Much of the Berkeley campus of the University of California was built by Patricia Hearst's great-grandmother Phoebe; so "for a Hearst to be kidnapped from Berkeley, the very citadel of Phoebe Hearst's aspiration, was California as opera." Wyntoon, Phoebe Hearst's misty, Gothic country estate, embodies northern California and "wilderness sanctified," just as San Simeon embodies southern California and "wilderness banished." Ms. Didion finds an ingenious parallel between Ms. Hearst's "abrupt sloughing of the past" when she became the gun-toting Tania of the Symbionese Liberation Army to the don't-look-back spirit of the emigrants of the Donner party, who forsook all attachments when they headed west in 1846. In a report on the psychology of earthquakes, a minor shock "lent a certain moral gravity to the way [Los Angeles] happened to look that weekend, a temporal dimension to the hard white edges and empty golden light." In Ms. Didion's hands, even a report on real estate prices can acquire the ominous quality of film noir.
Elsewhere in the "California" section, she evokes the now perhaps too-familiar seductive anomie of which she has long been the foremost chronicler. "A good part of any day in Los Angeles is spent driving, alone, through streets devoid of meaning to the driver, which is one reason the place exhilarates some people, and floods others with an amorphous unease," she writes -- elegantly, but with her word processor on cruise control. Fortunately, she sometimes parks the car to write knowledgeably and piercingly about the politics of L.A. zoning, Hollywood screenwriting and more.
In her long concluding essay, Ms. Didion casts the Central Park jogger case as a clash between "one vision, shared by those who had seized upon the attack on the jogger as an exact representation of what was wrong with the city," of "a city systematically ruined, violated, raped by its underclass," and an "opposing vision, shared by those who had seized upon the arrest of the defendants as an exact representation of their own victimization," of "a city in which the powerless had been systematically ruined, violated, raped by the powerful." These two "narratives" were subsumed in a third, "the transforming narrative of 'contrasts,' " in which even the "criminality of the city and its related absence of civility could become points of pride, evidence of 'energy': if you could make it here you could make it anywhere, hello sucker, get smart."
Within this framework Ms. Didion offers some brilliant observations about undercurrents of the case. She explores the double-edged symbolism of interracial rape. She reviews, with economy and appositeness, the "entire complex of loaded references," for American blacks, "around the question of 'naming': slave names, masters' names, African names, call me by my rightful name, nobody knows my name." (The jogger remains anonymous to this day in the New York dailies, while the black press repeatedly printed her name. Ms. Didion connects this to the legacy "in which the specific gravity of naming locked directly into that of rape, of black men whipped for addressing white women by their given names.") And she debunks the "sedative" notion that "if the city's problems could be seen as deliberate disruptions of a naturally cohesive and harmonious community, a community in which, undisrupted, 'contrasts' generated a perhaps dangerous but vital 'energy,' then those problems were tractable."
Ms. Didion plainly finds the "black" vision of systematic oppression morally superior to the "white" vision of systematic mayhem. But both visions are contemptible exaggerations, and it is far from clear which, in today's New York, is the more damaging. Moreover, both are rejected by millions of New Yorkers, black and white. These New Yorkers are absent from her schema.
In her discussion of the Rev. Al Sharpton, Ms. Didion seems to admit of no role for black political leaders other than the media-driven polarities she terms "the Good Negro" and "the Outrageous Nigger." Disqualified for the first role by a lack of "refined manners and good grammar," she suggests, Mr. Sharpton has been obliged to cast himself in the second. With this argument, and because the rage Mr. Sharpton expresses (and exploits) is shared by many blacks, she essentially absolves him of responsibility for his destructive demagogy. Surely this is as patronizing as the stereotypes she otherwise deplores.
MS. DIDION is right to connect the growing disharmony of New York life to economic hardship and injustice. But her specific accusation of an "unindict able conspiracy of criminal and semicriminal civic and commercial arrangements, deals, negotiations, gimmes and getmes" is an unexpected echo of naive goo-gooism at best, Dan Quayle-style scapegoating at worst. It's puzzling to find Joan Didion attributing New York's woes to high taxes, too much regulation and too many unions. In any case, gimmes and getmes have been the city's modus operandi for more than a century. So it's hard to see how they can be responsible for its current travails.
Perhaps Ms. Didion brings too much California comfort to her observations of New York. The flip side is that her observations of California have a nice New York edge. In one of the best anecdotes in this book, she recalls that while covering the 1988 Democratic National Convention she had to wait in line for a rotating press pass that would give her access to the convention floor for 20 minutes. Spotting an acquaintance from her screenwriting days, the film director Paul Mazursky, she noticed that Mr. Mazursky had a V.I.P. floor pass -- "and, since I was working and he seemed not about to go on the floor, I asked if I might borrow it for half an hour.
"He considered this.
"He would, he said, 'really like' to do this for me, but thought not."
The story beautifully clinches her point, which is that the Hollywood screenwriters' strike was more about status and hurt feelings than about money. And by telling it, Ms. Didion gets deliciously even with Mr. Mazursky. Really, though, writing well is her best revenge.

HEADLINE: Limousine Operators Fighting City Licensing

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
LIMOUSINE operators in Westchester are up in arms over an attempt by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission to levy a series of fees on suburban-based taxis that pick up passengers in the city.
"If they get away with it, I can say goodbye to a business that took me 15 years to build," said Walter Bell, owners of Walter's Personal Car Service in White Plains. "It makes me very angry, especially because there's no real reason behind it. It's only a scheme to raise money for New York City." 
 Richard J. Guberti, president of the 187-member Limousine Industry Council of Westchester, said that if new fees went into effect his group's members would be forced to raise their prices by more than 40 percent and that at least half of the smaller companies would be forced out of business.
"The exorbitant amount the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission is proposing to license all suburban and taxi limousines is not justified," said Mr. Guberti, who owns Excell Limousine Service in Mount Vernon. "It's only another attempt to raise money for the city."
 
'We Don't Cruise for Business'
 "None of us do business in New York City," he said. "We don't have 212 telephone numbers. We don't advertise for business there. We don't do 'point-to-point' business there. We don't cruise for business like their gypsy cabs do. All we do is pick up customers in Westchester and drive them to and from airports, theaters, proms and restaurants in the city."
Under the commission's most recent proposal, out-of-town taxis that pick up passengers in the city would be charged the same $250 licensing fees as city-based cabs. In addition, the proposal calls for a $50 fee for a license for each driver and a $100 fee for the radio-dispatch base of each out-of-town company.
Originally, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission had announced that on March 2, 1992, any suburban limousine not in compliance found in New York City would be seized and towed. The deadline has been extended to June 1.
Mr. Guberti said that if Westchester operators were forced to raise their rates by 40 percent to cover higher operating costs resulting from New York City licensing requirements, the average charge for a sedan holding up to three passengers going from White Plains to La Guardia Airport would rise to $91 from $65, not including tolls, parking fees or tip. The average charge for a stretch limousine carrying up to six passengers from White Plains to the Manhattan Theater District would rise from to $151 from $108.
Mr. Guberti also said that Westchester operators were concerned that if they are licensed by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission their insurance rates could be raised.
"We'll probably be treated by the insurance companies as vehicles operating within New York City and be charged much higher premiums," he said.
He estimated that insurance would likely increase by $1,500 a vehicle, and by imposing its requirements on suburban operators the city would open the operators to further business taxes.
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke is working with Westchester's state legislative delegation to bar the city commission's attempt to impose fees on suburban limousine operators.
"I've already written to the county executives of Nassau, Putnam, Rockland and Suffolk Counties, who are behind our efforts to bar the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission from levying licensing fees on suburban operators," Mr. O'Rourke said. "At the same time, our county attorney is researching the law to determine what retaliatory measures we can take, such as establishing our own taxi and limousine commission, the power to levy similar fees on taxis and limousines that do business in Westchester."
"But frankly," Mr. O'Rourke added, "I feel that's a tactic of last resort. We don't want to engage in a border war in which everyone loses."
 
A Second Try in Albany
 A bill proposed by State Senator Norman Levy to regulate fees equitably for all limousine companies, which was passed by the Senate but defeated in the Assembly, has been reintroduced.
To give the State Legislature time to work on a solution, Mr. O'Rourke has tried to get the Taxi and Limousine Commission deadline extended to the end of the year.
"Although we weren't able to get the City of New York to agree to declare a six-month moratorium on the enforcement of the licensing provision on suburban taxis and limousines, I have been in constant contact with Mayor Dinkins, whom I have always found to be reasonable and fair," Mr. O'Rourke said. "The Mayor has agreed to continue our negotiations on a day-to-day basis in hopes of resolving the matter amicably."
The County Executive said that any additional fees "would be disastrous for all the entrepreneurs who through hard work and on their own have established businesses."
 
Livelihood in Jeopardy
 Mr. Bell is one of those entrepreneurs. He capitalized his fleet of five late-model Lincoln Town Cars and one stretch limousine himself.
"I've put a lot of money into my business," Mr. Bell said. "The Town Cars cost me about $20,000 apiece; the limo about $40,000, and that does not include the insurance. Now the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission wants me to give them what amounts to over $15,000 out of pocket. That's if I want to be able to pick up my passengers in the city or at area airports.
"What's strange about the whole thing is they say it's O.K. for me to pick up passengers in Westchester, but I can't pick up the same passengers in New York City for a return trip without being licensed by them."
Since 90 percent of his business is generated by Westchester corporations, much of it in airport trips, Mr. Bell said, his livelihood would be in jeopardy should the New York City licensing provisions go into effect.
"In this business, you are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week," he said, "and the competition is fiercer than ever because a lot of corporations are downsizing and cutting back on all services. It took me more than 10 years to establish good personal relationships with corporate accounts. And I know I'd surely lose most of that business if I couldn't provide them with airport pickups.
"People say, 'Well, you can always raise your rates,' but if you do that in today's world, you price yourself right out of the market," Mr. Bell added. "Corporations will simply turn around and rent cars for their executives and have them drive themselves instead."
 
A Threat to Hotels
 Richard Eisley, president of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the fee proposal would deal a blow to the county's convention and tourist industry. "Our hotels, conference hotels and historic attractions would all suffer along with the limousine industry," Mr. Eisley said. "We're backing their battle to the hilt."
James Moricone, owner of James Limousine Service in White Plains, has a fleet of 17 vehicles. Most of his business is with corporations in the area, like Pepsico and its affiliates, with which he has contracts to supply car and limousine service on demand.
"If the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission has their way, my fleet would be reduced to five vehicles," said Mr. Moricone, who is an executive director of the Limousine Industry Council. "That's all I could afford."
The one- and two-car fleets would be forced out of business, Mr. Moricone said, "or else they would join the thousands of illegal drivers who are already competing with us."
"I'd say that our industry -- already hard hit by the recession -- would lose 50 percent of its present members," Mr. Moricone estimated.
Noting that there are plenty of New York City taxis coming into Westchester every day, Mr. Moricone said: "Are we going to shut them out to get even? Are we going to guard the borders of the county? It would be better for all of us in the industry, in Westchester and New York City, if we solved the problem by issuing state permits to operators or through establishing reciprocal agreements between counties."

HEADLINE: Scofflaws Give Communities A New Line Item

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
LAST fall New Britain paid $1,875 for five Denver boots, devices that immobilize illegally parked cars until their owners pay outstanding parking tickets. "We had more than $60,000 in unpaid tickets, and we had to do something," said the supervisor of the New Britain Police Department's traffic division, Sgt. Joseph S. Rizzo.
It proved to be a good investment: New Britain got back more than half the cost of the boots the first day, snaring two of the city's worst scofflaws, who owed $1,000 between them. Since then, the boots have brought in more than $15,000, Sgt. Rizzo said. As tax collections fall and municipal expenses rise, towns are looking at all sources of revenues, and parking ticket receipts are getting increasing attention. Across the state, officials are using a variety of methods to collect unpaid parking tickets, which can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 Besides the boot, which is used in at least a dozen cities and towns, municipalities are employing collection agencies, installing computer systems to more readily identify scofflaws, or impounding the vehicles of those with unpaid fines.
Some towns are starting to use a law to block parking-ticket scofflaws from registering their cars, and adopting ordinances to double or triple the fines after a certain number of days.
Towns are also going after more parking-ticket revenue by raising the fines so it is no longer practical to park in a no-parking zone. Bridgeport, a financially beleaguered city, hired six meter attendants this year to patrol the downtown district; they were looking for drivers parking 20 minutes in a 15-minute zone, parking too far from the curb or parking in a loading zone.
Police say that even in these times, people are willing to risk a ticket if it means saving a few steps. Some tickets are put on vehicles parked just a few feet from garages, where people could have parked legally and a lot less expensively. The Collector of Revenues in Mansfield, Pamela V. Wells, said that the number of tickets issued in that town, primarily on the University of Connecticut campus, had been climbing sharply, from 30,000 in 1990 to 35,000 last year. The Town Council decided it was due in part to an old fine schedule -- tickets were all $10, with no late penalties. So they raised the levies, depending on the offense, to as much as $25, and instituted a $5 charge if the tickets were not paid in 21 days. Still, the town expects to issue about 30,000 tickets this year, based on the trend so far, Ms. Wells said.
The boot, which has been around for the last 10 years, is becoming one of the most popular methods of cracking down on scofflaws.
In Greenwich, one of the first towns to employ the device, a traffic technician, Scott T. McConnell, said that a list of scofflaws was updated every two weeks and given to police officers. "Most of the tickets are given out in the central business district, to people who are there on a regular basis," Mr. McConnell said. "They have to come to work, and if they're on that list they're going to be spotted sooner or later."
Mr. McConnell said it was not unusual to snare people with $500 or $600 worth of parking tickets. "We have five boots, and they're used pretty steadily," he said.
In New Britain the new boots are being deployed with a more sophisticated method of tracking scofflaws: hand-held computers that get updated daily. "We catch up with people a lot quicker," Sergeant Rizzo said. "If someone makes the scofflaw list on a Wednesday night patrol, we know about it by Thursday morning, and the next ticket he gets, he gets the boot."
The computers also print out tickets, Sergeant Rizzo said, which speeds up the process considerably. "We can tag a whole line of cars in 40 seconds -- zip, zip, zip," he said. "We're getting real high-tech."
Sergeant Rizzo said that the police were also concerned about a $5 ticket for overtime parking in a one-hour zone being cheaper than paying $8 for a parking garage for the day. As a result the police asked for, and got, a city ordinance that allows for multiple ticketing: after one hour the car gets its first ticket, after two hours it gets its second, and so on. "If you get five tickets in a restricted area, that's $50, but after 10 days it's $150," Sergeant Rizzo said. "It can add up to some real money pretty quickly."
 
'Question of Image'
 Parking violators aside, not everyone likes the boot. The parking enforcement administrator for the City of New Haven, Charles A. Wailonis, said that he has some boots but does not use them. "It's a question of image," he said. "Driving down the street and seeing a car with a boot on it doesn't translate into, 'Welcome to New Haven.' "
Even in New Haven, which has $506,000 of unpaid tickets from people who owe at least $150 each in fines, scofflaws do not get off any easier. When their cars are spotted they are towed to an impoundment area where they are held until the owner pays the fines as well as towing and storage charges. Mr. Wailonis said New Haven was impounding 40 to 60 cars a week. "A year ago we were probably impounding about 30 percent fewer cars than we are right now," Mr. Wailonis said. "Some of it is the fact that more people are not paying their parking tickets, probably because of the economy," he said.
But it is also because those who hand out the tickets have been given radios that allow them to call for a tow truck.
Last month the city also began using a different towing company each day rather than a different one for each call. "That allows them to beef up their staff on their day, and keep a couple of trucks right in the downtown, ready to go," Mr. Wailonis said. "That's cut way down on our response time."
Mr. Wailonis also said that New Haven has started to take advantage of a law that allows the state's five largest cities to block scofflaws from registering their cars. In January it sent a list of 300 scofflaws to the State Department of Motor Vehicles. On April 28 it sent 375 more names. The registrations on those cars, including vehicles owned by people from out of town, cannot be renewed until the parking fines are paid.
Ms. Wells said Mansfield and other smaller towns were lobbying for the same power. She said it could have a particular effect in a college town like Mansfield. "A lot of these cars are driven to campus by the student but registered to the mom or dad, and when the notice of the tickets comes home the student is told to take care of it," Ms. Wells said. "If all of a sudden they can't renew their registration, that will certainly get some action."
 
$20,000 a Year in Fines
 The Tax Collector for Bristol, Esmonde J. Phelan, said that that city collects about $20,000 a year in parking fines, but he is not sure how many scofflaws there are because the records have never been computerized. "I'd like to say we're collecting two out of every three tickets that we're giving out, but I'm not sure the collection rate is that good," Mr. Phelan said.
A project to computerize those records by June has been delayed because of personnel cuts, Mr. Phelan said, "but there's no question we have to computerize that list if we want to maximize our collections.
"There's no question the process of computerizing the records would pay for itself in short order," he said. "And, as long as there's a need to give a parking ticket, we should have a vehicle to collect it. Otherwise, it's not fair to the people who pay their fines on time."
In Waterbury, the Deputy Police Superintendent, Richard J. White, said the city recently doubled the price of a parking ticket, and imposed late fees for the first time -- though they offered scofflaws amnesty for a month. The program was so successful that one scofflaw called from his new home in the Middle West to settle a bill of several hundred dollars, Mr. White said.
"There was a little criticism that we shouldn't give them the chance to pay at the old rate," Mr. White said. "But the fact is, 100 percent of nothing is still nothing."
Mr. White said Waterbury has also started to take advantage of the law that allows it to block scofflaws from registering their car. "We'd like to get some boots, but with times the way they are we can't afford the investment," he said. "I think we'll accomplish just as much as we did if we impounded the car this way but it's a longer process. The registration period in Connecticut is two years, so if you've just registered your car you're in the clear for two years, but we're going to get you eventually."

HEADLINE: A Daunting Challenge for Graduates

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
STARTING out or starting over -- either way, finding a job these days can be difficult. For many recent college graduates and for experienced workers, obtaining employment in a changing marketplace is becoming daunting.
Although most job seekers do not need an expert to confirm what they already know from personal experience, economists and labor-market analysts -- while not describing a hopeless situation -- report that not only are the jobs few and the competition keen but also that this situation is not likely to change dramatically in the near future. 
 What recent graduates are discovering as they look for jobs is that their stiffest competition is coming not from their peers but from the ranks of displaced older professionals, many of whom have a proven track record to offer a new employer.
"College grads today are interviewing against some very experienced and highly skilled workers," said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor. "For new graduates, with diplomas in hand, not even that piece of paper automatically opens doors anymore."
Although there are fewer graduates entering the job market, primarily because of the baby bust of the 1960's and 1970's, they are looking for work at a time when unemployment in the county has hit historically high levels. Westchester's jobless rate in March was 6.2 percent, the highest figure for that month since 1977.
And although census figures show that in 1990 there were only 11,940 21-year-olds in the county -- 10 percent fewer than in 1980 -- young adults are trying to enter the work force at a time when, in addition to high unemployment, the number of jobs has declined. Westchester lost 10,800 jobs between March 1991 and last March; at last count, there were only 372,600 jobs, the county's lowest March job count since 1984.
All that adds up to the fact that it has become a buyer's market for recession-weary employers, who can demand highly developed job skills, sometimes in exchange for only a part-time position that offers few or no benefits and no long-term commitment.
"It's an extremely difficult time," reported Noreen L. Preston, an economist with the County Office of Commerce and Economic Development. "The competition keeps jobs at a premium and holds wages down."
 
Some Industries Still Flourish
 Nevertheless, even at a time when many corporations are cutting back their operations and there is only a glimmer of hope that a recovery is in sight, there are pockets of jobs and some industries are forging ahead, the State Labor Department reports.
"Without a doubt, it is a difficult job market," Mr. Surdey said. "But it's not an impossible one."
Topping the list of growth industries is the health-services field, which includes nursing, respiratory therapy, radiological technology and home health care. The aging of the population -- with about one-third, the Baby Boomers, now in middle age -- is resulting in a greater demand for health professionals.
"And prior to the Great Depression, there was another baby boom," Mr. Surdey said. "That group is in their 60's and 70's now and demanding even more health services."
The jobs for health-care professionals can be found in nursing homes, hospitals and doctors' groups, some of which are self-contained medical centers that often have on-site pharmacies and testing laboratories.
 
500 Students on a Waiting List
 "If we look into the future," Mr. Surdey said, "one out of every six jobs generated will be in the allied health fields."
At the Job and Career Center of Westchester Community College in Valhalla, Richard Putnam, the center's director, reported that student requests for courses in health fields were soaring, with 500 students on a waiting list to enter programs related to the field.
In 1989, the last year for which the college had data, respiratory therapists earned an average starting salary of $32,000, radiological technologists started at about $38,182 and registered nurses at $32,662, Mr. Putnam said.
"Relative to other fields of employment, health care is faring better," the director said. "But that's only relatively speaking. Because health-care workers are holding on to their jobs, new hiring has slowed down and "employment isn't what is was a year or two ago," Mr. Putnam said.
In addition to the health services, the job outlook is somewhat better than average for social-services providers, insurance carriers and business services.
Specifically, as many firms reduce their size and contract for services that were previously provided in-house, Mr. Surdey said that companies performing those functions could benefit.
"Most of the job growth will be in small and medium companies because of all the restructuring," Mr. Surdey said.
Some of the services now in demand are advertising and marketing, personnel and human resources, computer and data, legal and paralegal, auditing and accounting, management and public relations, engineering and architecture, research and testing for the environment and products, decorating and maintenance of building interiors and security.
 
Computer Skills in Demand
 Also, professionals with advanced computer skills are in demand. At the Westchester Private Industry Council, the director, Renee Guy, reported that the county-administered organization has set up a retraining program with Mercy College for displaced Nynex workers who can learn such computer programming languages as Pascal and Unix and re-enter the job market at salaries that often start around $60,000.
"The whole world of the dislocated worker is new," Ms. Guy said. "And colleges are recognizing that as the traditional student population dwindles, schools need to go after a new adult market. The time is right for adult education and retraining."
Retraining is also often the main factor for blue-collar workers facing unemployment. "There is no market any more for assembly-line workers," Ms. Guy said. "We are losing all our factory jobs in Westchester."
At the Board of Cooperative Educational Services for Southern Westchester, the director of the occupational education division, Joseph Schwartzberg, called the proposed closing of the General Motors assembly plant in North Tarrytown "the classic example" of the changing marketplace for factory workers.
 
Enrollment Up at Center in Valhalla
 "A narrow focus for an employee is all well and good if business conditions stay the same," Dr. Schwartzberg said. "But as companies change and work gets exported to other parts of the world, workers here have to have broader-based skills to survive."
Adult enrollment this year at the Southern Westchester Center for Technical and Occupational Education, run by Boces in Valhalla, was 300, compared with 60 adult students six years ago, said Dr. Schwartzberg, the director of the center. He called the increase "clearly a function of economics and the changing workplace."
There is a demand for blue-collar workers in such fields as computer repair, building maintenance, office machine repair, trucking and the hotel and hospitality industry.
Many of those jobs, however, pay less than assembly-line workers are used to earning. "The difficulty G.M. workers will have is that they are not going to make the same kind of money," Ms. Guy said.
"But that problem," she said, "is rampant among all dislocated workers. It is something most white-collar workers as well are going to encounter."
 
Starting One's Own Business
 As all segments of the working population face layoffs and a shrinking job market, many blue-collar and white-collar workers are considering entrepreneurship. Robert Bierman, supervising coordinator for the Hudson Valley Region of the State Labor Department, called it "a growing trend of 'I've always wanted to start my own business.' "
At Mercy College, the president, Dr. Jay Sexter, said the school was seeking grants to set up a program to help people start new businesses and obtain bank loans in a tight economy.
Mr. Surdey said, "If you can get the capital, it is definitely a good time for this. And with modems and databases, more businesses can be operated from a home office."
About 9 percent of the county's work force is self-employed, he said.
For those preferring to work for others, Mr. Surdey recommended applying at small and medium-size companies rather than at larger businesses that may still be cutting back.
"Keep your goals high," he said. "Keep your eyes on the Fortune 500 companies. But, if you want a job, you many have to be willing to start lower than you had wanted to."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
A Human Whirlwind In South-Central L.A.

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Marva Smith Battle-Bey delayed her long-planned trip to Chicago and Detroit by two days in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, but when she returned last Tuesday she hit the ground running. Phone calls have been flooding the 13-year-old private nonprofit Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corporation, deep in the heart of riot-ravaged South-Central Los Angeles, which Mrs. Battle-Bey, the president, has run since 1981.
She and her staff are on the front lines of the "Rebuild L.A." movement because they already know how to do it. With money scraped together from the City of Los Angeles, foundations and banks, they have built a neighborhood shopping center, an affordable apartment building and a low-rent "incubator" to house five fledgling businesses; they rehabilitate 75 to 100 housing units a year. The black-owned McDonald's at their Vermont Slauson shopping center has so little competition right now that on Monday it ran out of french fries. 
 Today, Vermont Slauson is struggling to keep up with the sudden onslaught of meetings and requests. "I'm trying to catch up," Mrs. Battle-Bey tells her husband on the phone. "I can't; it's a whirlwind." At her narrow storefront at Vermont and Slauson, which was miraculously spared in twin conflagrations that engulfed the stores on either side, Mrs. Battle-Bey, an imposing woman in her late 30's, wearing a flowing lavender pantsuit, starts her 8:30 A.M. staff meeting. As she sorts through mail, her staff fills her in on various meetings she couldn't attend.
Opportunities await. Mrs. Battle-Bey is already dusting off old projects because they now have a better chance of getting funding. There's now plenty of real estate to be developed, she reminds grimly: at the intersection of Vernon and Central, four corners of prime space, leveled in the riot, are available.
And there's more money chasing these projects. "It takes a crisis and newsworthy attention," Mrs. Battle-Bey said. "Now, we can put all the things together that we couldn't get done in the last 10 years, when there was no money. Everybody wants to be involved in this crisis intervention and resolution. We'll try to be as selective as possible, do our own stuff, let the dust settle."
Like many nonprofit workers, Mrs. Battle-Bey and her staff are accustomed to throwing around acronyms and abbreviations: today's agenda includes mentions of S.B.A. (Small Business Administration), FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and C.C.E.D.A. (California Community Economic Development Association). So far, they aren't encouraged by the data on loans and disaster assistance. "Sounds like folks have a couple of things to jump through to get money," Mrs. Battle-Bey said. "We'll get more information tomorrow at the Mayor's Office, and I'll report back on what's happening at Rebuild L.A.," a project headed by Peter Ueberroth that will parcel out private contributions, mainly from corporations.
Richard McNish of the Community Redevelopment Agency drops in unannounced, eager to report that Vermont Slauson is apparently on a list of five agencies that Washington will endow with a portion of some $12 million in direct equity financing. "This is the best money in the United States," he says. "It's liquid money in the bank. It doesn't go through the city."
After Mr. McNish leaves, the group discusses setting up open-air farmers' markets for street vendors and conducting small focus groups. But Mrs. Battle-Bey exhorts her employees: "I don't want you to think about what our response should be. I want you to think about what the need is and how we can address that need. We can fund much of this ourselves. We're not going to sit around and wait for little pots of money. If they come, great. We'll do our programs regardless. We still have proposals on the table for funding -- like our $2.5 million entrepreneurial plastics manufacturing company that actually produces products and provides long-term jobs."
Mrs. Battle-Bey still has to conduct continuing business, including her weekly confab at the construction site at Central Avenue and 40th Place, 20 almost-finished units of affordable housing. En route, Mrs. Battle-Bey surveys the scarred landscape and complains, "I can't find doughnuts anywhere."
Vermont Slauson owns this building, so she's responsible for riding herd on construction quality and costs. In a trailer cramped with five construction supervisors and an architect, she selects the colors for the oak doors, the table in the laundry room and the child-safe height of the roof railing. One supervisor reports that as soon as they finished painting the outside walls, graffiti vandals sprayed them right through the fence. Mrs. Battle-Bey instructs him to clean it up right away or more will follow and happily pockets two sugary crullers as she leaves.
After picking up a bean-cheese-avocado burrito and a large lemonade at a Mexican food stand across the street, Mrs. Battle-Bey takes a damage tour along Vernon and Broadway. Flea markets, or "swap meets," were targeted not only because looters wanted goods, especially clothing. They might also have been targeted, she says, because of anger at Koreans who ran the markets but would not let other vendors participate. Many gas-station markets were hit. And one burned-out bank was community owned.
The problems in Los Angeles "have been building for the last 10, 15 years," she says. "It's a whole different kind of inner city than it was after the Watts riots, with more ethnic diversity, and some communities in transition. The trouble isn't over yet."

HEADLINE: History Has Questions for Gorbachev;
What Does He Know and When Will We Know It?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN SESTANOVICH; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Russian and Eurasian studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV, it used to be said, plays a weak hand brilliantly, and this talent was never more in evidence than during his just concluded two-week tour of the United States. Mr. Gorbachev is out of office, on a meager pension, and is hounded back home by charges about his role in this or that abuse of power. Yet he got Americans to treat him like a head of state, promise him millions, and confine the conversation to such tame questions as who started the cold war (no one was going to blame him, after all), how to reorganize the United Nations, and how to deal with global environmental pollution. The man at the center of the most important political revolution of our time came and went without providing a single new revelation, not one sharp insight or telling detail, about what happened.
For Russians, this result will come as no surprise. Radio Moscow recently expressed doubt that Mr. Gorbachev had anything "new, practical, interesting or unexpected" to say to foreign listeners. His ability to grow rich while saying nothing will be especially galling to those former Soviet officials, high and low, who -- whether as consultants to Western corporations or as participants in oral history projects -- are trying to sell what little they know about the system for a few measly dollars. Even Pravda, now the voice of reaction, grumbled that when he gets home Mr. Gorbachev ought to tell his own people the truth about such episodes as the crackdown in the Baltic states in January 1991.
 
A Thin Account
 Mr. Gorbachev sometimes avoids pointed questions by saying that he has to save his best material for his memoirs, now nearly finished. He said the same thing last fall while preparing his book, "The August Coup," and it is worth remembering how thin and insubstantial a recounting that turned out to be. American publishers seem to remember; they have reportedly balked at the sums Mr. Gorbachev is asking, realizing that for all that he has said and written in the past ("master of the 40-minute sound bite," someone once said), he has left us with a long list of questions about perestroika and only the most fragmentary answers. 
 A publisher who wants the real story of how reform became a revolution probably needs to begin with just such a list of questions, pressing the last leader of Soviet Communism to do what he has never done: detail his relationship with party conservatives, how he maneuvered around them when he could, mollified them when he had to and joined them when it served his interest.
The question that led Pravda's list would be as good a place as any to start. How did last year's crackdown in the Baltic states come about? It is possible that Mr. Gorbachev simply wanted to restrain the Lithuanian and Latvian separatist movements a little, had no idea that local commanders would conduct the operation in such a brutal manner and pulled back when he saw bloodshed. Possible. Yet some hard-line supporters of the crackdown subsequently asserted that Mr. Gorbachev had actually promised them he would suspend the Baltic parliaments and impose "presidential rule."
What did he tell them -- and what did he plan to do next? Russian democrats insist that the crackdown was meant to be the first step toward closing down their own newly elected government as well. This is hardly wild speculation; once the Baltic offensive failed, Mr. Gorbachev started up a campaign to impeach Boris N. Yeltsin as chairman of the Russian parliament.
Here again, it is conceivable that the drive against Mr. Yeltsin was authored by hard-liners in the Russian Communist Party. Yet one former member of the party's Politburo recently denied this, saying Mr. Gorbachev himself kept badgering them to seek Mr. Yeltsin's impeachment. Had this effort succeeded, the effect on future events would have been incalculable. The conservative old guard might not have had to launch a coup against Mr. Gorbachev in August. He would already have become their prisoner.
To push Mr. Gorbachev to be candid is not, of course, to focus exclusively on the shameful episodes of perestroika. We also know too little about his finer moments, like the East European revolutions of late 1989, which earlier Soviet leaders would obviously have tried to crush. Was there a debate within the leadership about how to deal with the sudden collapse of their "fraternal" allies, or not? The usual Kremlinological tea-leaf reading suggests that there wasn't, and Yegor K. Ligachev, at the time the leading conservative critic of perestroika, has said there was no interventionist faction pushing Mr. Gorbachev to do the wrong thing.
Is Mr. Ligachev telling the truth? And, if he is, what explains the hard-liners' moderation? Were they restrained because they could not stomach a blood bath, or because Mr. Gorbachev, who had by 1989 abolished regular Politburo meetings, managed to keep the issue from being discussed? Or was it that he managed to reassure those who were unhappy with where things were heading -- perhaps promising the military that he would never pull Soviet forces out of Germany? Answers to these questions can help us understand what we now only guess at: the finality with which the Soviet establishment accepted the loss of empire.
The collapse of Soviet control in Eastern Europe was followed almost immediately by a collapse on the home front. In February 1990 the leadership of the Communist Party agreed, at Mr. Gorbachev's suggestion, to surrender its constitutional guarantee of a monopoly on political power. Conservatives first made a furious show of opposing this idea at a special Central Committee meeting. Then, with only a handful of "no's" and abstentions, they meekly voted to accept a multi-party system.
How did Mr. Gorbachev pull this off? Can such an astounding result really be explained by the party tradition of deferring to the leader -- that is, by Stalinist means in the service of anti-Stalinist ends? Or did Mr. Gorbachev persuade conservatives to go along with his plan by promising them that he would not implement the new law? (And in fact, he did not.)
Neutralizing potential opposition from the military was as important as any other part of Mr. Gorbachev's effort to move conservatives to accept reform. His "new thinking" was an attempt to demilitarize Soviet foreign policy, and both the political and economic reforms he embraced were clearly intended to undermine the power of the entire military-industrial complex. But results were another matter. In the late summer of 1990, when he seemed on the verge of accepting the controversial "500 days" economic reform plan, the loudest objections were from the defense industry. When he left office at the end of 1991 the debilitating drain of resources into military spending had barely been slowed.
The failure to make a sustained and effective attack on military spending is especially puzzling, because few things that Mr. Gorbachev could have done would have so greatly improved his chances of success. What happened? Did he fail to understand how important the problem was, understand but not know what to do, fight but fail to get his way, or choose not to fight at all, because the generals -- and the "generals" of industry -- were just too powerful to take on? An honest account of this matter would not only explain the balance of political power in the system over which Mr. Gorbachev presided. It would tell us much about institutions that are still part of the system over which Mr. Yeltsin presides.
What would move Mr. Gorbachev to tell the story of perestroika as only he knows it? For the kind of book described here, publishers would surely be willing to pay far more than they would for bombast and evasions, which they may expect of him. Yet in the end, money may not be enough of a lever. (His recent fund-raising success has seen to that.) Before he writes memoirs worthy of his amazing career, Mr. Gorbachev will have to make a larger choice: He has to abandon hope of a political comeback and rest his claim to greatness on what he has already accomplished. The final chapter of the book he is writing suggests that he has chosen differently. Its title (which he divulges with a grin): "Everything Is Still Ahead."

HEADLINE: Cuban Journal: Havana and Beyond

BYLINE: By MARY MORRIS; Mary Morris is the author of "Wall to Wall: From Beijing to Berlin by Rail," forthcoming in paperback from Penquin.

 BODY:
As the taxi speeds, we pass the crumbling arches of the colonial houses that line the Malecon. Rubble lies in front of some. Others with no roofs or upper floors are held up by makeshift scaffolding. The frames of windows stand empty, open to the sky. On the lower floors, beneath the collapsed roofs, laundry hangs drying. A rooster struts on a Baroque balcony. Designed in 1857 by the Cuban engineer Gen. Franciso de Albear, the Malecon was at one time prime real estate - the seafront drive of Havanna. These formerly glorious houses were the dwellings of the privileged. Now as many as 10 families live in a single building among the ruins.
 The fading crimson, sun-drenched yellow and cobalt blue facades provide the hint of a playful past, but now they look as if they haven't been painted since the dictator Fulgencio Batista fled in 1959. Later we learn that they are painted, but Cuba can't get seaworthy paint to protect the Malecon from ocean sprays. This doesn't explain the rubble, the ancient scaffolding. It's not clear whether things are being restored or just propped up.
 Our car stops for a light (all the cars that don't carry tourists go through the light), and I gasp as a boy dives off the sea wall for his afternoon swim. Young men stroll, clasping the hands of their girlfriends who walk above them, along the sea wall, in what seems to be a courtship ritual, Havanna-style. Other people - almost exclusively young men - sit alone, facing the sea, looking north toward Florida. They appear as if they have nothing to do.
 As we begin to drive again, the last light of day catches the Malecon. For an instant the facades become a burst of color and you can see a splendor that was.
 IN 1962, I CLUTCHED A FRIEND'S HAND AS WE listened to John F. Kennedy call Castro's "bluff". Uncomprehending, we stared at my father who sat shaking his head. "What is it?" we asked. "Are we going to war?" "I'm not sure," he muttered. "I just don't know." Thus a curtain fell on an island to which one's parents sneaked away for a long weekend of gambling and frolic. America's playground, Cuba was called, a mere 90 miles from Key West, Fla. Now, flying down from Canada for a week's visit, it was to me a land cloaked in mystery, tinged with romance and rage.
At the bar of Havana's Hotel Inglaterra, where we are staying, black men in white linen suits with red ties, probably Jamaicans, are hunched over, doing business. My journalist husband and I have left our somewhat Spartan room, with its small balcony overlooking the Parque Central, to sip our first smooth rum drinks. A lone singer plays the maracas. Two little girls in yellow crinoline, hair braided, race to the adjoining dining room, recently refurbished to its former elegance of wrought iron and tile. Silverware clinks as waiters, who all seem to be named Ernesto or Fidel, serve grilled shrimp and sliced mangoes to German, French and Hispanic tourists, the majority of whom have that listless look that comes with the packaged tour. Cubans themselves almost never eat shellfish or swordfish, though their seas are rich in them. Highly valuable seafood is exported and the money goes to buy baby formula, among other things.
We pay for our drinks in dollars, just as we paid for our taxi ride. One can actually travel throughout Cuba and never need to change money, except perhaps to buy a newspaper or ride a bus. Faced with the loss of Soviet aid and the dire need for hard currency, Cuba has turned to tourism. And everything in the tourist economy is done in hard currency. Meanwhile, we are told over and over again, it is forbidden for Cubans to own dollars or even to enter the stores that carry the items that dollars will buy.

AS WE VENTURE OUT, IT IS dark and a different reality greets us. Boys beg for Chiclets and pens, "Please for school; we have nothing to write with." When I part with my lone Bic, the boy races off without a word. At a counter to the left of the hotel where tourists dine, a long line forms. People lean against a wall, arms folded, resignation in their eyes. They are waiting for "pizza," thick dough with a glop of cheese and some sauce on it, which is what their pesos will buy. Grease oozes through the paper wrappers; no one seems eager to eat.
Crossing the Prado, we head through the Parque Central and up Empedrado Street. A stray dog wanders into the road, without peril. Even on this main drag there are virtually no cars because gasoline is very scarce.
We enter the maze of streets of Old Havana, lighted by occasional street lights, but guards -- either regular police or the local Committee of the Defense of the Revolution -- are everywhere. We feel safe, but also ill at ease. We gaze into rooms where men stare at bargain-basement television sets that offer generic soap operas or predigested news.
The streets themselves are oddly devoid of life. There are no shops, no grocery stores. No restaurants or places to eat. Nowhere to go except where we are going, the Bodeguita del Medio (literally little grocery store in the middle). Hemingway had a phrase about this restaurant that has been immortalized on a plaque in the bar, "My daiquiri in the Floridita, my mojito in the Bodeguita." Here we dine on rice and beans (the best I've ever had), excellent roast chicken, fried plantains and, of course, those rum mint juleps known as mojitos. We are serenaded by state-paid troubadours who sing Latin love songs. During our trip all we will hear are love songs.

CALLE OBISPO RUNS from the Plaza de Armas to the Floridita bar. In the morning, the darkness and mystery of Old Havana lift, and the ubiquitous lines form. Cubans, ration books in hand, stand in line for about 5 eggs a week, a chicken every 10 days, a liter of milk a day if they have small children. The lines seem to move faster than they do in Russia, and the Cubans are jovial. They talk as they wait, often of the shortages. One toothless old woman walks away, shaking her head. No potatoes that day, but her shopping bag is full of oranges and bananas.
We stop at a cigar factory to buy some cigars, and learn that we can take a tour of the state-of-the-art facility. The workers, we are told, work eight hours a day, get six months paid maternity leave, lifetime guaranteed employment and a full pension after the age of 55, if they so choose. I ask a woman who must be close to 60 how long she has worked (23 years in the factory) and how long she plans to continue. She dances a rumba for me in her seat, "As long as I'm moving," she says. Her job is to put the little bands around the cigars.
After a visit to the Museum of the Revolution, which occupies the former Presidential Palace -- the exhibition begins, without irony, with Columbus -- we head to the coffee shop of the Riviera Hotel.
If I were to make a movie about Las Vegas in the 1950's, I'd film it in Havana -- at the Floridita or at the Riviera, Meyer Lansky's old casino. Havana itself is a kind of period piece, a kind of living museum. What few individually owned cars are on the streets are all preblockade -- De Sotos, Hudsons, Edsels, Chevrolets, painted iridescent gold and black or red and white, puttering along on what should be their last legs. The Riviera, too, is vintage 50's, the real thing. Now a hotel, its casinos have been turned into cabarets and a spacious lobby with starry light fixtures and a silver bank of elevators.
We order sandwiches and malteds, which are thick and smooth. Our waiter, who sees me scribbling, asks what I am doing. I tell him, which I do not tell everyone, that I am an American journalist. He then launches into a brief history of Cuban socialism and his theory of the current economic crisis. He explains that the Cubans have food, but it is bad food. Fastidious people that they are, they have no soap.
He leans over my arm. "You want to write something about Cuba, just go into a hospital," he says, "See what kind of care we really get. I don't mean the tourists who come for marrow transplants or heart surgery, but the Cubans. But don't tell anyone I told you. They'll put me in jail." We give him four bars of the Ivory soap that we were told to carry with us and he thanks us profusely.

HAT EVENING "SUENO Tropical" ("Tropical Dream") is playing near our hotel and we decide to go see it. But just as we are about to change money (the only time we try to do so), a tour arrives and we cannot get near the Inglaterra's front desk. We ask the bartender if she will give us some change in pesos, because we want to go to the movie. She has seen it, and says it is very funny, but she cannot give us change in pesos. Instead, she hands us a napkin enclosing a three-peso note (worth about $3.75). "I am not changing the money," she tells us emphatically. "This is a gift from me." We leave her a $5 tip.
The movie, made in Cuba, is, to our surprise, a spoof on gender relations -- an abusive husband dreams his wife goes off to work every day while he stays home with the baby. The film opens with a pregnant woman giving a man her seat on a bus. The theater is packed, and the Cubans never stop laughing.
After much difficulty and expense (Cuba does not provide incentives for the individual tourist), we rent a car and head east toward Trinidad, the old colonial city of smugglers and pirates. Along the way we pause for a visit to the Hemingway House in San Francisco de Paula. Hemingway bequeathed this house to Cuba, and it is much as he left it. Set in a grove of bamboo and palm trees, draped in bougainvillea, it feels as if Hemingway has just gone out fishing and will be back in time for his mojitos.
One of the woman guards and I strike up a conversation. She was a young girl and a neighbor when Hemingway lived there. "The last time I saw him was in the summer of 1960. He was walking through town and he was quite mad." She pauses, blushing slightly, "But he was a man, let me tell you that. He was really a man."
We head south. Bougainvillea lines the median strip. Sweet-smelling fields thick with sugar cane and plantains extend on either side. Oxen plow the fields, though this is to save gasoline. Indeed, we have the highway almost to ourselves. A few guaguas (public buses) pass. One is broken down by the side of the road. The right lane of traffic on the main freeway out of Havana is being used by bicycles (Cuba recently imported 500,000 of them from China) and hitchhikers. Pickup trucks carry workers from place to place and whenever one pulls up dozens pile on.
In the distance the cane fields are being burned. Dark smoke fills the sky. More smoke comes from the cane factories. We leave the main road and journey into the countryside, but the map grows vague. Roads are paved, but have no names. They are dotted with piglets and schoolchildren in their red-and-white uniforms (literacy of those under 30 is said to be almost 100 percent). We are lost, so we pick up our first hitchhikers -- a young couple with a baby, heading in the direction of Cruces. He speaks a Spanish I can barely comprehend, but I learn that he works in the cane factories and owns his own house. We leave them at Cruces and make our way to Cumanayagua, where the road divides. We've been driving for almost six hours when I stop an old woman for directions. She speaks for a long time, and I nod, but then I sink into the car. My husband says, "Well, which way?"
"I didn't understand a word she said." It is the low moment of the trip.
"Try again," he says.
I get out and several men come up. They gesticulate wildly, measuring turns, dips in the road. I follow their hands along imaginary roads. We drive on by the seat of our pants, past an alpine lake in a valley among mountains. There are no road signs and a mountain range is ahead of us. We are low on gas. Buzzards eating road kills take flight as we drive past. Boys gallop by on horseback, ignoring a cow that stands in the middle of the road. We pick up an old man who is going to Trinidad. He has spent the day cleaning fish, and the stench is nearly unbearable.
We deposit him in downtown Trinidad where we're told there is a hotel, but we find nothing. We head for the Ancon, the large tourist hotel on the beach, where the food is self-service and the furniture glorified Best Western. It is packed with English-speaking tourists from Montreal. The sand seems to be imported from elsewhere. We are there 10 minutes when the lights go out for the evening.
In the morning we visit old Trinidad and its magnificently refurbished Spanish colonial houses, complete with 19th-century plumbing. Then we head back across the country, toward Cuba's northern beaches. We are not far out of Trinidad when we pick up a grandmother carrying milk from her cow to her new grandson in Cienfuegos. At the crossroads to Cienfuegos she gets out. "Can somebody help these people get to Abreus?" she shouts. Three people who don't know one another, two men and a woman, all jump in. Only the woman, a nurse, is going as far as Abreus, where she tells us there is a fiesta going on.
At Abreus, we park near the main plaza, which is decorated with palm fronds; the usual music blares. Cubans slurp ice slush and sway to the music, a kind of salsa rap. In an alleyway is a broken-down carousel, its wooden horses like a child's drawing, hand-carved. We stroll down a dirt road where the houses are all primitive, in some cases with thatched roofs, but very clean and well kept. A sign in front of one reads, "Don't tie your horses here." In each home, as a kind of centerpiece, a television set, compliments of the revolution, stands.

IN THE MIDST OF MILES and miles of orange groves on the road north, we pick up a young woman with pink shoes, giant earrings and blonde hair with dark roots. She is going to Cardenas and will send us on to Varadero.
Our rider is chatty and good spirited and we begin to talk. I ask her where she lives and where she works. "I live in Cardenas, but I work where you picked me up."
"It's a long commute," I say.
"Yes, it takes two hours, each way, but there is no work in Cardenas."
"What do you do?"
"I'm a dentist. Actually I'm a cranial surgeon, but I do dentistry."
I look at this young woman in pink shoes. "You're a surgeon?" She nods. "Isn't there some easier way for you to get to work?"
She shrugs. "Oh, people know me, they pick me up. It's not so bad."
"You don't feel . . . inconvenienced?" I ask hesitantly.
"Oh, it is temporary," she says. "We have to work hard to overcome this period in our history."
"Well what do you think is going to happen here -- with Fidel."
"Oh, I hope nothing. I love Fidel," she says as if she is referring to her boyfriend. (We know, however, that one can go to jail for a long time for "insulting" Fidel and the jails, we have heard, are full.) "My country has given me my education, my work, my house. All the patients I treat are treated for free. I hope he lives 20 more years."

VARADERO IS ON A LONG narrow peninsula on Cuba's northern coast, with the sea on one side and a bay on the other, somewhat like Palm Beach, Fla., geographically speaking. But the comparison stops there. While it is a strip of fairly fancy hotels with elaborate facilities -- hotels that serve the Canadian and European tourists who come for their winter holidays, most of whom fly into Varadero and stay put -- it is peculiarly devoid of commercialism. There are the generic Intur tiendas, which sell the same rum and cigars and chocolates and shoes throughout Cuba. There are a few beach barbecues, but basically what you have in Varadero, besides a kind of funky Cuban version of Club Med, is a pristine turquoise sea and a white beach, the real thing.
I ask for a room with a view of the sea at the Punta Blanca, an older hotel, and we are given a stuffy room with no balcony, over a noisy discotheque. Knowing the language is helpful here. I return to the desk clerk, an unenthusiastic worker, and say, "We have come a long way and we are very tired, and we'd like something a little more comfortable."
So she hands me a key that opens a small house with a wraparound porch that sits at the edge of the sea. Next door is Al Capone's old guesthouse, a magnificent stone structure with French windows and wide stone arches that face the sea. It has been turned into an around-the-clock bar, and we beat a path between our house and Al Capone's.
We dine at a Creole restaurant where we see the one phrase of public social protest we will see on our entire trip. Graffitied across a poster is Fidel's revolutionary motto, "Socialismo o Muerte," revised to read "Fettucini o Muerte." We eat swordfish while the pre-paid musicians play love songs. A handsome young Cuban joins in with bongos and his lover, a European tourist with a cowbell, tries to keep up her end of the percussion. But then a drunk old man with a Hatuey beer in each fist sings some prerevolutionary decadent lyrics and the restaurant claps along.

HAT NIGHT EL NORTE blows in; the seas rise. In the morning it is cold and jellyfish line the beach. We walk, bundled up, while undaunted French tourists, bodies greased, sunbathe bare-breasted along the shore. When we return to our room, the maid has folded our towels into swans and my husband refuses to disturb them.
The next afternoon, a man who works at the hotel approaches us. "Please, I want to ask you a favor," he says. "Could you go into the tienda for me; I want to buy a pair of red shoes for my little girl." He displays dollars in his hands. Then he shows us a slip of paper, about four inches long. "That is the size of her foot," he says. "And I have another little girl." He adds two fingers to the piece of paper. "This size."
"You can't go buy them yourself? With dollars?"
He puts his fingers to his lips. "I can't even have dollars, but we all keep some of our tips, everyone does it. Can you do this? As a favor?"
It is this slip of paper cut to the size of his child's foot that wins me over. The woman who works in the tienda knows just what shoes, what size. She gives us a knowing nod as we leave.

UR LAST NIGHT IN Havana we join a group of German tourists, who keep tapping their watches, unaccustomed to Latin time, as we await the bus to take us to a cabaret. At last it pulls up. The automatic doors fling open and there, sprawled across the paunch of our aging driver are a pair of long black legs, a white skirt hiked up high to the thighs. The woman pulls down her skirt and rises with stunning indifference. "Tropicana," she says, shuffling into her tour director's seat.
The Tropicana has been in continuous operation since 1939. Neither war nor revolution has changed it or stopped it. Arriving, we file past a fountain with statues of nude nymphets dangling bunches of grapes. Mirrors are everywhere. For several hours the rum flows at $5 a shot and the girls, dressed in G-strings and spangles, kick and writhe and gyrate. The audience of former Eastern bloc and future European community members offers perfunctory applause and after the 25-minute finale files out despondently.
We return to the bus where our tour director in her white skirt sits smoking a cigarette. The driver drives so slowly that the Afro-Cuban dolls on his dash barely budge.
We cruise the Malecon at a snail's pace. The sea calm, the moon full, it is cast in blue like an opera set. Inside the dark stairwells of what appear to be abandoned buildings lights flicker. Two people embrace. I peer up toward the collapsed roofs and missing top floors and there, through the empty window frames, I see the stars.
 
SOME WORDS OF CAUTION

The Cuban tourist industry is designed to keep you on the tourist trail. If you follow it, Cuba will appear more or less like any other place. But if you deviate or scratch the surface, you may see that all is not as it might appear.
One morning before breakfast I placed two phone calls -- one to our daughter in Florida, the other to a former close associate of Fidel Castro's, in Havana, whose number had been given to me. The calls were put through without any difficulty, though the operator made an audible gulp when I said "Florida." Afterward, my husband and I went for a morning stroll along the Prado, stopping for a cup of coffee. Then we returned to our room to leave our sweaters.
We came upon the maid in the vestibule in front of our room. She stared at us, wide-eyed. The door was open, and another maid stood in the doorway. "Good morning," we said. They didn't say anything, which is unusual in Cuba. We walked in to find a man with a razor blade in one hand and a pencil in the other. With the pencil, he was literally tapping the phone.
"Is something the matter?" I asked.
The man looked up, startled but smiling. "Inventory," he said. He had a computer printout with him, and some small silver tags.
"Oh," I smiled. My husband stared at me, lips pursed. The man and the two maids quickly left the room.
Later, over lunch, when we mentioned to the former Castro associate that we suspected that our phone might be tapped, she just nodded. "Probably," she said. Never discuss money on the phone, she told us. Or anything of substance. Certainly not politics or whom we might be seeing.
On another occasion we met an Ethiopian man with a Canadian passport who was traveling with two white Canadian friends. He told us, "Everywhere I go I am stopped; they pull me over and say, 'What are you doing with tourists?' I tell them that I am a tourist. When they see my passport, they let me go." MARY MORRIS
 
RULES AND REGULATIONS

Although Cuba is constructing new hotels, often as joint ventures with European hotel companies, few Americans are signing the guest registers. Under sanctions imposed by the United States Government, American citizens, while technically free to travel to Cuba, are prohibited from spending any money there unless they are journalists, scholars or Cuban-Americans visiting family members who live on the island. These regulations are backed up by penalties of up to 12 years in prison and $250,000 in fines, although to date no individual traveler has been penalized.
Some back doors are open, however. SUN HOLIDAY TOURS, Post Office Box 531, Montego Bay, St. James, Jamaica (telephone: 809-952-5629), offers day trips from Montego Bay for $177 a person. The excursions depart every Wednesday, and the price includes round-trip air fare, in-flight snacks, an airport reception and transportation to, and a city tour of, Santiago de Cuba. And, for those who wish to bend the rules, package trips to Cuba can be booked through Canadian travel agencies. Some typical prices for seven-night packages offered by AIR CANADA VACATIONS, the major purveyor of such trips, range from about $350 a person, including air fare between Montreal and Varadero Beach and accommodations in a standard beachfront hotel, such as the Punta Blanca, to about $590 a person for air fare and a suite in the new Melia Varadero Hotel. Meal packages (breakfast and dinner daily) are an additional $119 a person, and service charges add another $109 each. Day trips to Havana can be arranged.
A recorded advisory concerning travel to Cuba (and many other countries) is available from the State Department: 202-647-5225.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Toward an Even Playing Field for All

BYLINE: By FAY VINCENT; Fay Vincent is the commissioner of Major League Baseball.

 BODY:
On Saturday, May 2, at Comiskey Park in Chicago, the White Sox honored some 25 former Negro League baseball players who, because of the accident of birth, were never able to play in the major leagues. The irony, of course, is that while these aged but quietly dignified men were standing on the field to receive long overdue recognition, the rest of the country was wondering whether the rioting in Los Angeles would spread to other cities. The tribute in Chicago had been planned months in advance, and therefore there was a poignancy, in some sense awful, to what was taking place at the ball park. 
 Before the ball game, the old-time ballplayers came out on the field and mingled with the rest of us around the batting cage as the White Sox players and the Texas Rangers went through the customary pregame drills. I sat in a golf cart, and soon Jimmy Crutchfield came over and sat with me. Crutchfield, 82 years old, is widely considered to have been one of the finest outfielders ever to play in the Negro Leagues. One of the reporters asked him what this day meant to him, and the old gentleman was so moved by the effort to express his feelings that tears came to his eyes and he was briefly speechless.
 
The Proudest Achievement
 We chatted about his career and some of his great moments in baseball. At one point he reached for his wallet and took out a faded clipping. The article from a 1930 Chicago newspaper described the East-West All-Star Game. Proudly he pointed me to a paragraph that described a catch he had made as "one of the greatest catches in baseball history." And then came a moment I will never forget.
"Jimmy," I asked, "what are you proudest of?"
"Commissioner, the thing I'm proudest of and what I tell my wife all the time is that I never hated anyone," he said.
The statement was so simple, so stark, I had to pursue it.
"Look, Commissioner," he said, "we never talked about the system. We grew up in it. We never knew anything different. We knew we couldn't change it and we never thought it would change. In the fall we would play the white guys and they couldn't change the system either. It wasn't our fault and it wasn't their fault. The fact is we just never talked about it."
And so the ceremony went on. Crutchfield and the others took their bows and I was left to think about what Jimmy had said.
While other cities were on alert and Los Angeles was burning, Jimmy Crutchfield was proud to tell me, "I never hated anyone."
 
Contributions Overlooked
 In fact, the Negro League players I have come to know have expressed little bitterness at their treatment by Major League Baseball. Still, their contribution to baseball and to our society has been largely ignored. For decades, they kept baseball alive in the black community, and they have every reason to be thanked by all of us, and especially by current black players. Major League Baseball honored 75 alumni from the Negro Leagues at Cooperstown last summer, and I took that opportunity to apologize to those wonderful gentlemen for all the indignities to which they had been subjected. Somehow my apology seemed like pretty thin soup.
But perhaps Jimmy Crutchfield's memorable statement can be our theme as baseball tries to play a tiny role in helping our country address the consequences of decades of racism. The ghetto, the parlous level of minority unemployment and the lack of opportunity for young black Americans all bear some resemblance to the problems these Negro League players faced before 1947 when Jackie Robinson was finally able to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy Crutchfield knew then and still knows that hatred is not a solution. Instinctively he knew, as did his fellow players, that hating could produce no useful result.
Major League Baseball, of course, has a long way to go to redeem itself by affording minorities better opportunities both on and off the field. And while baseball has a full set of its own problems, Jimmy Crutchfield might have given all of us a beginning point as we try to come together to build a more decent nation. I think Jimmy can be proud of much more than he admitted.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Cold Spring Harbor

BYLINE: By BRET SENFT

 BODY:
THE first inhabitants of Cold Spring Harbor were Matinecock Indians, who discovered fresh-water springs under a salt waterharbor. They called it Wawapex, "at the good little water place."
"You can actually dip your bucket in and pull up fresh water if you know the right spot," says Rufus Langhans, the Huntington Town historian. 
 The Matinecock name still holds for this small, low-key community where wealth is enjoyed but not put on display.
Laura Gutkowski, a 10-year-resident, finds such attitudes refreshing. She declines to discuss her husband, Robert, president of Madison Square Garden, or the size of her house, saying: "No, you see, that's a very un-Cold Spring Harbor thing to do."
Such aversion to pretension may be a holdover from the hard-scrabble ways of early settlers: among them, the Titus, Sammis, Roger, Jones and Hewlett families, who established farms and water-powered grist and woolen mills around the harbor in the mid to late 1700's.
In 1836, John H. and Walter R. Jones (descendants of Maj. Thomas Jones, owner of vast property from Cold Spring Harbor to Jones Beach) founded a whaling business. Their ships traveled the world until oil was discovered in Pennsylvania in the 1860's.
"Someone made kerosene in Pittsburgh, and that did us in," said Rufus Langhans, the township historian.
St. John's Episcopal Church, founded by the Jones family in 1835, still stands southwest of the hamlet in Laurel Hollow, serving 600 families. Three of its stained-glass windows were donated at the turn of the century by Louis Comfort Tiffany, a parishioner whose Laurelton Hall was on the harbor's west shore.
Through the early years of the 20th century, locally produced lumber and bricks were shipped by coastal vessels to New York City and several resort hotels flourished from 1880 until World War I. But hilly terrain and the estates of older families prevented large-scale development, and when the local industries flagged, the population shrank. With fewer people to serve, there was no need for commercial strips.
"And that was really the salvation of Cold Spring Harbor," said Ina Katz, curator of the Whaling Museum on Main Street. "I often say that it went from the 19th to the 21st century, and missed the 20th century altogether."
Stores and malls are abundant in Huntington, less than three miles away, and there has been no lack of culture. The Whaling Museum has an original whaleboat and gear, an extensive collection of scrimshaw -- tools and artwork carved from whalebone -- and a recently installed education center. In the summer, it conducts walking tours. The Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities has rotating exhibitions in its gallery.
The renowned Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which has a hamlet mailing address but is actually just across the border in Nassau County, has 40 buildings on 95 acres on the harbor's west shore; its DNA Learning Center (on Main Street east of the village) provides a hands-on laboratory for schoolchildren, an exhibit on DNA, and genetics education programs used in the school.
ACROSS North Hempstead Turnpike from the laboratory is the Cold Spring Harbor Fish Hatchery and Aquarium, with its hatch house, trout and turtle ponds and two aquarium buildings with the state's largest collection of native freshwater fish, reptiles and amphibians. The Nature Conservancy, a conservation group, has its Long Island chapter at the 93-acre Uplands Farm Sanctuary on Lawrence Hill Road; nearby is its 14-acre St. John's Pond preserve, open to hikers and birders.
The housing stock is diverse, with smaller lots close to downtown and larger Cape Cods, colonials and ranches on two-acre lots north of Main Street.
"But you really can't define the area in one way," said Pat Fratto of Sammis Real Estate. Houses on Titus Lane to the north, she said, may include "a mint colonial on two-acres ($600,000-$700,000), next to a two-bedroom cottage on three acres ($330,000), next to a five-bedroom Victorian new construction (sold four years ago for $1.1 million)."
A four-bedroom colonial on two acres is generally $500,000 to $700,000, "but it varies with this economy," said Susan Ferris of the Daniel Gale Agency. "I'd say prices have come down 20 to 30 percent. But they're on the rise."
Of the three restaurants, Wyland's Country Kitchen and the Cold Spring Harbor Inn, both on Main Street, are open only for breakfast and lunch. The Inn on the Harbor, on Harbor Road, is open until 11:30 P.M. and serves northern Italian fare and seafood.
Richard and Sandra Brehl, 20-year residents, raised six children in a six-bedroom ranch house overlooking Main Street, whose 50 shops sell mostly gifts, crafts, artwork, quilts and bedding.
"I do miss the pharmacy, the bank, the bookstore," said Mrs. Brehl, "but we came here for the school district. All the kids got an excellent education."
The school district includes Lloyd Harbor to the north and Laurel Hollow to the west (into Nassau County) and a northern section of Huntington. There are 1,400 students in two elementary schools (in Lloyd Harbor and Laurel Hollow) and the Cold Spring Harbor High School, which is in the hamlet and houses the junior high school as well.
At the elementary level, whole learning programs emphasize language arts, writing and literature. Science classes enjoy collaborative programs with the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
The high school has advanced-placement programs, a speech/debate team, a strong foreign language and student exchange program with Russia, Spain, France and Japan, a newspaper and a publication drawn from electronic mail linked to high schools around the world.
SEVENTY percent of the students take part in the sports program, which is "always strong" in soccer and lacrosse, said District Superintendent Francis Roberts.
The district's tax rate, he noted, is the third lowest in western Suffolk and eighth lowest in Nassau. To keep it low, parents raise funds when necessary -- for a computer writing lab, a new boat for the crew team, an art gallery in the high school.
Judi Porpora, president of the Central Parent Council, her husband, Steven, and their two children live in a five-bedroom colonial on Shore Road overlooking the harbor. Mr. Porpora, a stockbroker, is president of the Eagle Dock Beach Foundation, which owns and maintains the nearby beach for resident use. Membership and mooring rights are $125 a season.
Besides 50 slips at the private Whaler's Cove Marina, there are perhaps 200 moorings in the harbor. "We don't have a lot of water here," said Aaron Westergaard of H & M Powles Marine Agency, a fishing station at the head of the harbor.
The fishing station's main building, including a clam bar, burned in 1988 and was scheduled to be demolished last Friday. Residents and town officials disagree on its future. A new structure is to go up next spring "as a concession and not as a longterm lease," said Pat Reiss, a town spokesperson. Local residents sugggest a contextural building leased to Mr. Westergard, a close relative of the late Powles brothers.
"It's common sense to stay with a known entity," said Thorndike Williams, a local architect fighting to save Powles.
Farther north on Shore Road is the Cold Spring Harbor Beach Club, founded in 1921 by old-money families, including Walter Jennings, co-founder of the company that became Mobil Oil.
"I applaud the club's efforts to keep it spartan and understated," said Mr. Porpora, himself a member with his family.

Where's the Sign?: Billy Joel did an album called "Cold Spring Harbor" but never lived in the community. Yet last July a patch of green overlooking the harbor on Main Street was dedicated and named Billy Joel Park. Within hours, its handmade sign was gone. An overzealous fan? Maybe. But naming the park fell to the town, which owns the land -- a sore point with residents who wanted a say in the matter. "The park could have been named after a lot of other things -- for ships, or people who really helped the community," said Lee DeMartino, a lifelong resident. "Believe me, that sign is probably hidden somewhere right here in Cold Spring Harbor."

HEADLINE: Americas Approve Forceful Steps To Restore Ousted Haitian Leader

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASSAU, the Bahamas, May 17

 BODY:
Foreign ministers of the Organization of American States met here today and approved strong new measures aimed at restoring Haiti's elected President, including a denial of port rights to any ship that delivers goods to Haiti.
The renewed effort to isolate Haiti's military-backed Government and reinstate the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in an army coup last September, is built around a trade embargo adopted in October by the organization's 37 members. All the nations in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba are represented. 
 The sanctions have crippled Haiti's economy, but the coup leaders have resisted any compromise that would restore Father Aristide to power. Haiti has survived largely on fuel and other goods from Western Europe and European-controlled Caribbean islands.
Under the new measures, ships that do business with Haiti will be banned from all member nations, and visas will be denied to supporters of the coup. The foreign ministers will also ask the European Community to refrain from trading with Haiti.
Even as they approved measures that could completely shut down Haiti's economy, diplomats acknowledged the risk of accelerating the desperate exodus of Haitian refugees aboard rickety boats. To alleviate the misery, the foreign ministers also called for more humanitarian assistance to Haiti.
"This is a constant concern," said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who is leading the United States delegation here. "We are on the horns of a dilemma. Once you tighten the embargo, it begins to hurt and you increase the refugees."
While the ministers considered tough new measures on Haiti, a last-minute appeal by Peru prompted them to delay discussion of retaliation against that country for the suspension of the Constitution by President Alberto K. Fujimori. His seizure of dictatorial powers on April 5 has led to a cutoff of nearly all international aid, thwarting his stated goal of reviving the economy. [Page A8.]
Mr. Fujimori flew here tonight, and diplomats said he would appear before the foreign ministers on Monday to outline new steps his Government was planning to meet international demands for a return to democratic rule.
Diplomats described the organization's pressure on Haiti and Peru as a vigorous affirmation of the organization's post-cold-war commitment to democracy. Before the coup in Haiti and Mr. Fujimori's seizure of dictatorial powers, many of the envoys contend, all of the hemisphere's countries except Cuba had democratically elected governments.
In summarizing the tighter sanctions against Haiti, a senior United States diplomat said, "Now the people who sell goods to Haiti will have to decide whether it is worth it or not." But he acknowledged that the embargo had done little so far to restore democracy in Haiti.
Rep. Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who has been a strong critic of United States policy toward Haiti and who attended the meeting as an observer, said of the resolutions: "It is the first time I can actually be proud of the leadership of the State Department on this issue."
But European diplomats said they saw little chance that the European Community would impose a matching trade embargo against Haiti. The envoys, attending as observers, cited their trade accords with many third-world nations.
"We have already suspended our aid and technical cooperation with Haiti since Oct. 3, and that is a lot" said Antonio Menduina, a counselor for political affairs at the community's mission to the O.A.S. in Washington. "To do more would be to denounce the Lome Treaty. We don't have the legal ability to tell our companies that they cannot trade with Haiti."
 
Possible Appeal by U.S.
 United States officials said that Canada and the United States were considering approaching the 12 members of the community, rather than the community as a whole, to ask them to tighten sanctions against Haiti.
In addition to the suspension of port privileges, the foreign ministers agreed to tighten controls on civilian air traffic with Haiti to insure that people traveling there do not engage in commerce.
United States diplomats said the Treasury Department would offer to help member countries improve their monitoring of commercial exchanges with Haiti. To satisfy several Caribbean nations whose diplomats have complained of a lax enforcement of the embargo, the resolution included a provision for regular publication of violations.
Canada, which said it would provide $5 million in urgent humanitarian aid to Haiti, proposed a strong condemnation of human rights violations in that country. It was quickly accepted by the United States and other members.
The resolution also implicitly rejected any efforts by Haiti's current leaders to try to end the political crisis without acknowledging Father Aristide's presidency and allowing him to choose a new prime minister.
"This resolution shows an effort to raise the pressure significantly and close the loopholes," said Luigi R. Einaudi, the United States Ambassador to the O.A.S. "It is saying very clearly that we are not going to simply forgive and forget."
Father Aristide's representative expressed pleasure with the resolution but emphasized that its provisions must be strictly enforced.
"The resolution is a beautiful one, as everyone can see," said Juan-Robert Sabbalat, Haiti's foreign minister in exile. "But all the other resolutions have been beautiful, too. The Haitian people have been suffering for eight months now. Pretty words are nice, but we must await their application."
The exodus from Haiti has swelled in recent weeks, with the United States Coast Guard intercepting an average of 250 refugees a day at sea. At least 29,000 Haitians have tried to reach the United States by boat since Father Aristide was overthrown.
 
Haiti as Example to Peru
 As the ministers awaited President Fujimori, several diplomats expressed some optimism that he and other Peruvian leaders were seeking to avoid the isolation that has befallen Haiti by moving quickly toward a restoration of democratic government.
Mr. Eagleburger, the United States delegate, said the Peruvian President was expected to make "proposals with regard to a constituent congress and referendum" that might satisfy the organization's demands for the return of democracy.
"It suggests he takes this all seriously enough that he is coming to explain where he is going and where he wants to go," Mr. Eagleburger said.
One senior United States official commented, "If they are moving away from a rigid position toward something that seems to be moving toward democracy, we would see that as positive. But we still must wait and see."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE RIOTS
A Dream Undone -- A special report.;
Riots Ruin a Business, and a Neighborhood Suffers

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS with MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 17

 BODY:
It took Wenefrette Conner a week to gather the courage to visit her burned-out businesses, and even then, gripping the hands of her daughter and business partner, she said, "I didn't know it was going to hurt so much."
Collapsed now into their own ashes, her chiropractic and skin-care clinics represented more than a decade of personal struggle and a climb into what Mrs. Conner thought was economic security. And, along with scores of other small black-owned businesses destroyed in the recent riots, the clinics symbolized the efforts of black residents to build an economic base in an area filled with poverty. 
 About 1,600 businesses were severely damaged in the rioting, most of them here in South-Central Los Angeles. City officials have estimated the losses at nearly $800 million. A large proportion were Korean-owned, as rioters vented years of frustration and anger against a group that many blacks said was exploiting their poverty. But many were small black-owned businesses, consumed, like Mrs. Conner's clinics, by flames that spread from their Korean-owned neighbors, or made targets precisely because they signaled success in a community of have-nots.
In the days after the fires, a succession of mourners crept under the yellow police tape to take a final look at Mrs. Conner's clinics and their blackened neighbors on Crenshaw Boulevard near Leimert Park: the bookkeeper from the chiropractic clinic, the manager of the skin-care shop, the proprietors of surviving businesses from around the corner, an old customer hoping in vain to find and comfort an owner.
Fifteen of Mrs. Conner's employees are out of jobs today, and, for the most part, on the unemployment rolls. A network of suppliers that furnished everything from stationery to herbal drinks has lost a steady income. A corner of the city has lost the daily trade of Mrs. Conner's workers. The ripples go on and on.
"Everything is like a jigsaw puzzle: you get one missing part and it's not complete," said Richard Fulton, the owner of Fifth Street Dick's, a tiny coffee shop around the corner. "You're all tied together anyway. You hurt no matter if you never knew them. You hurt just because they disappear."
Here is the story of one of those missing parts:
 
The Owners
2 Novices Became Models of Success
 Sixteen years ago, two single working mothers -- Mrs. Conner and her daughter -- determined to make something of themselves and enrolled in a course to become chiropractors. In 1980 they gathered about $5,000 from friends and opened Family Chiropractic Services, painting its walls pink and furnishing it with a small jungle of plants and a quiet background of jazz.
"It took a lot of guts, a lot of guts," said Mrs. Conner's daughter, Priscilla Feldsher, who is now 35 years old. "Not being businesswomen at the time, we learned by trial and error. We were taken advantage of, and we made mistakes, but we were determined to make it."
Working without bank financing, she said, they plowed their profits back into their business, buying more equipment, hiring more employees and expanding in 1984 to open M.F.I. Skin Care Clinic next door.
Only weeks before the riot, Mrs. Feldsher said, they paid nearly $2,000 to a designer to prepare a floor plan that would have combined the two clinics and expanded the treatment rooms. They had installed new lighting and were making other renovations.
And the two clinics had grown into a considerable economic enterprise. The monthly payroll was approaching $20,000, on top of a combined rent of more than $4,000, Mrs. Feldsher said. Some $500 to $800 a month went to cover utility and telephone bills, an alarm system and petty cash payments.
The two women had developed a steady clientele in addition to their walk-in trade. For competitive reasons, Mrs. Feldsher said, she did not want to disclose her clinics' earnings. But she said she was turning a modest profit based on a standard rate of $55 for a top-of-the-line treatment session in either outlet.
 
Praise for Koreans
 As working women, she said, she and her mother, now 57 years old, can serve as models of determination and success. But with black businesses attempting to rebuild in South-Central Los Angeles, she said, the best models are the local Korean enterprises.
"The Koreans have a different type of community," she said. "They help each other. They lend to each other. We aren't a good example because we had to do everything ourselves. No banks financed us. No relatives financed us."
Surveying the cinders of her businesses, she noted another aspect in which she offered a poor role model: like many other black-owned shops in the area, she had no insurance. "That was something that we just never thought of," she said. "When we started, we had nothing to insure. So here we are, left with what we started with."
Starting over again, she and her mother stood in line for three hours last Friday to apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration. Most of their financial records were destroyed in the fire, and they are not sure how much help they will get.
"My mother has grandchildren she is raising, and I've got my children, so it's going to be a tough battle," Mrs. Feldsher said. "But we're determined to make it."
 
The Employees
Bereft of Paycheck And Second Home
 Nellie Torrecillas, 42, had been the office administrator of the chiropractic clinic almost since it opened, and as with so many employees in so many businesses, it had become much more than a workplace for her.
"It was like a home for me," she said as she picked her way through the ashes and charred beams of the clinic. "Sometimes I was sick and people would say to stay home, and I would come to work because this was my home."
On a salary that rose to almost $400 a week after taxes, she said, she had been supporting four relatives in her homeland of Mexico while sharing an apartment here with the clinic's secretary, Maria Perez, 26, and Ms. Perez's 2-year-old son, Steven.
This week, the two women were working on the basis of loyalty alone, digging through charred and sodden files without pay in an attempt to make an accounting.
Soon, Miss Torrecillas said, they would no longer be able to pay their rent. "I'm not going to be homeless, I hope, because my sister always says I can come and live with her," she said.
Like other employees bereft of their workplace here, she said she had little hope of finding another job. "There's nothing to go look for," she said. "Am I supposed to go to Beverly Hills to look for a job?"
 
Happy Memories
 Exploring the remains of the clinic, Miss Torrecillas crouched to look under what seemed to be a melted metal desk in the vain hope that a set of cassettes with a course in mechanics had survived the flames. "They cost me $500, and I've still got to pay for them," she said. "I have to keep on paying $59 a month, and I have no paycheck now."
At this moment, though, amid the shambles of her life, the future seemed to have less impact on her than the past.
"I remember the first day I came over here and I was so happy that they hired me," she said. "I thought, 'Somebody is giving me a big chance. I come from the ghetto and somebody thinks I am good for something.'
"We used to have pictures on the wall here with the way we used to look, skinny," she said. "Now we look fat. We used to have pictures here of boxers, famous boxers, that came to our office to be treated, and where are they? Not even the wall is here any more."
 
Pitiful Artifacts
 Ms. Perez, the secretary, had considered herself a happy person, supporting herself and her son on take-home pay of $511 every two weeks in a job she loved.
"They destroyed a lot of people's lives, like myself," she said of the rioters. "They destroyed my career. I don't have a job. I've got to give my son an education and at the same time I've got to start all over again myself."
Without prospects for a paycheck, she has already had to take her son out of the Crenshaw Academy preschool nearby.
Next door at the skin-care shop, the manager, Darryl Conner, 32, who is also Mrs. Conner's son, attempted to salvage something from the ashes. He recovered one or two bottles of face cleanser, some plastic caps used during facial treatments and a quarter of a bottle of alcohol.
"That's it," he said, holding up his trophies in a single paper bag. "Everything else is gone: steam machines, hair-removal machines, high-frequency machines, ultraviolet machines, skin-care products, not to mention furniture."
As for himself, he said, he had lost a salary of about $500 a week, in exchange for an empty future. "I'm laying low. I have to just wait for the next day to come, because all I know how to do is skin care."
 
The Suppliers
Big Network Feels Damage to Clinics
 No one on the staff knew his full name, but the delivery man for United Parcel Service was almost a member of the family, visiting nearly every day with supplies for the two businesses.
"He told me this was his area, Crenshaw, and now just about everything is burned down," said Miss Torrecillas. "I bet you he doesn't have any job now, because what is he going to deliver?"
Before the riots, he would bring more than $200 worth of materials each week from West Surgical Medical Supplies in downtown Los Angeles, including gloves and $40 rolls of paper bedding.
More than $100 of ointments, elixirs and mineral ice would come each week from a Burbank company called Professional Medical Inc. A Costa Mesa company, Dartel Laboratories, supplied vitamin supplements as well as medicine for arthritis and high blood pressure.
Arthur L. Raines, a 63-year-old black entrepreneur, was preparing to expand his business with Mrs. Conner, selling cases of a dark liquid health supplement that he imported from Canada. The concoction, containing 14 herbs, retails for $39 a bottle, and he sold it wholesale for $362.25 a case.
"We were just getting ready to do something big," he said of his deal with Mrs. Conner. "This is very painful."
 
The Winners: Builders
 On the other side of the South-Central area, on a street of burned-out buildings and angry graffiti, Inez Garrett, who had sold as much as $2,000 a month worth of supplies to Mrs. Conner, sat behind barred doors in her organic-products outlet and waited to feel the impact of the riots.
"I can't tell yet," said the 84-year-old Mrs. Garrett, surrounded by dusty flacons of herbs and potions. "I'm still sitting here with my products. I'm waiting to see which customers come in and which don't come in."
As with any small business, Mrs. Conner's shops developed a support system of workers, all of whom will now be struggling with the loss -- a janitor, a cleaning woman, a plumber, an air conditioning mechanic and the painter who periodically refurbished the front windows with their proud announcements: "Problem skin . . . treatments that work. Acne . . . look better, not different."
Rising from the ashes of the rioting, however, some black contractors were planning for a busy future as they cruised slowly by, writing shop names and telephone numbers on clipboards and on the backs of envelopes.
"Where there is destruction, there is also opportunity," said Voyer Penn, the owner of V. P. Plumbing, impressive in a tailored suit and gold chains. "I don't really want to go on people's disaster, but I might as well get a piece of it myself. I'm basically here to do the job. That's the top and bottom line."
 
The Community
Client and Friend Face an Emptiness
 At Radiant and Raw, a small black-owned barber shop just down the block that is still in business, Charles Moses, a co-owner, was already feeling the loss of his neighbors.
"On this block, all the businesses got along pretty well," he said. "We did business with each other. Now there is no place to go get snacks. We lost the skin-care center. We lost the fish market. We lost the manicurist down there. We lost our copy center. We lost the chiropractor."
He said he had often referred customers to the two enterprises owned by Mrs. Conner and Mrs. Feldsher. "It's affecting us quite a bit, them being gone," he said. "They sent people down. We sent people to them."
Mrs. Feldsher said she and her mother and their employees had themselves provided considerable trade for surrounding businesses, including a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a grocery store, clothing and shoe stores and a beauty supply shop.
Some employees, like Ms. Perez, had enrolled their children in nearby day care centers. In addition, Mrs. Feldsher said, she had been active in the local merchants' association and chamber of commerce, in local politics and in providing free screenings for the poor and the elderly at health fairs.
In a small but regular way, she had advertised in the local black newspapers and on a black-run radio station.
Most of all, she said, she was distressed at the sudden rupturing of long-established relationships with the customers and patients who had come to depend on her businesses.
One of these was Juan Richardson, who stood staring for a long time the other day at the remains of the skin-care shop. "Man, that was a good place," he said. "I'd come about once a week and sit in a chair and get some steam and a facial mask."
As with many small black-owned businesses, the transaction had been as much personal as professional. While clearing up a problem with his complexion, he said, the people who worked here had also helped him to confront his life as a drug dealer.
With Mrs. Conner's guidance, he said, he had given up a $500-a-day drug business in exchange for a $5-an-hour job as an office temporary worker. "It wasn't easy, but she showed a better way," he said. "She treated me like a son."
 
The Landlord
Voice of Investor Is Voice of Doubt

In Beverly Hills, the landlord, Hoyt Leisure of Leisure and Carpenter management company, said he would probably have to rebuild his property under the terms of his insurance policy, but he was not enthusiastic about it.
The reconstruction would involve the entire burned-out, block-long building that includes Mrs. Conner's clinics as well as a black-owned print shop, copy center and beauty supply store, a Korean-owned liquor store and fish shop and a Vietnamese-owned nail parlor.
"It's been a reasonable investment," Mr. Leisure said of the 63-year-old building where the rents for the 12,000 square feet of space range from 60 to 70 cents a square foot, as compared to about $2.50 a square foot in Beverly Hills.
"But if I were starting off fresh that's probably not where we would put our money, because of the character of the neighborhood," he said. He spoke of struggling businesses, vacant or run-down stores, a closed theater and fears of a return of violence.
Given the multitude of uncertainties, Mr. Leisure said, investors would be unlikely to move in quickly to South-Central Los Angeles. "I think a prudent person would want to stand back and evaluate the situation fairly carefully," he said.

A1); "There's nothing to go look for," said Nellie Torrecillas, who had been the office administrator of Wenefrette Conner's chiropractic clinic in South-Central Los Angeles, which was destroyed. Miss Torrecillas said she had little hope of finding another job. "Am I supposed to go to Beverly Hills to look for a job?" she asked. She sorted through some of the office's files. (pg.

Helping Top Schools Correct Some Bad Fractions

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"IF I were going to public school," said Sheldon Gilbert, a 16-year-old from Jamaica, Queens, "I wouldn't be thinking of Yale or Harvard."
He is thinking of applying to Yale or Harvard next year, though. And the reason he is going to Horace Mann instead of a public high school is that when he was in the fourth grade, his mother heard about Prep for Prep. 
 The program is in its second decade of identifying bright, highly motivated New York City students, most of them black or Hispanic, and helping to place them in independent schools, including Brearley, Collegiate, Dalton, Fieldston, Horace Mann, Poly Prep, Riverdale Country, Spence and Trinity, where the program is based. Promising smaller classes and individual attention, the nonprofit Prep for Prep depends almost entirely on philanthropy, not on the government.
Placement is just the beginning. Intense preparation, continued counseling, Saturday and after-school classes, summer institutes and a new alumni group that harnesses the experience of 300 Prep for Prep students who are enrolled in college or have already graduated also distinguish the program as an effective tool to save some of the city's children.
Saturday's "Save Our Cities-Save Our Children" march in Washington was a noble effort to prick the nation's conscience. This year alone, New York received $860 million less for its expense budget and $3 billion less for construction than it would have if Federal funds were flowing into the city at the same rate, adjusted for inflation, as they were a decade ago, before its burden was worsened by homelessness, AIDS and crack.
But the march's impact will depend less on how many people took part than on how many of those who didn't are persuaded that saving the cities is in their interest, too. That includes Congress and the President, whose "weed and seed" prescription for urban revival evokes Chauncey Gardiner's vacuous metaphors in Peter Sellers's film "Being There."
So far, last month's Los Angeles riots have generated more outrage over the failings of criminal justice agencies than over the failures they inherited from the social welfare and education systems. It is easier to take symbolic steps against discrimination in South Africa than to take substantive ones to repair the impact of poverty and racism at home.
Last year, only 4 in 10 black high school students passed their final examinations in South Africa, and only 1 in 10 black seniors scored well enough to qualify for university admission. The results were attributed to disparities in spending between white and black school systems, poorly trained teachers, truancy and violence.
In New York City last year, only 3 in 10 blacks completed public high school on schedule. Among black high school seniors, about 1 in 10 qualified for the more rigorous Regents-endorsed diplomas.
Prep for Prep is making a dent in those dismal numbers. The program is being replicated in Buffalo, Massachusetts and New Jersey -- its potential for expansion limited mostly by the availability of scholarships from independent schools and by contributions to cover administrative costs.
"All we can do is structure an opportunity," says Gary Simons, the program's founder and executive director. "We have managed to create an ethos that the young people don't feel something was given to them on a silver platter or that they were demeaned by the process."
"Would most succeed anyway?" Mr. Simons asked. "I guess it depends on what one's definition of success is. A portion would end up going to college, though I think the percentage going to the most rigorous institutions would be a pittance. And some would just drop out. Some of the brightest are already turned off. But we see a lot of parents raising children in difficult situations who have not lost faith."
Later this month, Prep for Prep will send acceptances to about 150 fifth graders and 60 seventh graders among more than 2,000 who were nominated by the city's public schools, with whose enlightened indulgence the program has flourished.
"We have, I believe, two choices," Mr. Simons said two years ago. "Either we allow Howard Beach and Bensonhurst and the Rev. Al Sharpton to write the epitaph for our generation, or we invest in the education of young people who have the potential and -- let us hope and pray -- the vision and determination to lead people into the system, to develop our capacity to be one people, to teach us that people of diverse backgrounds can and do have fundamental hopes and aspirations in common."
"We really don't have a third choice," Mr Simons said.

HEADLINE: Riverside's Pastor at Center of Turmoil

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Black and white they come to Riverside Church, more than a thousand strong each Sunday. It is a church sizzling with life and remarkably integrated at a time when blacks and whites tend to go separate ways for worship.
But tensions are running high these days at Riverside in a dispute that threatens to disrupt the delicate racial balance that the interdenominational church has tried hard to achieve. The congregation is deeply divided over the actions, leadership and style of its pastor, the Rev. James A. Forbes Jr., who is the first black to head the church. His appointment three years ago was seen as a mighty witness to Riverside's long-standing liberalism. 
 His critics accuse Dr. Forbes, 56 years old, of being authoritarian, aloof, too spontaneous in worship and too much of a fundamentalist, especially in his sermons. They say that under his leadership, more blacks have joined, whites have left and collections have declined. His detractors are both black and white, and they insist that their criticism is not racially motivated. Most are not calling on him to resign, just to be more responsive to complaints.
Average Sunday attendance at the imposing stone church in Morningside Heights is 1,404, down 10 percent from five years ago. Gifts and donations for the seven-month period ending Jan. 1 were $1.7 million, a 3 percent decline from the same period the previous year.
"We have to ask, why is membership down? Why is giving down?" said Howard Geiger, the treasurer of the church's religious corporation, and one of Dr. Forbes's more vocal critics. "I believe it is a protest against the senior minister's leadership."
But a spokeswoman for the church, Joan Bacchus, said membership had remained steady, at about 2,200.
The dispute over Dr. Forbes has involved open letters and petitions that complain about everything from the length of his sermons to his choice of liturgical music.
The divisions at Riverside have grown so deep that a professional mediator was called in to resolve a dispute that began when Dr. Forbes tried to dismiss his second-in-command, the Rev. David Dyson, who is white. But Dr. Forbes's attempt has been rebuffed by the church council, a 26-member board that hired both men.
Yesterday, after services at the church, the president of the church council, Geoffrey Martin, told church members, "The mediation process has not produced a reconciliation." Then the council issued a statement affirming Dr. Forbes as senior minister but saying he would have to find a way to work with the man he had tried to fire. Mr. Dyson is a former labor organizer who was brought in a year after Dr. Forbes arrived to help him translate the church's inspirational message into social action. The council appointed a committee to develop "meaningful work" for Mr. Dyson.
Mr. Dyson said he did not know what the statement meant for the future and declined to comment.
Dr. Forbes may have been alluding to the dispute in his sermon, which focused on using "vision to transcend division."
Neither man would discuss the details of their dispute.
Dr. Forbes's supporters acknowledge that his leadership differs from his predecessors' and that he has altered the length and style of the the worship service. Some parishioners have complained about "interjections" during the service -- like shouts of "Amen" and hands lifted skyward -- and applause afterward. An unsigned memo distributed during a service said such displays "produce dramatic and esthetic disjuncture."
Some longtime worshipers were shocked recently when Dr. Forbes ended a sermon with an "altar call," an invitation to anyone to so inspired to "come forward and accept Jesus in your life," which had never been done before at Riverside.
But Dr. Forbes's supporters say the congregation hired a black minister with a Pentecostal, Bible-based background and now should adjust to a leader who naturally attracts minority worshipers and who is not perturbed when a service runs longer and is louder than usual.
In a recent interview in his office in the church, Dr. Forbes said many critics based their views on stereotypes of black preachers. He said he remained committed to Riverside's historical tradition even as he tried to foster traditions that reflected its newer members, many of whom are black, Hispanic and Asian.
While Telemann and Bach are still heard within Riverside's limestone walls, so are spirituals and hand-clapping gospel music, as well as newer forms like sacred jazz and liturgical salsa.
The changes raise the ire of Betty Sheets, a former chairwoman of Riverside's board.
"To me the preaching is fundamental, thin fare indeed for someone seeking understanding and enlightenment," she wrote in an open letter to the congregation. "I do not need to return to the Sunday School of my youth; I need a thoughtful adult perspective."
It was a surprising indictment, given Dr. Forbes's reputation as one of the best preachers in the nation. For more than a dozen years before coming to Riverside, he was a professor of preaching at Union Theological Seminary. And he has been pastor at several black churches in the South, including St. John's United Holy Church of America, in Richmond.
A colleague at the seminary, the Rev. William Kennedy, who is also a member of Riverside's council, defended Dr. Forbes. "I think Jim has an amazing intuitive sensibility to know just where the congregation is," he said. "And the way he brings the congregation in and taps our spiritual needs is really remarkable."
Dr. Forbes makes no apology for his fondness for Bible stories. "I do not begin a sermon from the headlines of The New York Times," he said. "My emphasis is on Biblical preaching that has social relevance."
That is a departure from his immediate predecessor, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, who left to head a nuclear disarmament organization in Washington. Dr. Coffin was also besieged by complaints, but by critics who founds his sermons too topical and not Biblical enough.
Riverside is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches and the United Church of Christ, both of which give member churches a great deal of autonomy. Dr. Forbes was ordained in the American Baptist Churches and the Original United Holy Church, International, a Pentecostal church of which his father is a bishop.
Riverside's troubles, said the Rev. Carl Flemister, the regional executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Metropolitan New York, are "a test of its liberalism."
"We're going places we've never been before," he said, noting that Riverside's racial makeup -- now estimated at 50 percent white and 50 percent minority -- is highly unusual.
Dr. Forbes insists that he is struggling to keep Riverside integrated.
He attributed both the decline in church contributions and the anxiety over the congregation's growing racial diversity to the poor state of the economy. "Now more than ever," he said, "people are looking for stability, especially in their church."
An unsigned memo, which purported to represent the views of "many staff members," accused Dr. Forbes of ruling with an iron hand and demanding the loyalty of his subordinates. The memo also said the pastor called anyone who challenged his authority "racist."
A longtime church member, Elaine Olaoye, a psychologist, said she hoped Dr. Forbes would not frame the attacks on him in racial terms. "Riverside has made a concerted effort to make Jim comfortable," she said. "And it's a two-way street. To assume that Riverside must accommodate him and that he must not accommodate it, that's racism."
But Dr. Olaoye is confident that Dr. Forbes can succeed at Riverside. She sees his problems there as part of his transition from a seminary teacher to a pastor who must administer a church with an annual budget of $4 million and a staff of more than 100, from clerical to clergy.
"I'm a professor of psychology," Dr. Olaoye said. "If I were put in charge of a major clinic in New York, I would go crazy. That is what Jim is going through. It is a very different kind of experience than being in the classroom."

HEADLINE: Crackdown by Peruvian Leader Brings No Peace

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, May 17

 BODY:
When President Alberto K. Fujimori seized near-dictatorial powers on April 5, the pillars of his rationale were to fight terrorism and drug trafficking and revive the economy.
Six weeks later, he is facing growing pressure on all three fronts, a sign that his newly assumed powers have not yet worked in the public's favor. 
 Peru's tenacious Maoist guerrilla group, the Shining Path, has shifted to a strategy that the Government seems virtually incapable of confronting, setting off huge car and bus bombs around the capital. A 600-pound truck bomb exploded on Thursday within blocks of the Presidential Palace, shattering a number of windows.
While many Peruvian business executives were heartened by Mr. Fujimori's emergency decree, their euphoria gave way to sober reflection after nearly all international aid was cut off. A previously booming stock market has stalled. Hundreds of millions of dollars deposited in banks have been withdrawn from the country out of fear of instability. The banking system is in crisis, and foreign investment is at a standstill.
 
Meeting in Bahamas
 That grim economic picture is what prompted Mr. Fujimori to fly to the Bahamas today to speak directly to foreign ministers of the Organization of American States.
The political and economic isolation threatening Peru is even reminiscent of the days when Mr. Fujimori's political nemesis and predecessor, Alan Garcia, was refusing to make payments on foreign debt and trying to nationalize the country's banks.
"Peru is not totally isolated yet, but it is getting there," said a senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But this is the history of Peru. It has shown a willingness again and again to withstand international pressure almost always to its detriment."
In its battle with the Shining Path, the most violent guerrilla organization in Latin America, the Fujimori Government has made some short-term gains, experts say. Last week, Mr. Fujimori paraded triumphantly around the grounds of the Miguel Castro prison as more than 300 Shining Path inmates who had lost a four-day battle with the police lay face down on the dusty ground.
Two police officers were killed, but the Shining Path, known as the Sendero Luminoso, lost at least 36, including five high-ranking members.
 
'A Loss for Sendero'
 "You cannot deny that in terms of a military battle, this was a loss for Sendero," said a sympathizer with the movement who insisted on anonymity our of fear of police retribution. "They fought against impossible odds and in the end surrendered."
Though the Shining Path may have to retrench and shift its strategy, it has shown remarkable resiliency in replacing fallen members. The movement's political control over shantytowns in and around Lima has grown considerably in recent months, and the forcible prison takeover may even help it recruit a new phalanx of dedicated members from among the families of the slain rebels.
"The fact is that Fujimori won and Abimael Guzman won," said Carlos Tapia, an expert on the Shining Path, in a reference to the leader of the guerrilla organization. By responding to the Government crackdown with huge car bombs, the guerrillas have intensified a climate of fear and tension in Lima, giving an impression that the Government has actually lost some control.
Mr. Fujimori will come under even heavier pressure to show progress against the guerrillas as a July 5 plebiscite approaches in which the people will vote on whether to support his seizure of power.
He will be able to show little progress in fighting drug trafficking or reviving the economy.
The Peruvian Government announced in April that the air force would take control of municipal airports in the Upper Huallaga Valley, the source of 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. But seizures of drug shipments have continued to decline and the production of coca leaf has increased.
After a Peruvian aircraft opened fire last month on a United States transport plane, the Pentagon removed two radar systems that had been used to help track drug planes in the northern jungle. Washington has also halted Green Beret training for Peru's antidrug agents.
But the biggest setback may be the loss of international aid. Before Mr. Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the Constitution, Peru was close to receiving a $1.1 billion aid package from 11 industrialized countries, led by the United States, Japan and Germany. A $220 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank and other credits from the World Bank were in the pipeline.
After the United States announced it was withholding all but humanitarian aid, one country after another announced that they too would halt aid until democracy returned to Peru.

After 16-year-old Tawana Scott was charged with murder last May for abandoning her baby to die next to the swirling waters of the Harlem River, her relatives were left with many questions -- among them, why had New York City's child-welfare authorities returned the baby to Tawana when she had abandoned the child once before? In this case, as in any case in which a child under its supervision dies, the city's Human Resources Administration had the same reply: no comment. The response springs from laws intended to protect the privacy of families, but increasingly these laws are being questioned as some advocates for children charge that the laws too often shield bureaucracies that function poorly and make dreadful mistakes.

Three leading authorities on substance abuse are starting a national center in Manhattan to examine and work against all aspects of addiction, from chain-smoking and alcoholism to cocaine and heroin abuse. The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, which opens today, is intended to bring under one roof professionals from a variety of fields. The center will be financed by philanthropies and corporations -- it has a five-year, $8 million commitment from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N.J., and at least $2 million from a number of the country's major banks and corporations.

OFFERING A PATH TO SUCCESS
Prep for Prep is in its second decade of identifying bright, highly motivated New York City students, most of them black or Hispanic, and helping to place them in independent schools, including Brearley, Collegiate, Dalton, Fieldston, Horace Mann, Poly Prep, Riverdale Country, Spence and Trinity, where the program is based. Promising smaller classes and individual attention, the nonprofit Prep for Prep depends almost entirely on philanthropy, not on the government. At a time when the numbers of black and Hispanic students who graduate from high school in the city are dismal, Prep for Prep is making a dent. Metro Matters, B3.

CITY TO SELL $1 BILLION IN SECURITIES
New York City is scheduled to sell more than $1 billion in new tax-exempt securities this week, when conditions in the credit markets for the city appear better than at any time since the late 1980's. The ripple effect of Olympia & York Ltd.'s bankruptcy filing in Canada is the only potential problem for the city's offering, but it is not expected to be a serious one. D7.

SHORE KEEPS A VIGIL FOR SUMMER
The chilly spring weather has kept the main street of Long Beach Island in Beach Haven, N.J., as empty as a beach house in February. Under the severe economic rules of the summer tourist trade, every slow week before the season begins will have to be made up during the 10 crucial weeks leading up to Labor Day. In that span of days, shore business people up and down the Jersey Shore will trade 9 or 10 months of idleness and odd jobs for a delirium of 12-hour workdays and seven-day weeks. They will try to feed, dress, amuse and entice the migrant crowds of happy, sunburned and free-spending tourists while removing as much of their money as possible. B4.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Calls for Review Of Port Authority Plans

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, citing a "tunnel to nowhere" at Kennedy International Airport and other projects gone awry, called yesterday for a sweeping review of construction programs of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to cut waste and to safeguard against "ill-conceived capital investments" during hard economic times.
In a separate interview, the Governor proposed that New York and New Jersey set up a new and independent oversight panel that would monitor the authority's management and productivity and create greater accountability in an agency that he said had become "a kind of government all its own." 
 Expressing "grave concern" over "huge Port Authority investments in projects that have never been built or have been canceled after brief tests," Mr. Cuomo asked the agency's top officials to survey capital programs of the 1980's and 1990's and to report to him and to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey in a month.
 
'Past Mistakes'
 "In the wake of recent press reports on tunnels, computers and similar ill-fated investments, it is clearly time to review thoroughly and systematically the recent capital project history -- and even more important, the future capital project plans -- of the Port Authority," the Governor said.
The Port Authority's chairman, Richard C. Leone, said Mr. Cuomo's request for a review and his suggested oversight panel were "appropriate and timely," and added: "Even the best intentions need to be tempered by discipline and accountability. The current leadership of the Port Authority wants to insure that we learn from past mistakes and are more prudent in the future. The governors, who appoint us, have a right to expect no less."
Mark Marchese, a spokesman for the Port Authority, which has just begun a $5 billion, five-year plan of improvements for its airports, bridges, tunnels, bus terminals and other transportation operations, said the agency "will be happy to provide the governors with a prudent plan that will effectively minimize the risk associated with carrying out a capital plan of this magnitude."
 
Projects Postponed
 Governor Cuomo's request comes at a time of mounting criticism of the Port Authority, particularly over a $3.2 billion airport expansion program, begun with fanfare in 1985 as "J.F.K. 2000," that included a $21 million baggage tunnel that has never been used; a $22 million computerized freight mover that was halted after six weeks, and a largely unused $56 million parking garage.
Many of the Kennedy Airport projects were drawn up in the booming 1980's, when a central terminal complex flanked by hotels, automated people movers and an elaborate baggage-handling system was envisioned. But as the recession and hard economic times set in, some big airlines went bankrupt and many of the projects were postponed indefinitely.
After a series of Newsday articles criticized some of these projects, Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat from Queens, accused the authority last month of "shooting craps" with scarce resources and suggested Congressional hearings. Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, proposed legislative hearings and tighter controls on agency spending.
On May 1, Mr. Cuomo asked the authority's executive director, Stanley Brezenoff, for a "thorough accounting of what went wrong" with the 1980's projects, which, the Governor noted pointedly, had been launched prior to the appointment of the agency's current leadership. That review is expected to be completed later this week.
Yesterday, however, Mr. Cuomo said it was "becoming increasingly apparent" that "a broader review is required to make recommendations on how we can prevent this from happening again." He said he had asked Mr. Leone, Mr. Brezenoff, and the agency's vice chairman, Vincent Tese, to conduct the review and report back to him and Governor Florio by June 15.
Mr. Cuomo said the agency had an "incomparable" record for expanding and improving the transportation infrastructure of New York and New Jersey and he said the review would assure that its "history of progress continues."
In a later interview, Mr. Cuomo said that "all bureaucracies have to be weeded and watched," and he said he would ask his aides to meet with aides to Governor Florio to discuss the establishment of a panel to oversee the agency's management and productivity.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Into U.S. Aid to Iraq Urged

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

 BODY:
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, said yesterday that he would seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the secret American buildup of Iraq before the Persian Gulf war and the Bush Administration's "obstruction of justice."
In what was apparently the last straw for Mr. Gonzalez,Attorney General William P. Barr said on Friday that he would no longer provide Mr. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, with classified documents unless he was assured that the Congressman would not disclose the information. 
 Mr. Gonzalez replied that his speeches did not jeopardize national security because he disclosed classified information dealing with past policies, not continuing or future plans.
 
Seeking an Independent Counsel
 "He can't point to any national security conflict -- there is none," Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview yesterday. He said he would ask the House Judiciary Committee to recommend the appointment of a counsel to pursue the investigation and he expected the panel to do so. The chairman of that committee is Jack Brooks, also a Texas Democrat.
"The chairman has indicated to me that he is of like mind that we should proceed on this," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Our staffs have already started preparing the paperwork."
He added: "I think Mr. Barr is very confused. He thinks that we in the Congress, and I in particular, are in the position of some lowly state prosecutors."
The Ethics in Government Act specifies that a majority of the Judiciary Committee in the House or Senate can require the Attorney General to investigate whether sufficient evidence of wrongdoing exists to warrant appointment of an independent counsel.
 
Attorney General's Response
 Since Mr. Barr is one subject of Mr. Gonzalez's investigation, it is not clear how he will respond to such a vote by the Judiciary Committee. In the past the Attorney General has regarded such votes as binding.
Currently, two independent counsels are conducting inquiries. Lawrence E. Walsh is investigating the Reagan Administration's sale of arms to Iran and clandestine aid to Nicaraguan rebels, and Arlin M. Adams is investigating accusations of corruption against the Department of Housing and Urban Development and its former Secretary, Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
Mr. Gonzalez's approach to the Judiciary Committee is very much in character. A loner whom some colleagues in Congress view as an eccentrice, for most of the last two years he waged a campaign to unravel the Bush Administration's economic ties to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. For the most part, nobody listened until recently.
Mr. Gonzalez, who is 76 years old, began his hunt after he stumbled onto a major banking scandal involving the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in 1989 after reading a brief newspaper article about an obscure Atlanta bank that had issued a $2 billion line of credit to Iraq.
"I wondered, what kind of a bank is this?" Mr. Gonzalez recalled recently. "Ordinarily, a transaction of this kind would be initiated out of New York by a big, old bank, an international bank."
"When I learned that the Atlanta bank was a branch of B.N.L., an Italian bank, I said, 'How in the world could it issue that vast sum of money?' " Mr. Gonzalez said.
 
Steady Stream of Disclosures
 He has been providing the answers in a series of lengthy speeches on the House floor that began on Feb. 4, 1991, three weeks before the cease-fire in the United States-led war against Iraq.
His steady stream of disclosures, largely ignored by colleagues and only recently pursued by news organizations, portrayed a secret network of international transactions that enabled Iraq to expand its military power in the year before its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
In the process Mr. Gonzalez discovered that the assistance had been made possible by a policy initiated at the highest levels of the Bush Administration, which has been less than eager to help him get to the bottom of the embarrassing affair.
The Congressman's speeches are peppered with references to secret documents, including a National Security Directive signed by President Bush in October 1989 that directed Government agencies to expand economic aid to Baghdad on the ground that such action would help moderate Iraq's belligerent behavior.
The financial aid to Iraq was primarily indirect, in the form of commercial loans backed by United States guarantees mandated by top officials of the Reagan and Bush Administrations. The primary source of the loans was the Atlanta bank.
In the late 1980's, the bank lent Iraq a total of $4 billion, much of it mired in fraud. Mr. Gonzalez says he believes that much of $1.9 billion in loans from the bank that were backed by guarantees from the Commodity Credit Corporation went to buy arms, while another $2.1 billion enabled Iraq to buy related military equipment like telecommunications technology, electronic components, heavy engineering equipment and semiconductor devices.
Reagan and Bush Administration officials also persuaded the Export-Import Bank, a Government agency, to provide loan guarantees including $484 million for an Iraqi oil pipeline.
In his speeches about the United States policy, which also included relaxed controls on technology exports and the sharing of intelligence with Iraq, Mr. Gonzales says the key players included President Bush; his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger.
"This issue shows all of Henry's strengths," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat and member of the Banking and Judiciary Committees. "He can see down the road ahead of others, and once he fixes onto something, he pursues it and won't let go. He's willing to use unconventional methods."
But critics say Mr. Gonzalez's unyielding persistence and penchant for acting alone also reflect a legislative weakness that has prevented him from forging coalitions in Congress.
A 30-year veteran of the House, where he represents part of San Antonio and its suburbs, Mr. Gonzalez is a passionate advocate known for his fiery temper. Six years ago at the age of 70, in a San Antonio restaurant, he punched a 40-year-old patron in the head after the man called him a Communist. The district attorney dropped charges in return for a public apology from the Congressman.
Mr. Gonzalez says his initial efforts to unravel the Lavoro scandal were stonewalled by the Justice and Treasury Departments, the Federal Reserve Board and some state regulators. Each had its own reasons for trying to quash the Gonzalez investigation.
The Justice Department contended that Mr. Gonzalez's inquiry could jeopardize its own investigation, and Dick Thornburgh, the Attorney General at the time, expressed his "profound disappointment" when Mr. Gonzalez convened his first hearing on the Lavoro bank in October 1990, just as the Administration was assembling the international coalition that was to go to war against Iraq three months later.
 
Loss to U.S. Taxpayers
 "I felt that that couldn't have been the reason," Mr. Gonzalez said. "I felt that it was embarrassing to explain why the taxpayers had to foot the bill for $2 billion." He estimates that $800 million is still owed the Federal Government because of the loan guarantees.
The Treasury said it feared that the House investigation could cause the loss of foreign bank funds in the United States. That was echoed by the Federal Reserve and some state regulators, who also said they had no authority to collect data about foreign bank transactions in the United States.
The White House saw the investigation as a Democratic effort to embarrass President Bush. "They were sensitive because of the then unknown role of the policy makers with respect to Iraq," Mr. Gonzalez said. "In retrospect, I can see why that would be embarrassing."
Unable to obtain data from his own Government, Mr. Gonzalez turned to the Italian Government, which provided leads that the Congressman's chief investigator, Dennis Kane, followed in the United States. The Federal Reserve, the Export-Import Bank and the State and Agriculture Departments eventually cooperated with his investigation, but the Justice Department and Customs Service never complied with subpoenas for documents.
On Feb. 28, 1991, the day after President Bush ordered the cease-fire in the war, the Justice Department investigation bore fruit. Mr. Thornburgh announced a 347-count indictment against four Iraqi officials and three former executives of the Atlanta bank, charging fraud involving more than $4 billion in loans and a secret set of "gray books" not reported in the Italian bank's official records. Two of the former executives pleaded guilty to charges that they had helped funnel illegal loans and credits to Iraq. The other defendants have not yet stood trial.
 
Provision Added to Crime Bill
 Mr. Gonzalez had already succeeded in inserting a provision into the 1990 Crime Bill that made foreign banks subject to American criminal statutes. He also was instrumental in legislation approved last year that made the Federal Reserve the prime regulator of foreign banks, pre-empting the role of state regulators.
In his initial speech on the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Mr. Gonzalez advised the House, "I have developed evidence clearly linking B.N.L. loans to a network of companies that helped to build the Iraqi war machine."
Two months later, Mr. Gonzalez disclosed that a Federal Reserve work paper stated that Secretary of State Baker had talked to President Hussein in September or October of 1989 about the Lavoro scandal, and that officials of Treasury, State, Defense, the Office of Management and Budget, Commerce, Agriculture and the Office of the United States Trade Representative were among those who had held a meeting in late 1989 to discuss its implications. Mr. Gonzalez said he did not know the substance of the discussions.
In March he obtained a memo that he said disclosed that the National Security Council "is providing coordination for the Administration's response to Congressional document requests for Iraq-related materials."
Mr. Gonzalez said he was distressed that the memo "gave the White House a direct hand in regulating the flow of information to the Congress, thus limiting oversight of Iraq policy." The memo will be the subject of a Banking Committee hearing on May 29.

HEADLINE: BEACH HAVEN JOURNAL;
Shore's Shops Face the Annual Scramble

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: BEACH HAVEN, N.J.

 BODY:
LIKE a farmer scanning her seeded fields for the first signs of green, Barbara Buchan took a long look up Bay Avenue before returning to her store to set out the novelties she hoped would attract the waves of vacationing impulse shoppers who will soon crowd the Jersey Shore.
But the chilly spring weather has kept the main street of Long Beach Island as empty as a beach house in February. Under the severe economic rules of the summer tourist trade, every slow week before the season begins will have to be made up during the 10 crucial weeks leading up to Labor Day. 
 In that span of days, shore business people like Mrs. Buchan in her Dollar Parlor, Bill Dowd in the pizzeria around the corner, Lew and Anna Richards at the Crust 'n Crumb bakery and hundreds of others up and down the Jersey Shore will trade 9 or 10 months of idleness and odd jobs for a delirium of 12-hour workdays and 7-day weeks. They will try to feed, dress, amuse and entice the migrant crowds of happy, sunburned and free-spending tourists while removing as much of their money as possible.
For most summer business people, those two and a half months, with spikes of extra activity at Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day, will bring in three-quarters of the year's income.
For Mrs. Buchan, a good summer means an easy winter, maybe in Florida or "doing antique shows." A bad summer means having to get a winter job.
Like farmers depending on a one-crop harvest, the summer business owners are understandably worried about weather.
"That's what we're like, a bunch of farmers out here, looking at the sky," said Mr. Richards, who with his wife took the down payment they had saved for a move to Florida and put it into the Crust 'n Crumb. Its previous owner gave up and moved on after last Halloween's floods left the bakery awash in a tide of moldering doughnuts.
Spring is one of the "shoulders" of the season, in the local commercial language, and the chilly weather so far has made Jeanne DiPaola, head of the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, cautious about predicting a big payoff this season.
"I would say that this cool weather has given us a shaky start," she said.
But last year was a good year and the popular wisdom around here is that the lingering recession will keep families closer to home and at the shore instead of sending them overseas or to more distant parts of the country.
And summer rentals are running ahead of last year's rate, despite the colorful 'For sale' and 'For rent' signs that bloom on many streets.
Above all, the start of every season is also a season of optimism, and the shopkeepers at Bay Village know what kind of weather they want.
"Sun," said Mr. Dowd, the 27-year-old proprietor of Bay Village Pizza. "If we can't have sun all the time, sun on weekends to bring the weekenders, and the clouds on weekdays, so the people who are spending the week will go shopping instead of sitting on the beach."
Mrs. Buchan says her best year was in 1985, when, recently divorced and with children to raise, she bought the Dollar Parlor from its previous owner. But last year was good, too, she said, and with the Chamber of Commerce organizing new and better fall attractions -- the Chowder Cook-Off around Halloween, the visit from Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus on Thanksgiving -- her business can take in more dollars by staying open on weekends in the fall.
Mrs. Buchan's shop is banked floor to ceiling with every imaginable gewgaw selling for under $3, which is her limit. Squirt guns, playing cards, whoopie cushions and personalized toothbrushes are crowded next to plastic trolls, American flags and ingenious little boxes for spreading butter on corn. It is a cheerful business for a cheerful woman.
"I have certainly come to love it," she said. "My daughter married into the family here," she said, meaning one of the landlord's sons, "and my son and his wife have Sur La Plage -- they sell beach wear -- two blocks down."
While they hope and plan for the start of the summer rush, the business people at Bay Village are also counting out the last dollars carefully budgeted from last summer's sales. This is the time of year when that budget is tightest.
"We're all really scraping by right now," said Melissa Maschal, who is married to John Maschal Jr., whose father owns the complex of stores.
"The tenants' first rent payment isn't due until May 31, so it isn't just the tenants who are having to get by. By the beginning of May around here, we're all hitting the banks for loans."

HEADLINE: Coming in Hope, Staying to Struggle, Leaving to Die;
Gambling on Better Care, H.I.V.-Infected Puerto Ricans Seek Help in New York City

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Luis Alberto Lopez settled down in New York City two and a half years ago hoping, not for the American dream, but for a longer life.
He finds less stress in his native Puerto Rico, he says, and he misses his family, the sun and the beach. But Mr. Lopez is infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and he says his access to medicines, specialists and experimental treatments is better in the states than on the island.
"My mother said, 'Why don't you stay? I'll take care of you,' " said Mr. Lopez, 26 years old, who tested positive for H.I.V. in late 1989. "I told her, 'If I stay here, I think I'll die much faster.' "
 
In Hopes of Health Care
 While Puerto Ricans have traveled to New York for economic reasons for decades, those who are H.I.V.-positive have been coming more recently to fight a killer disease and, when faced with defeat, return home to die.
Now, responding to the strains such flow has created for AIDS services and families, officials in New York and Puerto Rico will for the first time try to measure the size of this migrant group and its needs.
In one collaborative effort spearheaded by the New York State Department of Health's AIDS Institute, two offices planned for New York City and the island this fall will document the travel patterns of H.I.V.-infected Puerto Ricans and assist them in transferring medical records, continuing medical treatment and finding clinical and social services as they arrive. The offices are expected to serve up to 200 clients apiece annually, with financing from United States Public Health Service.
And Mayor David N. Dinkins, who is in the Caribbean this week, is expected to announce an agreement on Wednesday between San Juan and New York City, home to nearly a million Puerto Ricans, to identify and coordinate AIDS services available in each city for the H.I.V.-infected population that travels between them. The officials also plan to seek financial support from both Washington and private foundations to improve services.
 
An Unknown Number
 It is not known how many Puerto Ricans travel because of AIDS, but health officials in New York and Puerto Rico say that anecdotal evidence indicate that the number is significant. Health officials say that H.I.V. itself has been exchanged back and forth across the air bridge linking New York City and San Juan.
Both New York and Puerto Rico have suffered a heavy toll. New York State has the nation's second highest per capita rate of new cases reported to the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, has the fourth highest. As of last March, Puerto Rico had reported 6,849 AIDS cases since the beginning of the epidemic and New York State 44,176, more than 38,000 of them in New York City.
And on the mainland, AIDS is striking Puerto Ricans proportionately more than any other Hispanic group, with most cases stemming from intravenous drug use, according to studies by the Centers for Disease Control.
Many H.I.V.-positive Puerto Ricans come to the mainland in response to disparities in Medicaid coverage and Federal disability benefits. The Social Security Administration, for instance, does not pay Supplemental Security Income benefits on the island, but Puerto Ricans are eligible for the program on the mainland.
Medicaid has a dollar cap for Puerto Rico and does not pay for treatments and services there that it covers on the mainland, such as private nursing care. In 1990, the cap was $79 million, while the commonwealth spent $519 million on medical care for the indigent, officials in Puerto Rico said.
Dr. Gabriel Torres, medical director of the AIDS center at St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, treats about 30 visiting Puerto Ricans at any given time. He said that some of his patients had discontinued certain treatments when they returned to Puerto Rico because the treatments were not covered by Medicaid there.
"Finally, you'll get all the tender loving care and chicken soup your mother will provide," Dr. Torres said, "but you won't get the medical treatment you need."
Dr. John V. Rullan, director of Puerto Rico's Office of AIDS Affairs and Communicable Diseases, said that a network of seven AIDS clinics that opened in late 1990 adequately serves the island's H.I.V.-infected population, which is estimated at 40,000. The clinics provide, free of charge, uniform medical care and psychosocial services throughout Puerto Rico and currently see 5,000 men, women and children, he said.
"If they gave me more money I'd do more," Dr. Rullan said, "but let nobody be mistaken that we can't take care of our people and have to send them to New York."
 
Model for Other Cities
 In New York City, the pilot program prepared by the New York State AIDS Institute and commonwealth officials will involve agencies that already work with visiting, H.I.V.-infected Puerto Ricans, like the Hispanic AIDS Forum and St. Vincent's and Bronx-Lebanon hospitals. Barry Gordon, regional AIDS coordinator for the U.S. Public Health Service in New York City, said that, if successful, the new offices could be replicated in other cities with large Puerto Rican communities, like Hartford and Philadelphia.
Health officials and advocates for people with AIDS in both Puerto Rico and New York say that, although services have improved tremendously in the last year, the demand still overwhelms the island's resources. Jorge Irizarry, a member of Act Up, an advocacy group for people with AIDS, in Puerto Rico, talked about the short supply of medicines for certain conditions. "Some people give false addresses to register in different clinics," he said, "so that they can get all the medicines they need."
Those who have the money to pay for medication and private doctors themselves or through insurance still find on the mainland preventive treatments and experimental drugsnot found on the island, advocates for people with AIDS say. Many patients who leave Puerto Rico wait until the final stages of the disease to return.
Dr. Jaime Rivera Dueno, executive director of the San Juan AIDS Institute, a nonprofit organization that treats AIDS patients, says that the number of H.I.V.-infected Puerto Ricans coming back now seems greater than the number who leave. Between 1989 and last year, the institute alone counted 64 patients from New York and New Jersey, which also has a large Puerto Rican population.
 
Back Again
 "Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more patients in such a poor state that the families are not prepared to deal with them," he said.
Luis C., 36, says he has gone back to Puerto Rico at least 15 times since he moved to Newark in 1988, drawn by a 12-year-old daughter and a supportive family. The last time, he gave away his furniture and said goodbye to friends in New Jersey, planning to stay in Puerto Rico for good. But a month later, a painful bout with herpes zoster, or shingles, a viral infection common among people infected with H.I.V., drove him back to Newark. He spoke on condition that his full name not be used.
"In Puerto Rico they treated it like an allergy," he said, noting he went to a municipal hospital in a small town of the island. "Here, the doctor needs only to look at my face to say, 'You're staying in the hospital today.' "
But Puerto Ricans with H.I.V. have to overcome a number of hurdles once they arrive on the mainland. Medicaid is not available until they have established residency for at least 30 days, New York State health officials say. Often, they must negotiate the maze of AIDS services by themselves because there are very few AIDS community organizations specifically serving Hispanic people.
But on the mainland, Puerto Ricans with H.I.V. say, along with better treatment, they find less stigma and a more organized advocacy community. Luis Alberto Lopez, who said he also felt more acceptance as a gay man, said he was inevitably drawn to AIDS work.
 
A Longing for Home
 A computer data operator, Mr. Lopez is participating in a trial of a drug intended to bolster his immune system. He is preparing himself for the upcoming international AIDS conference in Amsterdam.
"It helps a lot to be active," Mr. Lopez, who has become a member of Act Up, said. "It keeps you alive and it keeps you informed."
But even now, after nearly three years, he remains homesick.
"As soon as the AIDS cure comes, I'd move down there," he said. "I always hope to return."

HEADLINE: Francis Fitzpatrick, 89, Mayor And Party Leader in New Jersey

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Francis G. Fitzpatrick, whose elections as the insurgent Mayor of Bayonne, N.J., and as Hudson County Democratic chairman signaled the demise of an old-line political machine 20 years ago, died on Friday at Bayonne Hospital. He was 89 years old and lived in Bayonne.
He died of cancer, a family spokesman said. 
 A longtime independent Democrat, Mr. Fitzpatrick was a leader in the move to oust the corruption-riddled party organization, overturning half a century of domination by two legendary political bosses, Frank Hague and John V. Kenny.
Mr. Fitzpatrick's election as the director of the Hudson County Board of Freeholders in 1951 was an early setback to the party regulars, but they regained control and ousted him.
Later he became the Commissioner of Bayonne, the city's top post, then led a campaign to change the city's form of government to a strong mayoralty. He won the first election for the new mayor's post and served from 1962 through 1974. During his terms, urban renewal projects and a new City Hall were built, and the city's finances were stabilized.
 
Appointed to State Post
 The final blow to the old regime came with Mayor Fitzpatrick's selection as chairman of the county party from 1972 through 1974. He won the job as an ally of Paul T. Jordan, the young Mayor of Jersey City, in a reform coalition.
But soon then two strong-minded mayors had a falling out. Their feud and power struggle was resolved only when Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed Mr. Fitzpatrick chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
He served in the state post from 1975 to 1984, and during his tenure the turnpike agency reached record highs in use and record lows in traffic fatalities.
A tough advocate who relished the rough-and-tumble of politics, he called the state Democratic chairman a liar in 1972 and, citing losses in statewide contests, demanded his ouster. The chairman, Salvatore A. Bontempo, declined to comply. Even after Mr. Fitzpatrick assumed his state post, he kept his hand in local political disputes.
Born in Brooklyn, he moved to Bayonne as a youngster and never left. He worked days in oil refineries while studying at night. He graduated from John Marshall College in 1927 and earned his law degree there in 1930. He began working as an administrator in Bayonne government, then went into private law practice in the 1940's.
First elected a freeholder in 1945, he served on that board through 1951.
He was the Bayonne Commissioner from 1959 to 1962.
Surviving are his wife of 57 years, the former Marion Tierney; a son, F. Gerald, of Bayonne, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Timing Is Good for a Big New York City Offering

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
New York City is scheduled to sell more than $1 billion in new tax-exempt securities this week, when conditions in the credit markets for the city appear better than at any time since the late 1980's.
The ripple effect of Olympia & York Ltd.'s bankruptcy filing in Canada is the only potential problem for the city's offering, but it is not expected to be a serious one. 
 As the city's biggest commercial landlord and one of its largest taxpayers, the company owes more than $140 million in property tax payments.
 
Confident About Payment
 With a tax payment of about $75 million due on July 1, city and company officials said last week that options had been explored about whether some or all of that payment might be delayed.
But city officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed confidence late last week that payments would continue to be made and pointed out that relative to the $7 billion to $8 billion in property taxes the city collects each year, Olympia & York's contribution is fairly small.
Analysts tended to agree. And the real estate giant's problems had no effect on prices being quoted on the new bonds late last week.
"When people file for bankruptcy their property taxes continue to be paid," said Colleen Woodell, a senior vice president at Fitch Investors Service.
Nevertheless, city officials conceded that the issue had been raised at meetings with investors late last week.
"Questions came up relative to this," one city official said. "But we don't anticipate this as being a major problem. Their properties are fully leased, and their property tax payments are current."
On Friday, participants in the municipal bond market said the new bonds were quoted at yields ranging up to a maximum of 7.35 percent on securities maturing from 2013 to 2022.
However minimal the impact of Olympia & York's problems on the city's finances may prove to be, the company's bankruptcy filing nonetheless is a complication that City Hall apparently did not contemplate when it announced last week that it was moving up the bond sale to late May from July, as originally scheduled.
 
Period of Low Supply
 After being in a free fall for the better part of three years, the economy seems to be bottoming out. Interest rates on outstanding New York City securities are at their lowest levels in more than two years. And New York State, an important competitor for tax-exempt investment funds, has not been to market with a new issue in some time.
"There has been a dearth of issues," the city official said. "That is a reason why we are coming to market at this time. We also think we are managing well in a difficult time."
Although New York's financial condition appears to have stabilized, municipal bond market participants said the decline in yields on the city's bonds had more to do with underlying market trends than with greater comfort among investors about the city's prospects.
For two years, "there has been a compaction in rates," the head of one municipal bond desk at a New York investment bank said. "And anytime yields come down, people start reaching for paper that has lower ratings."
Currently, yield differentials between A- and AAA-rated municipal bonds are as narrow as 15 basis points to 20 basis points, the investment banker said.
For New York City, whose bonds are rated A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc., the difference in yield over AAA-rated bonds is about 85 basis points.
Still, that is markedly better than the yield spread of 1.80 percentage points the market demanded on city bonds over AAA-rated securities at the depth of New York's current financial crisis.
 
Fed Panel to Meet
 While Olympia & York's woes have the potential to cause unease among some buyers of New York City debt securities, analysts said its problems are not likely to influence decisions or debate at the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday, when members of the central bank's Open Market Committee are scheduled to meet.
Rather, policy makers will probably be more concerned with the overall health of the economy.
Some recent indicators suggest that the momentum established in the first two months of the year is waning.
Based on recent data, "the pattern suggests that the debate is about to shift from how rapid an acceleration is under way to whether growth is matching the relatively good first-quarter performance," James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, wrote in Data Watch, a weekly publication for clients.
Many analysts expect coming data, including a report expected on Tuesday on how the home-building industry fared last month, to reinforce the notion that the economy is losing steam.
But there are not yet enough signs to warrant a move by the Fed to cut interest rates, these analysts said. Rather, at the meeting a move to ease credit conditions will probably be approved, but not put into place for a few weeks.

HEADLINE: A Shot in the Arm for Health

 BODY:
Only 30 years ago, getting over measles, rubella or mumps was a rite of passage for American children. By 1983, however, vaccines had made these maladies rare. President Carter started a huge immunization initiative. Now President Bush has proposed another, to make up for callous economizing by the intervening Reagan Administration. In its eagerness to cut money from social services, it revived these highly contagious diseases.
During the Reagan years, the price of vaccine went up and Federal funding for childhood immunization went down. In 1987 Congress insisted on spending more, but that was too little and too late. By 1990, there were 26,520 cases of measles compared with 1,497 in 1983, and cases of mumps had nearly doubled. Rubella, too, was up, though not as much. 
 President Bush's current response is also too little. He initially asked for $259 million, which Congress wisely upped to $298 million. And the President said last June that he'd send a team of officials to six cities "to learn why kids aren't getting immunized." Health professionals already knew perfectly well why: too much red tape, and too little money. Now he is asking for $359 million and proposing ways to loosen the red tape. Even so, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that amount is $140 million short of adequate.
One dollar spent on immunization saves at least $20 in future medical costs -- and that doesn't include wages lost to the working parent who stays home with a sick child. Vaccinating the victims of Dallas's measles epidemic last spring, for instance, would have taken $45,000 in public funds. The costs of their illnesses are calculated at $1 million or more.
The Reagan Administration's cheese-paring on child health cost a lot of money and more than a few young lives. Mr. Bush's initiative is a step in the right direction, but not yet big enough.

'We Are Innocent'

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
If the Persian Gulf war promised a new era of collective responsibility, Yugoslavia heralds its early demise.
A television film clip from the Balkan war zone catches the future. Cradling her murdered child, a mother cries: "They are killing us, but we are innocent." 
There should be no mistaking the consequences of would-be peacemakers failing to stop this slaughter: The new world order will be like the old one. The most ruthless will feel free and be free to kill as they wish within their own borders -- in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Angola, Russia, China, name it.
 If Westerners wanted to be coldly realistic about the matter, they could adopt an attitude of limited tears. That is, there is simply too much misery everywhere for even the wealthy and courageous to combat. Western countries have their own problems and cannot cry for everyone.
That probably is the underlying feeling among most Americans, Europeans and Japanese. But conscience forbids such selfish realism. So Western governments are compelled to "do something" -- without spending much money or risking any lives. Thus the present approach of trying to pressure and isolate President Milosevic of Serbia and other Balkan killers. But these bad guys simply do not take outside peacemakers seriously. The United Nations, the European Community and the United States keep on threatening the killers with ever greater diplomatic and economic sanctions. And the killers just go on about their deadly business.
American and European diplomats have no illusions about this. They are trying to put up as good a front against the killers as they think their domestic politics will bear. And the diplomats want to do everything they can within those limits to bring Balkan leaders to their senses about the long-term consequences of murder and civil war.
That is why U.S. and European officials were dismayed last week when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ordered U.N. peacekeepers out of Bosnia and talked of withdrawing all U.N. forces from the region. It was a weak-kneed green light to the killers. And the Security Council voted quickly on Friday to correct this impression and reaffirm its peacekeeping mission. Yet the atmosphere at the U.N. is one of deep pessimism and resignation.
Everyone concerned with the Yugoslav problem knows there is only one decent chance to stop this horror: Peacemakers have to establish the only kind of credibility killers understand. They have to convince themselves, and then convince the Milosevics, that they are ready and able to use force.
European and American leaders have gone much too far in slamming the door shut on even the possibility of using force. It seemed gratuitous, for example, for the State Department to reiterate last week that the Administration was giving "no consideration" to armed intervention.
Public opinion in the West would not be happy about intervention, but would probably give leaders some leeway. The trick is for the leaders to find a military course of action that would not worry Westerners about an opened-ended ground war, yet still jar Balkan leaders.
It would be best if such military planning were authorized by the U.N. or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. But given the urgency of the situation, European nations and the U.S. have to be prepared to accept direct responsibility.
Above all Western leaders need to show resolution -- even if only to announce planning to keep the Serbian air force grounded or to bomb military airfields and bases.
The U.S. and the Europeans have to show at least this minimum level of seriousness. Anything less would be a moral and practical self-delusion.
However messy this situation, it is too easy to say nothing can be done to cool historical Balkan hatreds. Perhaps the West would not be so cool-headed if Christian Croats were being killed instead of Bosnian Muslims. Hand-wringing realism and resignation will not answer the cries of the innocent.
Post-cold-war ground rules for decency and humanity are being set in the Balkans today. The issue is whether they will be written by George Bush, Francois Mitterrand, John Major and Boris Yeltsin -- or by killers.

Buy Me Some Peanuts . . . and That's It

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE

 BODY:
Team executives have been blaming the cold spring weather across most of the country for major league baseball's drop in attendance so far this season, a dip of about 3 percent.
Another reason, however, could be the ever-rising cost forof a family of four to attend a game, now averaging $85.85. That figure comes from a survey by Team Marketing Report, a Chicago-based sports business publication, and it is 10 percent higher than last year. Why? A 12.3 percent rise in food and souvenirs, a 7.7 percent hike in ticket prices, all while the recession continues. 
 The cheapest one-day, four-person outing, $72.28, is inat Cincinnati; the most expensive is in Toronto, $112.83 (in United States dollarsmoney). Those figures include the prices of four seats, two beers, four hot dogs, four soft drinks, two souvenir caps, two programs and parking.

HEADLINE: $3 Billion Pledged For Business Loans By Bank of Boston

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 18

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston pledged today to make $3 billion available for new loans to businesses in New England. It was a sign of renewed confidence in the region's battered economy and an effort to increase the bank's own business.
With aggressive marketing, the bank plans to find new borrowers, especially among small and medium-size businesses that have been hit hard by the recession and companies in inner-city areas. 
 Ira Stepanian, the Bank of Boston's chairman and chief executive, said he hoped the availability of new loans would overcome widespread concern about a shortage of credit that has hampered the New England economy for three years. He estimated that the money would create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs. New business development, as well as a stronger economy would, in turn, help create more business for the bank.
To generate maximum publicity for the bank's policy and raise public confidence that banking in the six-state region is returning to normal, Mr. Stepanian and other bank officials, joined by area politicians, repeated the announcement in ceremonies today in three state capitals, Boston, Hartford and Providence, R.I.
In Boston, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d and Gov. William F. Weld took part in the announcement, with Mr. Weld saying, "This is a real mood-changer. I've been waiting for a long time for a day like this one."
In Hartford Gov. Lowell P. Weicker and Senator Christopher J. Dodd attended a ceremony, while in Providence, Gov. Bruce Sundlun and Senator John H. Chafee took part.
The $3 billion would represent a significant expansion in lending for the Bank of Boston, which made $800 million in new loans to businesses in New England last year, according to Ira Jackson, a senior vice president of the bank. The bank, the 21st-largest bank holding company in the United States and second-largest in New England, has $13 billion in total loans outstanding in New England, down more than 20 percent since the recession began here in 1989, Mr. Jackson said.
Under the bank's new initiative, bank officers will call on 25,000 businesses over seven months and visit 2,500 inner-city businesses. The number of loan officers will also be increased.
The latter move was not prompted by the riot in Los Angeles three weeks ago, Mr. Stepanian said, but was instead linked to the Bank of Boston's program to expand bank branches in minority areas of Boston, Hartford and Providence.
 
Collapse of 90 Banks
 Some economists were skeptical about how successful the Bank of Boston would be in attracting borrowers from small and medium-sized businesses, since much of its work in the past had been with larger companies. But Mr. Jackson said the market was there, adding that one branch in Waltham, Mass., received more than 100 phone calls this morning since the announcement.
Rates and terms for the loans under the new program will vary according to the size and type of loan, said Constance Hubbell, a spokeswoman for the Bank of Boston, and will not be specially reduced to attract customers.
In the last three years, New England has been hit by the worst economic slump since the Depression in the 1930's, losing 10 perecent of its jobs, said Andrew Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University here. Regionwide, employment fell to 5,334,000 in March from a peak of 5,966,000 in February 1989, Mr. Sum said, using figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
During that time, 90 banks failed in New England, not counting savings and loans, many saddled with bad real estate loans made during the boom years of the mid-1980's, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. As bad loans multiplied throughout the banking system, even healthy banks had large losses and became much more cautious in lending, even to customers with excellent records, prompting outcries from many businesses that no credit was available.
Mr. Sum, like other economists here, believes that the New England economy has stopped losing jobs and that there are some modest encouraging signs, like a small rise in homes sales, automobile sales and help wanted ads, along with an improvement in consumer confidence. But New England has not yet started recovering, he said.
 
'All the Help We Can Get'
 "So we can use all the help we can get," Mr. Sum said, referring to today's announcement by the Bank of Boston.
Economists say a number of other banks in New England have also started loaning money again as they returned to profitability in late 1991, though with less fanfare than the Bank of Boston's action today. A key turning point, several said, was an agreement between the region's three largest banks earlier this month to jointly loan $120 million for the construction of a new arena to replace the old Boston Garden, the home of the Boston Celtics basketball team and the Boston Bruins hockey team.
One factor behind the Bank of Boston's announcement today, several of the economists said, may simply have been concern that as the region's banks returned to profitability and have money to loan again, many businesses have grown cautious and are financing themselves out of cash flow, not taking out new loans.
Frederick Breimyer, the president of the New England Economic Project, a group of regional economists, said the Bank of Boston's action today was unusual in its scale and the publicity it generated. "Its symbolic value is very encouraging," he said.
But Mr. Breimyer warned that "turning the economy around is a longer-term proposition, with a lot more work to be done," than just making some loans, however extensive.
In making the announcement, Mr. Stepanian said: "We wanted to send a message that we are out there and we want to make loans. We felt we just haven't been getting the message across with all the talk of a credit crunch."
Mr. Stepanian acknowledged that the recession had caused the Bank of Boston to reduce its lending. "For a while, this caused us and others in the industry to focus inward and solve our own problems, making us less responsive to the needs of businesses," he said.
The bank experienced large losses in 1990 and 1991, but it has now enjoyed three successive quarters of profitability, putting it in position to resume its regular lending, said Mr. Jackson, the bank vice president.
The Bank of Boston is a superregional bank holding company, whose subsidiaries include The First National Bank of Boston, Casco Northern Bank in Maine, Bank of Boston Connecticut, Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank and Bank of Vermont.

HEADLINE: Thailand's Military Is Seen As Grasping Spoils of Power

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Throughout the 1980's, as Thailand's economy boomed, an exhilarating sense of change began to infuse the new middle class that was quickly putting its civilian stamp on the social and political life of the country. At every intellectual gathering where tomorrow's Thailand was discussed, one theme was heard: The days of coups and dictatorships are over; the army will have to play by political rules.
Today, many young, middle-class Thais were on the streets of Bangkok facing an army willing to destroy a dream so as to maintain its hold not only on political power but also on the economic spoils of near-absolute authority. 
 To the army, civilian rule in Thailand is a threat to the privileges that have made generations of colonels and generals rich. It would jeopardize their immunity from prosecution in corrupt and sometimes criminal acts, Thai political scientists say. It would sooner or later remove them from the boards and directors' chairs of major industries.
 
Civilian Corruption Cited
 It could end their involvement in a host of nefarious trades, including narcotics. A former high official of a nearby Asian country once recounted how he sat at regional conferences on heroin trafficking with Thai offciers he knew were involved in transporting drugs from the Golden Triangle area, the world's largest center of opium production.
"They were very, very greedy," said Sulak Sivaraksa, a leading Thai Buddhist intellectual, who was forced into exile in the West this year after he accused Thai military leaders of playing a major role in stripping the tropical hardwood forests of Thailand, Burma and, most recently, Cambodia, for personal gain.
Thai military leaders counter such charges by saying civilian politicans have often been very corrupt. They used that argument when they overthrew Prime Minister Chatchai Choonavan in Feburary 1991.
Diplomats in the region say the Thai military is the channel through which the Khmer Rouge raise money by selling Cambodian natural resources, gemstones as well as timber.
Mr. Sulak said today that the tragedy was that it did not have to come to this. "They could have made enough money without a coup," he said, referring to the 1991 army takeover.
Since taking charge of the country in the 1930's under the guise of a constitutional monarchy, the Thai military, always friendly to the United States and largely successful in promoting an image of respectability to the outside world, has escaped the international opprobrium heaped on military rulers in Pakistan, Indonesia or Bangladesh.
But behind the civilian veneer of Thai life, the country has long history of violence and warlordism.
Thailand was never colonized because successive Siamese dynasties were able to keep neighboring armies and distant colonial powers at bay through a combination of military strength and diplomatic dexterity.
By the 19th century, the center of institutional life had coalesced around a strong royal family, the Chakri dynasty, which began to modernize the country.
After the monarchy's powers were curtailed by the military in the 1930's -- at the same time that Thailand replaced Siam as the country's official name and the nation began to flirt with European fascism -- the army devised a strategy of using the immense moral power of the King as a cloak for its own authority. Crimes against the honor of the King -- lese-majeste -- became the most henious of offenses, punishable by long imprisonment or death.
But such charges were often lodged, as they have now been against Mr. Sulak, to curb dissent.

HEADLINE: Haiti Dispute: Limits on U.S.;
Other Concerns Appear To Block Strong Action

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Although the Bush Administration continues to insist that it seeks a speedy restoration of democracy in Haiti, the policy appears to be hobbled by domestic political concerns and a reluctance to risk confrontation with Latin America and Europe over a naval blockade or other direct intervention.
President Bush's unwillingness to raise the stakes in dealing with the Haitian military leadership that overthrew the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30 is puzzling to some members of Congress and area experts. They say that by breaking the political impasse and ending a regional embargo the Administration would also serve its goal of stanching the flow of refugees once again heading in large numbers toward American shores. 
 "We are rapidly reaching the point where the hardest question will need to be posed," said Robert Pastor, a Latin America specialist who served on the National Security Council under President Carter. "Is it humane to starve this country indefinitely with no realistic strategy for restoring a constitutional system?
"It would be criminal for the inter-American community to walk away from Haiti, but unless it does more soon, it may be compelled to do less," Mr. Pastor, now a professor at Emory University, said in an interview today.
In dealing with the crisis in Haiti, as with Peru, Administration officials say they prefer to give the lead role to the Organization of American States, an international body with no enforcement arm and a long record of avoiding direct confrontation.
 
Ships Arrive Regularly
 Steps taken by a special O.A.S. ministerial meeting this weekend in the Bahamas, including the withholding of visas for coup supporters and the barring from hemispheric ports of ships trading with Haiti, do not go far beyond policies already adopted unilaterally by the United States.
Requests to European nations to stop doing business with Haiti fall short of formal demands for adherence to a regional embargo, although crucial supplies are reaching Haiti regularly on European vessels. The Europeans say that economic sanctions against Haiti would violate the Lome Convention governing their aid to the world's poorest nations.
A blockade of Haiti is considered unworkable and unwise, Administration officials say, because the ships that would be stopped first would almost inevitably be European. The Administration is now trying to work with European leaders on tackling problems in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and a confrontation over Haiti would introduce strains.
The O.A.S. called for an economic embargo within hours of the Sept. 30 coup. But when the military leadership in Haiti demonstrated that it would not buckle under economic pressure or abide by a political compromise worked out by Father Aristide and the O.A.S. in February, the 37-member hemispheric organization ducked consideration of a regional peacekeeping force as well a blockade.
Creation of an international force to intervene in the Haitian standoff is not advocated by Father Aristide, who says that he does not want to be restored to power on the shoulders of foreign troops.
In interviews, the exiled President has said that the United States has enough political muscle to intimidate the usurpers of his office without the use of force. He recalls how American intervention forced Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in 1986 and Gen. Prosper Avril a few years later.
 
'Pro Forma Statements'
 But on visits to Washington, Father Aristide is never given the public attention by the White House or State Department that would send a strong message to the Haitian military. In mid-March, he spent nearly a week in Washington without meeting with a high Adminstration official.
"What we get here are almost daily pro forma statements from both the State Department and White House that we are for the restoration of Aristide," said Larry Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a private policy group. "But these are almost bloodless, mechanical statements not reflected in political initiatives."
In Congress, there has been a widespread belief that President Bush has been told by political advisers that any controversial action on Haiti could have a negative effect on business leaders who have invested in Haiti at the urging of Republican Administrations eager to make the Caribbean a showcase for private enterprise. Existing embargo rules already have been bent to allow American-owned industries to continue functioning in Haiti.
The second group of influential voters who have been judged to be opposed to both Haitian immigration and deeper involvement in Haiti's political crisis are the Cuban-Americans of southern Florida. Throughout Latin America, diplomats say, the Haitians are regarded as people with a language and culture that are closer to Africa than to most people in the Americas.
Black Congressional leaders say that the Bush Administration is equally indifferent to Haitians' suffering in their homeland and the refugees risking their lives to leave it.
"Bush's silence on Haiti is deafening," Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said in a recent interview. Mr. Conyers has been a strong supporter of Father Aristide and an advocate of granting "safe haven" to Haitian exiles.
He added, "I am outraged at the policy, which has become as bankrupt as Reagan's 'constructive engagement' was in South Africa."

GRILLED CHICKEN FOR GIULIANI
Rudolph W.

 After two flamboyant false starts, Donald J.

But Riverside South will almost surely be the most talked-about development effort in New York City this year, given its sheer size and the fact that it comes at a time of near-paralysis in construction.

A major racketeering-murder trial opened with a prosecutor accusing the defendant, Vittorio Amuso, of being a brutal Mafia boss who ordered nine murders "in a reign of terror." A defense lawyer responded that the charges were "completely unsubstantiated" and that the prosecutors were relying on testimony from "two psychopathic killers." B3.

At Town Hall in West Haven, Conn., employees are reeling from the dismissal of one-fourth of the city's 300 workers, and officials are furiously trying to balance the budget of a town whose economic woes forced it to submit to state control. The town's recent history is a cautionary tale of how a proud working-class community can abruptly slide from apparent economic well-being to the brink of insolvency. B6.

In the opening G.O.P. salvo against Democrats in the United States Senate campaign, the chairman of New York State's Republican party said that State Attorney General Robert Abrams had ignored or covered up "substantial evidence of drug trafficking and drug use" by one of his senior deputies. Mr. Abrams, one of four Democrats seeking the Senate nomination, denied the allegations, which he called groundless. B6.

HEADLINE: Trial Testimony Is Begun In Killing of Yale Student

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 18

 BODY:
 Testimony began today in the murder trial of a New Haven youth accused of shooting a Yale student during a robbery last year and leaving him to die outside a church. It was the first slaying of a Yale student in New Haven since 1974.
The police say that the accused youth, James Fleming Jr., 17 years old, was driving around the city with friends looking for someone to rob when he set upon Christian Prince, 19, a Yale sophomore from Chevy Chase, Md., on Feb. 17, 1991. 
 The killing led to stringent new campus security measures. It also highlighted racial tensions and town-gown problems facing Yale and other schools with inner-city campuses.
Yale is situated on the fringe of tough, impoverished New Haven neighborhoods, and economic contrasts between those neighborhoods and the university can seem stark. The city's per-capita income in 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are available, was $10,702, less than half what a Yale undergraduate pays in tuition for one year.
Yale students are aware of these contrasts and of the anger of some inner-city residents; even before Mr. Prince was killed, they were often reluctant to walk alone on city streets.
 
Statement Is Retracted
 The New Haven police say that Mr. Fleming and some of his companions set out to rob "a cracker" -- a derogatory term for a white person -- on the night Mr. Prince was slain. A police report said Mr. Fleming told an accomplice, "I ought to shoot the cracker" before firing at Mr. Prince.
The prosecution's case centers on a 31-page statement from Randy Fleming, who is not related to James Fleming.
According to the police, Randy Fleming said that he, James Fleming and two other youths saw Mr. Prince walking down the street as they were riding in a car, looking for someone to rob. He said he watched as James Fleming put a gun to Mr. Prince's head, took his wallet, then taunted him and hit him in the face with the weapon. Mr. Fleming then took a step back, according to the account, and shot Mr. Prince in the chest.
But six weeks after he gave the police this statement, Randy Fleming said in court that he made up this account because the police had threatened to charge him, as well, with murder if he did not cooperate.
During jury selection, James Fleming's lawyer, Frank Iannotti, a special public defender, asked a potential juror about his reaction to the verdict in the Rodney King case in California. He asked several other potential jurors about their feelings toward blacks. The jury that was selected has one black person among its 12 members.
 
Body Is Discovered
 During testimony today in New Haven Superior Court, James Van Bergen, who was a Yale drama school student in 1991, recounted driving down Hillhouse Avenue shortly after 1 A.M. and discovering Mr. Prince "lying spread-eagled on his back" at the base of the steps of St. Mary's Church.
Josh McHugh, a friend of Mr. Prince's, testified that he was with him at a campus party that night, which they left about 1 A.M. Mr. McHugh testified that Mr. Prince, a member of the lacrosse team, said he had to go home because he wanted to be rested for practice the next morning.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Jackson Asks His Party to Pay Attention to the Poor and the Cities

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, May 18

 BODY:
Accusing both political parties of being unresponsive to the crisis in the cities and the pain of the poor, the Rev. Jesse Jackson challenged the Democratic Party today to "renew its commitment to people in need."
If Mr. Jackson is able to energize the Democrats' most liberal wing, it could complicate the effort of Gov. Bill Clinton, the party's likely Presidential nominee, to unify the party behind a set of moderate positions and to run a nominating convention in July without a division over policy. Throughout the campaign this year, the Arkansas Governor and his supporters have tried to appeal to the middle class and have paid less attention to the needs of the poor than Democrats have in the past. 
 In testimony before the party's platform committee, which held a daylong hearing here today, and at a news conference afterward, Mr. Jackson refused to criticize Mr. Clinton directly and promised to endorse his party's candidate in the general election.
But Mr. Jackson's target was unmistakable. He urged those preparing the party's platform not to "go with the flow on capital punishment" or "walk soft on right-to-work laws," and he complained that the party's "most visible leadership did not answer the call" and show up for the march in Washington on Saturday in support of more Federal aid for cities.
Mr. Clinton supports capital punishment, a position Mr. Jackson called immoral. The Arkansas Governor has never seriously tried to overturn his state's law outlawing closed-shop union contracts, and he did not march on Saturday.
Mr. Clinton's supporters who testified today, including Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Robert Shapiro, one of Mr. Clinton's chief economic advisers, urged the platform committee to adopt a set of moderate stands, including a tax cut of about $300 a person for the middle class and a variety of tax breaks to stimulate business investment. They said little about the poor and the cities.
 
Concern for the Middle Class
 In the party's rush to soak the rich, Senator Breaux cautioned, Democrats should "make sure we don't drown the middle class."
Mr. Jackson, by contrast, said the country's problems would not be solved "by tax gimmicks or $300 gift certificates."
Many politicians are contemptuous of party platforms, noting that Presidents rarely feel bound by them once elected.
Still, even if platforms in America do not carry the weight they do in some parliamentary democracies, they serve to distinguish the guiding principles of the parties.
The Democratic platform this year, for example, is sure to support legalized abortion, guaranteed medical insurance for all Americans, new Federal spending for education and public works and a commitment to end homelessness. None of those planks are likely to appear in the Republican platform.
Over the years, Democratic platform fights have led to walkouts, even riots, but Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, said he thought this year would be different: "We're free of the kind of ideological splits that have plagued us in previous cycles."
Mr. Brown and other Democrats are hoping that it will be the Republican Party, sharply divided over abortion, where an ideological rift will be most apparent this year. The Republican platform committee will have a hearing on the issue in Salt Lake City next week.
But the abortion question arose here today when Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania urged Democrats to modify their usual plank supporting abortions without restrictions. Governor Casey argued that the position had hurt the party's Presidential candidates in the past.
Mr. Casey seemed to have relatively little support among party leaders. Mr. Brown said after the Governor's testimony, "I thought his view was not in concert with a majority of Democrats or a majority of the American people."
Mr. Brown, who was Mr. Jackson's convention manager four years ago, brushed off Mr. Jackson's challenge today as immaterial to party unity. Others said they could not tell yet whether Mr. Jackson intended to roil the waters.
The platform will be drafted at sessions in Washington and Santa Fe, N.M., next month and then will be submitted for a vote to the Democratic National Convention in New York in July.
In 1984 and 1988, when Mr. Jackson won large blocks of delegates in the primaries, he had significant influence on the platform. Four years ago, for instance, planks on South Africa, drug policy and voter registration, among others, were written at his insistence, and he caused debates on the convention floor on such touchy issues as tax policy and self-determination for Palestinians.
This year, of course, he did not run in the primaries and has no delegates, although he maintains a good deal of support among Democratic voters, particularly blacks.

HEADLINE: An Empire Run Amid Rice Paddies

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YUJIANG, China

 BODY:
Retailers in bankruptcy? A crumbling real estate market? A global recession? The problems might as well be happening on Mars, as far as Zhang Guoxi is concerned.
While gnarled old peasants slog barefoot behind water buffaloes in the rice paddies here, Mr. Zhang, apparently China's richest private businessman, has found a better way to make a living. 
 A balding 39-year-old who dropped out of school after the sixth grade, Mr. Zhang runs an international business empire based on furniture exports, property development and stock trading from his 10-story corporate headquarters, which juts above the paddies. From this remote country town he has emerged as an entrepreneur with assets worth tens of millions of dollars.
 
Defining the Limits
 Mr. Zhang (whose full name is pronounced JAHNG gwaw-shee) is one of the best measures of how much capitalism the Communist authorities are prepared to tolerate in their drive for national prosperity. For 15 years, he has more or less defined the frontier of what can be tolerated, and despite the hardline oratory from Beijing in the last few years, he continues to thrive.
"Sure, I live very well," he said, grinning, when he was asked how many homes he owns. "Very well!"
After a pause, he added with a mischievous gleam in his eye: "So I should say, 'Long live Comrade Xiaoping!' " The reference was to Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old paramount Chinese leader, who since January has led a new drive to carry out further capitalist-style changes in the economy.
In a society where peasants earn cash incomes of about $150 a year, Mr. Zhang is rich in a way that can scarcely be fathomed, rich in a way that the Rockefellers are rich. He sips Remy Martin cognac, and he has a chauffeur-driven car waiting for him in each city where he has an office. The state even provides him with his own police station of a dozen officers solely to protect his company and serve as his bodyguards.
Mr. Zhang may be leading the pack, but there are many other business tycoons emerging across China, capturing the spirit of the times. In the 1970's, many Chinese wanted to be revolutionary; today, they want to be rich. Most private businesses are only about a dozen years old, but they are expanding rapidly and branching across the nation and even the world. By the end of the century, China's private industrialists may be far more numerous and powerful than they are today.
"Deng Xiaoping has always said that China should let some people get rich first and let these people pull the economy along," said Christine Wong, an associate professor of economics at the University of California at Santa Cruz. "Now that Deng Xiaoping has reasserted his dominance in trying to formulate economic policy, I expect that things will look up for people like that."
Already the wealth and power that Mr. Zhang has gathered are jarring, partly because his base is not Beijing or Shanghai, but this small county seat of Yujiang in Jiangxi Province. Jiangxi is a poor, landlocked area that early in the century was a Communist guerrilla base. Most of the buildings around Yujiang are dilapidated brick homes with propaganda slogans proclaiming "Socialism is Good!" or calling on people to have just one child.
 
Touches of Modernity
 Mr. Zhang's corporate headquarters rises abruptly from these surroundings, 10 stories of gleaming modernity with international direct dialing and fax service, in a sprawling compound that also includes a goldfish pond and two marble arches -- "I'm an artist, after all," he explained. His buildings have their own slogans, but they are not political: "Guard against fires!" the banners warn.
Financial success carries political risks in China, and for that reason Mr. Zhang prefers to refer to his enterprise not as "privately run" but as "people run." But he does not dispute that his company is privately owned -- after all it is called the Guoxi Group, named after him -- and Government ministries have publicly referred to it as a private company.
Mr. Zhang is also discreet enough to dodge questions about his personal spending habits and about his net worth, but he finally acknowledges that $30 million or more might be a good estimate.
"More or less, more or less," he repeats, each time accenting the word "more."
 
Some Special Skills
 Entrepreneurs in China often run into trouble with grasping officials, who arbitrarily impose huge taxes or who force the owner to sell to the Government. Mr. Zhang has had few such problems, and his methods offer a window into the skills that business tycoons need to succeed in China.
One of the most crucial skills is cultivation of Government and Communist Party officials, a task that the gregarious Mr. Zhang assumes with ease. He is a good friend of the provincial governor and of county officials, and he has contributed more than $1.5 million in recent years to local charities and public causes.
"He is a good party member and an excellent businessman," Gov. Wu Guanzheng said of Mr. Zhang at a recent public meeting. "For many years he has loved the party and the people, and done many good deeds."
The latest good deed -- and the purpose of the meeting -- was Mr. Zhang's contribution of $200,000 to endow a new Zhang Guoxi Education Foundation. Everything he contributes to seems to bear his name: the Zhang Guoxi Big Bridge is being completed to link Yujiang with the other side of a broad river.
"Boss, three cars can pass at a time on the bridge, no problem!" Luo Genshen, the head of the construction team, says obsequiously as Mr. Zhang stands in the middle of the bridge and inspects the work. After asking a few questions, Mr. Zhang returns to his Nissan Cedrick to be chauffeured to his next spot on a round of inspections.
 
Providing Services
 Mr. Zhang also helped pay to bring running water and international telephone service to Yujiang. In addition, he contributed the only other structures in Yujiang that rival his headquarters in height: a television relay tower to improve local reception and a seven-story science tower at the local school.
Perhaps because of the philanthropy, local officials regard Mr. Zhang as a great hero rather than an evil capitalist. "We hope that more Zhang Guoxis will emerge!" The Jiangxi Daily News declared in a front-page headline. And local Communist Party officials have formally called on the entire community to "learn from Comrade Zhang Guoxi."
In some parts of China, including Beijing, Communist Party organizations have officially banned wealthy entrepreneurs from joining the party. But Mr. Zhang joined the party in 1972, long before he struck it rich, and he not only remains in the party but serves as party boss of his enterprise group, while also holding down the posts of chairman and general manager.
Zhang Guoxi's name means fruit of happiness, because at birth he was only a bit more than four pounds, the size of a small fruit. His mother died when he was 2, and after finishing elementary school he dropped out and began work as a carpenter. A few years later, in 1973, he sold his family home for $250 and used the money to start his company.
Initially, the company made carved wooden chests, when it was not fighting off criticisms and investigations by Communist Party ideologues who denounced it as the "tail of capitalism."
 
Recalling Rough Times
 "I'm fine now, and people see me going abroad and praised in the papers, and so on," Mr. Zhang said soberly. "But back in 1973 to 1977, it was really rough and I was often hungry. If I told you about those years, you'd be in tears."
After Mr. Deng came to power in 1978, the company prospered and began to export the wooden chests and other carved furniture to Japan. Then it branched into the manufacture of gold-plated Buddhist altars, which in Japan sell for about $10,000 each.
As business grew, Mr. Zhang opened offices in three Chinese cities, as well as Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and Germany. The Guoxi Group became a general international trading company, with interests ranging from stock trading in Hong Kong to Chinese restaurants in Germany. The company is about to open a new trading office in Thailand and is building a nine-story hotel in the southern Chinese resort of Sanya.

HEADLINE: PERUVIAN PLEDGES DEMOCRATIC RULE

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASSAU, the Bahamas, May 18

 BODY:
President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru told foreign ministers of the Organization of Amerian States today that he would restore democratic rule in his country within five months by holding elections for a constituent assembly to replace the Congress he dissolved on April 5.
Mr. Fujimori, whose appearance at the O.A.S. general assembly here was arranged only Sunday on the meeting's eve, urged the hemispheric organization not to isolate his country for its breach of constitutional rule, but instead to support the sweeping changes he has proposed for Peru's crisis-ridden political system. 
 In a 25-minute speech peppered with harsh attacks on the country's traditional political parties, Mr. Fujimori called for a sort of direct democracy that he said would include a new constitution, broad publication of Government initiatives, public referendums and direct popular election to political office, instead of closed party-controlled slates.
"In no more than five months we will see the establishment of a democratic constitutional congress, including the direct representatives of the people," Mr. Fujimori said. "With this, Peru will have achieved full constitutional legitimacy."
 
'Hidden Dictatorships'
 Mr. Fujimori described Peru's political parties, which he campaigned against as a maverick candidate for President in 1991, as "hidden dictatorships." He vowed not to prohibit the parties, but said his proposals called for "direct participation of the citizenry instead of the traditional elitist dialogue of party chieftains and union bosses."
In a seeming retreat from more defiant positions taken in previous discussions with foreign diplomats since he seized extraordinary powers, Mr. Fujimori coupled his call for new elections with an invitation to the O.A.S. "to participate with us in this process" by advising on electoral procedures and furnishing official observers.
In an initial indication of the reception of his proposals, the foreign ministers and other O.A.S. delegates gave Mr. Fujimori's speech only the politest of applause. Several diplomats said that while they were encouraged by several of the promised measures, especially the vote for a new constituent assembly, they remained troubled by the vigor with which he attacked traditional political parties.
"It was a shocker, but we are going to have to swallow it," a United States official said, adding that details of Mr. Fujimori's proposals, once available, would have to be carefully examined. "He moved a fair bit, but he can't admit that he has moved a fair bit. That's where the tension is."
Before Mr. Fujimori's address, another senior United States official said that "if the Peruvians want U.S. assistance, it's going to take a lot of movement on their part." After hearing the speech, the same official expressed uncertainty over whether Mr. Fujimori's presentation would prove sufficient to help restore normal relations.
 
'Some Rigidity' Remains
 Barbara J. McDougall, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, expressed similar ambivalence. After noting that the Peruvian leader had come closer to fulfilling demands for a restoration of democratic rule, Ms. McDougall said, "There is still some rigidity in his approach."
The United States canceled $167 million in aid to Peru after Mr. Fujimori's suspension of the Constitution and closure of Parliament. Although he made no direct reference to that aid, Mr. Fujimori repeatedly suggested that his country required international financial help to fight a leftist insurgency and the illicit traffic in coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. Peru is the world's largest producer of coca.
Mr. Fujimori's decision to make an extraordinary address to the O.A.S. followed strong measures taken by the organization, including a hemisphere-wide ban on trade, in an effort to reverse the coup last September that ousted the elected President of Haiti.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Gets That G.M. Feeling

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
For General Motors, yesterday wound up the sales pitch of a lifetime. Its short video presentation, which it displayed around the country, was a smooth one. Fresh-faced adolescents and bare-bottomed babies grinned from the seats of G.M. cars. Happy customers breezed by in their Cadillacs and Chevrolets.
But this time the world's largest auto maker was not selling cars and trucks, it was selling itself, in the form of the largest stock offering by an American company. Later this week, G.M. plans to sell up to 57.5 million new shares of its common stock to raise $2.29 billion. The money will dress up G.M.'s battered balance sheet and pay for everything from new-car development to new tools and equipment. 
 In terms of size, the next-ranked such deal by an American institution was done by Conrail, the freight railroad, which raised $1.46 billion by selling stock in 1987.
"There hasn't been anything this important in a long time," said Robert H. Stovall, chairman of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers, a money management firm, and a longtime G.M. watcher. "This could set all kinds of records in terms of numbers of individual investors buying. It's a major event in the distribution of stock."
It is also the monster that dominates Wall Street. Almost every brokerage house in the country is trying to sell part of the offering, partly because the market is ripe for a stock sale of an icon of corporate America. But more significant is the fees.
Compared with the mega-fees booked from mergers in the 1980's, the G.M. underwriting fees may look modest. But if the sale is a complete success -- nearly everyone predicts it will be -- Wall Street's estimated cut will be anywhere from $69 million to $115 million. Offerings like this have fatter profit margins for brokers, providing a big incentive to sell the new shares. And best of all for investors, G.M. effectively pays the sales commission -- not the customer.
Since it announced its stock offering late last month, three teams of executives have hopscotched around the world to 17 cities, meeting with investment managers to pitch the stock and G.M.'s plan to nurse itself back to health after a record $4.5 billion loss last year.
In fact, two of G.M.'s private airplanes have been in constant use to help transport the well-rehearsed management team of 10, and their Morgan Stanley & Company investment bankers, from London to Hong Kong to Minneapolis to New York. Translators have rattled off the minutiae of earnings per share and car-platform renovations in English, Japanese and French.
More than 500 institutional salespeople at Morgan Stanley, which is leading the stock-sale effort, have called up investors around the world to pull A crowd to the road-show sessions, which ended yesterday with stops in Baltimore and Philadelphia.
In the end, though, the well-laid plans could be undone by the market's unpredictable cruelty. "It would screw them up if the market tanked from here," said Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service, an investment newsletter. "They could still get the deal done, but odds are they wouldn't want to."
So far, the stock market has been awaiting G.M. with open arms. The more cynical of analysts say they wish the auto maker could run its businesses as brilliantly as it has timed its stock offering, which stands to capitalize on the current market euphoria.
Indeed, the Dow Jones industrial average, of which G.M. is a component, has set a string of records in 1992. G.M. shares, which closed yesterday at $39.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 12.5 cents each, have risen 36 percent this year. The rising market gave G.M. a comparatively less expensive means of raising money, rather than borrowing it from banks or selling bonds.
G.M. may be savvy to exploit a market of willing investors, but it did not expect them to clamor for its shares without instituting radical changes. Analysts have little doubt that much of the corporate dressing-up of recent months -- plans to eliminate 74,000 jobs, close a score of plants and realign top management -- was in preparation for the offering. "The status quo was just not enough," said Tom Galvin, an auto analyst at C. J. Lawrence.
The preparations actually began three months ago when a team of G.M. and Morgan Stanley executives visited analysts at the powerful agencies that rate corporate debt. The ratings agencies' displeasure with G.M. has been no secret: only a month before the stock offering was announced, the Standard & Poor's Corporation downgraded G.M.'s senior debt to A-, from A. Companies perceived as high risks by ratings agenies pay higher interest rates for short-term borrowings.
A number of securities analysts believe the ratings agencies played the largest role of all in determining just how much stock G.M. needed to sell to bolster its capital base and its spnding plans. Neither the analysts, G.M. nor Morgan Stanley would publicly discuss that or other matters surrounding the offering because Securities and Exchange Commission rules restrict companies from promoting their stock before the price of the shares is set, which could happen as early as tonight.
Although G.M. has recently come to symbolize much that is amiss in Corporate America, analysts say it has displayed clear evidence that it is finally willing to make painful changes. Thus, investors might be willing to buy the shares on the hopes and dreams that a once-great American institution -- the nation's largest industrial corporation -- could turn around and become regularly profitable. G.M. is also buoyed by the fact that investors are eagerly buying shares of "cyclical" industrial companies whose fortunes improve as a recession ends.
As a household name, G.M. can also peddle its stock with relative ease to individual investors, who may feel quite comfortable buying shares of a company in a business they can understand. Further assisting the brokers is the simplicity of the deal itself. In contrast to the complicated financial science of the 80's, the G.M. offering is as basic as it gets: common stock. Said one analyst whose firm is selling G.M. shares, "The G.M. deal is a return to the way business used to be done -- conservatively."
But many an expert on the company makes a persuasive case that G.M. has been a loser that can stumble again. It is a troubled company, they say, and it has not delivered on past promises to improve. Analysts say the stock has been a huge disappointment, never climbing above its record price of $56.875 a share, set in 1965.
 
Individuals Seem Interested
 Several of the deal's eight underwriters are already seeing unexpectedly strong interest in the stock from individual investors, as opposed to large institutional buyers like pension funds and mutual funds. "This is the kind of stock you can beat the tom-tom on and sell in retail houses," said Mr. Stovall, the money manager. "They will pitch it as the American Dream -- the great turnaround and all that."
For individuals who already hold G.M. shares, though, the new stock is being issued at a high cost; the price of the existing shares dropped $2.75 each when the company announced on April 24 that it would offer the new stock.
For the deal to succeed, institutions will have to absorb more than half of the offering, experts say. And institutions have good reason to buy. G.M. shares are so widely held and so actively traded that they offer big investors the attraction of "liquidity" -- meaning they can easily and quickly sell their large holdings.
A second factor helping sell the deal to institutions has to do with the the way Wall Street pays favors. Institutional investors like to buy shares of large, liquid companies like G.M. in a stock offering, because they get to choose which brokerage firms will be assigned the commissions. Big institutions use those "selling concessions" as a way to pay brokerages back for things like research reports. "You can pay a lot of people in an offering like this," said one institutional buyer. "The G.M. deal is a political deal where you can take care of favors owed."
 
No Time Behind the Wheel
 As a longtime adviser to G.M., Morgan Stanley was a shoo-in for the business. Keeping to its conservative, white-shoe image, it advised the company to hold down the road show's razzle-dazzle. The meetings with money managers and analysts included none of the test-driving around race tracks that has accompanied other Detroit pitches to investors. At the New York presentation at the Helmsley Palace last week, for instance, G.M. management gave a largely subdued, businesslike presentation, with the exception of the polished video presentation.
G.M. executives tried their best, of course, to put the company's best face forward. They reiterated that G.M. expects its work force to be 20 percent smaller by 1995. Also, the G.M. board "recognized the importance of future dividend stability," said the chief financial officer, William E. Hoglund, hinting that the dividend, which was reduced last year to $1.60 a year, from $3, would not be eliminated.
Mr. Hoglund even suggested that cost savings would be an impressive $1 billion more than that outlined in the stock sale's prospectus. G.M. expects to cut $2 billion in material costs and $4 billion in labor expenses by 1995, he said. "Four plus two equals the $5 billion in the prospectus, which is how I got to be C.F.O.," he joked.
 
The Japanese Question
 Though the tone of the New York meeting was cordial, it hit a few predictable bumps. One money manager noted that several people in the room owned Japanese cars, and asked Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, how he hoped to compete with Japanese products for the loyalty of the group. ("I suppose they will shop and compare," Mr. Stempel said, and come to like G.M. cars.)
Another questioner took the issue further, asking, "Why should a customer go from a superior product to a slightly inferior product?" Mr. Stempel replied that the auto maker would not be satisfied "until we are the quality leader."
Whether that happens quickly enough to satisfy investors is yet to be seen. But under the glittering lights of two great crystal chandeliers at the Helmsley last week, it was difficult for some to forget that G.M. has a long way to go before it presents its new corporate model to the world.

HEADLINE: West Haven Reels From Layoffs

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HAVEN, Conn., May 14

 BODY:
With sunbathers already lolling on the beach here and rollerbladers racing along the three-and-a-half-mile Boardwalk, this waterfront town hardly projects an image of financial distress.
But a mile away at Town Hall, employees are reeling from the dismissal of one-fourth of the city's 300 workers two weeks ago. And officials are furiously trying to balance the budget of a town whose economic woes recently forced it to submit to state control. 
 "We got hit pretty substantially," Public Works Commissioner Arthur C. Ferris said of the layoffs. Calling it "the toughest day" in his 31-year career with the city, he said he had dismissed four mechanics, three tree-trimmers and a secretary. But even the layoffs, which will cut one-third of the projected $10 million deficit this year, have done little to placate constituents whose property taxes are going up 20 to 40 percent. Taxes for an average house are expected to rise to $3,400, from $2,700.
"They're spending way too much money that we don't have," said Michael Matera, an unemployed truck driver walking along Savin Rock Beach. "There are city jobs paying $70,000, while they're cutting people way down below. We have three fire districts we don't need. And everywhere you go, taxes are going up."
Donna Muzyka, another longtime resident, said she expected her landlord to raise her rent because of higher taxes. But her biggest concern was for her daughter Christa, whose "kindergarten teacher is upset they didn't get raises."
"I worry about the schools," her friend Donna Stackpole added. "If they don't have money to pay teachers, they'll make the classes too big, and children won't learn."
 
Tax Cut in '91
 The troubles are hardly singular at a time when many cities have slashed services and payrolls because of cuts in Federal and state aid, as well as reductions in tax revenues. The particular problems, however, might have been foreseen last year, when West Haven was the only one of the 169 towns in Connecticut to cut taxes. The recent history is a cautionary tale of how a proud working-class community of 55,000 people can abruptly slide from apparent economic well-being to the brink of insolvency.
Unlike Bridgeport, a poverty- and crime-plagued city whose budget is also subject to a state review board, West Haven is a town of well-maintained wood houses, stable businesses like Miles Pharmaceuticals and the peaceful ambience of a small New England town, complete with a town green, where the quiet is broken only by the sound of church bells.
Mayor H. Richard Borer Jr. insisted that "being financially distressed gives us the opportunity to scale down government without significantly reducing services." But even the minor cuts are symbolic.
Trash collections will be reduced to once a week, from twice a week. Nonprofit groups may be unable to use school buildings for evening meetings, and the number of free summer concerts will be reduced, to 12 from 30.
 
$700,000 or $7 Million Deficit?
 The troubles surfaced three months ago, shortly after Mr. Borer had taken office. Although the previous mayor, Clemente F. Evangeliste, had forecast a $700,000 deficit for the 1991 fiscal year, a long-delayed audit released in February showed that the deficit was actually $7 million, and the audit projected a $10 million shortfall for the current fiscal year.
"It was a monster of a deficit that certainly took us by surprise," said Mr. Borer, a former real-estate appraiser. "What we found was poor budgeting and complete incompetence" by the past administration.
He faulted Mr. Evangeliste for increasing spending while cutting taxes and significantly overestimating revenues from the state.
Mr. Evangeliste denied that he left the city's finances in shambles, saying: "We were West Haven's first professional management team. When we left, we were about $500,000 in the red. Businessmen like us are used to facing cash-flow problems, and Borer is a young guy who probably got all panicky."
Six weeks ago, with the city unable to pay its employees' health-insurance premiums, bond-rating agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgrading West Haven bonds to junk-bond status. Standard & Poor's lowered its rating, from BBB+ to BB, and Moody's changed, from Baa1 to Ba.
Mr. Borer turned to the state for emergency aid.
"In early March, we paid a visit to the Mayor, advising him we were very concerned about the city's financial condition," said Linda R. Savitsky, director of municipal finance services for the State Office of Policy and Management, which oversees the review boards for Bridgeport and West Haven. "Then, with Moody's getting nervous, he came to us on March 30, saying they needed help."
Four days later, legislation was passed and signed by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. creating a state board to control West Haven's finances in exchange for up to $35 million in loan guarantees for bonds enabling the town to pay its bills. The board has sweeping powers to set the tax rate, negotiate labor contracts and approve borrowing and line-item transfers in the Board of Education budget.
The seven-member panel, which will pass judgment on Tuesday on the proposed $90.5 million budget, will function for as long as a decade, until all of the city's new bonds come due.
The city's finance director, Francis J. Kelly, acknowledged that the board "has substantial authority" to veto the town's budget and impose spending cuts, additional layoffs and higher taxes. But, he insisted: "We're not really giving up our financial independence to the state. The only thing different is that we'll hand over our finances for them to review."
But, Ms. Savitsky said: "The message to West Haven and other towns is that if they come to the state for help, the state's role won't be strictly advisory. We mean business. If this happens in other towns, the state will come in quickly and take control of their finances."

HEADLINE: A Ferryboat Again Plies Mid-Hudson

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y., May 14

 BODY:
After a lapse of 35 years, ferry service resumed this month across the Hudson River between Kingston and Rhinecliff.
The service consists of one ferryboat, a converted small Navy launch that can carry 40 passengers; for now it operates only on weekends. 
 "I see it as a chance for people without a boat to get out and enjoy the river," said Paul Ruge, Supervisor of the Town of Rhinebeck, which includes Rhinecliff.
Four times on Saturday and Sunday, the 40-foot-long ferryboat, named the Indy 7, makes the trip between the bustling Rondout Landing here and an unfinished dock alongside the Amtrak rail station in Rhinecliff. In July and August, the trips will be run daily.
The new ferry service leaves Kingston every hour from 12:30 P.M. through 3:30 P.M, and Rhinecliff 10 minutes after the hour from 1:10 P.M. through 4:10 P.M. The round-trip fare is $3 and $5 if a stop at the lighthouse is included, said Girard G. Henne, the captain of the Indy 7.
 
Stops at Lighthouse
 The boat stops at the Rondout Lighthouse, where the Rondout Creek meets the Hudson. The three-story yellow brick lighthouse, still an active Coast Guard beacon, is part of the Hudson River Maritime Museum on the Kingston waterfront.
Mr. Henne, a former Navy man, grew up around water. He bought the Indy 7 at a Navy surplus sale last year and converted it to civilian use.
"In the Navy it was called a 'liberty' boat," he explained, "because it was used to ferry sailors to shore" from the carrier Independence. "I tried to keep it Navy, painting it the Navy gray again."
The Indy 7 is the first ferryboat running across this area of the Hudson since the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge, four miles to the north, opened to traffic in 1957. For years before that, a much larger vessel carrying both vehicles and passengers operated ferry service as often as 15 times a day.
In addition to the new ferry service, Mr. Henne uses the Indy 7 to bring school groups to the lighthouse on weekday field trips. Today, for example, 47 fourth-grade students from the Brinckerhoff Elementary School in Fishkill, in Dutchess County, made the trip.
He also operates a much larger boat, the 300-passenger Rip Van Winkle, which runs Hudson sightseeing cruises out of Kingston.
Officials on both sides of the river see the small ferry service as a way to increase tourism, a major industry in the mid-Hudson Valley.
"It means that we can get museum visitors to the lighthouse on a safe vessel at a reasonable cost," said Lynn Beman, director of the Maritime Museum.
Mr. Henne expressed optimism about the future of ferry and cruise business on the Hudson. "Despite the recession, the passenger count is going up," he said. "Perhaps people are not going in for big-ticket vacations, but staying nearer to home on short vacations."
