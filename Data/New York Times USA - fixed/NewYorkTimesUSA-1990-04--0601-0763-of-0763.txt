HEADLINE: Another Departure at First Boston in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 23

 BODY:
CS First Boston's Asian operations today lost its second top executive in the last three weeks, just as the troubled international investment banking firm begins to put a new strategy in place.
CS First Boston said that Keisuke Inaba, who had been president of the firm's Japanese subsidiary, resigned to take a senior position with a rival, UBS Phillips & Drew, the securities division of the Union Bank of Switzerland. CS First Boston is the securities subsidiary of Credit Suisse, another big Swiss bank.
Mr. Inaba's resignation occurred two weeks after the departure of James M. Walsh, who had been chief executive of CS First Boston's Japanese division, which now has more than 400 employees. 
 
Move Away from Stock Trading
Both men, who were popular in the tight-knit Tokyo securities community, were said to have been unhappy with the changes being put in place by the new head of the firm's Asian operations, Allen D. Wheat.
Mr. Wheat has said he is planning to push the firm heavily into several complex, global businesses, like currency swaps, interest rate swaps and specialized stock options. All these businesses will tie the securities firm in more closely with Credit Suisse and will steer it away from stock and bond trading.
These new businesses rely heavily on computers and careful long-range analyses, rather than Wall Street's traditional style of securities trading and sales using intuition and split-second timing. The newer businesses tend to produce smaller, but less volatile, profits, something that many securities companies are finding attractive after the wild profit swings most experienced during the latter half of the 1980's.
Mr. Wheat joined CS First Boston in February from the Bankers Trust Company, along with nearly 20 other Bankers Trust officials in Tokyo and London. Mr. Walsh was a longtime CS First Boston executive who had worked in London and New York, in addition to Tokyo. Mr. Inaba joined the firm in 1987 from Kidder, Peabody & Company, where he had been Tokyo branch manager.
 
Struggle to Regain Momentum
Clearly, more change rather than less is in store for CS First Boston, as the once-powerful securities firm struggles to regain its momentum after a tumultuous two years.
''We do have a very ambitious set of goals,'' Mr. Wheat said in an interview today. ''It is inevitable that that would create some resentments. We need people who are committed 100 percent to this strategy.''
Mr. Wheat added that Mr. Inaba had had misgivings about remaining with the firm from the time he arrived in February. ''In Kei's case, I was disappointed that he left,'' Mr. Wheat said, using Mr. Inaba's nickname. ''But I got tired of trying to coax him to stay.''
Mr. Inaba said in a statement that he felt ''it is time to move on to new challenges.'' He was said to be in New York and could not be reached for further comment.
 
Plan to Lower Borrowing Costs
After suffering an outflow of talent from its investment banking division, Credit Suisse acquired the minority interest in First Boston that it did not already own. Since that was completed last year, it has been struggling to bring in new management and stem the loss of professionals.
Mr. Wheat arrived earlier this year at the Asian division and the keystone in his strategy will be the formation next month of a special purpose banking subsidiary in London, which will be controlled by Credit Suisse.
This division will, in effect, permit CS First Boston to use Credit Suisse's top rating with the credit agencies to borrow capital and engage in certain complex transactions far more cheaply than it could on its own. These cheaper borrowing costs will be central to the new swaps and other sophisticated businesses that Mr. Wheat plans to build.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about CS-First Boston's Asian operations misstated the ownership of CS-First Boston Inc. It is 44.5 percent owned by CS Holding, which also owns Credit Suisse, the large Swiss bank. The remaining shares in CS-First Boston are held by management and by institutional investors.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Higher While the Mark Declines

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against most major currencies yesterday, benefiting from weakness in the West German mark.
Speculation that United States interest rates will move higher as the economy continues to expand also encouraged dollar buying, dealers said.
Gold prices were mixed, rising in New York after falling in some overseas markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for April delivery settled at $378.90 an ounce, $2.30 higher than Friday's close. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at $378.65, up $2.40 from Friday's late bid. 
Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust in Chicago, said the mark was sold heavily amid worries about the consequences of planned German unification.
The Governments of East and West Germany have said they will merge their economies completely on July 1 as a prelude to full unification, expected next year. But a final agreement on linking their currencies has not been reached.
 
Effect of Lithuania Embargo
The dollar also benefited from news of growing oil shortages in Lithuania caused by the Soviet economic embargo on the republic. Also contributing to the dollar's strength were expectations of domestic economic growth accompanied by rising credit costs. Higher interest rates in the United States would enhance returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to lift demand for dollars.
It was anticipated that a report due today on orders for durable goods and a report Friday on the gross national product would confirm that the economic expansion has staged a modest revival.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 157.55 Japanese yen, from 157.60 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it was unchanged. In New York, the dollar settled at 157.55 yen, up from 157.50 yen on Friday.
The British pound rose to $1.6365 in London, from $1.6357 late Friday. Later in New York, the pound dipped to $1.63565 from Friday's $1.6388.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late quotes, included: 1.6995 West German marks, up from 1.6872; 1.4935 Swiss francs, up from 1.4895; 5.7020 French francs, up from 5.6655; 1,246.75 Italian lire, up from 1,238.20, and 1.16155 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1628.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Bush Delays Action on Lithuania, Not Wanting to Harm Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
After conferring with allies and Congressional leaders, President Bush today delayed carrying out a threat to take action against Moscow for tightening its chokehold on Lithuania, fearing sanctions might undermine President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and worsen the Baltic crisis.
The decision, supported by European allies and some leading members of Congress, reflected Mr. Bush's own inclination not to move against Moscow in hopes of buying time for the Soviet Union and Lithuania to resolve their differences over the Baltic republic's declaration of independence. Mr. Bush has not been under any groundswell of public pressure to act against Moscow.
His decision today reflected a complicated equation of political pressures that the Administration has avoided spelling out in public. While it is eager to take a strong stand supporting Lithuanian independence, the United States does not believe that trying to force immediate independence is worth risking progress on arms control, upsetting the evolution in Eastern Europe or jeopardizing Mr. Gorbachev's domestic political position. 
Appearing before agriculture writers today at the White House, Mr. Bush said his inaction was motivated by a fear of provoking the Soviet Union at a tense moment. ''I may do something imprudent,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I am concerned that we not do anything that would cause the Soviet Union to take action that would set back the cause of freedom around the world.''
Some members of Congress said today that economic sanctions are in order. But after a White House meeting with Mr. Bush, most of those who attended backed the President.
The House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said Mr. Bush was acting properly in seeking to promote a dialogue between Soviet and Lithuanian officials. ''There is not any action that I believe at this point could be taken which would be a constructive one in the way of sanctions or other activity,'' Mr. Foley said.
Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Mr. Bush for ''recognizing that if the situation is escalated it could be of mutual damage.''
Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, said there would be strong Congressional support if Mr. Bush took action against the Soviet Union, but commended him for his ''care and prudence.''
Although there was clearly no wave of Congressional or public pressure for Mr. Bush to act, the Administration kept the option of sanctions open in case the Soviet pressure increased. But Mr. Bush has now backed off twice from lines he had appeared to draw on Soviet behavior on Lithuania, and the White House said the situation would have to worsen dramatically before he imposed sanctions.
''It probably would be more than one or two things that would move us to a decision now,'' a senior Administration official said. ''Clearly more measures, or intensification of measures by the Soviets, failure of any dialogue to emerge, these would be considerations. But you shouldn't take that as a checklist.''
 
Meets With Advisers
Some Administration officials had expected Mr. Bush to announce limited action against the Soviet Union today after the morning conference with Congressional leaders. The options he has been considering involve the suspension of one or more of the negotiations now under way over trade concessions sought by Moscow.
Pressure to act built late last week when the Soviet Union began stepping up its sanctions against Lithuania by cutting oil and natural gas supplies. ''I think that the initial instinct when the Soviets imposed the sanctions late last week was that the time had come to take action,'' a senior official said.
Mr. Bush met with senior national security advisers Monday evening and received a report from a round of intensive weekend diplomacy that spelled out strong European opposition to sanctions, officials said.
As late as Monday evening, some Administration officials were still expecting Mr. Bush to take some action against Moscow. But the description of European opposition plus a reading of Congressional sentiment prompted Mr. Bush to decide later Monday not to impose any immediate sanctions, officials said. He and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have been extremely reluctant to impose sanctions, hoping that Moscow and Lithuania could work out their differences.
Mr. Bush, speaking to the agricultural group, said he thought Americans supported his approach, ''and I say that with total appreciation for the strength of the feeling that Lithuanians in this country have about their own freedom.''
''But I also am concerned about the freedom of Poland,'' he added. ''I was concerned about the evolution of freedom in the other Baltic states, whose incorporation we haven't recognized.''
 
Damage to Gorbachev Considered
Administration officials said today that Mr. Bush feared that taking action against Moscow could interfere with German unification and the Soviet military withdrawal from Eastern Europe. Another concern, emphasized in particular by West Europeans, was that sanctions could undermine Mr. Gorbachev's domestic position.
Finally, a suspension of talks on such issues as a trade agreement, investment, tax arrangements and Soviet membership in international financial organizations would block steps the Administration believes would foster a market economy and political pluralism in the Soviet Union, officials said.
A senior official said: ''There is a very genuine, sincere sympathy for Lithuania's desire for self-determination and for their own identity and the importance of our sticking to our principles. By the same token, Bush looks at what Gorbachev has accomplished in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe in particular, and there are huge equities at stake here.''
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the United States had been encouraged by signs of ''flexibility'' in recent Soviet statements and that Mr. Bush did not want to interfere with arms control talks or the schedule for the next Soviet-American summit. ----K.G.B. Sends Reinforcements MOSCOW, April 24 (AP) - Lithuania's President accused the United States today of selling out his rebellious Baltic republic in its confrontation with the Soviet Government.
After President Bush's announcement that he had delayed the imposition of sanctions against the Soviet Union, President Vytautas Landsbergis issued an angry statement from Vilnius.
''Can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom of another? What then is the idea of freedom itself?'' he said.
''This is another Munich,'' he said, referring to the 1938 pact by which France and Britain allowed Nazi Germany to take control of Czechoslovakia.
Also today, the Kremlin reinforced K.G.B. border guards in Lithuania today, and The Soviet press agency Tass reported a gunfire attack Monday night on a Soviet Army barracks in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, but said no one was hurt.
Tass quoted Maj. Aleksei Kirichenko of the Soviet Army as saying a shot was fired at an open window about 10 P.M. when soldiers were already inside the barracks. It said the bullet smashed a window on the opposite wall.
Lithuania hopes to make up for some of the supplies Moscow has cut with imports from abroad. But the K.G.B.'s announcement that it was adding personnel and equipment to guard the republic's border appeared designed as a warning against such a step.

HEADLINE: Milken Defends 'Junk Bonds' As He Enters His Guilty Plea

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Apologizing for his crimes but defending the ''junk bond'' market he created, Michael R. Milken pleaded guilty yesterday to six felony charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. The 43-year-old financier agreed to pay $600 million in fines and penalties.
Mr. Milken had long maintained his innocence and had not let the pressure of the Government investigation show in public. But yesterday, during his 35-minute appearance in a packed Manhattan courtroom, Mr. Milken broke down and cried, saying he had ''hurt those who are closest to me.''
In his statement to the Federal District Court, Mr. Milken admitted that he had committed several illegal acts in cooperation with others intended to enrich his firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and to help the firm complete trades for itself and its clients. 
''I transgressed certain of the laws and regulations that govern our industry,'' Mr. Milken said. ''I was wrong in doing so and knew that at the time and I am pleading guilty to these offenses.'' [Text of statement, page D8.]
In essence, Mr. Milken admitted to cheating some Drexel customers, aiding others in the violation of securities and tax laws, and manipulating the securities market to benefit a client.
 
The Largest Prosecution
The plea by Mr. Milken brings to a close the largest criminal prosecution in Wall Street history. He agreed to the plea and the largest monetary penalty ever last week.
Mr. Milken, the former head of the junk bond division at the now-defunct Drexel, had been at the center of the giant Wall Street inquiry that bloomed in 1986. In November that year, Ivan F. Boesky, the former stock speculator, agreed to settle insider trading charges, pay a fine of $100 million and provide evidence about other wrongdoing on Wall Street. The junk bond market Mr. Milken pioneered financed many of the corporate takeovers of the 1980's.
Mr. Milken will be sentenced on Oct. 1 and faces a maximum prison term of 28 years. Securities lawyers say they expect his prison term will not exceed five years.
Mr. Milken appeared in a courtroom that was overflowing. The walls were lined with officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorney's office, lawyers and reporters. Mr. Milken's wife, Lori, sat in the front row of the courtroom next to his brother, Lowell Milken had been indicted in the case, but the charges against him were dropped as part of the settlement.
Throughout most of the proceeding, Mr. Milken remained stoic, staring intently at the judge with his hands folded at his waist, while answering a litany of questions to assure the judge that his plea was being voluntarily given and that he was aware of the maximum possible sentence.
Only once did he divert from quickly answering the questions with a curt ''Yes, Judge,'' or ''No, Judge.'' When asked if he was making his plea under any force or threats, he hesitated for a few seconds and then replied, ''No.''
Reading from his statement, Mr. Milken said, ''This long period has been extremely painful and difficult for my family and friends as well as myself. I realize that by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to me.'' Mr. Milken hesitated as tears began to well in his eyes, and he placed his right index finger under his nose.
 
'I Am Truly Sorry'
''I am truly sorry,'' he continued, his face reddening. He then uttered while sobbing, ''I thank the Court for permitting me to add this apology and for its fairness in handling this complex case.''
Mr. Milken's lawyer, Arthur Liman, then put his arm around his client and raised his hand slowly to the judge, indicating that his client needed a moment to recover. Judge Kimba M. Wood then thanked Mr. Milken for his statement, and he sat down.
Seconds passed until Mr. Milken regained his composure, drinking from a plastic cup of water. He then stood again, and Judge Wood said, ''Mr. Milken, how do you plead?''
With his voice cracking with emotion, the financier replied, ''Guilty, Your Honor.''
The charges to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty involved a series of illegal transactions with Mr. Boesky, as well as other illicit deals with David Solomon, a former junk bond trader and founder of Solomon Asset Management. The charges portray a man who ignored some legal restrictions in an effort to benefit his firm and clients of his division.
 
Inaccurate Filings
Mr. Milken engaged in a conspiracy that allowed Mr. Boesky to violate the rules on capital that governed his stock trading firm, as well as to file inaccurate financial statements to Government regulators. He also conspired with Mr. Boesky to inflate the price of a stock to benefit one of Drexel's clients.
In addition, Mr. Milken entered into an illegal agreement with Mr. Solomon under which the cost of some trades was misstated to repay Drexel for the cost of paying commissions on those trades. Also, he conducted a complex series of trades that allowed Mr. Solomon to illegally claim losses to reduce his 1985 Federal income tax return.
None of the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty involved illegal activities in the junk bond market, but rather in other securities markets. In his court statement, which was approved by the Government, Mr. Milken said the crimes were ''not a reflection on the underlying soundness and integrity of the capital markets in which we specialized.'' He added: ''Our business was in no way dependent on these practices.''
After the hearing, Mr. Liman read a statement on the steps of the courthouse, saying the charges described were ''instances in which Michael went too far in helping clients'' and an arrangement ''to recoup expenses incurred by Drexel.''
He said, ''It is Michael's hope that in the long run, history will see his violations in context and judge him not just on the basis of his lapses, but on the basis of the contributions that he made to the economy.''
One trader who was caught up in the scandal that enveloped Wall Street after Mr. Boesky began to turn over information to the Government said he was not surprised by Mr. Milken's fate.
 
'What They Deserved'
''It's anti-climactic,'' said Boyd L. Jefferies, a former stock trader who is on probation for engaging in illegal activities with Mr. Boesky. ''I don't think anybody in this whole thing has gotten anything but what they deserved.''
Mr. Jefferies added: ''When I was doing these favors for clients, I knew I was breaking the law. We all knew we were breaking the law.''
While the charges Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to were serious, some securities lawyers expressed surprise yesterday at how mild they turned out to be. Mr. Milken did not plead guilty to insider trading or racketeering, the two most serious crimes in the original indictment in March.
Mr. Milken agreed yesterday to pay $600 million in fines and penalties to settle both the criminal case against him and the civil case brought in 1988 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He will pay $200 million in fines and, as part of the S.E.C. settlement, will set aside $400 million to satisfy civil claims that have been filed against him.
Despite the fines and penalties, Mr. Milken will remain a rich man. He was paid more than $1.1 billion dollars by Drexel from 1983 to 1987, and earned income from his large number of investments as well.
In his statement, Mr. Milken also described his personal relationship with Mr. Boesky. Mr. Milken said his dealings with Mr. Boesky constituted less than 1 percent of the business of Drexel's junk bond unit.
 
They Were Not Friends
''He traded in stocks, and I traded in bonds or their equivalent,'' Mr. Milken said. ''But because he was a major factor in the securities markets, he had the potential to become a more significant account.''
Mr. Milken said he and Mr. Boesky ''were not social friends, and had little in common.'' He added: ''His philosophy of business was different from mine. The relationship started as an arms length and correct one.''
But over time, Mr. Milken said, the two men began to enter into transactions that violated the law.
After the hearing was over, Mr. Milken left the courtroom through the judge's chambers. Unlike last year when he pleaded not guilty to the original indictment, there was no crowd of supporters waiting for him outside the courthouse. A handful of people did cheer for him, but others also booed as he left.
In its court filings, the Government said it would drop all criminal charges against Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell, as well as all civil charges brought against him by the S.E.C., Despite the personal benefit, Lowell Milken attempted to persuade his brother for more than two hours last Thursday not to plead guilty, his lawyer, Michael Armstrong, said.
 
Deterrent Effect
Government officials said the strong efforts in the Milken case should have a significant deterrent effect on white-collar criminals. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the Milken prosecution sent a strong message that ''white-collar criminals are never so powerful or clever that they cannot be caught by diligent and persistent law enforcement efforts.''
Unlike other Wall Street executives who have agreed to plead guilty, Mr. Milken is not required to begin immediately to provide the Government with details for its investigations. He will be interviewed by the Government after he is sentenced and is expected to be called to testify before grand juries. He has waived his Constitutional right to refuse to answer questions because he might incriminate himself and has been granted immunity from further prosecution in the case.

HEADLINE: After Gains of 80's, Northeast Is Lagging In the Growth of Jobs

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
After years that brought some of the sharpest economic gains since World War II, the Northeast is now trailing the rest of the nation in job growth.
In a ranking released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, seven of the nine states from Pennsylvania to Maine were in the bottom 10 in employment growth in the two years ending last December. Only one Northeastern state, Pennsylvania, was in the bottom 10 in job growth in the previous seven years.
Economists attributed the Northeast's decline to a labor market that tightened significantly in the mid-80's; to the sputtering of two driving economic forces, the financial industry in New York City and the high-technology companies concentrated around Boston; to continuing losses of factory jobs, and to a construction industry that is sagging in much of the region. 
The economists also said the standings reflected that Northeastern states were well developed, with mature economies, and thus have less room to expand than less-developed regions.
''The economic renaissance of the 1980's is now history,'' the regional commissioner of labor statistics, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, said yesterday in a telephone interview. Mr. Ehrenhalt, who compiled the ranking of total nonfarm employment state by state, said it showed that a slowdown that started earlier in the region than in the rest of the nation was also ''hitting here harder than in the country as a whole.''
The standings represent a sharp turnaround in the fortunes of the Northeast, which accounted for 18 percent of the new jobs in the 80's, double its share in the 70's.
Although eight of the nine states gained jobs in the last two years, their employment growth was generally much lower than earlier in the decade. In New York State, employment, which had been expanding 2.4 percent a year from 1982 to 1987, grew 1.4 percent in 1988 and 0.5 percent last year.
Employment in the country as a whole grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent from 1982 to 1988 before dropping to 2.3 percent in 1989, according to the labor statistics bureau.
For the Northeast, the survey results were reminiscent of the 70's, a bleak period in which six of the nine states were ranked in the bottom 10 in the nation in employment growth. New York was the sole state in the nation that failed to gain jobs in that decade.
 
Strength in the Northwest
In contrast, Western states, particularly the Northwest, were among the nation's strongest in the last two years, the survey showed. Seven of the top 10 states in job growth were in the West.
Robert A. Dye, director of state forecasting for the WEFA Group, a forecasting organization in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said a ''key constraining factor'' for Northeastern states was the supply of labor, which began to tighten in the mid-80's. ''Firms simply can't expand unless there's the available labor pool to fill the jobs,'' he said.
Mr. Dye also noted that the Northeastern states ''simply are going to show much less potential for new growth than less-developed states like in the Northwest.''
He said that states like Nevada, which rose from fifth in the nation in job growth earlier in the decade to first in the last two years, had ''a lot of potential for very high growth rates because they are starting from a low base.''
 
Extended Manufacturing Decline
Similarly, Washington State, which moved to 3d from 18th, was propelled by a boom in the aerospace industry, which is concentrated there.
The deputy director of research for regional affairs at the Federal Reservee Bank of Boston, Lynn Browne, said she believed the downturn in the Northeast was largely related to the decline in the construction and real-estate industries.
''But you could say one reason for that decline is the extended decline in manufacturing and the slow population growth,'' she said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt also stressed the continuing decline of manufacturing. A report accompanying the survey noted that factory jobs in New York declined 3.5 percent in the last two years and that in the 80's the state lost 300,000 such jobs.
 
Prospect of Higher Taxes
Other factors cited by economists for the decline included military cutbacks that affected employers in Connecticut and on Long Island and the high cost of real estate, wages and energy in the region.
Mr. Dye said nearly all state governments in the Northeast faced budget shortfalls. Such problems, which were made worse by the sluggish economy, will likely lead to tax increases in a region already known for its high taxes.
Whatever the factors, the downward movement of the Northeastern states from one survey to another was striking. Vermont dropped to 31st from 8th in the survey covering the first part of the decade; New Jersey, to 41st from 16th; Massachusetts, to 49th from 17th; Connecticut, to 47th from 19th; Rhode Island, to 48th from 25th; New York, to 45th from 27th, and New Hampshire, to 50th from 3d.
Pennsylvania edged down one place, to 42d. Alone in the Northeast, Maine improved its rank, moving to 9th from 10th. Mr. Dye said Maine's gain of 7.5 percent probably stemmed from a pickup in shipbuilding.
The survey showed that the prosperity of the early and mid-80's bypassed some parts of the nation. From December 1979 to December 1987, five states lost jobs, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming. Some of those recovered in the last two years.
Just New Hampshire lost jobs in the last two years. It lost nearly 5,000 jobs, about 1 percent of its total employment. Ms. Browne attributed the drop to sharp declines in construction and manufacturing.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Experts Fear a German Inflation Rise

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
It is widely agreed that Bonn's decision to ground a German monetary union on a one-for-one exchange of currencies will make East Germans very happy indeed. And by pleasing East German voters, the concession is likely to serve the immediate interests of West Germany's ruling party, the Christian Democratic Union.
But the economic implications of the deal are not so easily pinned down. According to Jan Vanous of the PlanEcon consulting firm in Washington, the inflationary impact of increasing the cash value of the savings of East Germans is likely to be small and transitory. But many economists do worry, however, that the decision to set the wages and pensions of East Germans far above the rates justified by labor productivity will set off a spiral of inflation and unemployment that will be difficult to check. 
 
Economy Five Times Larger
Much will depend, they argue, on the speed at which the East German economy is integrated into West Germany's, which is five times larger. And that, in turn, will critically depend on the flexibility of wage rates in the east and the willingness of West German taxpayers to subsidize East German living standards during the transition.
As Germans have discovered in the last months of debate, the choice of currency exchange rates poses an excruciating economic dilemma. Warwick McKibbin, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says that if East Germany hopes to attract investment, the exchange rate must reflect the low productivity of East German enterprises and workers. But if wage rates remain as low as productivity dictates, the best and brightest workers will emigrate west, stripping the east of its most notable resource.
 
Resistance Unlikely
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the West German Government responded with a compromise whose political virtues are clearer than its economic implications. The plan, which is unlikely to meet much resistance from the newly elected conservative Government of East Germany, would give individuals the right to exchange 4,000 East German marks in savings for 4,000 West German marks, worth about $2,400. Personal savings in excess of 4,000 East German marks, as well as other financial assets of individuals and enterprises, would be exchangeable at the rate of two East German marks for one West German mark, however. That rate more or less reflects the relative purchasing power of the two currencies.
The one-for-one rate, most economists agree, represents a windfall of 50 billion West German marks for the 16 million East Germans: indeed, they are currently obliged to pay about five East German marks per West German mark on the black market to buy scarce and much treasured West German consumer goods. But according to Mr. Vanous of PlanEcon, the likely inflationary effects of this financial gain have been exaggerated.
He predicts that many East Germans will hoard the cash until they are certain their employers - and their jobs - will survive the economic transition. Even if they were to spend the entire gain, the inflationary impact on the 2.3 trillion mark economy of West Germany would be modest. In any case, the impact would be transitory: West Germany's conservative central bankers would probably tighten credit in response, making it impossible for West German companies to maintain higher prices.
The more perilous imponderable is the impact of the plan on East German production costs. Bonn is calling for East German wages to be reset in West German marks at a one-to-one rate. That would give East German workers a big boost in purchasing power, encouraging them to stay on the job rather than moving west.
As Mr. Vanous points out, though, it would push wages far out of line with labor productivity, which is just one-third the level of West Germany's. If these excessive wages were maintained, many, if not most, East German enterprises would go bankrupt, and West German companies would have little incentive to invest in a distorted economy.
The collapse of East German output would presumably bring wages down. But that process could prove slow and painful, Mr. McKibbin says, as East German workers, with the support of West German labor unions, resisted the pressure. And the crisis might well bring on a general inflation: Pressed to cope with high unemployment in the east and wholesale migration to the west, Bonn might well decide to bail out East German enterprises with subsidies and easy credit.
The least painful way out of the trap, Mr. McKibbin contends, would be for West Germany to accept the political and economic imperative and simply subsidize East German living standards during the transition - and then raise taxes to pay for the subsidies.
 
Curb on Flow of Migrants
Wage subsidies would satisfy East German demands for higher incomes, staunching the westward flow of migrants. But they would manage the task without discouraging investment or pricing the struggling East German businesses out of the market.
There is a catch, however - a couple of catches. Wage subsidies high enough to make a difference would be very costly, perhaps 2 or 3 percent of West German income. Taxes would have to be raised commensurately. And once wage subsidies were in place, moreover, they might be very difficult to remove: Modern economic history is replete with transitory benefits that became permanent entitlements.
But according to Mr. McKibbin, the alternatives are even less attractive. One way or another, West Germany must absorb millions of new citizens -and voters - who harbor unrealistic economic expectations. And in the end, he says, it will likely prove far less costly to fulfill those expectations temporarily than to crush them under the anvil of unemployment or inflation.

HEADLINE: Chiles Transforms Florida Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 19

 BODY:
Less than two years ago, Lawton Chiles stunned Florida voters and political veterans by complaining of ''burnout'' and promptly retiring from the United States Senate. Now he has caused another stir, this time by declaring he wants to be Governor of Florida.
His surprise announcement April 12 almost immediately turned a lackluster campaign into a high-profile contest in which Mr. Chiles promises to raise a broad range of national issues, including whether the political system itself needs significant reform. He is pledging, among other things, to accept no more than $100 from each campaign contributor. The legal limit is $1,000 from an individual and $5,000 from a political action committee.
''Just by entering the race he's made it a national-level campaign,'' said Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who says he will make no endorsement in the party primary but who is a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Chiles's. 
Opinion polls show that Mr. Chiles's entry into the race almost instantly made him the front-runner for governing one of the largest, fastest-growing and most politically influential states.
 
Gains in Congress Expected
And Florida will probably be an even richer prize soon, since it is expected to receive four more Congressional seats, for a total of 23, under the reapportionment that will follow the 1990 census.
If Mr. Chiles does not falter, he is expected to defeat his rival, Representative Bill Nelson, in the Democratic primary in September. The Republican incumbent, Gov. Bob Martinez, is favored to win his party's nomination.
Mr. Chiles's critics, most of them Republicans, contend that he is a vulnerable opponent. They note particularly Mr. Chiles's acknowledgment of having suffered from depression, for which he is still taking the prescription drug Prozac. Governor Martinez's campaign managers have demanded that Mr. Chiles make public all of his medical records, something he has resisted.
Mr. Nelson too has made Mr. Chiles's health an issue. Criticizing Mr. Chiles for retiring from the Senate, Mr. Nelson declared recently, ''He walked away from that responsibility.'' A Retread Democrat? Republican analysts add that Mr. Chiles has also admitted trying marijuana many years ago, and they sum him up as a retread Democrat in an increasingly Republican state.
''I am looking forward to Chiles' being the last hurrah of what had been a dominant Democratic Party,'' Mac Stipanovich, the Republicans' chief campaign strategist, said.
Such talk does not appear to ruffle Mr. Chiles. Accompanied by Buddy MacKay, his running mate for Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Chiles, who is 60 years old, spoke of his plans and his prospects in an interview on the back porch of his ranch-style home here.
He said his re-entry into politics had been spurred by a profound sense that the world had changed while American politics remained mired in the past: ''You see the people of Eastern Europe saying they want to emulate Jefferson, Madison and Lincoln. And what do we tell them about? Political action committees, how to dodge the issues and the need to poll daily.''
 
'A New Spirit Loose'
''I think there is a new spirit loose in this land,'' the former Senator said, sounding an increasingly common Democratic Party theme. ''Just as elsewhere, there is a search for faith among people, people who want to be empowered. Why can't Bush see that? Why can't the Republican governors see that?''
Mr. Stipanovich dismissed such pronouncements. He noted that Floridians had overwhelmingly voted for Ronald Reagan and for George Bush.
Mr. Stipanovich emphasized that Governor Martinez would make public his full health records, noting that so far Mr. Chiles had released only some records and had refused to make public his full records from 1988 and 1989.
Mr. Chiles said he had suffered acute insomnia, mood changes and loss of appetite starting in 1988. He said he had never been suicidal.
Five months ago, he said, his doctor began treating him with Prozac, a drug widely prescribed to treat depression. Mr. Chiles said he believes he is cured, adding that he expects to stop taking Prozac very soon.
 
The Issues He Sees
He pledged to wage a campaign that would challenge many of the reigning dogmas of politics. He said the politics of the near future would be based on fiscal conservatism, a new sense of ethics, education, nurturing the family, protecting the environment, planned economic growth and greater emphasis on local issues.
As a corollary, he contended, elections and government will be wrested from the domination of political action committees, lobbyists, Washington bureaucrats, poll takers and television. He likened his years as a Senator to the drudgery of ''churning butter - the harder you churn, the harder it gets.''
To put his vision into practice, Mr. Chiles says he will limit contributions to his campaign to $100 per donor to encourage wide voter participation. Democratic strategists say Mr. Chiles will need 30,000 to 100,000 contributors. Small Ideas, Big Money? Depending on whom you talk to, the $100 limit is either the most naive or the shrewdest gamble in a political season that has been much noted for big money, slurs, small ideas and, seemingly, jaded voters.
Mr. Stipanovich, as well as Democratic Party consultants, say Florida is a sprawling state of largely faceless suburbs in which a successful candidate normally needs a lot of money to pay for television advertising.
But Mr. Chiles has based a notable career on alchemizing a seeming ''aw, shucks'' naivete into the ready ore of willing votes for winning elections.
In 1970, he won election to the Senate, along with the lasting sobriquet of ''Walkin' Lawton,'' by striding across 1,000 miles of Florida to say ''Howdy.''
 
Headed Budget Committee
In Washington, he won high marks, rising to head the powerful Budget Committee before leaving the Senate at the end of 1988.
Mr. Chiles remains one of the best-known and most popular political figures in the state, and there are signs that Republicans are more than a little flustered by his entry.
Several polls and political analysts of both parties suggest that Governor Martinez is extremely vulnerable after four years of political missteps.
Early in his term, Mr. Martinez vociferously supported a new tax on services, like those provided by lawyers, doctors and accountants, only to reverse himself when the going got rough. Later he called a special state legislative session to restrict access to abortion, and was humiliatingly turned down by state legislators.
An economically rich state of low taxes and more than 300,000 newly arriving residents each year, Florida is suffering from an inability to raise revenue for deteriorating highways, for education and for other social and economic development. The ''Sunshine State,'' despite its affluence, is among the nation's leaders in adult illiteracy, high school dropouts and infant mortality.
 
Help From White House
Republican worries about Mr. Martinez appear to have helped prompt President Bush to twice jet down to extol the Governor's virtues.
In addition, Mr. Martinez's campaign has already spent more than $1 million on television advertisements, which appear to have done little to bolster the Governor's standing.
But Mr. Stipanovich said he was not worried. ''I've got more than $6 million tucked away in the bank, and I expect we'll have at least $12 million to fund the campaign,'' he said.
''Money, money, money,'' retorted Mr. Chiles. ''That's the classic politics of the Reagan-Bush age. We're here to give people an opportunity to change that.''

HEADLINE: Many Interests at Stake as Farm Act Is Rewritten

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Addressing a trade group the other day, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter complained that he had ''taken a lot of flak'' for supposedly seeking to cut farm subsidies by $1.5 billion when he actually favored a $2 billion increase.
But after the speech he said it would be a good thing if American farmers could become less dependent on the Government without quite bringing himself to say they are now too dependent on Government subsidies. As a Nebraska farmer himself, he knows that opinions on subsidies are very subjective.
The ears of the lawmakers are being filled with more divergent views than ever. Congress began heavy bargaining this week in its twice-a-decade rewriting of the rules governing what remains one of the most efficient American businesses in terms of production. And with a concerted interest from urban lawmakers in cutting back on what they feel are overgenerous and ill-targeted subsidies. 
The debate this time is also being conducted as the Bush Administration seeks to eliminate subsidies for agriculture products around the world through an international agreement.
 
Reagan Legacy an Expansion
But so great is the subsidy momentum that American agriculture stands out as the one major domestic area in which the legacy of Ronald Reagan's Adminmistration is vast expansion of the Government's role rather than reduced Government involvement.
In the 1980's, crop subsidies cost the Government $133.5 billion, with $89 billion of that spent since 1985, when Congress last rewrote the farm law, passing amendments intended to control production to prevent huge surpluses by lowering Government subsidies for farm products.
Under the farm subsidy program, which applies to 14 farm products, the the Government pays cash to farmers for every bushel they produce - the payment for corn, for example, is about $1 a bushel - in exchange for a promise that they will leave a specified amount of land fallow. While the 1985 legislation lowered the price the Government paid the farmers for a bushel, more farmers joined the program, bringing the record subsidies.
But as crop prices rose sharply in the wake of the 1988 drought, farmers have earned record incomes and subsidies have fallen over the last two years.
The Administration proposed spending $10.2 billion on price and income supports next year, a reduction critics said represented a cut of $1.5 billion from the $11.7 billion that would probably be spent under long-standing budget policy assumptions. Mr. Yeutter contends that the $10.2 billion should properly be compared with a lower outlay projected at $8.2 billion for the current fiscal year.
 
'It Has Become Addictive'
As an increasing share of agriculture comes under Federal benefit programs in a period of general budget stringency, some economic experts are arguing that farming has developed an undue dependence on Government aid. Eight years ago, for example, less than 30 percent of the nation's corn acreage was enrolled in Government benefit programs. By the 1986-1988 period, the participation rate rose to 88 percent before easing a bit last year. Benefits seem likely to be extended this year to soybean growers, who have previously sought little from the Government.
''It has become addictive,'' said Robert L. Thompson, dean of agriculture at Purdue University. ''It is extremely difficult to scale down subsidies to farmers when you've had 50-plus years of them,''
In addition to the direct costs, the subsidies and controls on supplies tend to raise the prices that the nation's consumers pay for food. For example, in the case of peanuts, American consumers pay well above what foreigners pay for the same peanuts.
While Congress, the Administration and farmers all seem satisfied with the level of Federal support in this election year, the 1990 farm bill is expected to arouse intense debate over the allocation of this money. Already, the Subcommittee on Wheat, Soybeans and Feed Grains has been caught up in budget-breaking proposals that will probably be undone before the full Agriculture Committee starts its deliberations early next month.
 
Challenge From Urban Areas
This year's farm bill will also be spiced by an rare challenge from legislators representing urban and suburban districts who have tired of the near monopoly that farm-state colleagues have long exercised over the legislation.
In the past, a member like Representative Silvio O. Conte, a Massachusetts Republican, would assail an individual program like the $100 million in support of the nation's beekeepers in 1988, but the far bigger sums for corn and other major crops have gone largely uncontested. Farm-state legislators have long proved extremely skilled at forming alliances with urban legislators with constituents interested in benefits like food stamps and school lunches.
But this year Representatives Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Dick Armey, a Dallas Republican, are recruiting members they hope will bring drastic reductions in programs like the $100 million or more in annual subsidy for producers of wool and mohair. Wool has not been designated a strategic material for 30 years and much of the money goes to large meat companies. The group wants to curb the major subsidy programs as well.
''This is the first time that a coalition from outside is going to scrutinize the farm bill,'' Mr. Schumer said. He sees the group as filling a hole in the Congressional system in which a few million farmers have long exercised exceptional political power. One Government survey found that barely 10 percent of the House members represent districts with dominant agricultural sectors.
The Schumer-Armey strategy will emphasize applying a means tests to subsidy payments. Critics complain that many big subisidies are going to large farming corporations. In addition, many family farming operations have avoided maximum limits by subdividing their farms.
 
Drive for End of Subsidies
One of the most delicate tasks for the United States will to maintain its drive for an end to all agricultural subsidies deemed to distort trade while maintaining, or even expanding, its own.
In February, when the Administration unveiled its farm proposal, the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, promptly assailed it as ''sending the wrong signal'' in a year in which the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is to complete its work. Mr. McSharry complained specifically that Washington sought to ''increase the destabilizing effects of an aggressive'' policy to subsidize exports, a major feature of the 1985 farm bill.
Rather than to see the United States pass a new five-year farm bill that might be difficult to amend if the negotiations are successful, the Europeans would prefer that a stop-gap measure be passed here and then fresh legislation be drawn in light of any agreement.
Secretary Yeutter said, ''I don't see any inconsistency there at all,'' adding that the the United States will not engage in ''unilateral disarmament.''
 
'A Worldwide Intention'
John A. Schnittker, a private consultant, says that while many of his colleagues doubt the goal will be achieved, he remains optimistic. ''There is a worldwide intention of governments to reduce trade-distorting subsidies,'' he said. ''I see this as the wave of the future.''
At the same time, environmentalists are seeking to limit the use of fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals as a way to protect water supplies and fresh foods. This could possibly threaten Government subsidy payments, as farm programs support crops that use heavy doses of chemicals and are associated with severe soil erosion.
''The programs reward farmers for specializing in program crops year after year, resulting in further soil depletion and pest problems, which in turn lead to a greater need for agrichemical inputs,'' a study by the General Accounting Office states.
There is also a proposal to expand the coverage of a provision of the 1985 law that bars farm program benefits for farmers who convert wetlands into tilled fields.
But Congressional sources expect the environmentalists will not make major headway until the next farm bill, and when they do they will rely heavily on possibly expensive incentives rather than prohibitions.

HEADLINE: The Bush Message to Vilnius: Talk

 BODY:
For days, Administration officials have been floating stories suggesting that the United States would impose sanctions against the Soviet crackdown in Lithuania. Yesterday President Bush did the right thing - nothing. And he chose to do it at the right time.
Mikhail Gorbachev has now made clear that he is asking Lithuanian leaders to suspend their declaration of independence, not to withdraw it, and to proceed toward expedited independence based on the Soviet Constitution. That represents a fair basis for talks between Moscow and Vilnius and it deserves support, not sanctions, from the West. 
Dialogue is what Mr. Bush has been urging for weeks. And to those who had been pressing him to hit Moscow with economic sanctions, he responded: ''I am concerned that we not do anything that would cause the Soviet Union to take action that would set back the cause of freedom around the world.''
It may be hard to get the full impact of this message across to the Lithuanians. As long as some leaders in Vilnius think they can establish their independence instantly by precipitating a world crisis, there's little incentive for them to settle even for reasonable dialogue. The Lithuanian people are already feeling the bite of Moscow's oil and natural gas squeeze. But some Lithuanian leaders may have calculated that the Soviet embargo would compel the West to retaliate, even at the risk of a crisis, forcing the West to rush to their side. These leaders would have been encouraged by the recent reports implying that Mr. Bush was about to suspend Soviet-American trade and commercial talks.
The mystery is whether Mr. Bush or any of his top aides ever really contemplated such a step, and if so, why. Polls show Americans do not want to sacrifice support for Mr. Gorbachev's reforms in order to press for immediate Lithuanian independence. Almost all European leaders and influential members of Congress feel the same way.
Instant independence for a ''captive nation'' is a seductive but oversimplified cause. President Bush has wisely and consistently resisted it. He has urged Moscow to move along toward Lithuanian independence - and Mr. Gorbachev has been doing that. Now Mr. Bush is sending the Lithuanians two signals as gracefully as he can: The United States won't precipitate an East-West crisis over Lithuania. The time has come to talk to Moscow.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua's Second Revolution

 BODY:
Nothing happens tidily in Nicaragua. That's conspicuously true in today's landmark transfer of power from President Daniel Ortega to his conservative opponent, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Her succession is marred by defiance among the Sandinistas and die-hard contras, paralyzing strikes and unresolved arguments over the armed forces. Still, today marks a wonderful change in climate for Nicaragua and all the Americas. 
After a decade of brutal conflict, Nicaraguans can now glimpse the promise of peace and economic recovery. This is a yearning no leader can ignore. If the Sandinistas were confounded by Mrs. Chamorro's victory, so were people who insisted that only force would end Mr. Ortega's one-party autocracy. Regional pressure for peace, a shift in U.S. policy, a fading cold war - all this, combined with fatigue, has banked the fiery passions that made Nicaragua a battleground.
It would be unwise to expect miracles from Mrs. Chamorro. She leads a divided coalition and inherits an economy ravaged by war, sanctions, inflation and mismanagement. Her country has little experience with democracy. The Government contains some of her most dogmatic adversaries. But she and her team won a fair election and negotiated a transition, though the roughest patch remains -deciding finally whether to retain Humberto Ortega, the outgoing President's brother, as interim chief of the armed forces.
A democratic process is now in place for settling arguments without bloodshed. As the widow of the La Prensa editor whose murder in 1978 ignited Nicaragua's first revolution, Mrs. Chamorro personifies the cause of freedom. But elections and an unfettered press alone can't create jobs or grow crops. Her new Government needs and deserves U.S. help, beginning with the $300 million aid package still languishing in Congress.
President Reagan sought ceaselessly to crush the Sandinistas through a proxy insurgency. The war divided Americans without resolving the argument over its wisdom or morality. It produced the Iran-contra scandal. And it left Nicaragua's economy in ruins.
President Bush chose a different course. He compromised with Congress on ending arms aid to the contras and supported the regional peace initiative that led to Mrs. Chamorro's victory.
Such bipartisanship bodes well for Nicaragua - but only if those in Congress who opposed the war now vote for reconstruction. Their support is a debt owed to a neighbor striving to secure a democratic revolution.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Helping Migrant Students Beat the Odds in School

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARLIER, Calif., April 18

 BODY:
All her life, Christina Garza has worn the path between this small agricultural town and Texas, moving with her parents and the crops.
From April until October, her parents thin peaches and pick grapes here, near the city of Fresno. When night school is available, Christina, who is 18 years old, works in the field from 6:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., dashing home for a shower and five hours of school.
In California, Christina studies from one set of textbooks under one group of teachers with one set of friends. In the fall, another harvesting season beckons in Texas - along with another set of textbooks, another group of teachers, and schools that do not honor the independent-study program California offers to help her make up missed credits. 
Christina is one of the lucky migrant students who have managed, through hard work and help from special state programs, to excel in school and aim for college. But educating the 168,000 children of migrant workers in California (nearly a third of the estimated half a million such students nationally) poses a formidable challenge.
Most come to school from Spanish-speaking homes, and lag behind in English. Many face pressure to stay home to care for younger children, or to work to bring home more money for families in desperate need. Many of their parents are too exhausted after long work days to deal with teachers, or are wary of communication with school officials.
 
Measuring the Problems
Statistics are hard to come by because migrant children change schools so often, although a computerized transcript service in Little Rock, Ark., is helping to keep track of their performance. Robert Welty, a consultant in California's migrant education office, said 78 percent of California's migrant schoolchildren had limited English abilities in kindergarten. The rate improves slightly by senior year of high school, when 49 percent still have trouble with English.
Almost one-third have to repeat a year of kindergarten. Eighty-one percent score below grade level in reading, and 67 percent score below grade level in mathematics. Dropout rates are high, reaching 70 percent in some parts of the state. They average 37 percent, higher than California's statewide rate of 22 percent but better than a national migrant drop-out rate estimated at about 50 percent, Mr. Welty said.
Some problems are unique to migrant students: teachers who give up on them because they appear in their classrooms for only a few months at a time; teasing from children who see them as outsiders; school transcripts and health records that get lost along the way.
Alia Espinosa, a daughter of migrant workers who now counsels migrant students and their parents at Parlier High School, tells of children placed in one grade in California and a different grade in Texas in the course of one school year, of families so poor they had to ask for what a napkin was used for, of countless visits home to parents without telephones in migrant camps.
California is among the leaders in devising ways to help these students, with a range of programs designed to bolster their shaky self-confidence, enlist their parents, introduce them to college life, pair them with successful former migrant students, allow them to make up for classes missed because of parents' moves, and improve weaknesses in English, reading and mathematics.
 
Buses Sent to Camps
In California, these programs are voluntary, intended to supplement public education, which is open to them whether or not their parents are citizens. Migrant students attend regular public schools, which send buses and parent-liaison workers to the camps to make sure students get to school.
The main thrust is not to go over what is already taught in school, said Randolph Guerrero, himself a child of migrant workers who now runs a new arts program for migrant students. Instead, the programs offer extra help.
In the town of Santa Fe Springs near Los Angeles, Josefa Wann tries to teach students whose moves from place to place leave them painfully shy and academically behind. She holds up a painting entitled ''The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,'' a dark, futuristic work enlivened by the flash of light from a church steeple and a winding road.
Then she shows a Van Gogh landscape, bright and pastel and impressionistic. The children quickly identify shapes in the paintings, understand the use of light to delineate time of day and mood, and immediately recognize the name of Van Gogh -''He's the one who cut off his ear.'' They hear the story of Paul Revere and then compose their own landscapes in watercolors - combining history, geometry and art appreciation in one lesson.
Mrs. Wann, who is being trained in the special arts education program run by Mr. Guerrero for the Los Angeles County Office of Education, finds that art can be a way to reach migrant children who are shy of speaking out. ''At the beginning, they may not talk to me,'' she said. ''But if I ask them, 'Make a picture of your family,' then that's the first step to communication.''
 
Learning From California
California was a pioneer in allowing students like Christina to make up for lost classroom time by giving her credit for supervised independent study, a program that has now spread to several other states. And the state is using a reading program designed in New Zealand to help Jairo Rios catch up with his second-grade classmates. Jairo sits on a folding chair in a tiny trailer that shakes every time someone moves. His teacher at Pacific Union Elementary School, Carol Strum, is quiet as he reads from a book called ''The Long, Long Tail.''
''There is a tail on the steps,'' he reads, hesitating slightly.
''Look at that word again,'' Mrs. Strum says. ''Look at the ending.'' ''Stairs,'' he says. At the end of his half-hour session, Jairo chooses two books to take back with him to his classroom and two to take home to read to his parents. This is one way the program reaches out to parents, who may get more exposure to spoken English this way and a better understanding of what their children are learning.
Four weeks ago, Mrs. Strum said, Jairo could barely read. ''That one-on-one is wonderful,'' said his regular teacher, Sherry Wood, who cannot spare much time from her busy classroom for intensive personal reading instruction. ''It's really helped children I know would have been lost.''
Students like Christina Garza are the success stories, but not all do so well against the odds they face. Christina knows 12 classmates, pressed by their parents to help them in the fields, who have not returned to school this year. ''The kids say, 'I came here to work,' and I can't get this idea out of their minds,'' Mrs. Espinosa said. ''They say, 'Who will buy me new clothes if I don't work?' ''
In general, said Mr. Masla and Robert L. Allen, Fresno County's administrator of migrant education, it is harder to persuade older children to take advantage of the migrant programs, but those that do are often the best students, like Christina. To reach out further, Fresno and some other counties offer programs for low-achieving junior high and high school students, programs like Goals for Youth, in which former professional football players encourage them to set weekly goals they can meet, as well as take field trips and talk with them. Other programs place such students on college campuses for a few weeks in the summer. The programs have helped lower the dropout rate in Fresno County, Mr. Allen said.
Yet the economic pressures still keep many older children out of school. Versava Pena is a 29-year-old mother of two children who has worked in the Parlier fields in harvesting season for more than 10 years. In October, she and her husband return to Texas, where they go on welfare until they can return to California and find work. They earn $4.25 an hour picking grapes or $4.35 an hour thinning peaches, working at least nine hours a day.
In many ways, Mrs. Pena is lucky. In Parlier she has a clean apartment with running water, electricity, refrigerator, stove and a nearby coin laundry. The apartment costs $3.75 a day, and she can put her young son Roel in day care at the camp at 5 A.M. and go to work. But she and her husband barely earn enough to pay the bills.
But despite the efforts Mrs. Espinosa and others make to reach out to parents, Mrs. Pena does not seem to know about the special programs her third-grade son can get as a child of migrant workers. ''I don't think he gets extra help,'' she said. ''I haven't heard of any problems.''
She is worried about the toll the family's moves take on his grades and reading ability. But by the end of the day, when she is worn out from work, she must still cook and clean and care for her children. There is not much time for parent meetings.

Black Identity vs. Success and Seeming 'White'

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
Many black students may perform poorly in high school because of a shared sense that academic success is a sellout to the white world, according to a study by two anthropologists.
This phenomenon may be one of the subtlest and most insidious among the many social and economic factors that contribute to generally lower academic performance by blacks than whites, said one of the anthropologists, Signithia Fordham.
''Fear of acting white and fear of becoming the other was a motivating factor in underachievement in the school context,'' said Miss Fordham, describing her two years of research at a predominantly black high school in Washington. ''Schoolteachers and school officials didn't understand how difficult it was.'' 
The study by Miss Fordham, who teaches anthropology at Rutgers University, and John U. Ogbu, a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, has caused debate among educators, adding to already widespread disagreement over the causes of underachievement among black students.
 
Reaction of Educators
James Comer, a professor of child psychiatry at Yale University, said black youths internalized messages about being black that were transmitted by society.
Professor Comer said fear of ''acting white'' could be a factor among ''non-mainstream-oriented poor black children,'' but not among middle-class black children.
On the other hand, Wade Nobles, director of the Center for Applied Cultural Studies and Educational Achievement at San Francisco State University, said black underachievement in education cut across socioeconomic lines.
If fear of ''acting white'' does play a role, Mr. Nobles said, it comes in a context in which ''black children learn relatively early that their attempt to achieve is not rewarded in the school system.''
At high schools like the one studied by Miss Fordham, teachers and students tended in interviews to express far more concern about the larger socioeconomic factors that bear on academic performance. Poverty, broken homes, a low level of education among parents, an absence of parental involvement and poor societal role models were described as major causes for underachievement.
 
Context for Problem
Miss Fordham said it was precisely in this context that the problem she describes arose. ''If it weren't for those other things, the poverty and the unemployment, the lack of access to the world of success, I don't think the fear of acting white, the burden of acting white, would be a problem,'' she said. ''Kids are worried about being cut off by their own community and uncertain about being accepted by the other community.''
According to the study, which was published in 1986 and Miss Fordham is now expanding into a book, ''What appears to have emerged in some segments of the black community is a kind of cultural orientation which defines academic learning in school as 'acting white,' and academic success as the prerogative of white Americans.''
The study argues that this grows out of the low expectations that white Americans have of blacks, low expectations that have taken root among the blacks themselves.
At Capital High School in Washington, Miss Fordham, who is black herself, said she found that it was important to the students to maintain a black identity. To this end, she said, some black students shunned schoolwork.
 
'White' Behavior Avoided
''They chose to avoid adopting attitudes and putting in enough time and effort in their schoolwork because their peers (and they themselves) would interpret their behavior as 'white,' '' the study said.
Along with academic success, it listed more than a dozen other types of behavior that the students considered ''acting white.''
These included speaking standard English, listening to so-called white music, going to the opera or ballet, studying in the library, going to the Smithsonian Institution, doing volunteer work, camping or hiking, putting on airs and being on time.
Those students who do work hard in school often adopt strategies to camouflage the fact, like excelling in sports or clowning or acquiring the protection of a bully, the study said.
This assertion met with some skepticism from other educators, including Bill Bibbiani, director of research and testing for the Pasadena Unified School District in California. He said hard-working students of all races had been taunted as grinds and nerds.
''I don't know that black people have cornered the market on teasing people about academic achievement,'' said Mr. Bibbiani, who is white.
At Pasadena High School, a racially mixed school, some administrators said the study matched some of their experience.
 
'Do Not Want to Seem White'
''I have talked with students over the years who do not want to identify with white society,'' said Kathy Lesley, an assistant principal who is black. ''I have run across blacks who do not want to seem white. If they achieve, they might fall into that category.''
Echoing the opinion of several teachers and black students interviewed at the school, Larry Cash, a dean of students who is also black and whose father shined shoes for a living, said black students should not worry about things like ''acting white.'' Instead, he said, they can profit from applications of the same kind of determination and parental encouragement as any other students.
Nevertheless, Mr. Cash agreed that black students often suffered from an absence of black role models of academic achievement, and said this might contribute to a sense that academics was a white province.
He said that for this reason he wanted his own sons to attend an all-black college for at least one year. ''I want them to see that there are a lot of black people out there doing something, that there are a lot of black educated people,'' he said.
In their study, Miss Fordham and Mr. Ogbu agree that their findings should be considered in a context of other factors that affect the academic performance of black students.
She said ''the kids got two contrasting ideas from the civil rights movement, which sought integration, and the ensuing black power movement, which sought to strengthen black identity: ''They are seeking integration, but they fear the thought of not being themselves any more.''
At the same time, she said, there was an assumption among many whites that integration meant accepting white values.
''The message was: 'You've got to act white in order to succeed. You've got to be a carbon copy of us,' '' she said. ''I believe that resistance is at the heart of black life in America. Black children resist these efforts to make them white.''

Harvard Picks Rosovsky For Post of Acting Dean

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 24

 BODY:
Henry Rosovsky, one of the most respected figures in American higher education, has been named acting dean of Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, resuming a job he left six years ago.
He is replacing A. Michael Spence, who resigned unexpectedly last month to become dean of the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, while a permanent replacement is sought. 
The appointment of Mr. Rosovsky, a 63-year-old economist, was greeted with enthusiasm by many professors and administrators at Harvard. As dean of the faculty from 1973 to 1984, Mr. Rosovsky guided the biggest reform of Harvard's curriculum in decades, and helped bring the university's budget under control.
In making the announcement today, Harvard's president, Derek Bok, said, ''To my great relief, Henry Rosovsky has agreed to assume this responsibility.'' Mr. Bok said Mr. Rosovsky would assume his new duties on July 1.
''It's what we need most in this very difficult sitution created by Mike Spence's sudden departure,'' said Roderick MacFarquhar, a professor of government who is on a newly created committee to find a replacement for Mr. Spence.
Mr. Spence's resignation caught Harvard by surprise and touched off some resentment toward him, in part because the university is planning a huge fund-raising campaign, with a reported goal of $2 billion, and Mr. Spence would have been a key figure in the drive.
Mr. Rosovksy played down the significance of his return to the dean's office. ''My son compared me to Dwight Evans,'' the aging right fielder of the Boston Red Sox, Mr. Rosovsky said. ''He said I'm too old to play regularly, but I can step in as a designated hitter.''

About Education

BYLINE: By Fred M. Hechinger

 BODY:
Why is college so expensive? The question won't go away until parents get more believable answers.
''At some point, families will become sensitive to the price,'' writes Arthur M. Hauptman. ''We are close to that point now.''
Mr. Hauptman is not a spokesman for disgruntled parents. On the contrary, he is a consultant to the American Council on Education and the College Board, which together sponsored the study, ''The College Tuition Spiral'' (Macmillan Publishing Company). The two organizations are insiders, representing the colleges, rather than outside critics. 
College tuition in the 1980's rose drastically, often at more than twice the inflation rate. In 1981, the peak year, the increase neared 13 percent.
The study identified some reasons why costs skyrocketed.
Faculty salaries had to be raised to protect the quality of teaching and research. In the 1970's, while colleges had to cope with rising fuel costs, health insurance and other expenses, faculty members lost nearly 20 per cent of their purchasing power.
As the college-age population dwindled, recruiting became more important and costly, and efforts to increase the number of students from minority groups added to the cost.
As Federal student aid declined, more of the tuition paid by those who could afford it had to be used for scholarships - a kind of Robin Hood policy of taking from the rich to give to the poor. Donald M. Stewart, president of the College Board, while conceding that colleges would ''have to cut corners somewhere,'' expressed concern that ''aid to needy students could suffer.''
Colleges also point to the high cost of libraries and modern science equipment.
Still, families who are already struggling with inflated housing costs are less patient with explanations, as the annual cost of attending a prestige college creeps up to, and beyond, $20,000, and state university tuition rises as well. The study's sponsors warn about an impending revolt against further increases.
Some colleges, Mr. Hauptman found, have begun to put brakes on tuition. He cited Harvard and Stanford, which imposed hefty increases in the last decade but are planning rises of only 5 or 6 percent in the coming academic year.
While studies conducted on behalf of the higher-education establishment tend to justify or at least explain the high price tag, parents can be expected to ask whether there is any fat in the budget.
One area likely to come under scrutiny is the growth of the campus bureaucracy. A recent report in The Chronicle of Higher Education, a weekly publication, shows dramatic increases in the support staffs of colleges - by more than 100,000 people, or 61 percent, from 1975 to 1985. These are people with academic degrees but without teaching or research functions. They include financial aid counselors, specialists dealing with problems of minorities and the handicapped, auditors, lawyers, coaches, and systems analysts. They do not include executive, administrative, and managerial employees, whose ranks also grew, by 17.9 percent.
In the same period, the number of full-time faculty grew by only 5.9 percent, and service and maintenance personnel actually declined by 4.9 percent. Student enrollment went up by about 9.5 percent.
Part of the reason for the growth in managerial and support staffs, administrators say, is the need to comply with growing state and Federal regulations and to cope with litigation. Others cite many new services to students with special needs, like remedial help and special counseling.
Fund raising, too, does not come cheap.
Still, even some insiders admit that there is academic bloat. Robert V. Iosue, president of York College in Pennsylvania, told The Chronicle, ''Everybody wants to blame somebody else for their inability to control their own appetites.''
Some trimming has begun. In February, Stanford University announced it would reduce its budget by $22 million over 18 months, with emphasis on cutting nonacademic staffs and simplifying administration. Dartmouth plans to eliminate 52 administrative jobs.
The problem of bureaucratic bloat, some observers say, is not confined to education; it is a part of American life. In his recent book, ''Flashbacks: On Returning to Vietnam,'' Morley Safer reported that at one army post near Saigon 22,000 Vietnamese were employed as support staff for 26,000 Americans who were themselves supposed to have been support troops.
Tomorrow's parents may hope that the tuition rise can be stemmed through draining some fat from college budgets. But state and Federal governments could help by making more financial aid available to needy students. This would reduce the pressure on colleges to play Robin Hood, and help them to be able to stop charging high tuition of middle-class parents and students to finance the education of the poor.

HEADLINE: Freshness, Convenience: Juice for Today's Tastes

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
STICKER shock is what orange juice producers have been calling the reaction of shoppers who recoil at prices resulting from a devastating freeze just after Christmas.
The effect on the pocketbook has been compounded as consumer preference has shifted from cheaper frozen concentrate to more expensive ready-to-drink chilled juice. Prices for chilled juice, both pasteurized not-from-concentrate and reconstituted, now range generally from $2.99 to $3.99 for 64 ounces, a half-gallon, in many markets. Frozen orange juice concentrate costs about $1.75 to $2 for a 12-ounce can that makes 48 ounces of juice. During the past 20 years, sales of ready-to-drink chilled juice have been steadily increasing, finally topping frozen concentrate in 1986. Chilled juice now accounts for 57.7 percent of sales in the $3 billion orange juice industry.
''It represents a total reversal of consumer buying habits,'' said Karl Maggard, the senior vice president for sales for Tropicana Products, Inc., a division of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Limited, Today the typical supermarket devotes a vast amount of space in the dairy case to as many as a dozen different kinds of chilled orange juice, both national brands and private label. Some brands are sold in the produce department. Three kinds of products have emerged in the chilled juice category: pasteurized, reconstituted and fresh unpasteurized. 
When tasted at The New York Times, the pasteurized and reconstituted ready-to-drink juices failed to measure up in flavor to juice that had been freshly squeezed and consumed within 30 minutes.
The juices were compared with freshly squeezed orange juice because advertising for these products emphasizes their freshness. Even the unpasteurized fresh juice sold in plastic bottles in the produce section and costing twice the price of the other chilled juices was judged to be inferior to the truly fresh.
To many Americans ''fresh'' orange juice has come to mean juice from a freshly opened container. While there might be a slight decline in sales because of high prices, said Pierre Ferrari, the senior vice president for consumer marketing for Coca-Cola Foods, once the initial shock over prices wears off, consumers are expected to go right on buying chilled juice and not switch back to frozen concentrate.
''Convenience and perceived freshness are extremely important to today's consumers,'' said Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing Corporation, a research and consulting firm. ''They don't even want to be bothered mixing.''
Chilled juice, said Mr. Maggard of Tropicana, ''has reached a point in acceptability that people will buy it no matter what because it has become a household staple.''
Mr. Maggard went on, ''Our consultants have been assuringus that despite the price increases, the product category will continue to maintain its position vis-a-vis frozen concentrate.''
He also suggested that consumers concerned about water quality may be driven to buying chilled juice because it does not have to be mixed with tap water.
The most popular is juice that is squeezed and pasteurized, then bottled and shipped to market. The juice is often held in storage, frozen, then thawed before being pasteurized, bottled and shipped in order to assure supplies during the off-season.
Tropicana, made since 1947, is the leading brand. Minute Maid Premium Choice, introduced by Coca-Cola Foods in late 1988, is in second place, followed by Fresh 'n Natural, a brand packed by a cooperative in Florida and owned by Citrus World Inc. These brand rankings were confirmed by Mr. Bellas.
Reconstituted juice, the second most popular category, is made by diluting frozen orange juice concentrate in the processing plant with purified water, then bottling it. Minute Maid is the leading brand. Tropicana's reconstituted juice is in second place, with Citrus Hill by Procter & Gamble in third.
Another form, sold as fresh, unpasteurized juice, commands a tiny fraction of the market. Oranges are squeezed in Florida, and the juice is shipped in bulk to be bottled in the marketing area.
Sales of chilled juice are strongest in the Northeast, which accounts for 40 percent of total sales, and especially in the New York area, where 17 percent of the juice produced in the United States is consumed. ''New York is the epicenter of juice consumption,'' Mr. Maggard said. ''We call it the citrus bowl.''
''New York was the original sales area for Tropicana when it first came on the market and that's where the habit of drinking chilled juice became ingrained,'' he added.
Although Minute Maid is the leading brand of frozen concentrate and outsells Tropicana on the West Coast, its Premium Choice not from concentrate is only sold in the Northeast and in Florida.
''We introduced Premium Choice because we saw there was a large and profitable market in the East that was basically controlled by a single brand and we saw an opportunity there,'' said Mr. Ferrari of Coca-Cola Foods.
Many of the chilled juices come in a strained variety, preferred by children, and one with bits of pulp, preferred by adults.
Not-from-concentrate juices are often called premium. ''The experts find the products to have a fresher, fruitier taste,'' Mr. Ferrari said. While the juice is not evaporated using a heat and vacuum process, the way frozen concentrate is, it is still heated during the pasteurization process. ''People call it fresh but it's technically not fresh juice because it has been pasteurized,'' Mr. Maggard said.
Chilled juice is not only more expensive, it is not necessarily better tasting and comes packed in large plastic-treated cartons or plastic half-gallon bottles instead of small cardboard cans. It also may be less nutritious than frozen concentrate.
The United States Department of Agriculture says that about six ounces of chilled juice provides 66 milligrams of vitamin C compared with 78 milligrams in six ounces of frozen concentrate or 100 milligrams in fresh squeezed. The recommended daily allowance for vitamin C is 60 milligrams.
''And toward the end of its longer shelf life the pasteurized juice will deliver even less,'' said Mr. Ferrari.
But Chip Bettle, senior vice president for technology for Tropicana, said special packaging introduced in the past four years prevents loss of vitamin C for pasteurized juice in an unopened container. ''The Government's data may have been developed before this packaging was fully in use by the major brands,'' he said.
Nutrition aside, when it comes to beverages that can be kept on hand in the refrigerator ready to drink, chilled juice still may be one of the best.
When tasted, the juice that was considered most like fresh was Just Pik't, a brand that is squeezed fresh in Florida, then frozen without further processing. It is sold in the frozen food section of markets around the nation. It was sweeter tasting than the fresh juice, but it tended to separate faster and actually seemed a bit pulpier.
At one time Just Pik't, which costs $1.99 to $2.19 nationally for 33 ounces, was considerably more expensive than chilled juice. But the recent price increases for chilled juice have made it more competitive. ''Instead of increasing our prices we have stopped offering promotions,'' said Steven Smith, president of Fresh Juice Inc. in Great Neck, N.Y., which makes the product.
Because of the freeze, the 1989-1990 harvest amounted to 103.1 million boxes of oranges as of April 10, compared with 146.6 million boxes for that date for the 1988-89 crop. Experts with the Florida Department of Citrus refused to predict the dimensions of next season's crop but they estimate it will again be small.
''We anticipate a continued limitation,'' said Dr. Robert Behr, economic research director for the department. ''It will be a good two years before we can expect any normalization.''
Dr. Behr and others stress that by next year quality should improve because unless there is another serious freeze, processors would not have to use any fruit that was damaged in the freeze. Since the late 1970's, the Florida citrus industry has gradually been moving south, below the freeze belt, and will probably continue to do so.
In the meantime, any shortfall in Florida production is made up, increasingly, by frozen concentrate from Brazil. The amount used this year was double last year. To further capitalize on the Florida shortage, Brazilian producers raised prices by more than 50 percent this year.
''The availability of the foreign crop has prevented orange juice from being as expensive as wine,'' said Harvey Haller, executive vice president of Haller Brothers Corp., a packer and processor in Winter Garden, Fla. ''The demand is increasing but supplies are lower than what they were at the beginning of the decade.''
The demand for chilled not-from-concentrate juice has increased the pressure on the Florida crop. In 1987-88 less than 20 percent of the crop was used to make chilled juice, which this season will account for close to 30 percent.
''It's our fondest hope that the trend toward chilled juice will continue because it means the juice has to be produced in Florida,'' Mr. Haller said. ''It's our one insulation against foreign competition.''

HEADLINE: How Do You Fix A Broken Planet?

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

 BODY:
PATTY FREEMAN DORSON is not unlike many other Americans trying to do their part when it comes to the environment.
She separates glass bottles from her family's trash so they can be recycled and asks for paper bags, rather than plastic, at the supermarket checkout counter.
Still, Mrs. Dorson, a 34-year-old Indianapolis lawyer, is confused about what else she can do to ''save the planet,'' particularly after she discovered that the more expensive ''photodegradable'' garbage bags she used to buy are no more beneficial to the environment than other kinds.
''It's hard to know what to do,'' said Mrs. Dorson, whose husband, Roland, spent Earth Day planting lilies and raspberries in the backyard. ''It's all so overwhelming.'' 
Earth Day 1990 has come and gone, and there is no question that a subtle but powerful change has taken place across the country in how Americans perceive the dangers facing the environment and what they are prepared to do to help. Survey after survey conducted in conjunction with Sunday's Earth Day festivities found that the environment ranks with unemployment and the economy as a major national concern. According to a recent New York Times/CBS poll, for example, 71 percent of Americans said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to clean the environment and 56 percent said they favored protecting the environment even if it meant a loss of jobs in their communities.
But as debate continues over long-term solutions and confusion mounts about just how effective individuals can be, environmentalists and others say they are concerned that the public may become apathetic and disillusioned about the environment, as it did about the energy crisis.
''What worries me is that people will say the heck with it and turn away,'' said Barry Commoner, one of the early leaders of the environmental movement and the author, most recently, of ''Making Peace with the Planet'' (Pantheon Books, $19.95).
The problem is that now that Americans have been made aware of the staggering problems facing the environment and are actually taking steps to do their part, they want to be assured that their efforts have an impact. Claims by manufacturers trying to tap environmental concerns with promises that certain products are ''environmentally friendly'' when in fact many are no different from other products have added to the confusion. (Some manufacturers counter that they are helping to clarify the issue with such labels and that, compared to other products, theirs are indeed ''environmentally friendly.'') The confusion has been magnified by disagreement among scientists about solutions. The growing awareness, for example, that garbage buried in landfills does not decompose even after long periods has set off alarms with consumers, who feel they have been misled. So have conflicting claims over the biodegradibility of plastics.
''We have a real sense of a need to be good to the environment and to do our part, but there is a real sense of confusion as to what our part is,'' said Dr. William L. Rathje, professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona and director of the Garbage Project, which has been digging up landfills across the country for the past 17 years in to determine just what happens to the nation's garbage over time. ''There is a crisis mentality that we have to act now. But we have no information on how to act.''
Kevin Hardie, executive director of the Central States Glass Recycling Program, a nonprofit office providing information about recycling to communities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, says confusion among scientists and conflicting commercial claims directly affect the public.
''People want to do the right thing,'' Mr. Hardie said. ''But they don't know what the right thing is.''
Amy Burger, a 40-year-old homemaker and mother of two living in Montclair, N.J., for example, is confused about whether any plastic in products she buys at her local grocery store is truly recyclable. (According to the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental organization in Washington, only 1 percent of all plastic produced in this country is actually recycled - despite many manufacturers' claims - because there are so few plastic recycling plants.) This misconception about plastics underscores an even larger misunderstanding about recycling. Just because a consumer sets aside paper, glass, aluminum cans or anything else for recycling does not necessarily mean that these goods are actually recycled. Barry J. Cutler, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the recycling of products depends largely on whether there are enough recycling plants available in a particular locale.
Debbie Romano, a writer living in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, is confused about what commercially available cleaning products, if any, are ecologically sound. Some environmental groups urge boycotting all commercial cleansers and using only natural ingredients like vinegar and baking soda. A spokesman for the Clorox Corporation, which manufactures chlorine bleach and other cleaning products, countered by saying consumers should have a choice in such matters and should be made aware that certain chemicals in commercial cleansers serve as disinfectants as well as having other advantages.
Rae Evenson, who works part time in her husband's dental office in Houston, Minn., is confused over recycling claims being made on packages of cups made of plastic foam. ''I'm trying to be conscientious,'' Mrs. Evenson said. ''But it's hard to know what to do.''
Kevin Kelleher, recycling coordinator for the county where Mrs. Evenson lives, says the cups are not recycled. But when citizens in his community separate them out of the trash for recycling, Mr. Kelleher instructs his workers to pick them up because not to do so ''would be a slap in the face.'' The cups are sent to a landfill.
For all of these Americans, daily life has become a balancing act between their desires to help the environment and their needs for personal convenience at a time when experts themselves disagree.
There is sharp disagreement, for example, over whether recycling or making products biodegradable is the more appropriate avenue for the nation to pursue in solving the nation's solid waste crisis. So is the issue of creating additional landfills or using incinerators. Overwhelmed, perhaps, by these larger issues as well as by such cosmic notions as saving the rain forest or repairing the damaged ozone layer, many Americans nevertheless seem to be making their peace with the issues, adopting behavior they hope will ultimately prove beneficial.
It was not until she became pregnant last year, for example, that Mrs. Dorson of Indianapolis had to come to terms with disposable diapers. Despite her desire to help reduce the nation's solid waste, Mrs. Dorson decided in favor of the disposable diapers for convenience. There is some thought that cloth diapers present other dangers to the environment if they are washed in certain strong detergents, but Mrs. Dorson says she still feels guilty about her decision and, to compensate, she now drives five miles a week to take her glass bottles and aluminum cans to the nearest recycling plant.
''It seems like such a small thing,'' Mrs. Dorson said. ''But at least it's something. It does help your conscience.''
In Montclair Mrs. Burger, who on Earth Day took her family to church where the congregation planted a tree, buys orange juice in cartons at her supermarket and then transfers the juice at home into reusable plastic jugs to reduce her use of plastics. She no longer uses paper napkins or plastic eating utensils in an attempt to teach her children that ''less is more.''
''It is the little things,'' Mrs. Burger said, adding that only by reducing the amount of garbage consumers produce can the country ever gain mastery over its solid waste problem. ''It is how you lead your daily life more than telling the children. You're doing it. You're living it.'' Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, which has helped encourage such consumer awareness, said, ''Everyone can take a small step.''
But it is just these small gestures that other environmentalists, like Mr. Commoner, say offer Americans a false sense of accomplishment.
''It confuses feeling good with having an influence on the problem,'' Mr. Commoner said, arguing that the real power individuals wield is not at their garbage cans but rather in their banding together to demand changes in corporate boardrooms, in much the same way that individuals and groups refused to buy tuna and forced major companies to change the way fish are caught.
Indeed, Mrs. Romano of Brooklyn took her family to the beach for Earth Day. She took along four paper bags so that she, her husband and their three children, could do their part for the day by helping to clean up the beach. But when they arrived at the beach at Jacob Riis Park in Brooklyn, it was so filthy with debris that they just turned around and left without picking up so much as a can.
''There was too much to do,'' said Mrs. Romano, expressing the kind of frustration many Americans feel in the face of such large-scale environmental problems.
As for the future, most experts agree that much will depend on what course the Government ultimately takes on solid waste disposal. Research continues, but in the meantime some fear that the public may turn its attention to other things.
''Ultimately it will depend on the nation's leadership,'' said Dr. Theodore Roszak, a social historian at California State University at Hayward and the author of ''Where the Wasteland Ends'' (Celestial Arts, $14.95). ''Otherwise all this interest in the environment could be a fad that will come and go.''

HEADLINE: Portrait of a Collector: Walter Annenberg

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.

 BODY:
Walter H. Annenberg, publisher, philanthropist, former Ambassador to Britain and high-rolling art acquisitor, doesn't really mind that the J. Paul Getty Museum bagged van Gogh's ''Irises'' in a recent transaction with Sotheby's. ''I like my irises better,'' he said, pointing to a big, lush Monet canvas, ''The Path Through the Irises,'' hanging over a white couch in a sitting area of his Astrodome-sized house here. ''I wouldn't swap them for van Gogh's irises.''
Mr. Annenberg would not confirm reports that he was a heavy bidder on the van Gogh at the 1987 Sotheby's auction when it was sold for a record $53.9 million to the Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, who later had to give up the painting because of financial troubles.
There is no van Gogh shortage, however, at Sunnylands, the luxuriant Annenberg oasis in this desert country. The Ambassador, as he likes to be called, and his wife, Leonore, have five of them, including a floral study similar to ''Irises,'' but whose subject is roses. 
The van Goghs, together with six Monets, six Renoirs, eight Cezannes and works by Fantin-Latour, Degas, Vuillard, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Seurat, Picasso, Braque, Bonnard, Rodin, Giacometti and Arp, are part of what J. Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery of Art, calls ''one of the world's greatest collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art.'' To Whom Will It Go? But about the eventual fate of his collection, the 82-year-old philanthropist is cautious. ''There are two choices of what to do with it,'' he said in a recent interview. ''Either put it up for auction or give it to a great museum. You should have the intuition to know which I'd do.''
He has said he would not divide his collection. What museum it would go to, if it did, has fueled much speculation in the fiercely competitive curatorial world. The three most likely candidates are the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Mr. Annenberg has long had ties with each. He is a trustee of the Metropolitan, Mrs. Annenberg is on the board of the Philadelphia Museum and he is a trustee emeritus of the Metropolitan. As a founding member of the Patron's Fund of the National Gallery, he has given it substantial cash gifts, and has been a member of its collectors' committee from 1975 to 1981. His Washington attachments, his avowed patriotism and the prestige of the National Gallery could also help land the collection.
Last fall Mr. Annenberg gave $20 million to the three institutions for acquisitions: $15 million to the Met and $5 million each to the other two. There are those who say that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where the collection will be shown this summer, should not be ruled out either, since Mr. Annenberg is very fond of Southern California.
 
'He Is a Man of Grand Gestures'
''It's just too early to call it,'' said Joseph J. Rishel, the curator of painting and sculpture before 1900 at the Philadelphia Museum, who organized the touring Annenberg show that opened there last summer. ''He is a man of grand gestures that are in no way predictable.''
If he did give his collection to a museum, Mr. Annenberg said, he would insist that it be kept together. ''There'll be no lending, no deaccessioning,'' he said. ''I have to be very careful. I've spent years worrying about my things. They have great quality uniformly, and I'd be very unhappy if things were pushed out. I couldn't abide that.''
He has given up the idea he had once had of opening his own museum, he added. ''But because of the historic figures who have stayed at Sunnylands, we may set it up as something of a historic house with copies of all the art. I'd leave the furniture and everything else in place except the pictures.''
''We've had five Presidents here,'' said Mrs. Annenberg, a former United States chief of protocol. ''I'd turn over in my grave if it became a golf club.''
Over lunch, served by a snappily uniformed butler, Mr. Annenberg talked of his conviction that museums should serve as educational institutions not only for scholars but also for ''the broad masses.'' He is still stung by the furor over his proposal, in 1976, to give $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum for a communications center to disseminate information about art to a wide audience through films, tapes, slides, reproductions and other devices. After clamorous art world and community opposition to the plan on grounds that the Met would be overextending physically and downgrading intellectually, he withdrew the proposal.
 
'Something for the Public'
''I wanted to do something for the public,'' he said, ''and I still believe in that idea of making all of the world available to all peoples.''
Mr. Annenberg has stepped up his picture buying since 1988, when he sold his publishing empire - TV Guide, Seventeen and The Daily Racing Form - to Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion. Asked what he thought of the soaring prices in the art world over the last decade, he shrugged. ''It's a matter of simple economics - increasing demand and shrinking supply,'' he said. ''So great quality will only go up in value. I don't think prices will go down. I do believe there'll be a day when we'll see a $75 million to $100 million painting at auction.''
Of his collection, Mr. Annenberg said: ''I must have quality. An interest in art grows in you and it takes over. My wife and I set out to get things that we genuinely loved and respected and wanted to live with.''
In pursuit of this aim last fall the couple spent $40.7 million for a 1905 Picasso, ''Au Lapin Agile,'' at a Sotheby auction, and they proudly showed photographs of two more recent acquisitions, paintings by Braque and Fantin-Latour, that were about to be added to their crowded walls. Why Art Is Better Than Securities ''I sold stock to buy the Picasso and these other things because they're much better to look at than securities in a box,'' said Mr. Annenberg, whose charitable donations this year included $50 million to the United Negro College Fund.
The new Braque purchase, a 1939 painting called ''The Studio,'' had first been seen by the couple 35 years ago. ''We loved it but we were too young in those days for modern art, too inexperienced,'' he said. ''I'd been dreaming about it for years as one of my major mistakes, and when I saw the Picasso-Braque show in New York, I began to think about it again. We made inquiries and found out that the Acquavella Gallery in New York had it for sale.''
The Braque, the Picasso and the Fantin-Latour will be added to a show of the Annenberg collection that opens May 6 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and on Aug. 16 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It will be seen in New York at the Metropolitan Museum in the summer of 1991.
The loans, the Annenbergs say, are an exception. They like to keep the paintings at Sunnylands, where they spend four and a half months of the year. At Inwood, their home outside Philadelphia, they have Chippendale and Adam furniture and Lowestoft porcelain to contemplate.
The desert house is an airy extravaganza of glass and Mexican lava-stone walls, pink marble floors and clustered plantings intended to convey an ''outside-inside'' feeling. It sits on a manicured patch of rolling green terrain: 205 acres replete with trees, hills, ponds and waterfalls not exactly native to the desert. The well-guarded spread, on Frank Sinatra Drive in this exclusive estate and country club area, includes a nine-hole golf course.
The English countryside effects were achieved by sod, irrigation and a good golf course architect, Mr. Annenberg explained. ''With the land we bought the water rights,'' he said. ''But then people around here began complaining they couldn't use their sinks and toilets so I sold the rights and got more than what I paid for the land. Then we sank wells.'' Making a House A Part-Time Home The house has ''matured'' since they built it in the early 1960's, explained Mrs. Annenberg, who is affectionately called Mother by her husband. ''When we left London the choice was to put the paintings here or in Philadelphia,'' she said. ''Walter said here. And the collection has changed the house.''
Most of the works are concentrated in the rambling public areas of the house. They mingle with Chinese jades - including a Chien Lung bullock named Walter by Mrs. Annenberg - and porcelains, Meissen jars, Steuben glass and other decorative objects. Mr. Annenberg has a fond relationship with them. ''This is my family. I adore these things,'' he said.
Stopping in front of the new Picasso, whose subject is a harlequin at the cafe called Lapin Agile, he gleefully pointed to a pair of frisky Chinese porcelain rabbits he had placed as accents beneath it.
Stroking a small torso of white marble by Arp that turns on a stand, he eased it around to show its evolution from a slim nude to a pregnant woman. ''What mad person but an artist would think of that?'' he said. ''He really had the power to express something.''
And he revealed his discovery of a correspondence between a Cezanne still life and a landscape. As he sees it, a fold in the napkin surrounding a dish of apples in the still life, hung on one wall, echoes the incline of Mont Saint-Victoire, the artist's obsessive landscape motif, in a watercolor hanging across the room.
He laughingly recalled the purchase, some years ago, of another Mont Saint-Victoire by Cezanne, this one an oil. The New York dealer Wildenstein & Company ''wanted $450,000 for it, and my friend Bobby Lehman was stringing them along,'' he said, referring to the late collector whose holdings now occupy a wing named for him at the Metropolitan Museum. ''Then I bought it, and he pleaded with me to sell it to him. I said, 'Bobby, you blew it!' '' First Purchases: Van Gogh and Monet It was one of his seven sisters, Enid Annenberg Haupt, who started him on collecting, Mr. Annenberg recalled. His first purchases, ''at least 40 or 45 years ago,'' were van Gogh's ''Olive Trees'' and Monet's ''Stroller,'' a portrait of the artist's stepdaugher, Suzanne Hoschede. In 1983 the collection was substantially bolstered by Mr. Annenberg's purchase of 15 works from Mrs. Haupt's own holdings, among them such prizes as Cezanne's ''Portrait of Uncle Dominique as a Monk,'' Gauguin's ''Siesta'' and Matisse's ''Odalisque With Gray Trousers.''
If Sunnylands is something of a shrine to art, it is also a shrine to British royalty and to the Presidents with whom the Annenbergs have had connections. He served as Ambassador to Britain from 1969 to 1974. The sitting area and what the Annenbergs call their ''room of memories'' are filled with photographs and other souvenirs of the royal family. Framed and hanging on the walls of a corridor outside the room of memories are a series of Christmas cards from the Queen Mother, and a group of invitations focused on the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
Also in the room are photographs of Presidents and candidates supported by Mr. Annenberg, among them Wendell L. Willkie, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan.
In the same room hangs a stark 1978 portrait of Mr. Annenberg, looking flinty but noble, by his friend Andrew Wyeth. For the portrait, he is garbed in a choir robe, a cherished at-home outfit. He acquired it, Mr. Annenberg explained, from Whipple, makers of church garments in London. ''We went to a service at Westminster Cathedral and admired the way the choir was dressed,'' he recalls. ''We found they had just got new robes from Whipple, so we went there and ordered a pair for ourselves. They are the most comfortable things in the world for wearing around the house.''

HEADLINE: In Books, Greed Is Out; The Environment Is In

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
If the books people are buying are an indication, a new decade has already ushered in a new mood in America.
Gone from best-seller lists are the books of businessmen like Donald Trump and Lee Iacocca, whose first-person accounts of their successes sold millions of copies and made the authors icons of the 1980's. In their place, a host of successful books have emerged about the newly perceived greed of the last decade, and about the need to place environmental concerns above personal acquisitiveness and unfettered industrial expansion.
Several books scheduled for publication question the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Among them are ''Disorder and Decline: Crime and the Spiral of Decay in American Neighborhoods,'' by William Skogan (Free Press), ''The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath,'' by Kevin Phillips (Random House), and ''The Worst Years of our Lives: An Outsider's View of the 80's,'' by Barbera Ehrenreich (Pantheon). 
''What we are seeing in the books that are selling is the turnaround from the celebration of greed to the denigration of greed,'' said Linda Grey, the president of Bantam Books.
 
Heroes No More
Gary Del Vecchio, president of Doubleday bookstores, said the absence of best-selling business biographies or autobiographies had become a subject of discussion at Doubleday stores. Noting the success of several books on the environment, he said, ''We are seeing an absolute change in the things that readers are focusing on.''
Howard Kaminsky, chief executive of the Hearst Trade Book group, asked: ''What businessmen as heroes are left?''
Publishers perceive a new mood of questioning about exactly what happened during the Reagan years -specifically, whether the making of big fortunes on Wall Street and a rash of debt-financed consumer spending masked deep underlying problems like sagging national competitiveness and the growing gap between rich and poor.
''People feel like they are waking up experiencing the hangover after a smashing good drunkfest,'' said Steve Wasserman, the editorial director of Times Books. ''In the cold morning light, they are assessing a country that seems adrift at a time when all political and economic assumptions are up for grabs.''
Some publishers, including Ms. Grey of Bantam, said they believe it was Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' published in 1987, that initiated the shift to a more critical focus on the Reagan years. More recently, the talk of the New York book-party circuit has been two best-selling books that take critical looks at the frenzied deal-making on Wall Street in the 1980's: ''Barbarians at the Gate,'' by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar (Harper & Row), and ''Liar's Poker,'' by Michael Lewis (W. W. Norton).
 
Saving the Earth Is Popular
This mood of reassessment has also helped make the environment and ecology hot topics in publishing, analysts say. Dozens of books on the subject have been, or are scheduled to be, published.
''A lot of the psychic energy that went into political protest is now finding in the environment an outlet that provides the same sort of pleasures and sense of moral justification,'' said Erwin Glikes, president of the Free Press.
The most successful of the books has been ''50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth,'' self-published by the San Francisco-based Earthworks Press, co-owned by John Javna and Julie Bennett. This has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 12 weeks.
A follow-up book, ''50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth,'' has just been published by Andrews & McMeel, a Kansas publisher, and has had very brisk initial sales, he said.
Donna Martin, vice-president of Andrews & McMeel, said the books were so successful because they suggest something positive people can do about the environment. ''We've been having weird weather here in Kansas - a warm January and now Easter cold, and in the popular perception that's linked to the Amazon burning, the greenhouse effect and acid rain,'' she said. ''People want to get involved. There's a turn from the 'me' to the 'we' decade.'' Another publisher suggested this was the ''re'' decade - one obsessed with recycling.
''Chico Mendes could be a hero for the 90's,'' commented one publisher, referring to the slain Brazilian rubber tapper about whom two books are to appear soon.
 
A Sequel by Trump
Others think business books still have big potential, despite their current slump. Mr. Trump, whose first book, ''The Art of the Deal'' (Random House) has sold more than two million copies, has a second book, ''Trump: Surviving at the Top,'' also scheduled to be published by Random House later this year. ''It's deeper and more poignant than my first, and I think it will do even better,'' he said. Asked about the success of ''Barbarians'' and ''Liar's Poker,'' Mr. Trump said, ''People love reading negative things about successful people.''
Whether or not the new Trump book does well, several publishers said they believed the first book that really addresses America's new questioning mood, and offers solutions, could be very successful. ''People are floundering for a vision, and nobody has yet articulated it,'' Mr. Wasserman said. Mr. Kaminsky said there was thirst for ''a new motivational hero.''
And Mr. Glikes of The Free Press added: ''There is a sense of gridlock in the country, of a pious concern masking the fact problems are not confronted. The first book to really confront them could be very big.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Milken's Plea Reflects Ethics of Drexel in 80's

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Michael R. Milken, the dethroned king of ''junk bonds,'' admitted yesterday that he had cheated some customers, rigged the prices of some stocks and bonds, and engaged in sham transactions designed to fool Federal regulators and help a crony avoid paying taxes.
The six felonies that Mr. Milken acknowledged did not include many serious charges, such as insider trading, that the Federal Government brought last year when it indicted the celebrated financier. These allegations, which went well beyond the wrongdoing that Mr. Milken confessed to, were dropped in the plea bargain that he accepted.
But Mr. Milken's guilty plea nonetheless provided a stark view of the ethical standards that prevailed at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. during the soaring years of the 1980's, when Mr. Milken and his empire of junk were making Drexel perhaps the most powerful firm on Wall Street and certainly the most feared. In 1987, Mr. Milken was paid a stunning $550 million, not counting profits on his investments. 
 
Cutting Legal Corners
The charges he admitted paint a picture of a man who, however brilliant and however wealthy, was willing to cut legal corners in pursuit of further profit. But whatever the portrait of Mr. Milken, nothing that he pleaded to yesterday either proved or disproved that the junk bond phenomenon was bad - although evidence abounds that it enabled many companies to go further into debt than now appears to have been prudent.
''Our business was in no way dependent on these practices,'' Mr. Milken said of the illegal acts he admitted. ''Nor did they comprise a fundamental part of our business and I regret them very much,''
By happenstance, Mr. Milken's plea - and the imprisonment that will almost certainly follow - come as the junk bond market is reeling from defaults by companies unable to pay their debts. Those defaults, only some of which involved securities sold by Drexel, reflect the general weakening of credit standards during the 1980's, as lenders stood willing to finance takeovers of companies that could not earn enough money to pay interest on the loans.
None of the charges against Mr. Milken or the Drexel firm (which previously pleaded guilty to six felony counts covering some of the same ground) asserted that buyers of junk bonds were defrauded because the deals were defective. To the contrary, investors were given written information describing the bonds as very risky. But those warnings were ignored by buyers hungry for high interest rates.
Now, with the series of defaults having scared investors, junk bond prices have fallen sharply, and it is very difficult to sell a new issue of junk bonds. Some nostalgically think that the junk bond market would still be humming if only Mr. Milken were back at his desk in Beverly Hills, Calif., working long hours and finding ways to place hard-to-sell bonds. But it is hard to imagine what he could have done that would have enabled Robert Campeau's Federated Department Stores or Merv Griffin's Resorts International to find the cash to pay its bills.
So the acknowledged felonies do not demolish the widespread assessment of Mr. Milken as the most influential financial innovator of his day. But they do leave an impression that is very unflattering to a man who hoped to become known as the pioneer whose ideas would solve the third world debt problem.
In a less lofty vein, the aspiring financial statesman has now admitted that he shortchanged Drexel's customers. To pay higher commissions to Drexel brokers, he routinely overcharged a mutual fund when that fund bought bonds from Drexel, and he paid too little to the fund when it sold bonds.
That fund, the Finsbury Group Ltd., had been created by Drexel and was sold to overseas investors by Drexel brokers. In effect, the practice stole money from the fund shareholders -the Drexel customers - and gave it to the brokers. The amounts in each trade were small, but they added up to 1 percent of the fund each year, a substantial amount.
As part of an encompassing conspiracy charge, Mr. Milken also admitted to manipulating securities prices. In one case that the Drexel firm acknowledged, though not specifically referred to in Mr. Milken's plea, the manipulation was said to have cost a corporate client a lot of money by driving down the price of its securities just before an offering. Drexel evidently thought that step would make the securities easier to sell and assuredly profitable.
When Ivan Boesky needed to have some stocks taken off his hands so that he could comply with Securities and Exchange Commission rules, Drexel and Mr. Milken admit they obligingly did so, with Mr. Boesky guaranteeing them against losses. When Drexel needed Mr. Boesky to buy and hold some securities, he complied, obtaining similar guarantees. In each case, Mr. Milken admitted aiding Mr. Boesky in filing false reports regarding the transactions.
When David B. Solomon, the money manager who ran the Finsbury Group, concluded in late 1985 that he wanted to pay less taxes, Mr. Milken obligingly arranged for Drexel to sell some bonds to him for $3.1 million and to buy them back a week later for $2.1 million. That created a tax loss for Mr. Solomon, but Mr. Milken promised he would find good investments for him that would more than make up for it. He did so.
The Government previously accused Mr. Milken of twice arranging for Drexel to buy or sell large blocks of securities in order to profit from pending transactions that he had learned about as the investment banker for companies involved in the transactions. But those charges were dropped as part of the plea.
It was Mr. Boesky, once the most prominent speculator in takeover stocks, who provided much, but not all, of the evidence against Mr. Milken. Mr. Boesky was recently released from prison after serving a sentence for violating securities laws.
Mr. Milken, in his statement in court, emphasized that transactions with Mr. Boesky ''never approached 1 percent of the business of our department.'' What is not known, and may never be known, is whether the fraudulent activities that Mr. Milken admits conducting with Mr. Boesky were aberrations at Drexel, or whether they stand out only because Mr. Boesky chose to testify about them after he was caught.
Mr. Milken, who is 43 years old, went to work for a predecessor firm of Drexel as a young graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, having done a study there that concluded that a diversified portfolio of bonds rated below investment grade - the bonds now known as junk bonds - generally ended up being a good investment because the high interest rates paid more than offset losses from defaults.
In those days, virtually all the junk bonds outstanding were ''fallen angels,'' bonds that were believed to be of high quality when they were issued but that had run into trouble because of business reversals for the company that issued them.
Mr. Milken gained early fame by trading those bonds and persuading customers to buy them. He gradually moved to underwriting new issues for smaller firms that could not qualify to issue investment grade bonds, but for which there might be good business prospects. Such companies as Turner Broadcasting, the cable television giant, and MCI Communications, now the second-largest long-distance telephone company, borrowed money through Drexel-issued junk bonds.
Big profits on early junk bonds brought in buyers and created a demand for more bonds. Drexel filled that demand, and credit standards gradually began to deteriorate. ''Bonds were issued to finance nothing more than speculation on the price of companies,'' Hugh Johnson, a market analyst at First Albany Securities, said yesterday. Those bonds could be paid off only if the companies in question, or large parts of them, could be sold for ever-higher prices.
''On Wall Street, there is a rule that every good idea must be driven into the ground like a tomato stake,'' said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a magazine that has been critical of Mr. Milken for years. ''Junk bonds were good ideas that became dangerous ones.''

HEADLINE: Reports Stir Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Government reports provided fresh evidence today that the economy has successfully skirted recession but that it now confronts a problem of stepped-up inflation that may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy this spring.
Orders for durable goods jumped by 6.7 percent in March, the Commerce Department said today, largely because of sharp, unexpected gains in orders for aircraft and motor vehicles.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said wages, salaries and other benefits rose by 5.5 percent in the 12 months that ended in March. The rise in the Employment Cost Index was the most rapid in nearly six years. Employee compensation -pay and fringe benefits - is one of the main determinants of the inflation rate. 
 
Mixed Interpretations
Analysts expressed various degrees of anxiety about the reports, but a typical comment was that of Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York.
''They add up to an economy that's continuing to show signs of strength, with no relief on the inflation front,'' he said. Mr. Beck said that as a result, the Federal Reserve was more likely to decide in the fairly near future to raise interest rates a notch to counter inflation. The central bank's chief policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, is to hold its next formal meeting on May 15.
Other analysts acknowledged that the economy appears markedly stronger than it did a few weeks ago and that inflation needs to be closely watched. But they said no sign of a boom existed and that prices were not showing any real acceleration.
Lyle E. Gramley, the chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington and a former governor of the Federal Reserve, noted that excluding the transportation sector, durable goods orders were up only by 2 percent. The March increase in durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last at least three years, followed a revised 2.3 percent rise in February and was the largest monthly gain since a 7.4 percent rise in December 1988.
 
Backlog at Jet Makers
Aircraft orders will take a particularly long time to have any economic impact since producers, especially the Boeing Company, have large backlogs. Unit labor costs, Mr. Gramley added, still appear to be consistent with a 4.5 percent consumer inflation rate of the last three years.
As a result, the Federal Reserve ''can probably wait and do nothing for six months,'' Mr. Gramley said.
A similar message was offered by Gordon Richards, the economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, another Washington-based industry group. ''The surge in durable goods orders is misleadingly high,'' he said, because of aberrational rebounds in aircraft and automobiles. Mr. Richards also noted that orders increases in February and March did not fully offset a 10.5 percent plunge in January.
''These figures support the view that the economy may experience something of a 'false start' in the second quarter, as business activity picks up due to a series of one-time factors,'' Mr. Richards said. ''However, continued high interest rates, coupled with signs of an impending increase in interest rates overseas, make it likely that the rise in growth will be unsustainable, leading to renewed sluggishness in the third quarter.''
 
G.N.P. Due on Friday
On Friday, the Commerce Department will publish its first estimate of gross national product for the first three months of the year, with most analysts expecting an annual growth rate of 2 percent to 3 percent. Output grew at a 1.1 percent rate during the final quarter of last year.
The majority of economists, unnerved by today's reports, were distressed at the Employment Cost Index, which Norman Robertson of the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh called ''a little ominous.'' Private-sector compensation in health services, for example, has edged up to 7 percent over the last 12 months while educational services have reached 6.4 percent.
But Mr. Robertson contended that while the overall core rate of inflation had now climbed to 5 percent, the Fed might still be reluctant to tighten policy next month. Service inflation, he said, is less affected by higher interest rates than commodity inflation. Moreover, the Fed might be reluctant to raise rates when housing is in poor shape and when the dollar is overly buoyant in world currency markets.
 
Higher Health Costs
Fringe benefits - mainly health costs soaring by 12.1 percent - drove the year-over-year Employment Cost Index up by 5.5 percent in the March quarter, up from 5 percent last December and from 4.8 percent in March 1989. Fringes advanced by 7.2 percent over the latest year, and the rise would have been 5.9 percent without health benefits and 5.7 percent without health and the January rise in the Social Security payroll tax.
Wages and salaries, on the other hand, remained steady at a growth rate of 4.4 percent for the 12 months through March, for calendar 1989 for the 12 months that ended in March 1989.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Soviet Economy: Red Storm Ebbs

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
JUST how much are Soviet consumers really suffering? Alfred Volkov, a researcher from Moscow's Academy of National Economics, replies with a story about the quality of food in state-run markets: Criminals vowing not be be taken alive, he quips, now carry a piece of sausage to swallow in case they are cornered by the police.
Grim jokes about the parlous state of the Soviet system are as old as the gulag. What was startling about this one was the setting in which it was recounted and the composition of the audience.
Mr. Volkov, along with a dozen other senior Soviet economic researchers, was a guest of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research group. The object of their on-the-record meeting at the Airlie Conference Center, deep in the horse farm country of Virginia: to compare notes with representatives of the devil incarnate, the Central Intelligence Agency. 
What was perhaps even more startling to the uninitiated was the division of opinion among the conferees. Children of the cold war might assume that the Russians would end up on one side, Americans on the other. In fact, the breakdown was establishment versus anti-establishment, with both Soviet and American critics stumbling over each other to show that both the C.I.A. and Goskomstat, the Soviet statistics agency, had overestimated the size and growth rate of the Soviet economy.
Soviet authorities have never published income statistics with much credibility in the West. Until very recently they did not even bother to explain the precise meaning of their numbers; nor, apparently, did they follow research conventions permitting outsiders to second-guess their results. But that has not deterred the C.I.A.'s in-house economists or the agency's academic consultants, respected scholars including Gertrude Schroeder of the University of Virginia and Abram Becker of the Rand Corporation. Their estimates, assembled from raw Soviet data and released over the years by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, have had wide influence in policy debates over Soviet economic prospects and military intentions.
The C.I.A. figures suggest that Soviet output and living standards rose substantially from the end of the war through the mid-1970's. But according to the agency, the Russian economic bear was never as formidable as Soviet bureaucrats and American cold warriors believed. Soviet growth rates were roughly in line with American rates - an adequate if unimpressive performance for an economy with a well-educated work force that was starting from a very low base of development.
Moreover, as Ms. Schroeder noted at the conference, the C.I.A. made an early and correct call that the Soviet economy would hit a wall in the late 1970's: the growth rate for living standards tumbled to just 1 to 1.5 percent annually, widening an already yawning gap with the West. According to the C.I.A., Soviet citizens now live about as well in material terms as Portuguese or Greeks.
Even the C.I.A.'s bearish numbers, however, have been viewed skeptically by independent American analysts, including Igor Birman of the Foundation of Soviet Studies in Maryland. Mr. Birman, who plainly savors his reputation as a gadfly, argues that by the mid-1970's the Soviet G.N.P. was just one-third that of America's, in contrast to the estimate of one-half offered by the C.I.A. Yet more striking, he believes that individual living standards were just one-fifth that of America's - and presumably they have grown worse in relative terms over the last decade.
Enter the new Soviet economists, propelled by the heady winds of glasnost. Rather than disputing the iconoclastic Mr. Birman's findings, Yuri Dikhanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has gone to heroic technical efforts to confirm them. In a tortuous extrapolation using the Hungarian economy as a benchmark, he estimates that Soviet consumption per person averaged just 20 percent that of Americans' in 1985.
His academy colleague, Victor Belkin, went even further: After accounting for the very low quality of Soviet goods and factoring in waste on a scale inconceivable in the West, he estimates that Soviet G.N.P. per capita is now less than one-seventh of America's. Soviet citizens, it follows, have roughly the material living standard of the Chinese.
It is far from clear that Mr. Belkin is right. As most of the conferees agreed, the lack of hard data makes it possible to defend a wide range of soft estimates. What is clear is that the strange times are breeding strange bedfellows. The C.I.A. and Goskomstat have, in effect, become the principal defenders of conservative scholarship in the field - and, implicitly, of the view that the Soviet economy remains a force to be reckoned with.

HEADLINE: 2 Chemical Makers' Net Off

 BODY:
The Dow Chemical Company, the nation's second-largest producer of chemicals, said yesterday that its first-quarter net income plunged almost 38 percent because of higher costs for raw materials and lower prices for some products.
The Monsanto Company, whose products include chemicals, said its profits in the quarter fell nearly 13 percent because of soft conditions in the automobile industry and a seasonal slowdown in agriculture. 
Dow's net income totaled $462 million, or $1.71 a share, compared with $743 million, or $2.72 a share, in the comparable period last year. Its sales increased 9.3 percent, to $4.9 billion, from $4.48 billion, reflecting recent acquisitions and strong volume gains, the company said.
Analysts said they had expected Dow's earnings to be affected by recent price declines for some chemicals and plastics. They also said the company's results reflected slower growth in the overall economy. But they added that Dow's business in consumer specialty products would probably grow.
Dow, based in Midland, Mich., said its operating income for chemicals and performance products, which include absorbents and air-separation systems, dropped 43 percent in the 1990 quarter.
Meanwhile, the St. Louis-based Monsanto said it had profits of $194 million, or $2.95 a share, down from a record $222 million, or $3.24 a share, in the 1989 period. Its revenues were flat, at $2.28 billion, compared with $2.26 billion.
Monsanto's drug unit, G. D. Searle, showed a $4 million profit, compared with a loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 1989, and the Nutrasweet Company, also owned by Monsanto, had slightly lower profits because of the cost of introducing its new frozen dairy dessert, Simple Pleasures.

President Named Chief At Cincinnati Milacron

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Cincinnati Milacron Inc., a leading machine tool maker, announced yesterday that it had named Daniel J. Meyer chief executive, ending the long leadership of the founding Geier family at the company.
Mr. Meyer, 53 years old, who is also president, will assume his new responsibilities immediately, succeeding James A. D. Geier. Mr. Geier will continue as chairman until he reaches age 65 at the end of the year, at which time he will retire.
Mr. Geier is a grandson of Frederick A. Geier, co-founder of the Cincinnati-based company, which was established in 1884. Mr. Geier's grandfather was president from 1905 to 1934. His father, Frederick V. Geier, took the reins in 1934 and retired as chairman in 1963. 
In a statement, Mr. Meyer said, ''I wish to acknowledge the importance of continued strong support from Milacron employees and from the Geier family, which has guided this company for over a hundred years.''
Mr. Meyer is a longtime Milacron executive who has no plans to depart radically from the company's recent strategies. ''I do not see the company changing direction,'' he said yesterday. ''We will be focusing on improving its worldwide competitive position in its core businesses.
Mr. Meyer joined Milacron in 1969 as director of corporate accounting and worked on the finance side for much of the time. He was named president in 1987, a year in which the company and the industry were being battered by foreign competiton.
Cincinnati Milacron reorganized in the last two years, seeking higher quality and productivity in its factories.
Mr. Meyer said the company had been looking to the aerospace industry, especially the commercial side, to offset lagging automotive orders. The company is also looking to Europe, where it operates in the Netherlands, Britain and Austria, and is exploring Eastern European opportunities.
''We're cautious about some of the immediate opportunities there,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''but at the same time we don't want to miss any.
Mr. Meyer holds a degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University and an M.B.A. from Indiana University. Before joining Milacron he worked for Touche Ross, the accounting firm, as a management consultant.

HEADLINE: Control Data Net Up by 94%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., April 24

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation reported today that its first-quarter profit rose by 94 percent from a year ago because of a huge after-tax gain from its reorganization, but the revenue of the scaled-down computer company declined sharply.
Net income for the first three months of 1990 totaled $6.8 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with earnings of $3.5 million, or 8 cents, in 1989. Revenue, however, dropped by half from the 1989 quarter, falling to $421.6 million from $843.5 million.
The latest results included a $5.8 million gain from the company's reorganization. Control Data sold or discontinued several operating units, including its Imprimis disk drive subsidiary and its maintenance business. It also laid off 7,750 workers last year, and replaced its chief executive officer, Robert M. Price.
Lawrence Perlman, who took the helm of Control Data in January, said that ''apart from restructuring gains and charges, Control Data has now been profitable for three consecutive quarters.''
''Although the first quarter traditionally has not been a strong one for Control Data, earnings were stronger in several businesses than we had anticipated,'' he added. ''Business Management Services sustained its revenue and earnings growth, and Computer Products continued to make progress.''
The company posted a net loss of $680.4 million in 1989, the worst in its 32-year history.

HEADLINE: Moody's Reviews Ratings Of 2 Giant Japanese Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The top triple-A ratings for long-term borrowings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and the Fuji Bank Ltd., the largest and fourth-largest banks in the world, are under review, Moody's Investors Service said yesterday.
Moody's said the ratings for short-term borrowings of the two Tokyo-based banks remained at the highest level of prime-1 and were not under review.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji are both strong operations over all, Moody's said, and a rating reduction, if any, would not be substantial for their borrowings of more than a year. A lower rating would, however, tarnish the banks' image in capital markets, including the markets for interest-rate and currency swaps. 
 
Interest-Rate Risks
Because rising interest rates in Japan have reduced bank earnings, Moody's said the two banks need to show that they have plans to control their interest-rate risks in the future. Deborah Kinzer, a senior analyst at Moody's, said deregulation of the financial system in Japan had resulted in banks raising the interest rates they pay on consumer deposits more rapidly than the interest rates they charge borrowers.
Japanese bank earnings for the year ended March 31 are expected to be announced in May or early June.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo operates the largest branch system of any Japanese bank and has assets of $430 billion, nearly twice the level of Citicorp, the largest American banking company. But Moody's said Dai-Ichi Kanyo had a long-term problem of controlling the costs of its branch banking system. Because its expenses are higher than other large Japanese banks, Moody's said, the earnings of Dai-Ichi Kanyo are more vulnerable when rapidly rising interset rates narrow the profit margin from lending.
 
Real Estate Exposure
Moody's said a rating review of both banks was justified because of their exposure to Japanese real estate. The rating agency has said it is worried about the possibility that real estate prices might decline.
Although data were not available on the extent of their risk, Ms. Kinzer noted that the real estate exposure of the two banks was not as great as that of the Yasuda Bank and Trust Company, the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation and the Mitsui Trust and Banking Company. The credit ratings for these Japanese banks were lowered earlier this year.
At Fuji Bank, Moody's said it was also concerned about the risk of loss on loans made in the United States to finance corporate takeovers.
Ms. Kinzer said the recent decline in the Tokyo stock market was not a consideration for Moody's because only a small part of each bank's stock holdings was counted when measuring their financial resources.
Masahiro Nagayasu, the manager of the New York branch of the Fuji Bank, said he was puzzled by the Moody's review because other large Japanese banks were vulnerable to losses on real estate or loans for American corporate takeovers to the same degree, or more, than Fuji. He added that Fuji bank had recently created a new group to use financial futures and options to control the risk of rising interest rates.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower But Rises Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against all major currencies yesterday except the Japanese yen, which weakened considerably.
Gold prices finished lower in the United States after moving higher abroad.
Foreign exchange dealers said trading was moderately active and most of the attention was directed toward the yen. Japan's currency slumped across the board, benefiting the West German mark, the Swiss franc and other currencies. 
There was no news from Japan to account for the heavy yen selling. Dealers said an underlying bearish outlook for the yen, which had been temporarily suppressed, reappeared. The low level of that country's interest rates relative to those of Japan's trading partners accounts for some of the yen's troubles.
The dollar's losses against everything but the yen came despite a strong report on orders for durable goods. March bookings for durables, which are items expected to last three or more years, posted the largest increase in more than a year, jumping 6.7 percent.
But the report had little influence on the dollar and traders were said to be more interested in the report on the gross national product due Friday, which will be the first comprehensive assessment of economic activity in the first quarter.
By late in the afternoon in London, the dollar was quoted at 1.6930 marks, down from 1.6960 marks late Monday. It stood at 1.6980 marks late in New York, down from Monday's late level of 1.6995.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.60 yen, to a closing 158.15 yen. It was quoted at a higher rate of 158.59 yen later in London. In New York, the dollar ended at 158.95 yen, up from 157.55 yen on Monday.
Also in London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6345, compared with $1.6365 late Monday. Later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.6347, from $1.63565 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, included: 1.4875 Swiss francs, down from 1.4935; 5.698 French francs, down from 5.7020; 1,244.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.75, and 1.15955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16155.
Selected dollar rates late in Europe, compared with levels late Monday, were: 1.4865 Swiss francs, down from 1.4925; 5.6795 French francs, down from 5.6930; 1.9100 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090; 1,241.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.00, and 1.1590 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1610.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Rising Interest Rates Spur A Drop in Precious Metals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of precious metal futures fell yesterday, reflecting a general lack of interest in gold and silver in the face of rising interest rates.
On other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply and grains and soybeans retreated, while energy futures were mixed and livestock and meat futures finished likewise.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold futures settled $3 to $3.10 lower, with the April contract for delivery at $375.90 an ounce. Silver finished 10 cents lower, with May at about $5 an ounce. 
On the Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures fell $6.50 across the board, with the July contract settling at $487.80 an ounce.
The retreat followed a strong rally on Monday in the platinum market, which had been linked to speculation that Nelson Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress, was preparing to take a more militant stance against apartheid, posing a threat of possible platinum supply disruptions.
The rumors about Mr. Mandela were discounted yesterday and as platinum futures fell, the gold and silver markets followed, said William O'Neill, the research director with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
The precious metals markets kept tumbling, though, even after platinum selling dwindled. Mr. O'Neill said the weak tone reflected the outlook for higher interest rates, which tends to discourage demand for precious metals.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper futures climbed strongly amid a resurgence of buying on indications of tight supplies available for delivery against the April contract, which expires tomorrow.
Further buying was inspired by a report that officials of the Codelco Copper Company in Chile had lowered their estimate for 1990 production from the country's state-owned copper mines to 1.2 million to 1.25 million tons, from an earlier estimate of 1.29 million tons.
Copper settled 1.8 cents to 4.9 cents higher, with April at $1.24 a pound.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, the prices of grain and soybean futures fell substantially, led by a technically inspired selloff in the soybean market, analysts said.
Oil futures finished mixed on the Merc before the American Petroleum Institute released its weekly stocks report after the close. The report showed an expected increase in American refinery activity, a fairly large 1.2-million-barrel increase in United States oil stocks, a 926,000-barrel drop in gasoline stocks and a 752,000-barrel decline in heating oil stocks.
The buildup in crude stocks extends a pattern of oversupply that has been linked to overproduction by the 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But the higher refinery activity is a seasonal factor that may offset the market effect of the rise in oil stocks.

Times Mirror Net Down 33%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 24

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Corporation said today that its first-quarter profit fell by 33 percent, while revenues rose by 3.3 percent.
The company cited an advertising slowdown at its Northeastern newspapers, consumer magazines and broadcast television operations, and higher promotional costs and higher circulation that pushed up operating costs at The Los Angeles Times. 
For the quarter ended April 1, Times Mirror's earnings fell to $46 million, or 36 cents a share, from $68.8 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose to $875.2 million from $846.9 million.
''Although our professional publishing and cable television operations achieved solid earnings growth during the quarter, their performance only partially offset the marked deterioration in our newspaper publishing segment,'' said Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror's chairman and chief executive.
 
Ad volume was slow at the
Northeastern newspapers, with Newsday and New York Newsday suffering from a depressed New York economy, Times Mirror said.
Times Mirror said its companywide circulation, as reported to the Audit Bureau of Circulations but not yet verified, rose by 4.1 percent for the daily papers and by 3.2 percent on Sunday over the last six months.

HEADLINE: He Can Milk 'Em, But He Can't Hide

BYLINE: By Benjamin J. Stein; Benjamin J. Stein, a lawyer and economist, writes frequently on financial issues.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The deed, apparently, is done. Michael Milken, the premier financial swindler of all time, is being given a plea bargain.
A $600 million fine may seem large, but in fact it will be trivial to him. His prison sentence is likely to be less than is given to petty income tax cheats. While he has supposedly agreed to provide information for related investigations, he is under no obligation to do so, since the Government has already settled his case. And he has bought immunity for his lawyer brother, Lowell. 
In short, Michael Milken is off the hook. The Houdini of the legal system has gotten out of the locked trunk.
Never mind that the collapse of savings and loan institutions, stuffed with Mr. Milken's worthless junk bonds, will cost the ordinary taxpayer billions that might have gone for medical care or retirement. Never mind that Mr. Milken's money came from the sweat and sacrifice of ordinary people.
So small is Mr. Milken's punishment that it constitutes nothing less than a pardon from President Bush, who would have to approve this deal himself. Never mind. This is what always happens when the big guys' interests are weighed against the little guys'.
Still, there is one little thing that might be done to soothe the burning hurt of the injustice of the Milken plea bargain: open the grand jury transcripts and the grand jury exhibits.
Of course, the Milken lawyers will demand that they be sealed. It's their right, after all, because their client is rich. But maybe, just maybe there are other interests. Maybe the public might be allowed a chance to see a little more into the world of Michael Milken before he disappears into well-upholstered legend.
There is much that the public needs to know. For example, who in Government were his protectors? Who knew about what he was doing and when did they know?
It's a matter of public record that staffers at the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the Milken junk operation repeatedly through the 1980's and recommended action. It never happened until 1989. Why? Who was protecting Mr. Milken at the S.E.C. and why?
It is a matter of public record that Drexel was raising capital for the circle of savings and loan institutions that then turned around and bought its now largely worthless junk bonds. It's a matter of record that Federal Home Loan Bank Board staff people were suspicious of these transactions, at least insofar as they applied to the failed Lincoln Savings & Loan, run by the infamous Charles Keating. And they held these suspicions for at least the last five years. Who at the Bank Board was working for Mr. Milken and the junk bond industry?
It has now been reported thoroughly that organized crime elements were major players in the looting of America's savings and loan institutions. By an eerily similar token, a number of the names that turn up as long time Milken pals and supporters (as in ''Mike Milken, We Believe In You'') have repeatedly been described over time, and in major publications, as organized crime honchos. Of course, Mr. Milken's company, Drexel Burnham, was also the preferred financing entity for the casino industry.
Something is going on here. If organized crime was linked in a big way to Drexel and Mr. Milken, this is well worth knowing. Grand jury testimony might give leads that could help us to understand just who is running American finance. If it's organized crime, that has some bearing on whether sensible people want to invest in certain entities. If not, that's important, too. Maybe it is all just a fantasy. Let's have a look.
Many of these items may be false trails, may not even involve crimes. Maybe much of what swirls around Mr. Milken is just fog and filthy air.
But the missing billions, the taxpayers socked to make Mr. Milken rich, the savings and loan disaster he helped to engineer, the Government in his pocket for far too long - these are real. The plea bargain is insult enough on top of this injury. Let's get a look at the grand jury transcripts.
The Government is clearly not eager to represent the people on this one. Maybe, with the grand jury data, we can start to defend ourselves against the next Milken, who may be jauntily stepping our way.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Voters in Revolt Against Soaring School Taxes

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 25

 BODY:
Voters in nearly half the school districts in New Jersey soundly rejected budgets in elections on Tuesday in the most sweeping revolt against soaring taxes since the state was forced to change its financing of education 14 years ago.
In many of the 263 districts where budgets were defeated, property taxes would have risen as much as 40 percent. The revenue would have covered increased costs and replaced millions of dollars in state aid lost as the state government struggles to close its own budget deficit of more than $600 million.
 
Back to Municipal Officials
With the rejection of 48 percent of the budgets - many by 2-to-1 ratios - the state's budget problems are sure to be felt by students, parents and teachers in the districts as the defeated budgets are returned to municipal officials, who will decide whether they should be reduced and, if so, by how much. 
In some instances, school officials said, teachers will be laid off, schools closed and programs cut to keep the budgets balanced without raising taxes too high.
''A lot of teachers and staff are going to be put out of work,'' said Dr. Edwin Oskamp, superintendent of the Andover Regional School District in Sussex County in the northern corner of the state, where the budget was defeated. ''There's going to be lean years ahead.''
Education officials said it was the prospect of higher property taxes on top of Gov. Jim Florio's announced plans to increase sales and income taxes that brought out voters in greater numbers than for any school election in 10 years. Of the 3.8 million eligible voters, 15.8 percent participated.
Because they are the only budgets voted on directly by taxpayers, school budgets often bear the full brunt of anti-tax sentiments.
Mr. Florio, whose proposed budget would cut aid to the districts by 16 percent under the state's formula, said in a statement the election results were ''a strong signal from people who are fed up with New Jersey's growing overreliance on local property taxes to pay for education.''
The fate of the financing system is before State Supreme Court.
In his budget plan, which is to be voted on by the Legislature, Mr. Florio has offered a program for property-tax relief under which income and sales taxes increase and property taxes could decrease as much as $500 a year for people meeting income restrictions.
 
Problems in the Northeast
Education experts said the elections on Tuesday represented a taxpayer revolt that could be repeated in other Northeastern states where the economy has slowed, housing values are sinking, frustration over educational achievements is growing, and more people with grown children are voting on the budgets.
''There's no reason why what happened in New Jersey couldn't happen in other states, especially in the Northeast,'' said C. Kent McGuire, a professor of education at the University of Colorado and a senior policy analyst for finance at the Education Commission of the States. ''When there's uncertainty and confusion and discontent at the district level, it's hard for local boards to sell these tax increases.''
This is the fifth year in a row that the percentage of budget defeats has increased. Last year, 39 percent were rejected. The 48 percent rejection rate is the highest since 1976, when 58 percent were defeated, In some of the 21 counties, substantially more than half the budgets were rejected. One of the lowest rates was in Burlington, where 10 of 38 passed. In Union, 4 passed and 16 were rejected. Bergen County, the state's wealthiest, saw 38 of 73 budgets defeated. Last year, 45 were rejected.
 
Series of Rising Expenses
The executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, Octavius T. Reid, said voter backlash stemmed from a reaction against taxes, not against quality education, adding, ''People just said, 'Ouch, I can't afford it.' ''
Several superintendents said they had been hampered by rising costs for employee benefits and new state and Federal regulations on environmental hazards like leaking fuel tanks. The primary reasons so many school boards had asked voters to accept big tax increases was to cover the loss of state subsidies.
In Midland Park, a residential borough of 7,400 people in Bergen, state aid was cut $220,000 below the anticipated $1.09 million. When the cut was combined with an 11 percent budget increase, taxpayers were asked to accept an average raise of $440 a year in property taxes.
John B. Casson thought that was too much. ''It was an unconscionable increase,'' said Mr. Casson, a police lieutenant. He has two sons in elementary schools. ''But where do you draw the line?'' he asked. ''There's probably some fat that could be taken out of budget.''
 
Passage in Newark
Voters in Newark, the largest district in the state, approved their budget, despite a vigorous campaign against it by Mayor Sharpe James, who said it was too high.
In Willingboro, a middle-class suburb of more than 40,000 people south of Trenton, voters turned down a budget that would have increased property taxes 40.5 percent. Business Administrator Wayne W. Thomas said the proposed increase was so large because the township would receive $1.5 million less in aid than anticipated.
When budgets are defeated, they are submitted to local officials for negotiation. The officials can decide to overrule the voters and accept the budget as proposed, or they can specify cuts to reduce it. If the municipal officials and the Board of Education reach an impasse, the State Education Department may resolve it. The budgets have to be in place by the end of next month.
The defeats of so many budgets in communities rich and poor, big and small, points once again to an underlying dissatisfaction with the financing of public education here, primarily through property taxes, officials said. The system has been under attack for almost 20 years. In 1976, the State Supreme Court ordered public schools closed until the Legislature devised an alternative, which was the state's first income tax.

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIAL CITES JAPAN'S PROGRESS ON OPEN MARKETS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
Japan should not again be cited for unfair trading practices, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, told Congress today, disclosing that Washington and Tokyo had reached agreement on the last major item on their current trade agenda.
Japan has ''moved further this year than any other country'' in opening its markets, Mrs. Hills said. Citing Japan under the ''Super 301'' provision of the tough 1988 trade law again would impede further progress, she added.
The accord announced today, the culmination of a negotiating process set forth by that law, involved wood products and is expected to raise American exports to Japan by $1 billion a year. Under earlier accords, which are expected to increase annual exports by $700 million, Japan agreed to open its markets for American supercomputers and satellites. In Tokyo, the announcement was viewed favorably. Ignoring of Law Seen The comments of Mrs. Hills before the Senate Finance Committee elicited challenges from most of the Senators present who contended that only constant pressure yielded results. 
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the panel and was one of the sponsors of the 301 provision of the trade law, argued that the Administration would be ''ignoring'' the 1988 law and could ''poison the well'' for Congressional consideration of trade accords that it is expected to seek later with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, China and members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva body that promotes trade liberalization and resolves trade disputes.
Mr. Bentsen, who takes a hard line on Japan, issued an unusually stern rebuke, contending that the constitutional form of government ''cannot work if the Administration refuses to implement laws.''
On the other hand, both Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon termed the wood products pact ''significant.'' Because of the prominence of wood-producing industries in their states, both had taken leading positions demanding Japanese liberalization. The two Senators said they had spoken with industry representatives who welcomed the accord.
Senator Packwood, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, was among the few Senators at today's session to speak out against citing Japan.
President Bush has been caught between his reluctance to offend powerful lawmakers and his desire to reward his new friend, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, whose undertakings at a meeting with the President last March in California have led to the spate of accords, including today's on wood.
 
Change in Dynamics Seen
In addition to the successful conclusion of trade agreements, the Administration's tilt against branding Japan results from changing political dynamics, many analysts believe.
While many Americans still think that Japan does not play fair in world trade and is seeking commercial hegemony with its vast surpluses, the resentments are not as intense as last year, the analysts say.
According to William T. Archey, vice president, international, of the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''What's different this time round is the political imperative doesn't have the same oomph.''
A declining trade imbalance with Japan and the fact that Japanese surpluses are financing American budget deficits are among attentuating factors.
 
Cabinet Meeting Scheduled
Later Mrs. Hills told reporters that the Administration had yet to make its final decision on whether to name Japan as an unfair trader. A first Cabinet meeting on the issue is scheduled for Thursday morning. But Administration officials said was unlikely that her position would be reversed.
The law gives the Administration some discretion in naming countries that will be subject to Super 301 procedures. Congress can ''jawbone'' the President, but short of enacting new trade legislation it cannot overrule his decision. Among the criteria the President must consider is whether it is in the United States' overall interest to name a country.
Already in Mrs. Hills's camp, Administration officials said, are Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin.
But Mrs. Hills insisted that ''we are not backing off, or taking the pressure off.'' She said that the talks aimed at overcoming the pervasive policy and cultural obstacles confronting foreign business in Japan, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, had achieved significant preliminary results perceisely because they were proceeding outside the 301 process, which carries the threat of sanctions.
''I must be given a small amount of discretion to be able to tell members of this committee where I think the tools ought not be used and where they should be used,'' Mrs. Hills said.
She added that she wanted ''to very surgically use the tool of Super 301 in a manner that is so careful that in balance it does not cause a distraction or, in fact, a permament impediment to achieving our multilateral goal'' of opening markets.
 
First Step in Process
Citing a country is the first step in a process that could lead to reprisals in the form of 100 percent duties on a country's exports to the United States, if improvements in what the United States considers unfair trade practices are not made.
Monday is the statutory deadline for citing countries for ''priority'' negotiations under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, reflecting practices that pose, according to the law, ''significant'' barriers to American exports.
Japan was named under the Super 301 law last year for its closed markets in satellites, supercomputers and wood products. Today's pact, under which Japan would alter product standards, building codes, product certification and tariffs in ways to accelerate the flow of wood imports, means that Japan has now reached agreements in all three sectors.
The supercomputer and satellite agreements were both concluded within the last month. Under the supercomputer pact, which is expected to lead to increased sales of as much as $500 million a year, Japan would use practical benchmarks to select among machines, instead of the ''hypothetical'' standards used in the past to undercut American-made supercomputers.
 
Open Process Required
The agreement on satellites, which could increase exports by up to $200 million a year, requires the Government of Japan to buy all commercial and operational satellites in an open and competitive procurement process. It opens up the Japanese market to American commercial, communications and broadcast satellites and to non-research and development satellites.
The accords have come against a backdrop of improvement in the American bilateral trade balance with Japan. In the first two months of this year, the American trade deficit was running at an annual rate of $35.8 billion, a 27 percent improvement over the $49 billion trade deficit for all of 1989.
 
Reaction in Japan
TOKYO, Thursday, April 26 (Special to The New York Times) - Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today of the announcement by Mrs. Hills: ''It is good that we have settled the problems of our shared perceptions.'' He had no further comment.
Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman offered guarded support, saying Japan had always ''firmly believed our country will not be cited once again'' under the United States trade law known as Super 301.

HEADLINE: Japan Offers Its Good Offices to U.S. and Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 25

 BODY:
As Iran and the United States haltingly begin searching for ways to end a decade of hostility, the neutral ground for exchanging messages, providing explanations and coaxing both sides along has cropped up in an unlikely spot: the Japanese Foreign Ministry in downtown Tokyo.
For a decade, Japan has kept up regular, if not exactly warm, contacts with the Iranian Government. And over the last year, since President Hashemi Rafsanjani took office, Japanese officials have been gradually stepping up the pace of exchanges among the three countries, playing a go-between role that both Japanese and American officials are hestitant to discuss in detail.
The Japanese say they have not been involved in the specific negotiations over the fate of the American hostages, nor the logistics of the release of Robert Polhill on Sunday after 39 months in captivity. The main channel for those communication appears to have been the Swiss Embassy in Teheran, which represents American interests there. 
But officials say that the central figure for other, deeper exchanges has been a high-ranking Japanese diplomat, Makoto Watanabe, who directs the Mideast and African affairs division of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and who formerly served as Ambassador to Jordan.
''It is not that I have been passing messages as much as conveying views,'' Mr. Watanabe said in an interview today. In visits to Iran in recent months, he and other Japanese diplomats ''described the American position and conveyed our own view that it is in Iran's interest to improve relations with the United States.''
''With the U.S., we are doing the same thing, trying to explain the Iranian positions,'' said Mr. Watanabe, who for most of his career has specialized in the United States. He added, ''It is almost clear that Rafsanjani does want the hostages released, and to begin to open the way'' for a lifting of American sanctions against his country.
Japanese and American diplomats say they cannot imagine Japan's playing a similar, third-party role in such talks three or four years ago. ''It's one of the strongest signs yet that they have emerged from their shell,'' a senior American official said, ''and they are ready to get in the middle of some very complicated issues that do not directly affect them or Asia.''
For Japan, it is a role that is not entirely free of self-interest. As talk of trade wars, military burden-sharing and the wisdom of buying American companies and property have dominated discussions with the United States, officials here are eager for any successful initiatives that demonstrate that a relationship with Japan can transcend economics.
American and Japanese diplomats say the strategy appears to be making an impression on the Bush Administration. ''I sense that there is a degree of appreciation in Washington of a general, deeper role of Japan in Middle Eastern issues,'' Mr. Watanabe said.
There is also the matter of Iran's need for Japanese money and technology.
This need is particularly acute now, with the American trade embargo against Iran still in place. But Japan has never had such an embargo, and, in small ways, there are signs that commercial relations are resuming for the first time since the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
The most tangible evidence can be found in Nagasaki, at the turbine factory of Mitsubshi Heavy Industries, one of Japan's biggest makers of ships, military equipment and energy devices. During a recent tour of Mitsubishi facilities, company executives pointed to four giant turbines nearing shipment to the Iranian power authority.
The 250,000 kilowatt turbines are intended to alleviate critical power shortages that have crippled Iranian industry. Already, four have been delivered, but the next four were delayed by the Iran-Iraq war. Mitsubishi officials declined to say how much the turbines cost, but equipment like that can easily run into the tens of millions of dollars.
Japan has also been a major market for Iranian oil, but Iran now ranks only sixth among Japan's petroleum suppliers.

Responding to continuing criticism from Lithuania, President Bush declared bluntly today that he needed no defense for his refusal to penalize the Soviet Union for its tightening economic squeeze on the rebellious Baltic republic.
Answering President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, who has accused him of selling out the Lithuanian people by failing to move against Moscow, Mr. Bush said with unusual asperity, ''The policies and decisions I've taken have had strong support from the American people, and that's who I work for.''
Mr. Landsbergis said in a telephone conversation this morning with members of Congress that ''the Soviets are strangling our nation like a boa constrictor.'' Twenty-four hours earlier, he had called the American decision not to intervene ''another Munich'' - a reference, laden with political emotion, to the decision by Britain and France in 1938 to in effect abandon Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany. The episode has since become synonymous with appeasement. 
Apparently trying to turn up the heat on Mr. Bush by appealing to American public opinion, Mr. Landsbergis said, ''Can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom of another?'
 
Bush Policy 'Has Enough Support'
After promising ''appropriate action'' last week if the Soviets cut off oil and gas to Lithuania, Mr. Bush decided on Tuesday not to impose the limited economic sanctions that were under consideration. The tone and substance of the President's comments today, made during a picture-taking session at the White House, reflected the three principal White House conclusions about the potentially explosive situation in Lithuania.
Lithuania's parliamentary press office quoted the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, as saying today of Mr. Bush's decision, ''The logic in this is hard to understand, but blackmail does not require logic.''
The Administration is convinced, senior officials said, that the Lithuanians are more responsible than Moscow for provoking a crisis and have suffered less than they have contended; that furthering better relations between East and West is infinitely more important than responding immediately to the Lithuanians' pleas, and that the American people support Mr. Bush's policy of support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
''We're convinced that the President has enough support in the country to carry us without any sanctions through the summit, which starts in five weeks, unless the Soviets do something far more violent than we expect,'' a senior Presidential aide said.
Mr. Bush's reference to his popular support echoed remarks a year ago by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, to the effect that polls showed the President's foreign policy to be overwhelmingly popular among the American public, and thus to a considerable degree insulated from cricitism.
On Capitol Hill this morning, Mr. Baker suggested that if the negotiated settlement that Washington is counting on failed to materialize, Mr. Bush would be more likely to try to aid Lithuania, despite all the obvious difficulties that would be entailed in sending oil and gas or other supplies through closed ports, than to try to retaliate against the Soviets.
He said that Scandinavian countries had expressed interest in trying to get oil supplies to Lithuania and added that the subject was discussed by Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday.
If it proved feasible, he said, such an idea might be preferable to sanctions against Moscow in which the United States would ''shoot ourselves in the foot'' by undermining progress in Eastern Europe and on arms negoitiations that are as important to the United States as they are to the Soviet Union.
Still, the realization was spreading in Washington today that when Mr. Bush stepped back on Tuesday from a confrontation with the Soviet Union, he tied his political fate more closely than ever to that of President Gorbachev.
 
'Response to Soviet Bullying'
Twice he had publicly promised action if the Soviet Union took certain steps, and twice he had decided to refrain from acting after the Soviet Union had crossed the line he had drawn in the sand. Mr. Bush said taking anti-Soviet measures might ''compel the Soviet Union to take action that would set back the whole case of freedom around the world.''
His decision won widespread approval on Capitol Hill and among the allies. Indeed, the allies had threatened to disown American policy if he took any other tack. But today there were signs of restiveness. Some analysts argued that the President is taking a considerable risk by gambling that the Lithuanian problem can be resolved relatively quickly, because if the matter is not resolved, currently quiescent American public opinion may shift against him.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader, said Mr. Bush should act to ''express disapproval and to deter further action'' against Lithuania. Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, a conservative Republican from New Hampshire, asserted that it was ''time for a principled response to Soviet bullying.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Name Donors of $7.1 Million to Party

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25

 BODY:
The Republican Party today made public a list of wealthy givers who donated $7.1 million to the party last year. Democratic Party officials backed away from making a similar disclosure, saying it would interfere with critical negotiations in the Senate over campaign finance legislation.
Democratic officials said they feared that the disclosure of their largest donations would underscore the party's reliance on monied interests at a time when some leading Democrats are facing Senate investigations about their fund-raising practices and when members of Congress are calling for tightening the campaign finance laws.
Some of the individual contributions to the Republican Party were as much as $100,000.
 
Funds Are Unregulated
Donations to a political party that are not channeled directly to campaigns are not subject to Federal regulations. But they are often used by the party for voter drives and other efforts that help specific candidates. The parties are not required to disclose these funds, which are called ''soft money,'' as opposed to ''hard money'' that goes to the candidates. But advocates of new restrictions on political fund raising have pressed the parties to be more forthcoming about where their money comes from. 
The use of these funds is the subject of a simmering conflict between Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic Party chairman, and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Brown and several Democratic state party chairmen have opposed many of the proposed new restrictions on how the parties use unregulated funds out of concern that they would hinder a major party effort this year to use this money to bolster Democratic slates in several states.
At the same time, Mr. Mitchell has made provisions regulating these funds a centerpiece of the campaign finance legislation he is sponsoring, which is pending in the Senate.
The Republicans are also more successful in collecting money that goes directly to the candidates and thus have not been as outspoken in opposing efforts to restrict these contributions. Republican officials said donations to the party that were not channeled directly to campaigns accounted for about 20 percent of their total receipts last year. That total was about $35 million. $2.7 Million for Democrats In February, Democratic officals said in interviews that they had collected $2.7 million in fund not channeled to campaigns in 1989, and they said they would release a list of the donors within days. But Mr. Brown has postponed the disclosure of the names indefinitely.
Ginny Terzano, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said: ''We believe in disclosure, and Brown has said time and again that we will release a list of non-Federal donors. But because of the reform legislation that is coming up, we waited on it and postponed it. We did not want to interfere with the process now going on on the Hill.''
Ms. Terzano added, ''We have nothing to hide.''
But another party official, speaking on the condition that he not be named, gave another reason.
''We didn't want to be used as an example, that this is the bad side of non-Federal money,'' the official said.
Mary Matalin, chief of staff for Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, ''On our side, soft money has had the effect of strengthening the state parties.'' The party has not actively lobbied to preserve its ability to raise such money, she said, because ''Senate Republicans understand how the system works'' and would not favor restrictions on donations to the party not channeled to campaigns, except for new disclosure requirements.
 
Voluntary Disclosures
From time to time, the Republican and Democratic Parties voluntarily make public some of these donations. The Republicans' last disclosure was before the 1988 election; the Democrats' disclosure was soon after that election. But officials in both parties concede that they never release the names of all these contributors and that there is no way of knowing exactly how much money they raise and from whom. Nor do the parties provide tallies of money that they help raise directly through state party committees.
The Republican Party's decision today to permit a reporter for The New York Times to review a list of 4,250 donors from 1989 was in response to a request. The list was headed, ''selected contributor report'' and included no information on how the money was spent.
But it was clear from the disclosure that even in the year after a successful Presidential campaign, when donors have often given all they thought they would, thousands of wealthy people and major corporations still found it in their interest to make sizable donations.
Many donors are longtime financial backers of the party. Individuals who gave $100,000 to the party last year include Joseph J. Bogdanovich, chairman of Star-Kist Foods; Roy M. Huffington, founder of a Houston oil company; Monty Hundley, a Manhattan-based hotel owner; Alexander P. Papamarkou, a Manhattan investment adviser, and Bertram R. Firestone, a Virginia horse breeder and race track owner.
Companies that contributed $100,000 included the Beatrice Corporation of Chicago; the Salem Leasing Corporation of Winston-Salem, N.C.; Hibbard Brown & Company of New York, and Sonic Communications of Walnut Creek, Calif. RJR Nabisco of Wilkes Barre, Pa., gave $104,960.
Advocates of eliminating the loophole through which the parties raise and spend unregulated money argue that in accepting large contributions, the parties are becoming increasingly reliant on wealthy interests. They contend that these contributions render meaningless the spending limits in Presidential campaigns.
Ellen S. Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which has lobbied for stricter laws to regulate these donations, said she believes the Democrats are embarrassed by their increasing reliance on major donors.
''It is perfectly conceivable that one of the reasons they don't want to show this money is that people will be alerted and reminded that there are many, many $100,000 contributors out there,'' she said. ''And these contributors have economic and legislative interests. The disclosure of these fat cat contributors might spur reform in such a way and to such a degree that the party will find untenable.''
Other organizations or companies that donated $30,000 or more to the Republican Party last year include the following:
 
The Atlantic Richfield Company, Los Angeles, $95,660.
The SME Distribution Company, West Caldwell, N.J. $85,000.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
'The German Question Remains Open'

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

DATELINE: WEST BERLIN

 BODY:
The message from the President of the United States was delivered to me on the Lufthansa plane even before the takeoff for Germany.
''George Bush: The Time Has Come to Forgive the German Holocaust,'' read the major headline in the German newspaper that the flight attendant offered me when I sat down.
I told the President and myself, as I buckled in, that there was no statute of limitations about forgiveness of a volcano that had spewed death and fire. What counted was to make sure that the volcano was cold and out, before settling down on its slopes again.
It seemed to me that ever since the collapse of Communism in East Germany brought down the Berlin wall, and started the rush toward unification, the world's leaders have been deliberately avoiding talking about the fear that the idea of a larger, stronger Germany fires in so many minds around the world. 
But by their moral casualness about a unification they never thought would take place, the Western nations have been saying there is nothing to worry about. But I did not believe them, nor did millions of others who belong to the blitzkrieged nations or the slaughtered peoples.
I believed unification could not be stopped. The passion of the East Germans surging through the wall was a song of testimony to freedom and wasn't that what we all wanted, for ourselves and for all people?
But, on the plane I thought again that without even giving the fears a chance to be heard, with hardly a pause to remember the scores of millions killed by the last unified Germany, the allies were giving their blessing to a new unified Germany. No attempt to remove the fears of the living, no prayers said for the dead.
Then I remembered a conversation that I had at a small party with a young German lawyer visiting the United States, just a day before I left.
She told me quietly that whenever she thought of all the Jews and so many others killed by Germans a half-century ago, just a minute in the memory, she felt personally guilty.
I said that she was too young to be personally guilty. I said it was even dangerous to think so, because unreal guilt can lead to real hatred.
She looked at me in some astonishment and said:
''But then what do you want us to do?''
I visited Bonn, the elegant port city of Hamburg, the Berlins, briefly Schwerin and Dresden in East Germany - all told, too much too fast. But for me it was more Germany than ever before.
Except for three short inescapable visits over the years, I had avoided Germany because I did not choose to try to keep a civil tongue or a civil face among those I felt would have stood by while my children and I were murdered. I did not choose to hear their reasons why they could not have helped and anyway could not have possibly known.
Still, I became sort of an expert in German efficiency. Living as a reporter for a couple of years in the Poland of the late 50's showed me how swiftly and completely Germans could turn almost a whole nation into rubble, blood and bones.
And I felt I knew all I cared to know then about German history and the German soul. On both, every Jew is a specialist.
So on this trip there was no epiphany for me in Germany, no sudden revelation and certainly no emotional reconciliation.
Sometimes I would feel real warmth flowing back and forth between me and Germans. That would happen when I talked with small, earnest groups of young Germans in Bonn and Berlin. They had studied the Holocaust. I knew we were trying to reach through to each other.
Then somebody in the group would complain about how hard it was on the Germans to be so feared. Why did everybody keep emphasizing the ''negative'' side of German history and not Beethoven or Goethe?
Or, riding around Berlin these past days, I would come across something like the squat waterside mansion where the final extermination of the Jews had been planned. The house of murder sits among trees and flowers.
Once I walked past a memorial list of concentration camps on a stanchion at a busy Berlin crossroads. I knew it was meant well - a reminder to the passers-by.
But I felt again the anger rise within me. I have no apology for the anger; it seems the least possible memorial to the dead.
But few trips turned out to be more important to me. The reason was that the visit removed from me a personal weight of hypocrisy. I always had said that I did not lump all middle-aged and older Germans together as tainted by the history of their nation. But I did. Now I do not.
I always believed the children of Germany were not responsible for the sins of their fathers. But I always thought of them as children of their parents - not as separate. Now I do not. I see them as separate, with their own fate to create.
Hypocrisy clouds the mind. Now I feel clearer - not gentler, just clearer.
There were a few surprises for me. One was that there was almost as little real discussion about the moral and political meaning of the creation of a stronger Germany as in the United States. I had been told by Americans at home and by Germans in letters that there was much more.
Unification talk dominates the country. But I found that Germans were interested in an aspect of unification that did not move me at all -money.
All they seem to be interested in talking about is how much it would cost West Germany to subsidize and change backward East Germany.
I wanted to talk about how to make sure a united Germany did not mean a greater threat. They wanted to talk about how to make sure a united Germany did not mean a weaker Deutsche mark.
The second surprise was how little patriotic enthusiasm I found in younger West Germans for unity.
For the most part they did not oppose it. But they told me that East Germans had such a different political and educational background that they were ''as different as Orientals.'' I was also surprised by the constant effort of West German officials to minimize the importance of unification. I was told jokes about how inefficient the East Germans were; worse than Poles, one chap in Bonn said, and then recovered himself.
German businessmen do not minimize it. They are making plans for new factories in East Germany. Real estate people hope to make millions buying up dilapidated estates of early German movie stars in Potsdam and turning them into luxury homes for West Berliners. They think that any economic loss Germany suffers as a result of unification will be handsomely made up in a couple of years.
German officials say that economic integration of Western Europe outdates any fears - no one country will be able to dominate the Continent.
Maybe they are right. But the cost of being wrong will fall not just on Germans but on the whole world.
''But what do you want us to do?'' I heard that question put to me not only in New York but in Bonn, Hamburg and Berlin.
The answer is for Germany to do itself what the Western allies have failed even to try.
First, recognize and acknowledge that the already dominant economic power of Germany in Europe plus Germany's own history create legitimate fears about a unified, more powerful Germany - not just fantasies or phobias. Military and economic agreements last only as long as the most powerful signatory wants them to last. Denial increases fear.
Germany can then seize the opportunity suddenly available to it to diminish the fears. That is, ask the nations and peoples that have suffered from Germany's history to meet with Germans in Germany to bring out their fears and whatever plans or hopes they have of making sure that the past does not await.
Before and after unification, Germans can establish in Germany a continuing conclave between Germans and people from the nations Germany invaded and the peoples it slaughtered. Yes, officials should take part, but also artists, scientists, students and workers.
No doubt they will waste time and bore each other frequently. But perhaps they will come up with ideas on how the world can live with a new Germany in something approaching trust and truth. Perhaps they can work out what freedom of action Germany must give up for that boon.
Over the decades of a divided Germany, West German diplomats always had the same sentence to emphasize that unification was the goal: ''Die Deutsche Frage bleibt offen.''
Unless Germany itself makes sure that all the victims of its history can express their fears and hopes, that sentence will echo generation after generation in a dozen languages:
''The German Question remains open.''

HEADLINE: Tax the Toxics Out of the Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With politicians from President Bush on down lecturing on the benefits of the market economy, we seem reluctant to take our own advice on environmental protection. We insist on periodic political combat to set a new round of rigid standards. We ignore that we can only guess at the relationship of these hard-fought standards to human health or even to environmental quality. When results fall short of expectations, we are compelled to repeat this ritual.
A more flexible and self-correcting approach relies on taxes to insure that health and environmental costs are reflected in the final cost of a product or service. Consumers and producers can then make intelligent choices without the bureaucratic overhead. It would let the political process define goals and use taxes to achieve them.
Think of it as an environmental value-added tax, a VAT, where the tax is not proportional to economic value but to health risk, environmental damage, public disposal costs. The most important feature is that the tax schedules remain flexible and be modified over time to adapt to market behavior and to scientific and technological developments.
Instead of a Congressionally mandated shock every 10 years or so, the tax schedules could be administratively fine-tuned to yield short-term benefits by influencing consumer choices and, when needed, phase in more substantive changes in coordination with product-process development cycles. An example would be a tax on gasoline to limit its adverse impact on the environment.
An environmental tax-based approach would allow more environmental protection with fewer job losses. There should also be no problem disposing of the additional revenue.

HEADLINE: Michael Milken's Guilt

 BODY:
Michael Milken is a crook. He admitted that much in U.S. District Court Tuesday when he pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to put up $600 million, $200 million of that in fines, to settle the biggest fraud case in the history of the securities industry.
Mr. Milken's public admission ends four years of obdurate denial of wrongdoing, virtually assures a prison term and opens the possibility of further fraud prosecutions. For those reasons, and also to avoid the uncertain outcome of a phenomenally complex jury trial, the Government's decision to accept the plea bargain is justified. But even if justified, the outcome is deeply unsatisfying. 
At one level, the likely punishment for these few admitted crimes will be light compared with that of criminals who steal money the old-fashioned way. At another level, the plea bargain is unsatisfying because it masks more than it uncovers. It masks the nature of Mr. Milken's personal crimes. And it masks the relationship between the market for the high-risk - junk - bonds he created and the crimes he committed.
The Government believes that Mr. Milken, in the process of becoming the ''king'' of junk bonds, engaged in a long pattern of lining his own pockets at the expense of his clients and his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
But by comparison, the six felonies to which he pleaded guilty are serious yet technical securities violations and did not directly enrich him. His lawyer has even characterized them as an overzealous attempt to help friends.
The plea bargain allows theft to be cloaked as misguided loyalty. That's reason enough to hope the court will be able to release the extensive report the Government is expected to file before Mr. Milken is sentenced.
The plea bargain reinforces another misconception. In his statement to the court, Mr. Milken explained that his ''business was in no way dependent on these practices. Nor did they comprise a fundamental part of our business.'' That claim is, at best, a self-serving half-truth.
The junk bond markets that Mr. Milken orchestrated did feed credit to many promising new businesses - like MCI Communications - that had been turned away by commercial banks. Mr. Milken proudly, and correctly, claims credit for helping to create thousands of jobs in vibrant new industries.
But junk bonds also provided the borrowed money that financial buccaneers used in their frenzied corporate takeovers; such leveraged buyouts are an innovation of debatable economic value. In some cases, the new managers streamlined and improved their businesses' operations. In others, the corporate raiders buried themselves in debt and drove healthy companies into bankruptcy.
Whatever its long-term value, the world of junk bonds that Mr. Milken created did not work the way ordinary markets do. This was a highly personal world in which he intervened to match buyer and seller and depended on an intricate network of reciprocal obligation. He would sell the junk bonds of Corporation X only if it agreed, at least tacitly, to buy the junk bonds of Corporation Y at an advantageous time.
The stakes were immense and the identities of the players were often kept secret. The opportunities to cheat clients, the Internal Revenue Service and regulators were numerous and lucrative. Drexel, for example, would lend money to investors who were buying stocks based on the predicted outcome of deals that Drexel itself was arranging. There was obvious temptation to trade illegally on the basis of privileged information.
True, junk bonds can be sold without manipulation or deceit. But that requires extraordinary personal integrity. Tuesday showed that the King had no such moral compass.

HEADLINE: Roosevelt Island: A 'Wonderful' Experiment Still Building

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Twenty years after New York City and state officials decided to create a new community on Roosevelt Island, integrated by race and income, the social experiment has been hailed as a success while the housing development is still struggling toward completion.
''It is a piece of social engineering that worked,'' said Edward J. Logue, the former head of the State Urban Development Corporation who led development efforts for the island in the 1970's.
But Mr. Logue, along with many present and former public officials and some Roosevelt Island residents, remains frustrated at the slow pace of development on the cigar-shaped island in the East River. Though the first new housing there in more than a decade was completed last year, nearly 2,000 of the 5,000 apartments envisioned by the original planners have still not been built. 
An ambitious and complicated proposal announced last October by state housing officials for the final 1,956 apartments attracted little interest from private developers, apparently because of fears about New York's flat real-estate market.
 
Options Being Considered
The plan called for the creation of nearly 1,000 luxury apartments, to be sold at market rates. Some of the profits from the sales would be used to help subsidize almost 1,000 apartments for low-, moderate- and middle-income New Yorkers. The city and the state also would contribute subsidies to make the apartments affordable.
No developers bid for the key market-rate component of the plan, and state officials are now reconsidering it. Among the options are waiting until New York's housing market improves or reducing the number of subsidized apartments.
Many of those disappointed with the island's development say they are relieved that it was not completed quickly by foresaking the original vision of the community: racial and economic integration. ''In a very creative way, Roosevelt Island has muddled through,'' said Theodore Liebman, an architect who was the urban development agency's chief of architecture under Mr. Logue.
''One of the exciting things to me is that it didn't give in, in times of no subsidies, and did not just create a couple of thousand units of luxury housing,'' Mr. Liebman said. ''The most important thing is the creation of a mixed-income neighborhood.''
Several things give residents and planners confidence about the future. One is the affection that many residents have for the island.
''This is still a wonderful place,'' said Sandra Blake Neis, president of both the local P.T.A. and the Roosevelt Island Residents Association and a resident for 13 years. ''I wanted to be somewhere that seemed safe and was like the country. And yet it's also four or five minutes from Bloomingdale's. My children get to know all kinds of people, and I think that's really important.''
Many black residents said they were attracted to the island because they knew they could rent or buy housing without risking discrimination. Many black and white parents said they wanted the opportunity to send their children to a good integrated school.
Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, moved to Roosevelt Island with her husband and two daughters in 1978. The children were in private school at the time, and the Becks wanted to send them to the island's public school. ''We wanted them to be with youngsters from a wide variety of backgrounds,'' she said.
Four original apartment buildings, with a total of 2,141 units, were constructed in the early and mid-1970's, built primarily for moderate- and middle-income families, using state subsidies. Low-income families with Federal rent subsidies also rented units.
 
A New Cluster
A new cluster of five buildings, called Manhattan Park, was completed last year. It has 1,100 apartments, with 20 percent set aside for low-income families, under one of the last Federal programs for new housing. The rest of the apartments are being rented at market rates, as high as $3,300 a month.
About 14 percent of the island's residents are black and about 9 percent are Hispanic, the 1980 census found. State officials estimate that the proportions remained stable over the last decade.
The state created an independent corporation in 1985 to manage the island and plan its future. Its president, Rosina K. Abramson, has presided over completion of Manhattan Park and a host of improvements, from a new indoor tennis center to a new park.
''I'm a fan of Rosina,'' said Mr. Logue, now a consultant and developer in Boston, who keeps a close watch on the island. ''She's the first person who clearly had the responsibility to run the place and do things with it.''
Ms. Abramson said her top priority was finishing the housing plan, both for its symbolic value and for the amenities that a larger population would attract and sustain. She likes to say Roosevelt Island may be the only place in Manhattan where the quality of life would improve with more people.
Before the building of Manhattan Park, Roosevelt Island had a population of 5,100. When the new development is completely rented - it is now about 70 percent full, officials say -the island is expected to have about 7,400 people. The population is still too small to qualify for a branch of the public library, nor have there been enough stores, restaurants or other basic services to make the community complete.
 
A Delayed Subway Line
One key to Roosevelt Island's future - a short subway line that connects it to Manhattan - finally opened last October, 14 years behind schedule. Construction of the last 2,000 apartments depended on the subway because the aerial tramway that connects the island to the rest of Manhattan could not have accommodated more passengers at peak hours. (The city government technically considers the island part of the borough of Manhattan.) Some racial tensions have also arisen. Most of the low-income residents who moved into Manhattan Park are black or Hispanic families. Ms. Neis, the P.T.A. president, said the demographics of the local elementary school had shifted slightly as a result. ''We've had some white flight,'' she said. ''And I have parents who count how many white kids are in the class.''
The actual number of students leaving the school has been small. Fifty-one percent of the school had been white, she said, and now 49 percent is white.
Ms. Neis, who is black, said she was hurt that some white parents removed their children from the school because it now had more minority students.
She said, though, that she was optimistic that most white residents continued to find integration one of the compelling attractions of Roosevelt Island. ''It's something we really want to hold on to,'' she said.
 
Tax-Exempt Bonds
With the subway in place, only one thing is missing to make possible the island's completion: money. Ms. Abramson, who heads the island's corporation, and Richard L. Higgins, State Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, said they hoped that after revision their plan for the last 2,000 apartments would succeed.
The state might float tax-exempt bonds to help finance the new buildings, Mr. Higgins said. The proportion of subsidized to unsubsidized units might also be changed, he said.
''We're ready to go,'' Ms. Abramson said. ''All we need is the money.''

HEADLINE: Officials Fear Albany Cuts Will Raise Local Taxes

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 25

 BODY:
While Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders continue their private negotiations on how to slash state spending, local officials fear that they may be the ones who get bloodied, both fiscally and politically.
Just as the Governor rails against Republicans in Washington for shifting the Federal tax burden to the states, New York's mayors and county executives complain that the state has been passing the buck along to them.
And the local leaders, many of whom are besieged by residents' rebellions against property tax increases, realize that they stand at the end of the line.
''On the local level, there's no place to hide,'' said Patrick G. Halpin, the Suffolk County Executive, a Democrat. ''You can't run to Albany or Washington to escape the attention.'' 
 
Frustratingly Little Information
Because the talks about filling the $1.8 billion gap in this year's state budget have been secretive, little is known about how local governments will ultimately be affected. Local leaders, who have budgets of their own to plan, are frustrated by the lack of information from Albany as negotiators finish work on a budget that is 25 days overdue.
They fear that they will be asked to absorb major cuts in social-service programs like Medicaid and welfare at a time when a weakening economy is stoking demand for those programs. But given that the only list of cuts in social services released by Mr. Cuomo includes vague entries like ''additional reductions - $49.3 million,'' many of their calculations are based on guesswork.
A plan announced today by Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders would save local governments $200 million by reducing their contributions to public employee pension systems. But local leaders believe the pension windfall may not completely offset expected cuts in social services, and they maintain it will not reverse the trend of local governments having to absorb state budget cuts by raising property taxes and cutting services.
''What the state is doing is forcing costs back on the local taxpayer and forcing local government to pay the state's bill,'' said Onondaga County Executive Nicholas J. Pirro, a Republican. ''And local government officials pay the price politically.''
That is a charge that Mr. Cuomo does not necessarily deny. But he argues that the responsibility for soaring property tax rates begins with the Republicans in Washington, who began the initiative that drastically reduced Federal aid to states as well as income-tax rates in the last 10 years.
Mr. Cuomo concedes that the shifting of the tax burden will be pushed along by his grudging compromise with the Senate's Republican leaders to preserve the last phase of a four-year cut in the state's personal-income tax.
''It's not the best thing to do,'' he said at a news conference on Tuesday. ''You cut the income tax when you're broke and you have to raise all the other taxes and the property tax goes up.''
 
Local Aid Increases
While conceding that the state's fiscal problems prevent it from doing all he would like for local governments, Mr. Cuomo points out that the share of the state's budget for local assistance has grown to 67 percent from 60 percent in his eight years as governor.
Almost half of that increase, however, has gone to education and another quarter has been absorbed by Medicaid, leaving local governments to rely more on their own revenues to provide other services. Excluding aid to education, the share of local government revenues provided by state and Federal sources dropped to 17 percent in 1988 from 21 percent in 1983, Mr. Cuomo's first year as governor.
Many local governments have relied on property taxes to make up the difference. A study by the New York Conference of Mayors showed that 87 percent of the state's cities and villages raised property taxes between 1986 and 1989, with the average three-year increase totaling 24 percent.
In the 24 counties that have responded to a survey being conducted by the New York State Association of Counties, property taxes increased last year by an average of 14 percent.
 
'It Must Be Your Fault'
In Broome County, for instance, property taxes were raised 42 percent last year, and County Executive Timothy Grippen attributes 10 percent of the increase to state budget cuts, including the elimination of revenue sharing for counties and restrictions on reimbursements for social-services programs.
''I'm glad I'm not up for re-election next year,'' said Mr. Grippen, a Democrat who is a year into his first four-year term. ''People don't want to hear about Federal cuts or the end of state revenue sharing. They just know it's you that's sitting there so it must be your fault.''
In Suffolk County, Mr. Halpin faces a different kind of problem. To quell a taxpayer revolt instigated by a 48 percent increase in property taxes last year, he took a two-year pledge not to raise them further. But with sales-tax revenues also stagnant, Mr. Halpin fears he will have to cut an already threadbare budget if Suffolk is pinched by the state.
He most fears cuts in Medicaid and welfare programs, which are financed jointly by Federal, state and county governments. Because the state mandates that those services be provided, cutbacks in the state budget often require counties to absorb the loss.
Among the projects that could be hurt is a Suffolk pilot program to save both the state and county money by certifying disabled people for Federal assistance, thereby removing them from county welfare rolls. Last year the program saved more than $3 million, and savings of $9 million are projected for this year.
Suffolk officials have lobbied to have such cost-saving programs exempted from state cuts. ''It just doesn't make any sense,'' said William W. Bartsch, Suffolk County's deputy director of social services. ''It's like firing the cashier in the supermarket and saying you reduced your payroll. Meanwhile, everyone's walking out of the market with bags of groceries.''

HEADLINE: The High Cost of Peace Jolts a Connecticut Factory Town

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTVILLE, Conn.

 BODY:
For most of the 1980's, this town 10 miles north of New London was awash in money from the nation's military build-up. Many of the 17,000 residents commuted to the Electric Boat submarine shipyard in nearby Groton. Others worked at the local UNC Naval Products plant, which builds nuclear reactors for submarines.
But as the cold war thaws and pressure grows to cut the defense budget, the price of peace is starting to become evident here in southeastern Connecticut, long among the nation's regions most dependent on military spending.
Electric Boat, maker of the Trident missile-launching submarine, has not lost any jobs. But this year UNC laid off 166 of its 1,060 employees. This month the company told the remaining workers that they would be dismissed within three years. The next round of layoffs, about 100, are to occur on June 10. 
 
'Tough Times Ahead'
Of the first layoffs, 117 have been prompted by a Navy decision to cut production of its fast-attack submarines.
All the rest are because of a cost-cutting decision by the Department of Energy to give all future marine reactor work to a single contractor, UNC's competitor.
''We are going to have some tough times ahead,'' said Montville's First Selectman, Wayne D. Scott.
In many areas where military contracts help fuel the economy, immediate layoffs remain more a distant fear than a reality. Just a few miles away in Groton, for example, Electric Boat officials are almost bullish about the future. Besides the Trident, the company is building the nation's first Seawolf submarine, a nuclear-powered attack vessel.
 
'We Have a Backlog'
''There are uncertainties,'' said Electric Boat's director of communications, Neil D. Ruenzel. ''Nevertheless we have a backlog and are looking ahead to continuing programs.''
In Montville, though, the military contracts are scheduled to stop, and the economic aftershocks are already rippling through the area's non-defense businesses, from realtors to pizzerias. Town officials also worry about large reductions in their tax bases.
UNC workers talk of winning the cold war only to lose their livelihood.
''The defense workers of America have paid the premiums of peace through their labor and efforts and dedication, but the peace dividend is going to be paid overseas,'' said James B. Rusiecki, a supervisor of electronic technologies. ''That dividend should be turned around and put back into the defense industry for retooling. It's only fair.''
 
Elimination of Competition
The main blow to UNC is a directive by the Department of Energy giving all future construction work on marine nuclear reactors to Babcock & Wilcox of Lynchburg, Va. In some areas of work, particularly those that produce a small volume of products, military officials consider using a single supplier more cost-effective than requiring competition between contractors.
The layoffs astonished UNC employees, many of whom are highly skilled technicians or engineers involved in classified work. As recently as December, they believed that they would be spared projected spending cuts because the Navy and its submarine program appeared the least vulnerable.
Indeed, when the layoffs were announced, UNC was two months shy of starting operations at a new $60 million reactor factory at the 32-year-old, 242-acre complex in the Uncasville section of Montville.
''It's now just sitting there, ready to be dismantled,'' Mr. Rusiecki said.
 
Petition Asks U.S. Aid
This month several hundred UNC employees and their families held a rally at the town's St. Bernard High School to express their concerns to a panel of visiting Congressmen. They also presented a 20,000-name petition asking the Government to supply either enough work to sustain the company or funds to attract non-defense industry to the area.
''We feel that some of the money that's being saved in defense should come back to us,'' said Charla McDermott, a UNC quality-control worker who lives in nearby Bozrah.
At the meeting were Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, who sits on the sea power subcommittee of the Armed Forces Committee; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; Representative Sam Gejdenson of Bozrah and Representative Bruce A. Morrison of New Haven. Mr. Rowland, a Republican, and Mr. Morrison, a Democrat, are candidates for governor.
''This may be the first economic blow because of the peace dividend,'' Mr. Rowland said. Joining them was Dr. Robert M. Rauner, director of the Office of Economic Conversion. He noted that after World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the nation endured greater military reductions.
''It's a growing problem,'' he said. ''But it's just part of the defense industry dynamic.''
 
'Too Good for Too Long'
The lawmakers promised to a try a variety of remedies, including introducing legislation that would allow UNC to continue to compete with Babcock & Wilcox. They also promised to urge the Department of Energy to provide UNC with non-defense projects and to allow the company to do work for some foreign nations.
They cautioned, though, that diversification may arrive too late to save UNC. Asked why Montville had not aggressively sought non-military businesses, Mr. Scott said: ''Things have been too good for too long.''
Montville is home for 156 UNC employees and their families; the rest are scattered in neighboring towns like Norwich, Bozrah and Ledyard. The company is a subsidiary of UNC Inc. of Annapolis, Md., which has 12 divisions and 5,200 employees nationwide. A phase-out of a smaller UNC division in Montville, UNC Aerospace, is expected to be completed later this year.
 
Help to Displaced Offered
Robert F. Bonito, the vice president for human resources at UNC, said the company would offer job counseling and support services to laid-off workers for as long as necessary. He also said he believed that most employees would have little trouble finding work if they were willing to move.
''These are quality people,'' he said, adding that the average length of service at the company was 13 years.
Mr. Bonito said UNC would continue to assist in efforts to obtain new Federal work and attract non-defense industry. He was pessimistic about the prospects, though.
''If something doesn't happen in six months, we'll lose our resources,'' he said. ''Not equipment - people.''

HEADLINE: Police Say Drug-Program Profiles Are Not Biased

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
All but 2 of the 210 people arrested last year in a drug-interdiction program at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown were black or Hispanic, the bistate agency said yesterday.
But the agency insisted that the program, which use profiles of possible drug dealers and couriers, was free of racial discrimination.
A judge in Manhattan has thrown out crucial evidence in the drug arrest of a young black woman in the terminal on the ground that the profiles were almost exclusively aimed at black and Hispanic travelers. A police search found that the woman was carrying several ounces of cocaine, but the judge ruled that the search was illegal. 
The judge, Acting Justice Carol Berkman of State Supreme Court, said she based her ruling on the fact that not one of the defendants arrested by the Port Authority police and taken before her for arraignment was white.
 
Problem With Stereotyping
The police profiles involve characteristics that might seem innocent by themselves but when taken together provide what the police say are strong clues to drug trafficking. They include factors like buying a one-way ticket, paying with cash or being obviously in a hurry.
Although Justice Berkman's ruling has focused new attention on police profiles, the Supreme Court of the United States has upheld their use. Critics contend, however, that since that decision last year, arrests of black and Hispanic suspects have significantly increased. To be black or Hispanic, the critics say, invites the police to draw a racial stereotype of criminal behavior.
The deputy director of the Port Authority public safety department, Salvatore Samperi, disputed such criticism and insisted that the Port Authority profiles were color blind.
He and other law-enforcement officials said profiles were necessary for transient populations, to sort out the criminals from the law-abiding citizens.
Virtually all the people arrested last year at the terminal were black and Hispanic, he said, because the program focuses on long-distance travelers, and nearly 90 percent of those passengers are members of minority groups. ''If you analyze the drug arrests made by the New York City police in areas such as Washington Heights and Harlem,'' Mr. Samperi said. ''you will find the same percentage of those arrested are black or Hispanic.''
 
Reflection of Other Factors
Several criminal-justice officials said the ratio of arrests reflected a ''reality of the streets'' rather than a policy of racial discrimination.
Even defense advocates like the Legal Aid Society said the preponderance of black and Hispanic arrests reflected the economic facts that most people who committed crimes were poor and that black and Hispanic people were the poorest in the city.
In her ruling, released on Tuesday, Justice Berkman harshly criticized the Port Authority for ''discriminatory law enforcement,'' which, she said, ''does incalculable damage to our civil liberties and which produces at best questionable results for the war on drugs.''
 
Ratio in Holding Cells
Justice Berkman's ruling dealt with a tiny percentage of the defendants taken to the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street. But it also reflected the reality of arraignment courts. On a given day, the defendants in holding cells awaiting arraignments are overwhelmingly black or Hispanic.
''Of course the criminal-justice system is racially biased,'' said Sterling Johnson Jr, the special narcotics prosecutor. Mr. Johnson, whose office prosecuted the case criticized by Justice Berkman, also said the profiles of criminal behavior used by narcotics police could ''absolutely be racially inspired.''
Mr. Johnson, who is black, said, ''The only thing we can do when that happens is weed it out.''
As for the impression that virtually everyone arrested on the street is a black or Hispanic suspect, Mr. Johnson added, ''It's a lot easier for the police to arrest a mugger and a drug seller than it is a forger, a wife beater or a discreet drug user in the suburbs.''
The city's new Criminal Justice Coordinator, former Justice Milton Mollen, said the disproportionate number of black and Hispanic defendants troubled him, too.
''How can you say if the ratio is a result of racism or reality?'' he asked yesterday. ''I'm not sure I'm capable of answering that question. I'm not sure there is any easy answer.
''But it all starts when the police arrest people, and I cannot accept the charge that the police only go out and arrest blacks and Hispanics and are reluctant to arrest whites. What I believe is that the arrest figures are a sad commentary on our society in that they relect the reality of the streets.''
The head of the Legal Aid Society, Archibald Murray, said: ''The police arrest the poorest people who have the least, and that happens to be the black and Hispanics of this city. Arrests are mostly made at the bottom of the economic ladder.
''But there is a need to make the criminal-justice system respond more apporopriately to that reality. Blacks and Hispanics are not inherently criminal, even though that is a common and mistaken impression. People become criminals because they are poor.''

HEADLINE: Milken's Sentence;
Leniency to Be Sought on Argument That 'Junk Bonds' Helped Business

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
Although the guilty pleas that Michael R. Milken entered on Tuesday were not to selling ''junk bonds,'' his legal team is planning to make the high-risk, high-yield securities a focal point of his attempt to avoid a long prison sentence.
Mr. Milken, the former head of the junk bond division of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., faces a maximum prison term of 28 years when he is sentenced for securities laws violations. His counsel expect him to get no more than five years, but some legal scholars would not be surprised if he received eight years, and more is possible. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood who has scheduled sentencing for October, has been on the bench only since 1988, too short a time for lawyers to discern a pattern in sentencing. 
Nor can they predict with confidence how she will react to the arguments planned by Mr. Milken's lawyers and public relations team - that he is a statesman-like financier whose junk bond sales did significant good for the downtrodden among corporate America, which were unable to obtain money elsewhere.
 
Lack of Cooperation a Factor
Mr. Milken is precluded from using many of the standard pleas for leniency because of the breadth of the charges, his wealth and his lack of cooperation with Government investigators.
He and his lead lawyer, Arthur L. Liman, foreshadowed his argument on Tuesday in separate statements at the United States Courthouse.
''It is an enormous accomplishment for Michael to have been instrumental in finding the capital for hundreds of American corporations, which are generating jobs, providing a livelihood for hundreds of thousands of people,'' Mr. Liman said in a statement on the courthouse steps at Foley Square on Tuesday. ''It is Michael's hope that in the long run history will see his violations in context and judge him not just on the basis of his lapses but on the basis of the contributions that he made to the economy and to the American people.''
Some legal scholars are not impressed by that argument and suggest it could even cause the judge to impose a relatively steep sentence.
''The notion that junk bonds did a lot of good strikes me as a non sequitur,'' said Joel Seligman, a professor of securities regulation at the University of Michigan Law School. ''Whatever good they did, it doesn't justify violating the law.''
 
Other Arguments for Leniency
And that will not be the only basis for seeking leniency in sentencing. Lawyers and people involved in the case said that Mr. Milken would probably argue that the Government has already barred him from the American securities industry for life and that he has suffered close to four years of difficult publicity and scrutiny. He will also probably cite his enormous contributions over the years to a variety of charities through his private foundations.
But the thrust of his arguments is expected to be the contention that his work with junk bonds helped hundreds of small corporations expand and provided jobs for hundreds of thousands.
Some critics of debt financing, however, point to other aspects of the junk market. While many small and less creditworthy companies did expand by raising money through high-yield, high-risk instruments, estimates are that about half of the funds raised through junk bonds in the last decade have gone either for corporate takeovers or for reorganizations to avoid unsolicited takeover bids. According to the Securities Data Company of Newark, $71 billion of the $153.7 billion issued between 1980 and 1989 in junk bonds went to acquisition-related activities.
 
Heavy Cost to Taxpayers
And about 7 percent of the junk bonds were placed in the portfolios of savings and loans institutions, many of which have since collapsed, costing taxpayers billions of dollars.
But Mr. Milken's legal team cannot rely on the arguments that have won relatively lenient treatment for other Wall Street felons. They cannot argue, for example, that their client will be destitute. Indeed, although he agreed to pay a record-breaking fine of $600 million, he earned $1.1 billion in compensation alone.
Nor apparently will he be able to claim that he has provided any substantial assistance to the Government in tracking down other criminals. This defense worked particularly well in mitigating the sentences of Ivan F. Boesky, the speculator who served two years of a three-year sentence and settled insider trading charges, and Boyd L. Jefferies, the trader who received probation after pleading guilty to two felony counts.
The breadth of the six charges also prevent his lawyers from maintaining that the case involves a single aberrational instance of wrongdoing. This view was effectively argued by lawyers for Robert M. Freeman, a former partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who earlier this month drew a four-month prison sentence for a single instance of illegal insider trading.
Judge Wood, a Reagan appointee and a relative newcomer to Foley Square, has earned high praise from a wide number of Government and private lawyers for her diligence and insightful rulings, but no one is predicting confidently what she will do in this case.
''She's an unknown on sentencing,'' a Milken adviser said.
 
Letters of Support Expected
Following a standard formula, the lawyers for Mr. Milken, in asking for mercy, will submit letters deeply supportive of Mr. Milken from business executives, clients, friends and others.
The Government will also file a memorandum that outlines the depths of the crimes Mr. Milken has committed and is expected to ask for a substantial sentence.
Under the terms of the plea agreement, prosecutors may not suggest what terms the judge ought to impose. In past practice, the prosecutors have noted to the judge what punishment would be under the Federal sentencing guidelines, which call for considerably harsher treatment in most white-collar crime and give less latitude to the judge than the previous rules. As a technical matter, the new rules are not applicable to the Milken case because they were adopted after his crimes were committed.
Judge Wood will also be guided by a report prepared by probation officers that presents a profile of Mr. Milken and suggests possible penalties.

HEADLINE: Shorter Rations for Borrowers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Some companies are complaining that their banks have turned stingy with loans, creating a ''credit crunch'' that could needlessly strangle business activity and cause a recession. For their part, bankers talk about ''prudent'' lending as a reasoned response to a weaker economy and to the tightening of standards by Federal bank regulators.
Is corporate America feeling a genuine credit crunch, a squeeze in which loans are all but unavailable at any price, similar to the one that occurred in 1974?
Federal Reserve officials, economists and bankers say the answer is a qualified ''no.'' They agree that harsher treatment by Federal bank examiners has made bankers more cautious lenders, but they say that a lack of bank lending does not threaten to cause a recession. 
 
Tougher Requirements
Certainly, many small and medium-sized companies are finding loans tougher to get. With increasing frequency, their banks are withdrawing credit lines, demanding that more collateral be put up to back loans, trimming their estimates of the worth of collateral that is offered and taking a generally more suspicious view of borrowers' growth forecasts. There has even been a sharp slowing in some types of lending to individuals, like home-equity loans.
The problem of credit restraint varies considerably by region. Lending for real estate and to smaller companies has been most dramatically crimped in the Northeast, where the economy has slowed sharply after the booming 1980's. Politicians in New England are particularly concerned. The House Small Business Committee held hearings yesterday on the standards used by bank examiners and their effect on the availability of credit in New England.
Yet despite some tightening of lending standards, larger businesses -typically those with annual sales of $100 million and more - still find plenty of willing lenders, the Fed officials, economists and bankers say.
''This is not a credit crunch where suddenly the lenders have no money,'' said Albert Wojnilower, senior adviser to the First Boston Corporation. ''The process now is one of credit restraint where funds are readily available in the financial markets, but banks are tightening their standards.''
Instead of rationing loans by price - as when the Federal Reserve's tight-money policies pushed short-term interest rates above 20 percent in 1980 and 1981 - loans are now being allocated by credit standards set by each bank.
Mr. Wojnilower said both kinds of restraint tend to slow economic growth. But he said the current credit restraint was not severe enough to cause a recession.
With foreign banks accounting for more than a quarter of all business loans, and with the securities markets funneling money to more companies than ever before, analysts say that a credit crunch stemming only from American bankers' reticence is becoming less plausible every year.
Economists note that the gross national product, the output of goods and services, is expected to show a rise of more than 2 percent, at an annual rate after inflation, in the first quarter of 1990. That is up from 1.1 percent in the last quarter of 1989.
''A growth rate of over 2 percent does not describe an economy suffering from a credit crunch,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. He noted that the seven-year-old economic expansion has survived other bouts of regional weakness, like the depression in the oil-producing states in the mid-1980's.
In New England, bankers' restraint is closely linked to the billions of dollars in losses banks have taken on bad real estate loans. With office vacancy rates above 25 percent in some cities in New England and elsewhere on the East Coast, banks began reducing lending last year, even before bank examiners forced them to report large losses early this year.
But recently, the cutback in real estate lending has been supplemented by a less severe but still noticeable reduction in lending to other businesses. In some cases, the cutback has come from banks that had much of their capital wiped out by real estate losses and are now forced to reduce their size to comply with regulators' rules on adequate capital.
In many cases, the cutbacks in bank lending go beyond just eliminating risky borrowers. Joseph Blair, executive director of the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Authority, said that a recent survey of companies showed ''significant problems with the availablity of credit'' even for companies that had previously been judged creditworthy by local banks. Effect on the G.N.P. ''There is no doubt that small and medium-sized companies are having problems getting credit,'' Richard F. Syron, president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, said in a telephone interview. ''It's not enough to expect a major impact on G.N.P., but that is scant comfort to someone who borrows $150,000 and is caught in a squeeze not of their own making.''
John P. LaWare, a former Boston banker who is now a governor of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, has spoken several times of anecdotal evidence that credit is now less available. But the most detailed comments by a Fed official on credit availability came last week from the chairman, Alan Greenspan, who said that bank lending to business has expanded this year, though more slowly than it did last year.
He conceded that tougher lending standards have ''potential effects on the level of local economic activity.'' But, he said, the restraint has not been severe or prolonged enough to hurt entire regions.
Bankers acknowledge that they have made some changes recently. But they also note that they have no desire to stop lending entirely, because making loans that are repaid is how banks generate profits.
''We are still trying to increase our market share, but when the regional economy worsens, it is only prudent for a lender to test new loan applications in light of the changed conditions,'' said Brendan J. Dugan, president of National Westminster Bank USA in New York.
 
Lowering Expectations
For example, instead of accepting a borrower's forecast of 15 percent sales growth, the bank might assume a 5 percent growth rate. And some companies that would be considered creditworthy with 15 percent sales growth are denied loans when the lower projection is used.
Chemical Bank is the largest and most active lender to middle-sized companies in the New York area, and its chairman, Walter V. Shipley, said lending standards were indeed a bit tougher. But the change has not been sudden or recent.
''We saw the economy in the Northeast softening about two years ago,'' Mr. Shipley said. Since then, Chemical has sharply cut real estate loans it deemed risky and ''consciously eliminated relationships with middle-market companies that accounted for about $1 billion of loans.''
Those cutbacks may send some customers to Chemical's competitors, but Mr. Shipley said any loss of business would be more than offset by the benefits of avoiding bad loans.
Fed data show that bank lending has grown this year, but at a slower rate than in 1989. Business loans at large banks have increased $3.1 billion since the beginning of the year, slower than the rate that produced a $17.9 billion rise for all of 1989.
But that is still a far cry from a credit crunch, in which loans actually decline. Real estate loans, excluding home-equity loans, also continue to increase, rising $6.7 billion since the beginning of the year, again at a slower rate than in 1989, when such loans rose $43 billion for the year.
In the six-state region tracked by the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, business loans at large banks have fallen 7.9 percent since the beginning of the year, or about $1.8 billion, to $20.8 billion as of April 11.
 
Borrowers Are More Cautious
Not all the slowdown in lending can be attributed to tougher credit standards at banks. When business turns down, experienced companies of all sizes try to ride out the bad times by reducing expenses and holding borrowing to a minimum.
''Rather than the banks turning off the spigot in the New York area, the demand for credit has subsided,'' said Mr. Dugan of National Westminster. ''We don't have to tell most customers to be cautious.''

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Behind the Sale Of Marshall Field

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
THE Dayton Hudson Corporation's $1.04 billion deal to buy Marshall Field & Company, announced last Thursday, shows that despite the recent troubles of several big department stores, a strong economic niche still exists for full-line, broad-based chains, merchants and analysts say.
They also say the aggressive bidding for Marshall Field by major department store companies and by a Field's management team reflected the value still held by huge stores that sell a wide range of wares aimed mostly at affluent customers. But more important, analysts say, is that they have healthy cash flows and good management.
The same could be said of the announced sale of Saks Fifth Avenue yesterday to an international investment group for about $1.5 billion. Saks and Marshall Field were put on the auction block last September by B.A.T. Industries as part of a restructuring plan to offset a hostile takeover bid by Sir James Goldsmith. 
The prices for Saks and Field's were both surprisingly high, but for different reasons, retail executives said. Saks sold at a premium because it is basically in a class by itself as a mass seller of high-fashion goods, they said. The Marshall Field deal centered on the fact that the Chicago retailer offers goods from housewares and furniture to toys and designer clothes - under exclusive labels and store brands - and does so more successfully than most other American department stores.
''Dayton Hudson knows what it is doing in department stores,'' said Robert Buchanan, an analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons of Baltimore. ''It obviously doesn't agree with the critics who say that the department store's day is over because of the big boom in specialty stores.''
With the recent demise, dismantling or fiscal problems of well-known retailers like B. Altman, Bonwit Teller and Bloomingdale's, many critics had pronounced department stores that sell everything from pots and pans to designer dresses as dinosaurs headed for extinction.
Specialty-store rivals, especially, deride what they call the anachronistic clutter of full-line department stores and point to their own relative success in handling only sportswear, high fashion or toys. Retailing consultants have said that stores with a wide array of merchandise had better strip down to their most desirable departments.
But Marshall Field, in Chicago, and Dayton Hudson, in Minneapolis and Detroit, have remained dominant in their home markets as full-price family department stores, making a good profit even as rivals have faltered.
It is not that the successful stores have not changed. Many of them, including Marshall Field, have added or eliminated entire departments.
But executives and analysts say the major distinctions of chains doing well are that they have made sure the customer has a clear perception of what the stores offer, kept up to date with trends and refurbished their stores. Marshall Field just spent more than $100 million to remodel its flagship store on State Street in downtown Chicago.
Analysts say there is little doubt that the purchase of Marshall Field was a good move by Dayton Hudson. ''It gives Dayton Hudson an excellent department store chain, with a strategic geographic fit,'' Mr. Buchanan said.
The move is also a strategic shift for Dayton Hudson. In 1984 it sold its department stores in Phoenix and Oklahoma City and consolidated some operations of its J. L. Hudson stores in Detroit with its Dayton stores in Minneapolis. Since then, Dayton Hudson appears to be retrenching its department store business and expanding its powerful discount chain, Target Stores, which rang up about $7.5 billion of the corporation's sales of more than $13 billion last year.
The latest transaction indicates that Dayton Hudson is not staking its future just on Target and on the moderate-priced Mervyn's clothing stores. By adding Marshall Field's $1.1 billion volume and some expected overall sales growth, Dayton Hudson's department store revenues should rise to about $3.1 billion this year from $1.8 billion last year, analysts say.
But more important for Dayton Hudson is that buying Marshall Field's 24 stores in four states makes Dayton the upper Midwest's biggest operator of middle-to-upper-priced department stores.
''While Dayton Hudson did sell its Southwest stores, the company apparently revised its opinion of department stores, probably because of their improved profitability,'' said Walter F. Loeb, a New York retailing consultant. ''The company's department stores had been growing at an estimated 11 percent annually compounded. The price paid for Field's is a good one, with most people thinking it would be about $800 million.''

HEADLINE: Real Estate Feels the Pain Of Tighter Credit Standards

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The real estate industry, more than any other, is feeling the pinch of the tighter lending standards being applied by banks across the country.
With real estate values falling in some regions, particularly the Northeast, after the generous lending and building boom of the 1980's, some tightening of credit is natural and even welcomed by some developers.
But many real estate professionals say that even some established developers without problem loans now find themselves unable to finance their projects. The problem, they contend, has been made worse by overzealous Federal bank examiners. 
 
Regulators Called 'Intimidating'
''We are in the middle of a real estate credit crunch right now,'' said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the department of real estate and urban economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a consultant at Salomon Brothers. ''The regulators are being overly aggressive and far too cautious in their assessment of the value of real estate. The regulators are intimidating the lenders.''
In the light of the savings and loan debacle and the troubled real estate portfolios of banks in New England and the Southwest, Robert Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, and his examiners have become more strict in supervising commercial bank lending, especially real estate loans.
Mr. Clarke defends the tougher approach, saying regulators are often unfairly deemed responsible for tighter lending policies that were adopted by the banks themselves.
''It's really the responsibility of the banks to oversee their own credit quality,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''To suggest that it's our fault is to abdicate the banks' responsibility to maintain their own credit quality.''
Yet Mr. Clarke also notes that his examiners try to assess the likelihood that a loan might be paid, rather than ''wait until it goes sour.''
''You can be anticipatory without being unreasonable,'' he said.
Lending for real estate nationwide has not been stagnant, but the standards for loans have been raised. According to Federal Reserve figures, real estate loans nationally continued to increase in the first three months of 1990, rising $6.7 billion, though the rate of increase is far slower than the pace last year. But a different picture emerges from regional data. For example, construction loans in New England dropped 9.1 percent last year, after annual increases ranging from 25 percent to 52 percent in the previous four years.
''What we have is American banks taking a much more conservative view toward real estate lending and raising the credit requirements,'' said Arthur Sonnenblick, vice chairman of Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation, one of the country's largest commercial brokers.
 
Other Sources of Finance
He said, however, that top-quality, pre-leased buildings were still being financed. ''On attractive transactions there's still plenty of money,'' Mr. Sonnenblick said. ''There are the Canadian banks, the Japanese banks, and some American banks that are out there and still feel comfortable doing deals.''
The banks have cut back on their lending largely by raising the standards used to judge loan requests, a change that many say was sorely needed to correct excesses in real estate lending. For example, banks that a few years ago were willing to provide all the financing for an office building or shopping center are now willing to supply only a portion of the financing and they require that more money be put up by the borrower.
''I think you will find that all the banks now have more stringent underwriting criteria,'' said Edward Pabich, the former senior vice president in charge of real estate lending at Connecticut Bank and Trust.
 
Advance Commitments Sought
Mr. Pabich said the banks had also raised their standards by, for instance, demanding that developers have more advance commitments to lease the office space or buy the apartments being built.
One of the most frequent complaints the banks have about the regulators is that they are excessively and arbitrarily marking down the value of real estate loan portfolios. In many instances the bankers say the examiners are reviewing loans that they reviewed only a year ago and marking down the value or forcing the banks to increase loan-loss reserves, even when there have been no late payments or other problems on those loans.
''This is causing banks to increase their loan-loss reserves and add more loans to their nonperforming lists than they would have had to last year with the same exact loans still being paid,'' said Joseph Brannen, executive vice president of the Georgia Bankers Association.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Stable To Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of the taxable money market funds monitored by the IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report were unchanged for the week that ended yesterday, while those of tax-exempt funds were slightly higher.
Mixed economic news and constant signs of inflation are keeping the Federal Reserve Bank from taking any action on lowering short-term interest rates, Donoghue's analysts said. The yields on money market funds have remained relatively flat for months, and fund managers say they do not expect any noticeable change in the near future. 
For the third straight week, the average number of days to maturity of securities held in money managers' portfolios was 44.
The analysts note that the yields on bank certificates of deposit are becoming attractive. Some money that found its way into money market funds as C.D. yields fell may be headed back, they say.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund was unchanged at 7.99 percent, while the 30-day average yield rose by a basis point, to 7.99 percent.
The assets of taxable funds declined by $400 million for the week, to a total of $381.7 billion, with institutional assets down by $661 million, to $78.4 billion. The assets of consumer funds, those for small investors, rose by about $260 million, to $303.1 billion.
 
Dreyfus Riding High
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., showed the best return, with a yield of 8.91 percent, up from 8.88 percent. The fund has shown the best return for more than two months.
The yields of tax-exempt funds were up slightly for the week that ended yesterday, and assets declined by $916 million, to a total of $76.6 billion. The average on a seven-day compounded yield increased to 5.74 percent, from 5.63 percent last week. For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, an equivalent taxable yield would be 7.97 percent. For those in a 33 percent bracket, the equivalent would be 8.56 percent.
For the third consecutive week, the best-yielding tax-exempt fund was the Spartan Pennsylvania Municipal Money Market Portfolio, distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation in Boston. Its yield was 6.56 percent, up from 6.52 percent last week and about 82 basis points points higher than the seven-day average.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed that bank money market accounts were unchanged at 6.24 percent. C.D.'s, on the other hand, were up.

HEADLINE: Goodyear Net Tumbled 77.9% in First Quarter

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings plunged 77.9 percent because of severe price competition, the slowdown in automobile production and higher costs.
Goodyear's net income fell to $20.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $94.5 million, or $1.64 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales were up slightly, to $2.69 billion, from $2.64 billion in the first quarter of last year. 
Goodyear's position as the world's largest tire producer will soon be overtaken with the acquisition of the Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company by Groupe Michelin of France. In the last few years, competition has intensified as the merger of tire companies has produced a few international giants, eager to gain market share. And price competition has been particularly fierce in recent years.
Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said that the company had expected earnings to be depressed in the first half of the year and that conditions were likely to improve in the second half.
''We're not happy with the results, but they are basically what we saw coming with the economic conditions in Detroit being what they are,'' Mr. Barrett said.
 
Results Affected by Ad Costs
Goodyear, which has been looking to increase its share in the replacement tire market, said that its results were affected by the costs of an advertising campaign to promote its new All-American and Concorde lines. Indeed, the first-quarter results indicated that worldwide tire sales, on a unit basis, increased 1.1 percent, with a 3.3 percent increase in unit sales domestically.
''That increase was the surprise in the first-quarter earnings, since it was coming in the face of a 27 percent decline in original equipment sales,'' said Harry W. Millis, a tire industry analyst with McDonald & Company in Cleveland, referring to the drop in sales to automobile manufacturers. ''That indicates a sharp gain in market penetration in the replacement tire market,'' Mr. Millis said.
He and other analysts said, however, that the company's earnings were being hurt by lower prices for tires. ''It appears that tire profits for Goodyear were down close to 40 percent for the quarter,'' he said.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Goodyear's stock was up 50 cents yesterday, closing at $35.50.
The company said that operating income in its domestic geographic segment fell 40.3 percent, to $82.8 million. The foreign geographic segment had a 25.4 percent drop in operating income, to $90.8 million.
In Europe, sales increased strongly but operating income declined because of lower prices and marketing costs, the company said. First-quarter sales in Latin America increased significantly, Goodyear said, but operating income was negatively affected because of major economic reforms currently being undertaken in Brazil, Mr. Barrett said.
The company said sales and operating income in the Asia and Africa segment declined, primarily because of the sale last year of Goodyear's subsidiary in South Africa. And sales declined in Canada, where Goodyear recorded a loss because of start-up costs at a plant in Napanee, Ontario.

HEADLINE: New U.S. Aid Sought For High Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Proponents of increased financial support for the development of advanced technologies, concerned that the Bush Administration is reducing its commitment to research sponsored by a Pentagon agency, are scrambling to find new sources of money outside the military budget.
The efforts have been intensified because of the removal last week of Craig I. Fields, the director of the Pentagon agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, in a dispute over what the agency's role should be. The agency has played a vital role in the development of technologies that proved to have important commercial as well as military applications, including advanced computers and aerospace materials.
Several executives of the agency said Dr. Fields had been transferred to a new post because he had advocated high-technology initiatives that some high Administration officials opposed as smacking of advocating the development of certain industries - a de facto industrial policy. 
 
A Variety of Proposals
Acknowledging that they have little hope of either restoring Dr. Fields to his old position or forcing the Administration to direct the Pentagon agency toward nonmilitary research, proponents of increased financial support have shifted their attention to a variety of proposals. But they concede that the prospects for such proposals are dimmed by the Administration's ideological opposition to such concepts.
Here are some of the proposals:
* A new plan by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, a Government-industry advisory group, to set up a private $5 billion to $10 billion fund, backed by Federal loan guarantees, to create an Electronics Capital Corporation. It would provide money for important technology projects.
* A bill introduced by Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, that would provide $1.75 billion for the development of advanced computers, software and computer networks.
* A bill to be introduced soon by Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, to establish a corporation, known as the Technology Corporation of America, that would support joint ventures with $50 million a year.
* A bill by Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, that would allocate $100 million annually for applied research financed by a new organization, the Advanced Civilian Technology Agency, a civilian counterpart to Darpa within the Commerce Department.
* The expansion of Federal financing for the Advanced Technology Program, created this year at the National Institute for Standards and Technology and currently receiving $10 million annually.
But the Bush Administration's position has left supporters pessimistic that significant Federal programs will emerge soon to underwrite important research in areas including high-definition television, advanced semiconductors and computers.
''Even many of the initiatives that were started under the Reagan Administration are on the chopping block,'' said Robert Reich, a Harvard economist who favors the development of Government programs that foster advanced technologies.
 
'An Industrial Outcry'
But proponents of increased support for such research argue that the Administration's opposition to new spending initiatives is breeding intense criticism even from Republican strongholds.
''There's an industrial outcry building up,'' said Robert Cohen, a New York economic consultant. ''Normally conservative corporate executives are extremely upset about the way the country is moving away from promoting industrial innovation.''
One difficulty facing those concerned about a growing gap between the United States and Japan in terms of capital investment is how to match the historically effective style of the Pentagon agency in supporting leading-edge research.
The agency spends about $1 billion annually in areas including advanced computing, exotic materials and future manufacturing techniques. By spending in a freewheeling fashion, often backing academic and corporate research ventures before they are ready for commercial financing, the agency has had an enormous influence over the course of the computer industry, many executives say.
Some industry executives and Government officials point out that it will not be easy to duplicate the Pentagon agency's style. ''The big issue is who are you going to trust to make the investment?'' said Robert Kahn, a former official of the agency who left it to found the Corporation for National Research Initiatives. ''Setting up a brand new organization and bringing in new people entails its own risks.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
2-Year Notes Get Tepid Reception

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower again yesterday, as a morning rally was cut short by selling after an auction of $10.5 billion of new two-year Treasury notes received a lukewarm reception.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 8.90 percent, the highest yield on a two-year note since the two-year note sale a year ago, and well above the 8.59 percent average yield at the last two-year note auction on March 27.
Attracted by high yields, demand from individual investors was strong, as more than $1.9 billion worth of noncompetitive bids were placed. The amount was the highest for a two-year note auction since January 1989. 
Noncompetitive bids, where investors agree to pay the average of all bids, are considered a good gauge of demand by individual investors and small banks.
 
'Market Just Isn't in Good Shape'
''The auction wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible,'' one government bond trader said. ''The market just isn't in good shape, and there is nothing else to say about it.''
There were strong signs that the new securities were having difficulties. Late yesterday, the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.94 percent, up four basis points from the average yield at the auction. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
William V. Sullivan, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that ''there is no retail sponsorship for higher prices, and a sense that the upcoming supply of new Treasury issues can only be underwritten at higher yields.''
Traders said some of yesterday's selling was prompted by fears that the Federal Reserve Board would tighten its monetary policy in advance of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions early next month.
 
Stable Federal Funds Rate
Despite continued worries about inflation, most analysts remain convinced that weakness in certain key sectors of the economy, as well as a strong dollar, will prevent the Fed from moving soon to push up the overnight Federal funds rate, the short-term money-market interest rate it most directly controls.
The Federal funds rate has remained around its current level of about 8 1/4 percent since mid-December.
''There is a fairly sharp division at the Fed'' about the need to tighten policy, said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that examines the credit and foreign-exchange markets.
''If I thought they were going to move tomorrow, it would be to tighten rather than ease,'' Mr. Stone said. ''But I think they will wait. The economy is not as strong as many people seem to think it is.''
 
Eighth Drop in Nine Sessions
Yesterday's dip in cash market prices was the eighth in the last nine sessions.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent Treasury bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 95 1/8, down 5/32, to yield 8.97 percent. Late Tuesday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.95 percent.
The 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 27/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.98 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 1/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.97 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.76 percent, up two basis points. And six-month bills were offered at a rate of 7.94 percent, up six basis points.
 
New Brunswick Debentures
Elsewhere, a number of new issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a $200 million offering of 30-year debentures for the Province of New Brunswick in Canada.
The 9 3/4 percent debentures, which mature on May 15, 2020, were priced at $99.85 to yield 9.87 percent, 90 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds at the time of pricing. The securities are noncallable for life.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead underwriter for the transaction, which is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Morgan Stanley Group Inc. offered $200 million of five-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company, its principal subsidiary.
The 9 7/8 percent notes were priced at $99.875, to yield 9.907 percent, 95 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
 
Rothschild's Re-evaluation
In other developments, poor conditions in the tax-exempt municipal bond market have forced L. F. Rothschild & Company to re-evaluate whether it will remain in the market.
The financially troubled firm re-entered the municipal bond market in November after an absence of nearly two years.
''When we got back in, we decided to give it six months,'' said Robert McNamara, a managing director in charge of capital market operations. ''But the market has been choppy and new-issue volume has been low. At this pont we don't know whether or not next month we will have a municipal bond department.''
Actively traded issues in the secondary municipal bond market, which have mostly avoided the sharp drop in Treasury prices, were hit hard yesterday. Dealers said that prices of most issues fell by about 1/2 a point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said prices of intermediate-term issues dipped by about 1/8 point, while long-term bond prices fell by about 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	99.955	Average Yield	8.90%	Low Price	99.934	High Yield	8.94%	High Price	99.991	Low Yield	8.88%	Accepted at low price	71%	Total applied for	$26,123,770	Accepted	$10,502,595	N.Y. applied for	$22,752,360	N.Y. accepted	$8,525,120	Noncompetitive	$1,906,000	Interest set at	8 7/8%

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Prices Plunge; Gold and Silver Fall Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal futures prices plunged yesterday as a supply-connected collapse of platinum prices prompted selling in the gold and silver markets, which had already been weakened by a lack of investor demand.
Gold for spot delivery traded as low as $370 an ounce for the first time since April 2, and silver plummeted to its lowest level in nearly four years.
On other commodity markets, copper futures surged to an eight-month high; oil futures were sharply lower; grains and soybeans retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
Gold futures settled $5.20 to $5.70 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in April at $370.70 an ounce; silver was 7.5 to 9.1 cents lower, with April at $4.919, the lowest settlement price for a near-month silver contract on the exchange since May 19, 1986.
 
Platinum Off $15.60 an Ounce
Platinum futures finished $15.60 lower across the board on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with July at $472.20 an ounce, the lowest near-month platinum settlement since April 2.
The tumble extended Tuesday's steep losses in gold and silver, which analysts had attributed mainly to weak investor demand in the face of rising interest rates.
Some analysts also cited sluggish spring car sales, inferring a corresponding drop in platinum demand for use in automobile catalytic converters.
Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., discounted that notion, saying that car makers buy platinum on an annual contract basis.
''I really think it was a technical selloff and all these things were excuses,'' she said.
 
Copper Prices Surge
The exchange reported supplies of deliverable copper at about 6,000 tons yesterday, one day before the April contract is due to expire. Another exchange report indicated that more than 10,000 tons of copper would have been needed to satisfy all outstanding April contracts as of Tuesday, the last day for which statistics were available.
The apparent shortfall in deliverable supplies was the main factor behind yesterday's striking surge in copper futures prices, analysts said.
Copper settled 1.1 to 10 cents higher, with the April contract up 10 cents at $1.34 a pound, the highest settlement of a near-month copper contract since Aug. 25.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Swiss Franc and Mark Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most primary foreign currencies yesterday in light trading as the Swiss franc and the West German mark rose sharply, traders said.
The traders said the Swiss currency was bolstered by the Swiss central bank's decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates. That caused the dollar to lose strength against the franc, said Lorenzo Troni, the vice president of foreign exchange at Paine Webber International Inc. 
The mark strengthened against the dollar on the belief that the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, would raise its official interest rate soon to stem inflation, Mr. Troni said. Higher West German interest rates make returns on the mark relatively more attractive as an investment.
Linda McLaughlin, a currency trader with Chemical Bank, said the dollar lost its value because of technical factors, with little economic news to affect the currency. Trading was light, she added.
In late trading in London, the dollar fetched 1.4665 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865 late on Tuesday. Later, in New York, the American currency traded at 1.4575 Swiss francs, down from 1.4875 late on Tuesday.
In late London trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6820 marks, down from 1.6930 marks late on Tuesday. It stood at 1.6780 marks late yesterday in New York, lower than Tuesday's late rate of 1.6980 marks.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose by 1.10 yen to close at 159.25 yen. In London, it was quoted late yesterday at 158.59 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 158.73 yen, down from 158.95 yen late on Tuesday.
The pound sank in London after the British announcement that the country's merchandise trade deficit widened in March to 2.18 billion, from February's 1.39 billion. The currency, however, later finished stronger on buying by the Bank of England.
Sterling finished the day in London at $1.6370, compared with $1.6345 on Tuesday. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.6405, from $1.6347 on Tuesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 5.6345 French francs, down from 5.6980; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.75, and 1.1608 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15955.

HEADLINE: CHENEY PROPOSES SHARP REDUCTIONS IN NEW WARPLANES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Facing intense pressure from Congress to cut more deeply into the Pentagon budget, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today proposed large reductions in the development and production of new warplanes, including the Stealth bomber.
Citing changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Mr. Cheney told Congress that the Pentagon now wants to buy 75 of the Stealth, or B-2, bombers instead of the 132 that the Air Force had initially sought. The cut would reduce the cost of the Stealth program from $75.4 billion to $61.1 billion, but raise the cost of each plane to $815 million from $530 million.
The cost tradeoff drew support from some members of Congress, but appeared to leave the program vulnerable to further reductions from lawmakers who consider the advanced radar-evading aircraft a prime target for budget savings.
 
Seeking Political Viability
Mr. Cheney also indicated that he had made a preliminary decision to cut the Navy's fleet of aircraft carriers from 14 to 12. 
The overall plan represents the Bush Administration's most forceful effort to shape a politically viable plan for military spending when tensions with the Soviet Union are receding and the Warsaw Pact has collapsed as a threat to Europe. It brings the Administration's military spending proposals closer to the lower ones outlined by leading members of Congress, but still leaves a substantial gap.
Mr. Cheney's proposals would produce a reduction of $2.4 billion in the $295 billion Pentagon budget that the Administration has proposed for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. That proposal is already 2.6 percent lower than the amount that would be needed to keep pace with inflation.
 
Cheney's Promise
Through 1997, Mr. Cheney's proposals would produce savings of $34.8 billion, which would amount to a first step toward fulfilling the promise he made earlier this year to continue cutting the budget at a rate of about 2 percent a year.
Shortly after the Bush Administration submitted its budget proposal to Congress in January, Mr. Cheney said he had begun a review of plans to buy new warplanes and might return later in the year with revised plans and additional savings. He did so today in appearances before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Mr. Cheney had been chided by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and others in Congress for failing to outline a long-term vision for reshaping the military. His testimony today, which was an important step in that process, was in general welcomed by Congressional arms experts, although some said the plans still did not go far enough.
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Armed Services committee, said further budget reductions would be needed, and he complained that Mr. Cheney's proposals were ''still based on an unrealistically pessimistic view of the Soviet threat.''
In addition to the Stealth reductions, Mr. Cheney proposed cutting by half the Pentagon's planned purchase of new C-17 transport planes, buying fewer of the Navy's A-12 attack plane and deferring production of two new Air Force planes, an air-to-air fighter and an air-to-ground attack plane.
The immediate military implications of the plan are limited, since some of the new warplanes were not scheduled for production until the mid-1990's.
 
A Program That Can Be Sold
Nevertheless, Mr. Cheney's proposals are an important scaling back for weapons systems that are to serve the military well into the next century.
Mr. Cheney is clearly hoping the reduction in the total cost of the Stealth program will improve the prospects for Congressional approval, and some supporters agreed.
Representative Robert W. Davis, Republican of Michigan, said Mr. Cheney had given Republicans ''a very defensible position, something we can sell to the House and the American people.''
But the proposal to scale back the Stealth program is a double-edged sword. Almost $30 billion has already been spent on development. Because this investment would be spread over a smaller number of planes, it means a less efficient rate of production by the Northrop Corporation.
''They are cutting out 40 percent of the aircraft and only saving 20 percent of the cost of the program,'' said Michael C. Brower, an analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has urged the Stealth program be canceled.
 
Inefficiencies Enhanced
Mr. Cheney has previously stressed his opposition to stretching out weapons programs, which creates inefficies. His new proposal, which would provide the Air Force with two wings of Stealth bombers, represents something of a reversal.
Adding to his predicament is that deeper cuts in the Stealth program Congress might dictate would drive up the cost of each plane even more. The Congressional Budget Office warned in a report earlier this month that ''slow rates of production are particularly inefficient for the B-2 bomber because of the program's complexity and because the bomber is reportedly being assembled at a factory that only produces one product - the B-2 bomber.''
In another important development, Mr. Cheney disclosed today that strategists had begun reviewing the number and types of targets that would be struck in a nuclear war. He suggested that altered targeting requirements justified a scaling back of the Stealth program.
''To the extent that you used to be concerned about targeting military targets in the Warsaw Pact, and the old Warsaw Pact goes away, you've got new requirements,'' Mr. Cheney said.
Discussing the C-17 transport plane, being built by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon wants to buy 120 of the aircraft instead of the 210 originally planned. That would cut the cost of the program from $41.8 billion to $29.9 billion.
 
Transport Needs Change
Mr. Cheney said that the political changes in Eastern Europe as well as the withdrawals of Soviet forces would mean the Western nations would have much greater warning of a possible Soviet attack.
''We can anticipate that warning time now will be a matter of months, not a matter of days or a couple of weeks,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''And that gives us more time to marshal our resources and to acquire what we need and get it to Europe given that amount of time.''
Scaling back the C-17 program would raise the cost of each of the planes to about $240 million, providing ammuntion to critics who argue that the improved warning time suggests the C-17 should be canceled altogether and instead, fast ships should be built.
The Navy has been relatively unscathed in the military budget cuts so far, but Mr. Cheney's testimony today was seen by Navy officials as a message that the service would have to accept some reductions. The Secretary noted that the figure of 12 aircraft carrier battle groups was tentative. Last week Senator Nunn, in outlining his ideas for military cuts, suggested that the Navy's 14 carrier groups could be reduced to the range of 10 to 12.
Mr. Cheney said his decision to defer Air Force fighter and attack planes was based in part on new intelligence data suggesting a lag in the production of similar Soviet planes.
Mr. Cheney added that as a result of the changes in Europe, the Western allies would face ''fewer enemy aircraft, a reduced ground threat, and a less robust air defense threat over Eastern Europe itself.''

HEADLINE: California Pushing the Limits With Environmental Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 26

 BODY:
The stage was set today for one of the toughest national political battles of 1990, drawing the environmental movement directly into hardball politics over a measure that would impose on California the most sweeping controls in the country.
A coalition of environmental groups turned in 800,000 signatures, more than enough to place a voter-initiated referendum on the November ballot.
The initiative would, among other things, ban 19 cancer-causing pesticides still in wide use, drastically reduce emission of artificial gases that trap and retain heat from the sun, curtail clearing of forests, ban offshore oil drilling except in national emergencies and create an elected state environmental advocate to enforce the law.
The measure has stirred nationwide unease among agricultural, chemical, logging and other interests, who are mounting a multimillion-dollar campaign to defeat it and to pass competing initiatives to override it lest the other states follow California's lead. But given the mounting public concern about the environment, the Big Green initiative, as its backers have named it, is considered likely to pass. 
 
Votes Are Involved
''There's no way we can lose,'' the initiative's campaign manager, Bob Mulholland, said today. ''This is a done deal. We can't lose unless there's an earthquake that stops California.''
Much more than the environment is at stake. The measure has been deeply enmeshed in the race for Governor as candidates have jockeyed for the powerful environmental vote.
The measure was endorsed early on by State Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp, who faces the former Mayor of San Francisco, Dianne Feinstein, in the Democratic primary on June 5. After months of hesitation, Mrs. Feinstein, who had feared losing support in the agricultural Central Valley, endorsed the measure on Sunday, Earth Day.
That leaves the certain Republican nominee, Senator Pete Wilson, a moderate with a pro-environment record, in the position of seeming to be against something widely perceived as akin to motherhood. He says he opposes the measure because it takes environmental authority away from the Governor.
Critics of the measure say it would grievously injure the state's billion-dollar agriculture, aerospace and electronics industries, cause food prices to rise nationally and bring substantial increases in gasoline taxes, electricity rates and unemployment. They have tried to tarnish it by tagging it the ''Hayden initiative'' after Assemblyman Tom Hayden, the Democrat from Santa Monica who largely wrote the measure and who has a long association with radical and liberal causes.
 
Interest in New Post
Mr. Hayden is thought to be interested in running for the post of environmental advocate.
The measure, the California Environmental Protection Act of 1990, touches on food safety, global warming from pollution, oceans, beaches and forests. Environmentalists say it is necessary to go directly to the voters because the California Legislature is so beholden to special interests that legislative remedies are impossible.
The measure includes these major elements:
* All pesticides judged by the state to cause cancer or reproductive damage are phased out in foods by 1996. Food produced out-of-state is banned from sale if even the slightest residue of such chemicals is detected.
* Allowable residues of other pesticides are reduced to levels considered safe for children. Exposure of farmworkers to pesticides would be reduced to the lowest achievable levels.
* Emissions of carbon dioxide, believed to add to global warming, are reduced by 20 percent by the year 2000 and 40 percent by 2010.
* Steps to cut the emission of chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals believed to damage the earth's protective ozone layer. By 1995, the sale of cars using these chemicals in air conditioners is banned.
* Oil drilling within three miles of the coast is forbidden unless the President declares a national emergency.
* Creation of an oil-spill prevention plan, including a $500 million prevention and cleanup fund established with a fee of 25 cents a barrel paid by companies moving oil through California waters.
* New controls on public sewage discharges and stricter health standards for beach waters and seafood.
Although the measures do not address all of California's environmental problems, Albert H. Meyerhoff of the Natural Resources Defense Council said they represented the most comprehensive environmental law ever proposed.
''It will not by itself save the planet,'' Mr. Meyerhoff said. ''It will save this corner of it.''
Proponents say they expect to spend as much as $3 million to pass it.
To fight the measure, the California Chamber of Commerce and the pesticide industry are mounting a campaign that opponents assert will cost $16 million. They have employed the political consulting firm Woodward & McDowell of Burlingame, Calif. Jack S. McDowell, a partner in the firm, said the initiative was scientifically flawed in that it ignores the possibility that chemical residues at extremely low levels may not be hazardous to health.
According to a preliminary study for industry by Spectrum Economics Inc. of San Francisco, the initiative would have devastating economic consequences for the state. The study said it would increase gasoline prices by 25 to 50 cents a gallon, raise electricity rates by more than 20 percent, force food processors, supermarkets, restaurants and shippers to spend millions of dollars to replace refrigeration units, cost one million jobs by the year 2000 and put California businesses at a competitive disadvantage.
 
Competing Measure on the Way
Food growers and processors have also joined to fight the initiative by forming Californians for Responsible Food Laws. They are gathering signatures for a competing measure, which they call the Consumer Pesticide Enforcement Act for Food, Water, and Worker Safety. That measure would double the amount of testing of fresh fruits and vegetables and establish a fund to find means of reducing pesticide use, but that sets less stringent standards.
Lee Stitzenberger, campaign director of the growers' measure, said the approach was ''driven by science'' to establish safe risk levels for pesticide use. If the growers' measure gets more votes than the environmental initiative, it will override the pesticide provisions addressed in ''Big Green.''
A spokesman for the Wilson campaign said that while Mr. Wilson approved of many parts of the environmentalists' measure, he thought environmental responsibility should remain with the Governor. But critics maintain that Mr. Wilson is beholden to the state's agricultural and chemical interests.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
LITHUANIA IS ASKED BY PARIS AND BONN TO HALT DECISIONS

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 26

 BODY:
France and West Germany jointly urged Lithuania today to suspend its Parliament's moves toward independence and to seek negotiations with Moscow with a view to finding ''a solution acceptable to all parties.''
The move came in a letter addressed to Lithuania's President, Vytautas Landsbergis, by President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany at the conclusion of two days of talks here.
In their letter, the two leaders said a solution to the complex situation in Lithuania ''requires time and patience and should be sought through the classic channels of dialogue.''
 
Self-Determination Backed
''Without doubt, to facilitate the opening of these talks, it would be helpful if the effects of the decisions taken by your Parliament were suspended for a while,'' they said. ''They would lose none of their validity because they are based on the universally recognized principle of the self-determination of peoples.'' 
While Western countries have generally advocated a dialogue between Moscow and Lithuania, this was the first time any of them have specifically called on Lithuania to suspend any of the pro-independence actions taken by its Parliament.
As their meeting concluded, the French and West German leaders signaled that they had surmounted threats to their special relationship posed by recent events in Eastern Europe and that having patched up differences, they were again working in tandem on speeding European integration.
In a joint news conference Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl fell short of hailing a reconciliation, but both stressed the special role that France and West Germany should now play in Europe.
''We never thought that alone we could make things advance,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''But, without arrogance, it can be said that the process of European unity could not occur unless France and Germany pushed for it.''
Mr. Mitterrand, who last week joined Mr. Kohl in calling on the 12-nation European Community to start planning political union, said his talks with the German leader had resulted in ''a feeling of deep understanding.'' And he added, ''French-German friendship is more alive than ever.''
In their letter to the Lithuanian leader, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl said they shared ''the same worries'' about the situation in Lithuania and had decided to convey them to Mr. Landsbergis. But they added, ''The Lithuanian people have demonstrated unequivocally their desire to exercise their right to sovereignty.''
Their initiative came just days after President Bush and Mr. Mitterrand agreed at a meeting in Florida that the United States Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, and the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, whould work through diplomatic channels to promote talks between Vilnius and Moscow.
Earlier today, in a news conference, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl were asked whether Lithuania was a victim of ''the spirit of Munich,'' a reference to the 1938 agreement between Britain and Nazi Germany that in effect legitimized Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia.
 
Munich Analogy Disputed
Mr. Mitterrand said no comparison could be made between the policies of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and Hitler. ''We are not on the eve of a war; there is no conquering imperialism,'' he said.
He said it was now up to Mr. Gorbachev to take the initiative to establish a dialogue with Lithuania, and he added that the contents of the French-German letter would be conveyed to him.
Responding to the same question, Mr. Kohl said the comparison to Munich was totally inappropriate. He added, ''I do not think it is advisable to create any pressure that could block the start of a true discussion.''
In referring to the two days of talks, French and German officials said one immediate result of the new mood of cooperation between their Governments was likely to be the further isolation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain when Community leaders hold a special summit meeting in Dublin on Saturday.
Mrs. Thatcher has made no secret of her opposition to both existing Community plans for economic and monetary union and the new call for political union, but in recent weeks her Government has been seeking closer ties with France as a way of counterbalancing the power of a future united Germany.
With Paris and Bonn agreed on the need for a parallel process of German and European unification, foreign diplomats said, recent uncertainty over how the European Community should respond to both the uniting of the two Germanys and the revolution in Eastern Europe should now evaporate.
But the nervousness created by tensions between Paris and Bonn in recent months also reflected the way that France and West Germany had come to view their postwar rapprochement as perhaps the single most important pillar of European stability.
After the crumbling of the Berlin wall in November, France was alarmed by the pace of German unification and worried openly that West Germany was losing interest in European integration. Mr. Mitterrand also criticized Mr. Kohl for not assuring Poland that its postwar borders would not be challenged.
But Bonn showed irritation with Mr. Mitterrand's apparent effort to move closer to Moscow in response to German unification as well as with his proposal that a special inter-government conference on economic and monetary union be held before West Germany's elections this December.
Their joint statement last week calling for a simultaneous inter-governmental conference on political union in December was therefore seen as a boost for European integration and a symbol of what one Bonn official called ''the rediscovery of our friendship.''
Today the two leaders went out of their way to emphasize the harmony of their views, with Mr. Kohl reassuring France that German monetary union would not only provide French businesses with new opportunities but would also benefit all of Europe.
Endorsing Mr. Mitterrand's call for a NATO summit meeting later this year, the Chancellor brushed aside concerns expressed in the German Parliament over France's plans to install the new Hades short-range nuclear missile, which could strike targets in Germany but not in the Soviet Union. ''Hades doesn't worry me at all,'' Mr. Kohl said.
Mr. Mitterrand said he expected a summit conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to review all aspects of Western defense and that he did not regard the Hades missile as a priority issue. ''There is not yet a new European balance,'' he said. ''France will not budge while circumstances have not changed.''
 
Lithuanian to Study Message
MOSCOW, April 26 (Reuters) -President Landsbergis of Lithuania promised today to ''carefully study'' a French-German proposal to suspend the effects of recent laws linked with his independence declaration.
''The leadership of Lithuania also desires that a dialogue between the two countries begin as soon as possible,'' Mr. Landsbergis said. He added that talks would be helped by an end to the Soviet blockade.

HEADLINE: In Battle Over Sign, All Roads Lead to Albany

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FULTONVILLE, N.Y., April 26

 BODY:
Vinnie Gramuglia is very fond of his giant road sign - a retired 18-wheeler perched 65 feet up in the sky over the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway. The sign, the local truck-stop owner says, ''is to trucks what a lighthouse is to ships.''
Thruway officials think it is nothing but an illegal blemish on the Mohawk Valley landscape of this village just off Exit 28. The sign, they say, must go. 
Now a potent mixture of local enthusiasm and Albany politics has turned what began as a local dispute into a statewide issue. The two lawmakers who represent the village, feeling the heat from residents who are passionately in favor of preserving the truck, introduced a bill that would do much more than that. Their legislation would remove the New York State Thruway Authority's jurisdiction over signs, billboards or other advertising devices within two miles of any exit on the 559-mile highway.
 
'Invitation to Visual Pollution'
The State Senate passed the bill 57 to 1, and it is about to go to the floor of the Assembly, whose transportation committee approved it earlier this week on a 17-to-3 vote. Final approval is expected as early as next week.
While the measure could be a boon for merchants along the Thruway and a bonanza for the billboard industry, Thruway officials say lawmakers have either ignored its damaging consequences or do not understand them.
''It's a sneak attack on the environment,'' said Peter F. Tufo, the Thruway Authority's chairman. ''This legislation is an open invitation to visual pollution.''
Environmentalists are dismayed as well. Instead of insuring sweeping views of the Catskills mountains or the rolling hills of the Mohawk Valley, ''this bill will turn a trip on the Thruway into a drive through the yellow pages,'' said Edward T. McMahon, executive director of Scenic America, a Washington-based group concerned with the country's natural vistas.
If it receives final approval from the Legislature, the measure will go to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. A spokeswoman for the Governor, Anne Crowley, said Mr. Cuomo would have no comment on the bill until it reached his desk.
 
Truck Called Hazardous
The Thruway Authority calls the truck - which sits atop an abandoned oil tank - ''the most hazardous, gaudiest, most novel and most distracting advertising device on the Thruway.'' Although it concedes no accidents have occurred, the authority says the truck is illegal and could cause accidents involving gawking motorists who might wonder whether the rig is about to cross over the roadway.
''That is absolutely nuts,'' replied Mr. Gramuglia, who has tied up state efforts to get rid of his truck in the courts, partly by contending that the truck is duly registered and legally parked. ''Anybody who thinks this truck is moving shouldn't be out on the road to begin with.''
Mr. Gramuglia, a New Jersey native who opened his Countryside Fuel Stop 28 a few years ago, described his rig as a ''thing of beauty.'' And he said, ''All I'm asking here is that the state keep its hands off my truck.''
Mr. Gramuglia installed the truck on its perch last November. First he poured 300,000 pounds of cement into the abandoned oil tank, then welded the trailer to two 60-foot I-beams. He then hoisted the truck to the top of the tank with a crane.
 
'Save the Truck' T-Shirts
The bill gained momentum partly because Mr. Gramuglia, who has become a folk hero here in Montgomery County, seems to have captured the imagination of many lawmakers in Albany. He has made several lobbying trips to the capital from Fultonville, 40 miles away, and hands out ''Save the Truck'' T-shirts to just about anybody. Most lawmakers in Albany seem to have deferred judgment on the bill to the legislators who represent Mr. Gramuglia - State Senator Hugh T. Farley, a Schenectady County Republican, and Paul D. Tonko, an Amsterdam Democrat. But many critics of the bill say the plight of the colorful Mr. Gramuglia and his truck has obscured the much broader effects of the bill.
''This is a textbook case of how a bill should not become law,'' said Lee Wasserman, executive director of the Environmental Planning Lobby, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''A truck gets put on a pole, the case becomes a cause celebre, and now the Legislature stands poised to roll back a 40-year policy of protecting richly scenic landscapes statewide.''
The state Thruway Authority currently has some of the most stringent rules on billboards of any highway authority in the country. Almost all billboards are set back at least 660 feet from the highway, and the Authority has tight control over the exceptions.
Here in Fultonville, support for Mr. Gramuglia runs all the deeper because residents say they have many reasons to resent the Thruway Authority. The highway bisected the village when it was built in the 1950's, and it is just a few miles from where a bridge over the highway collapsed in the spring of 1987, sending 10 motorists to their deaths in the Schoharie Creek.
Still, the village economy has become largely dependent on Thruway motorists. ''It's been terrific for business,'' said the mayor, George Wadsworth. ''If it weren't for that truck, a lot of people might not even know we were here.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
U.S. Reaches Trade Deal With Moscow

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 26

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it had reached broad agreement with the Soviet Union on a trade pact that should be ready for President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign when they hold their next summit meeting in Washington in late May.
Once it is approved by Congress, the trade agreement could pave the way for the Soviet Union to be granted most-favored-nation treatment by the United States. This status, already enjoyed by some Eastern European countries, would provide the Soviet Union with additional trade privileges.
United States tariffs average about 5 percent for countries with most-favored-nation status, but for countries like the Soviet Union that do not have the privilege, they can be 10 times as high - that is, 45 or 50 percent. The United States does not permit the export of some strategic goods to the Soviet Union, but that is a different matter that is not affected by most-favor-nation status. 
 
Disagreement Over Small Points
After three days of talks here, the Deputy United States Trade Representative, Julius L. Katz, noted that the two governments were still in disagreement over three or four small points. He declined to identify them, but he said they should be resolved through diplomatic exchanges in the coming weeks.
There had been some speculation that the talks could be suspended because of Washington's disapproval of Moscow's policies toward Lithuania. Mr. Katz said the Lithuanian crisis was not discussed during the meeting.
''Fundamentally, we have reached agreement on the text,'' he said. ''It is still the intention that the agreement be signed at the Washington summit between May 30 and June 3.''
The agreement would initially be for three years. Then it could automatically be renewed for a further three years if neither side objects. It is expected to bring a moderate increase in bilateral trade, as well as provide the Soviet Union with easier access to American goods needed for its modernization program.
 
Toward a Market Economy
''The agreement looks toward development of a market economy in the Soviet Union but reflects the fact that they are not quite there at this point,'' Mr. Katz said. Before the trade agreement can be signed, President Bush has insisted, the Soviet Union must adopt a new emigration law, a demand that prevented a trade pact signed between the two countries in 1972 from coming into force.
Mr. Katz said he did not know when Moscow's new legislation would be approved, but he noted that the link between the trade agreement and a more flexible Soviet emigration policy was clear and understood. ''I am not sure if it will be ready in time,'' he said.
Describing the contents of the provisional agreement, Mr. Katz said that in addition to the exchange of Most Favored Nation treatment, it called for the establishment of trade offices by both governments and travel facilities for Soviet and American businessmen.
 
Making It Easier for U.S. Business
Before the talks began, United States officials said Washington was particularly eager to make it easier for American companies to operate in the Soviet Union, not only as traders but also as investors who can repatriate their profits without difficulty.
Mr. Katz noted that the two governments planned to sign separate letters dealing with trade facilities, financial relations, tourism and protection of all aspects of intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights and sound recordings. The draft agreement also includes provisions dealing with national security questions.
He said that Soviet access to official American loans, such as trade financing from the Export-Import Bank, was not covered in the planned trade agreement. He added that the Bush Administration would be required to seek Congressional approval if such a privilege was granted to Moscow.

HEADLINE: Panel Rejects a Social Security Tax Cut

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
In the first test of Congressional sentiment on Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes, the Senate Budget Committee today overwhelmingly rejected the measure.
The 17-to-6 vote came on a motion by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who said his purpose was to force the panel to adopt ''truth in budgeting.'' Cutting the Social Security payroll taxes, he said, would eliminate the surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which is being used to mask the real size of the Federal deficit.
But only four Democrats and two Republicans voted for the proposal. 
Today's vote is by no means the last word on the subject. Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is not a member of the Budget Committee, said today that the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, had assurred him that the measure would come to a vote on the floor.
A test of sentiment for the measure on the Senate floor could come in the next few days, when Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Hollings and other senators plan to offer the tax cut proposal as an amendment to an unrelated emergency spending measure.
 
Moynihan Predicts Victory
''There will be a floor vote, the majority leader has made very clear that he wants to facilitate that,'' he said. Mr. Moynihan predicted that he would win a majority for his proposal on the Senate floor.
Mr. Moynihan caused a political firestorm last December when he suggested cutting the Social Security payroll tax. Mr. Moynihan said that it was unfair to collect workers' Social Security taxes meant to finance their retirement, and then use the money to cover part of the budget deficit.
The Moynihan proposal divided the Democrats and stirred strong opposition from the White House. Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said the Moynihan plan risked ''fiscal policy havoc'' by substantially increasing the budget deficit.
But political strategists at the Democratic National Committee and the more conservative Democratic Leadership Council eagerly seized on the plan as a potent weapon to counter President Bush's tax policies.
 
Worries About Deficit
Mr. Moynihan's supporters said the proposal was a politically savvy move that would help the Democrats re-establish themselves as the party of the working people while the Republicans pushed a capital gains tax cut that would benefit the wealthy.
But Democrats in Congress, including Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committtee, have been cool to the payroll tax cut. Critics argued today that the proposal would increase the Federal deficit.
''I'd be prepared to support Mr. Hollings if he offered any offset either on the revenue or the spending side,'' said Senator Charles S. Robb, a Virginia Democrat and a member of the Democratic Leadership Council. His views were echoed, though more cautiously, by other Democrats who voted against the proposal today but said they might change their minds if it reached the Senate floor.
But Sen. Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, a supporter of the Moynihan proposal, said he was endorsing the plan in part because using Social Security surpluses to hide the true size of the deficit was ''embezzlement.''
The House Budget Committee, which has already adopted its 1991 spending plan, has recommended immediately removing the trust fund from the calculation of the deficit, a plan the Administration is willing to accept. The Senate Budget Committee is moving in the same direction but has not decided when and how it will be accomplished.
After an increase in the payroll tax on Jan. 1, workers and their employers each pay 7.65 percent on wages up to $51,300. Of that tax, 6.2 percent finances retirement benefits, with the rest going to Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Mr. Hollings' measure would have reduced the retirement benefits portion to 5.1 percent.
Today's vote in the Senate Budget Committee would not necessarily preclude lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee from adopting Mr. Moynihan's proposal if they found other tax increases to offset it.
While the Congressional tax committees will make the ultimate decisions on which taxes to cut or raise later this year, it is the Congressional budget committes that determine the overall revenue level within which the tax panels must work.
Earlier today, the Senate Budget panel rejected on a tie vote a proposal by Senator Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, to impose a $5-a-barrel fee on oil imports.
 
Hollings Chides Colleagues
Mr. Hollings chided his Democratic colleagues for not rallying around the Social Security tax cut, noting that he had called for revenue increases, including an oil import fee and a 5 percent ''value added tax'' to make up for the revenue the Treasury would lose from cutting the payroll tax. The value added tax, a system used by the European Economic Community, taxes goods and services at each stage of production and at final sale to the consumer.
''You know what the offset is,'' he said, referring to the value added tax. ''I could have married the two plans, but everybody wanted a clean vote on this.''
The committee later defeated Mr. Hollings' overall budget plan including those tax increases, by a vote of 15 to 7.
In addition to Mr. Hollings and Mr. Exon, the committee Democrats who voted for the Moynihan proposal were Senators Terry Sanford of North Carolina and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. The two committee Republicans who voted for it were Senators Steve Symms of Idaho and Robert Kasten of Wisconsin.
While the budget panel struggled to reach agreement on a fiscal 1991 spending plan, the full Senate spent the day struggling to tie up loose ends for spending in the current 1990 fiscal year. The Senate is working on a $2.3 billion emergency spending measure that includes $720 million in aid for Panama and Nicaragua as well as additional financing for a variety of domestic programs, including food stamps, disaster relief and the census. It also includes $400 million in housing loan guarantees to Israel to help pay for resettlement of Soviet Jews.
More than 60 amendments, including those dealing with the Social Security tax cut and abortion, are pending.

HEADLINE: Grim Contractors Ready For Cutbacks on Arms

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 26

 BODY:
The Pentagon's plan to scale back and stretch out its purchases of aircraft in the coming decade confirms what many arms makers have come to expect: a period of painful consolidation.
Industry executives to some extent took heart from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's decision not to cancel any of the expensive and complex military aircraft programs planned for the next few years, but instead to buy fewer of the planes and to buy them at a lower annual rate. This would reduce the potential profits for the weapons makers but not eliminate them.
''This removes the anticipation of bad news and turns it into reality,'' said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst who studies military contractors for the Wall Street investment concern C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. ''The question is how well you can manage the consolidation.'' 
The programs involved are the Stealth bomber, built for the Air Force by the Northrop Corporation; the C-17 transport plane built for the Air Force by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation; the A-12 attack plane, built for the Navy by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the General Dynamics Corporation, and the advanced tactical fighter being developed for the Air Force by two competing teams of contractors, one headed by Northrop and one by the Lockheed Corporation. Mr. Cheney also delayed production of a variant of the A-12 planned for the Air Force and a variant of the advanced fighter being developed for the Navy.
 
Defining the Debate
The cuts proposed by Mr. Cheney are a major step in defining the debate over military spending and will shape the business strategies of almost all the major aerospace companies and their subcontractors. But the final numbers and the fate of some of the programs will not be determined until after what is certain to be a lengthy process of horse-trading in Congress. Pressure there for deeper budget cuts is partly offset by the desire of some lawmakers to protect prgrams that benefit their consitutents.
Some members of Congress are already concerned that delays and reductions in big programs will force up prices per plane because the production lines will become less efficient. The Stealth bomber, for example, would be cut to 75 planes from 132, with peak production of 12 a year, as against the 24 a year originally envisioned.
Mr. Cheney said the cut would save more than $14 billion over the life of the program by reducing the total price to about $61 billion. But the cost of a one of the radar-evading bombers would jump from about $530 million to $815 million.
If there are any winners from Mr. Cheney's decision, they could be the companies making the planes scheduled to be replaced by the programs being delayed. The Grumman Corporation, for example, might find it easier to persuade Congress to upgrade its F-14 fighter if the Navy has to wait longer than it planned for a new generation of fighters.
''To the extent that new programs get stretched out, the unit costs go up, and if you look at it rationally the new programs start to look less cost-effective versus existing programs,'' said Robert Paulson of McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm. ''If there are any winners, they are the old programs.''
 
The Appeal: Few Jobs Lost
Mr. Cheney's plan has the political appeal of dealing primarily with programs that are not yet in full-scale production and that therefore do not put many jobs in jeopardy. As a result, the economic impact in southern California and around St. Louis, where most of the aerospace companies are situated, will be largely limited to the loss of new jobs in coming years.
''Congress will take as much money as it can out of the new programs to keep the old programs in production, because they want to keep people in their districts employed,'' said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential Bache Securities.
But in a sign of the industry's precarious financial condition, McDonnell Douglas said today that it would eliminate 3,000 jobs at its Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach, Calif., where the new C-17 transport plane is built. The cut was not directly related to Mr. Cheney's decision on the C-17, which has had design problems and cost overruns. The Douglas plant, which also builds two commercial aircraft, the MD-80 and MD-11, has had a poor financial performance.
Investors have long assumed that cuts of this magnitude would be imposed, if not by Pentagon decisions, then by Congressional actions. As a result, the stock prices of most military contractors were not hard hit by today's announcement.

HEADLINE: Temporary Census Army Begins Door-to-Door Count Nationwide

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
A temporary army of students and homemakers, laid-off coal miners and between-jobs executives swept down on their neighbors yesterday as the Government began its most complex effort ever to count people door-to-door.
But while the hastily trained enumerators took to the streets of major cities, many district offices were still scrambling to hire recruits.
Census Bureau officials, noting that they had more than half again as many approved job applicants nationwide as were hired in 1980, said they remained confident that the count would be finished on time.
But other experts said that with about 37 million households still to be counted, 75 percent more than at this stage a decade ago, census officials might nonetheless be short-handed. 
 
'Much Tougher'
''It's going to be much tougher than the bureau thought it would be,'' said William M. Hunt, who manages national studies on the census for the General Accounting Office.
''Certainly the recruitment has fallen short of their goal,'' he said. ''We'll have to wait and see whether the recruitment is enough to sustain them through the process. They tend to lose a lot of people.''
Only 63 percent of households mailed back completed census forms, seven percent fewer than the bureau projected and 12 percent fewer than in 1980. Because of that, census officials and their critics agree that the second phase of the 1990 count will be more difficult and more critical.
Across the country, experts say, the process will be hindered by many of the same demographic changes that the census seeks to document.
With more women in the work place, fewer will be available for temporary jobs as census takers and fewer will be at home to answer the door. An older population will mean fewer students, a group usually sought out for recruitment. And growing numbers of immigrants will demand counters who speak more languages, understand more cultures and who can penetrate more mistrustful households.
 
Some Daunting Changes
Lower-level census officials and enumerators also described changes that were less tangible, but perhaps equally daunting to the uninvited: rising fears of crime, increasing concerns about privacy, and pervasive feelings, especially in large cities, that days have grown shorter and time more precious.
Then there are the worries that have grown frustratingly familiar to those who train the arithmetic legions.
''I didn't want this job,'' said Virginia Pei, who was pressed into door-knocking service in New York's Chinatown by friends in a community group anxious to make use of her skills in Cantonese, Mandarin and a couple of dialects. ''I am scared. What if they open the door and shoot you?''
In classrooms, meeting halls and community centers, supervisors have steeled their counters for the task with advice of common sense and special local tactics.
For some neighborhoods, instructors say, passwords must be spoken in foreign languages and in obscure accents. The doormen of fancy apartment buildings or the wary eyes at tenement windows might yield only to certain colors of skin or styles of dress.
 
'Like Little Spies'
''You're going to have to be like little spies,'' Charles W. Mitchell, a former Army captain on his way to law school, warned a small audience dominated by middle-aged women in sensible shoes. ''This isn't selling brownie cookies.'' From his district office for Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Mitchell surveys one of the toughest spots on a generally bleak landscape. The households he is to count are mostly affluent, busy and deluged with junk mail. And the residents appear even less anxious to count others than they have been to count themselves.
A general rule of census-taking holds that the harder a community's economic times, the more fertile the terrain for bureau recruiters.
So, around Kentucky coal mines, as in East Harlem, applicants are more than sufficient. Along New York's Park Avenue and California's Silicon Valley, recruiters are struggling.
Of a recent recruiting visit to a community meeting in New York, Mr. Mitchell said: ''The guy before me talked about the problems of limos being double-parked. And then I got up to offer these people $8 an hour to go door-to-door.''
 
Scale is Top in New York
That wage is the top of the Census Bureau's scale, paid only in New York City. Elsewhere, the pay runs between $5 an hour and $7.50.
Richard L. Bitzer, the Census Bureau's assistant chief for the field division, said the pay scale was one source of optimism in the bureau. In 1980, he said, enumerators were paid primarily by the number of households they visited. This year, along with an hourly wage, they will receive bonuses of $75 to $325 for completing their work and then for taking on more.
A survey of district offices around the country suggested that in some areas, many of them suburban, low rates of return for census forms were matched by indifference to recruiters. But in others, impoverished people who paid little attention to forms quickly answered offers of a job.
Around Boston, where the mail response rate ranged from 45 percent to 49 percent, the region's assistant census director, Harold K. Wood, said recruiters had qualified between three and four applicants for every job slot. But experts on the census say such accomplishments can be deceptive.
To compensate for no-shows, high attrition and inadequate work habits, many New York officials said they hoped to approve - by written test, interview, and a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation -10 times the number of workers they would need on a full-time basis. Because they were instructed to wait until the last minute to call applicants back, district officers said they found that many had already taken other jobs.
By contrast, in the San Francisco Bay area, where about 62 percent of the forms mailed out were returned, the Census Bureau yesterday had trained only 2,500 enumerators. The bureau estimated that it needed about 10,000, a spokeswoman, Elaine Dempsey, said.
For all the difficulties faced by Census Bureau officials, the challenges for some employees loomed larger.
B. Edward Garrison, a 56-year-old former truck driver, applied too late to be an enumerator in 1980, but he was approved this year. In the interim, he lost his left leg in a driving accident, and will search for his uncounted fellow residents of the South Bronx in his wheel chair.
''I could use the money,'' said Mr. Garrison, who lives on welfare. ''And I figure it has to be done, and it seems nobody wants to do it.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Official Is Contrite in Obscenity Furor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Dr. Richard Berendzen, who has been in seclusion since he was forced to resign as president of American University two weeks ago amid complaints that he had made obscene telephone calls, broke his silence today and said he was tormented and embarrassed by the events surrounding him.
In a statement issued through his lawyer, Dr. Berendzen confirmed reports that he was undergoing treatment and counseling at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore. His lawyer, Gerard Treanor, said, ''He is in a general psychiatric unit.'' But Mr. Treanor declined to discuss details.
Dr. Berendzen's statement seemed to acknowledge that he had made a series of obscene telephone calls to women in nearby Fairfax County, Va., many from the ornate office of the president on the American University campus in northwest Washington. ''I cannot begin to convey my embarrassment or torment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. PANEL WARNS ON CHILD POVERTY

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
Poverty and despair facing many American children are not only personal tragedies but also ''a staggering national tragedy'' that threatens America's future, a Federal commission reported today.
The panel, the National Commission on Children, said in an interim report that children had become the poorest age group in the nation, with one child in five living below the poverty line.
It said childhood poverty, more than any other factor, placed young Americans at risk for long-term problems, including poor health, failure in school, teen-age pregnancy, crime and drugs. 
As a result, it said, many of today's children will reach adulthood unhealthy, illiterate and unemployable.
 
Broad Peril is Discerned
''The health and vitality of our economy and our democracy are increasingly in danger,'' Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the chairman of the panel and a West Virginia Democrat, said in releasing the report. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''We have very deep concerns about the children of this country and the poverty level that they may be facing.''
The panel was established by Congress in December 1987 and began its work early last year. It made no recommendations in its interim report, but its findings thus far are expected to form the basis for suggestions for new spending when it issues its final report, due no later than next March 31.
The report cited an array of jarring statistics, all of them previously reported:
* Malnutrition affects nearly half a million children, and 100,000 children are homeless.
* Among black and Hispanic children, poverty is even worse. The poverty rate in 1987, the year the report cited, was 15 percent for white children but 45 percent for black children and 39 percent for Hispanic children.
* One of every four rural children is poor, and rural families are less likely than urban ones to receive public assistance.
American children on average are economically better off now than they were in the 1960's. But those figures do not reflect the growing disparity among families, it said.

HEADLINE: Don't Punish the Wrong China

 BODY:
President Bush, justly criticized for failing to distance himself from Beijing's bloodstained leaders, can now best serve freedom by asking Congress to maintain China's status as a most favored nation. Congress, which has honorably resisted other Bush accommodations to the Chinese leadership, can go along in good conscience.
Insuring preferred treatment in U.S. markets would constitute a wise bet on those sectors of Chinese society most likely to build a progressive state once time and popular scorn sweep away today's aging rulers. 
Most-favored-nation status entitles a country to whatever preferences the U.S. grants its best trading partners. Most capitalist countries enjoy this status. Most Communist countries, including the Soviet Union, do not.
Under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974, a country with a non-market economy that restricts the right to emigrate is ineligible unless the President grants a waiver. Such waivers must be renewed annually, with the consent of Congress. President Bush's recommendation on China is due by June 3.
Washington first granted China a waiver in 1979, amid predictions that Deng Xiaoping's reforms would eventually produce a market economy with unrestricted emigration. For a decade, events supported those predictions. Exports to the U.S. soared. Areas like Guangdong Province and the Shenzen Special Economic Zone became engines of modernization and growth, showcases of reform. Stimulated by this new commerce, economic reform created a new China - capitalistic, urbanized and more engaged with the outside world. The older, more insular, less politicized, peasant China persists, more populous but losing ground.
These two Chinas clashed violently last June in Tiananmen Square. As in the 1930's, the armed peasantry wore People's Liberation Army uniforms. As in the 1930's, Communist propaganda portrayed urbanites as corrupted by foreign influence. Over the decades, however, peasant Maoism has lost its capacity to inspire and lead. The demise of today's aged leaders could spark a succession crisis, as the new China of Guangdong, Shenzen and, soon, Hong Kong try to renew China's frustrated advance.
Granted, extension of most-favored-nation privileges would permit the current leaders to gloat. Continued economic development coupled with political repression is their aim. But suspending trade preferences has little chance of deflecting them. If forced to choose, they've shown that they put repression first.
For the workers and entrepreneurs of China's new export industries, losing low tariff access to the U.S. would be disastrous. It would bring huge financial losses - and halt, even reverse, the modernizing trends that gave the pro-democracy movement its extraordinary resonance. Continuing favored-nation status would nourish China's progressive forces for the coming succession battles. Deng Xiaoping and his associates deserve to be pariahs. The Chinese deserve to be a favored nation.

HEADLINE: Another Kind of Peace Dividend?

 BODY:
Peace is breaking out in Central America -and maybe north of the border, too.
Four years ago, President Reagan warned that the Sandinistas in Nicaragua were consolidating ''a privileged sanctuary for terrorists and subversives just two days' driving time from Harlingen, Texas.'' Mr. Reagan's histrionic threat of invasion never materialized. Now, as Nicaragua's democratically elected President, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, is taking office in Managua, Border Patrol stations near Harlingen and San Diego are reporting something like the opposite: fewer undocumented immigrants from Central America.
O.T.M.'s, they're called, ''other than Mexicans.'' In Texas and California, the vast majority of them come from Central America. Arrests of O.T.M.'s dropped by 50 percent in Harlingen and 43 percent in San Diego, comparing the first three months of 1990 and 1989. This reverses a three-year pattern in which O.T.M. arrests increased steeply. By contrast, apprehensions of Mexicans in the San Diego area increased by more than 60 percent in the first three months of 1990.
What accounts for the drop in non-Mexican arrests? The obvious speculative interpretation is that the border is a barometer of political violence and economic stress to the South. It may well be that Nicaraguans otherwise inclined to flee are now staying home to test the fruits of peace.
Political violence robs ''the slim waist of the Americas,'' as the Nicaraguan-born poet Ruben Dario lovingly called his home, of its greatest resource, its people. Refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala, where war and death squad violence drag on, also dream of the day they can return to their villages. If the O.T.M. pattern continues, diminished illegal immigration from Central America will be another, welcome kind of peace dividend.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Intelligence Fiasco

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
The central mission of U.S. intelligence is to gather and evaluate data on the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union in comparison with the U.S. We are now discovering how the C.I.A. has botched that assignment.
Throughout the 80's, our analysts clung to the notion that the Soviet economy was more than half as large as our own, and that 15 percent of its budget was devoted to arms. That was the bedrock estimate on which most other projections - and our own defense planning - was based. 
A handful of outside experts began to dissent from the official view in 1985. Led by Henry Rowen of Stanford (now with Defense), Charles Wolf of the Rand Corporation, the Russian emigre Igor Birmin and the Swedish economist Anders Aklund, the dissenters drew on startling Gorbachev admissions to arrive at a wholly different conclusion:
Growth had stopped in the Soviet Union as the 80's began; this meant that its economy had shrunk to less than a third the size of ours, and the percentage of Soviet national product spent on armaments had become an unsustainable 22 to 25 percent. (Each dissenter came up with a different percentage, but all differed from the C.I.A. on the essential points - that the Soviet economy was disaster-bound unless drastic arms cutbacks began right away.) When this disagreement was bared in this space two years ago, Director of Central Intelligence William Webster - not an uptight fellow - invited a couple of us to an on-the-record lunch at Langley. I outlined the views of the new thinkers and called for appointment of a ''team B''; the C.I.A. economists politely held their ground. As we left, I stole a C.I.A. ashtray and left behind a New York Times mug; Director Webster called it ''a fair exchange in more ways than one.''
The discussion was duly recorded in a column; the C.I.A. economists' contrary views were expressed in a letter to the editor from the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which has become a C.I.A. publications outlet.
Here we are in 1990. One side operated on shoestrings, the other on billions; which proved right?
The answer is evident in the C.I.A.'s catch-up analysis. ''The Soviet Economy Stumbles Badly in 1989'' is the title of Director Webster's recent report to his Joint Economic Receptacle; it is as if the decadelong decline - long ago divined by the unappointed ''team B'' - had mostly taken place in the past 12 months.
The agency belatedly discovers that the Soviet Union is in ''near crisis'' and might soon be pushed ''over the edge into sharp deterioration.'' Its assessment of the pressure on Mr. Gorbachev reads like a rehash of Judy Shelton's 1989 ''The Coming Soviet Crash'' with an update from Wellesley Prof. Marshall Goldman's excoriation of Gorbanomics in the latest Foreign Affairs magazine.
A few days after this C.I.A. epiphany, a trio of reformist Soviet economists came over to tell an American Enterprise Institute conference -headed by non-team B's Nicholas Eberstadt - how it really is. Oleg Bogomolov, who serves in the Congress of People's Deputies, said that Soviet military expenditure was 20 to 25 percent of G.N.P., contrary to the C.I.A.'s lowball 16 percent; Viktor Belkin, also a Gorbachevite, said that Soviet output was about one-fourth that of the U.S., not nearly the half that the C.I.A. still estimates.
These Soviet economists disagree with the official figures put out by their establishment, just as our outsiders dispute C.I.A. estimates. However, the C.I.A. is hustling over to the conclusion reached by the outsiders about the economic crisis forcing the Soviets to reduce arms spending. To avoid admitting egregious error, the C.I.A. will gradually revise its underlying estimates in future years to jibe with present conclusions.
Doesn't this huge miscalculation cry out for oversight? Economic intelligence has none.
The Senate Intelligence Committee defers to a Joint Economic subcommittee on these matters, and its dovish chairman, Jeff Bingaman, is putty in the hands of the C.I.A. In the National Security Council, the posterior coverage of the misguided evaluation is handled by former spook Robert Gates. And the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board is being limited to technological kibitzing.
As the Bay of Pigs was to intelligence operations, the extended misreading of the Soviet economic debacle is to intelligence evaluation. Yet this fiasco is ignored and concealed -even as the future C.I.A. mission must be redirected toward realistic assessments of economic and scientific strength.

HEADLINE: CUNY Says Budget Cut Affects Open Admission

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
Officials of the City University of New York have told the Dinkins administration that a major reduction in financing from New York City would threaten the university's 20-year-old open admissions policy.
The open admissions policy, which was begun in 1970, guarantees a place within the university system - generally at one of seven two-year community colleges - to any high school graduate. The policy has fueled the tremendous enrollment growth that has made CUNY the third-largest universty system in the nation. It has also provided the opportunity for many of the educationally disadvantaged, particularly minority students, to attend college. 
CUNY has faced serious financial crises before, including one that led to its closing for two weeks in 1976.
But university officials said yesterday that the warning to the city earlier this month, which came in an April 11 letter to the Budget Director, Phillip R. Michael, from Joseph F. Vivona, who was the university's vice chancellor for budget and finance, was the first time since open admissions began that CUNY officials had suggested that budget reductions might jeopardize its ability to absorb all applicants.
 
A 4 Percent Cutback
The university's assessment comes at a time when city agencies have been asked by Mayor David N. Dinkins to report to him on the effect of a possible 4 percent budget reduction in the 1990-91 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. A 4 percent cutback in the $279.5 million budget for the community colleges would be $9.1 million. Mr. Dinkins is expected to present his executive budget for the next fiscal year on May 17.
While the greater share of the university's overall $1.2 billion budget is financed by the state, the city currently contributes $122 million of the financing for the community colleges. Students are accepted into the community colleges if they have a high school diploma or a general equivalency diploma. Students applying to the university's 10 four-year undergraduate colleges must generally have a minimum high school average of 80 or be in the top one-third of their graduating class.
The community colleges currently enroll 60,000 of the university's 193,000 students.
In his letter, Mr. Vivona noted that the community colleges had absorbed several financing cuts by the city in the last decade and that this year the colleges had already eliminated hundreds of classes, stopped buying virtually all library materials and deferred many building repairs. ''Hundreds of class sections have been eliminated, thus increasing class sizes to levels which, in some cases, threaten effective learning,'' Mr. Vivona said.
He said a $9.1 million reduction could mean the elimination of nearly 10 percent of the current classes. ''Ultimately, implementation of the latest proposed budget reduction would jeopardize open admissions and render continuation of current enrollment levels impossible,'' Mr. Vivona said in his letter.
A spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, Albert Scardino, said yesterday that the Mayor's position was that there was no way to close the city's nearly $2 billion budget gap without imposing cuts on ''the order of magnitude of 4 percent.''
But Mr. Scardino said that how each agency absorbed the cuts was between the agency and the city's Office of Management and Budget. The budget office, he said, had prepared a list of suggestions on how CUNY could deal with the cutbacks, including an increase in class size.
Although Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and leaders of the State Legislature have not agreed on a budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, they have already announced they will make major cuts in the budgets of both the City University and the State University of New York.

HEADLINE: A Week After Closing, 7 Days Wins a Magazine Award

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The two-year-old weekly magazine 7 Days, which closed down last week, yesterday won a National Magazine Award for general excellence in magazines with circulations of less than 100,000.
To the wild applause of the 1,200 magazine editors and publishers who attended the annual presentation luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Adam Moss, the editor of 7 Days, thanked the judges for ''the first clean posthumous win.''
''We will wear that asterisk with particular pride,'' he said. 
Leonard Stern, publisher of 7 Days, announced on April 16 that the magazine would fold. Mr. Stern blamed, among other things, the severe competition for advertisers' dollars and the sluggish New York economy.
 
The New Yorker Wins Again
The National Magazine Awards, established in 1966 by the American Society of Magazine Editors, are administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and sponsored by the Magazine Publishers of America. The 14 winners were selected from 74 finalists. In all, 292 magazines submitted 1,239 entries. The awards carry no money, but each winner received a bronze plaque and a reproduction of an Alexander Calder stabile, ''Elephant.''
The New Yorker won the same two awards it won last year. It received its sixth citation for reporting for its three-part series ''Beyond the Mountains,'' by Mark Danner about civil warfare in Haiti. The magazine received its fourth award for fiction for three stories: ''Goodness and Mercy,'' by Alice Munro; ''The Trick of It,'' by Michael Frayn, and ''Letter to the Lady of the House,'' by Richard Bausch.
Texas Monthly also won two awards, one for general excellence in the 100,000-to-400,000 circulation category, and one for photography for a series of photo essays, including ''The Soul of East Texas''; ''Side by Side,'' about Mennonite farmers and Tarahumara Indians living in Northern Mexico, and ''Get Along, Little Doggies,'' a spoof of Texans' love for their boots and their dogs.
Sports Illustrated won the award for general excellence in the 1,000,000-and-over category. Metropolitan Home won the general excellence award for the 400,000-to-1,000,00 slot.
 
Styron Essay Wins for Vanity Fair
Vanity Fair received the award for essays and criticism for ''Darkness Visible,'' an essay by the novelist William Styron, who at the age of 60 fell into a clinical depression and found himself on the verge of suicide.
Consumer Reports won the award for personal service for ''Beyond Medicare,'' by Trudy Lieberman, a comprehensive examination of the Medicare system.
Arts & Antiques won in the special-interests category for ''What's Not Hot.''
The Washingtonian won the feature-writing award for its profile by Katie McCabe of Vivien Thomas, a laboratory assistant who, without formal scientific training, became a pioneer in cardiovascular medicine.
The public-interest award went to Southern Exposure for three articles on the chicken industry that resulted in fines and legislative action intended to make the industry safer for workers and customers.
The design award went to Esquire for its issues of April, June and November, 1989.
National Geographic won the single-topic award for an issue in which 50 percent or more of the editorial content is devoted to one subject, in this case the celebration of France's bicentennial in the July 1989 issue.

HEADLINE: India Is Expected to Remain On U.S. Trade 'Hit List'

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
As President Bush's Cabinet-level Economic Policy Council met today to consider which countries to target for reprisal under 1988 trade legislation, Administration officials said that India was likely to remain on their ''hit list'' but that Brazil, like Japan, had worked its way off.
The two largest third world democracies were cited last year, along with Japan, as having the most onerous barriers to American trade. Unlike the other two, India has made no concessions. It has taken the position that it cannot submit to another nation's law. 
''How do you not name India this year and maintain credibility of our law?'' asked a senior Administration official, who requested anonymity.
The President did not meet with the Cabinet group today and has not yet made a decision, according to White House officials. The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday that India ''is truly out of step with the historic changes taking place around the globe,'' a reference to market liberalization and deregulation spreading in Eastern Europe and the third world.
The 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act imposes a Monday deadline for setting trade policy priorities. The law generated a similar procedure last year, creating the initial list of countries to be subject to reprisals.
 
'A Fantastic Change'
Mrs. Hills contrasted the Indian experience with the ''very happy story'' of Brazil, which has undertaken ''a fantastic change in policy'' under its newly elected President, Fernando Collor de Mello.
Brazil is not only cutting protectionist barriers but has also agreed to submit for international settlement the licensing restrictions for imports cited by the United States in last year's complaint.
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that because of three important agreements to open Japanese markets for wood products, satellites and supercomputers, Japan should not be cited again. It is expected to be dropped from the list with a warning that trade reprisal weapons remain, should difficulties persist.
Much of the political debate has centered on Japan. ''If we have learned anything over the years that we have fought to reduce our monumental trade deficit with Japan, it is that the only thing that works is clear, constant, consistent pressure for needed change,'' said House majority leader Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who made an America First trade policy the linchpin of his unsuccessful bid for his party's 1988 Presidential nomination. .
But the Indian situation has also raised some basic issues. The trade law's Super 301 provision, which increases the likelihood of retaliation against countries that do not lower barriers on United States products, was aimed chiefly at Japan.
The United States is Japan's largest export market, and Japan is this country's second-largest export market after Canada. Over the last decade, the United States has run deficits with Japan approaching a total of $400 billion. Last year's deficit was $49 billion, and total trade between the two countries was $138.2 billion. In contrast, total trade with India last year was $5.8 billion. India was the United States' 27th-largest export market. Why India? ''Surely we must be inconsequential to the American economy,'' an Indian businessman said at the United States-India Bilateral Business Conference in Washington. ''Why then will we remain under 301?'' he asked Mrs. Hills.
She replied that India, with its population of 850 million, represented a potentially huge market. ''We select our trade liberalization priorities on the basis of those which have maximum potential for U.S. exporters and for the world at large,'' she stressed.
India was cited last year for a ban on operations of foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign investment that distort world trade. Both issues are important in the context of global market-opening that the United States is seeking in the so-called Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks.
Now being negotiated by 105 Governments in Geneva, the round aims at lowering barriers in services like insurance that account for ever growing portions of world trade. Other goals include ending trade distortions from foreign investment regulations, improving protection for copyrights, trademarks, patents and other intellectual property and wiping out farm export subsidies.
 
A Hard Line
India, which maintains one of the most protected economies in the world, has taken a hard line against not only the bilateral American trade demands but also the objectives of the Uruguay Round. The new Government of Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh has been cool to foreign investment and unwilling to promise anything more than what it terms a ''gradual'' tariff cutting.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates Rise Above 9%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates moved above 9 percent yesterday for the first time in nearly a year, continuing a rise that will crimp certain sectors of the economy.
Since mid-December, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, the benchmark most often used in setting rates on a wide variety of debts, including home mortgages, have risen by more than a full percentage point, and prices have fallen for 9 of the last 10 days.
If the trend continues, economists said, the rate increase will hurt the housing and construction industries, but have relatively little impact elsewhere.
 
Housing Demand 'Is Pretty Weak'
''The rate rise comes at a time when demand in the housing market is pretty weak, and it will hit that sector pretty hard,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''But a rise of a little over one percentage point in long-term interest rates is not going to kill the economy.'' 
The increase over the last four and a half months has been caused by a number of factors, some international, many domestic. For the last month or so, developments in the United States have caused the greatest worries. There are signs of more rapid economic growth and rising inflation than were anticipated at the start of the year, and traders fear the Federal Reserve might tighten credit, which would further raise rates and depress bond prices.
Those concerns were paramount in the credit markets yesterday, as dealers in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds sold securities in advance of the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate of first-quarter economic growth, which is to be released today.
Most economists expect the report to show that the economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5 percent or better in the first quarter, up from the 1.1 percent rise in the previous quarter, in large part because of unseasonably warm weather.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 94 14/32, down 3/4 point, to yield 9.04 percent. This is the first time that the bellwether issue has closed at a yield of more than 9 percent since May 11, 1989.
The rise in money-market interest rates, however, has not yet prompted the Federal Reserve Board to tighten its grip on monetary policy by raising the rate on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market, and some economists do not believe it will do so. That rate has stayed around 8 1/4 percent since mid-December.
''My guess is the Fed won't tighten policy,'' said Mr. Gramley, a former Fed governor. ''There is not enough evidence of economic resurgence or rising inflation to warrant that sort of action.''
 
Chrysler's $1 Billion Issue
But economic worries were not the only reason for yesterday's selloff. Traders and analysts said the sale of $1 billion of long-term bonds backed by the Chrysler Corporation also played a role, as some dealers adjusted their portfolios to accommodate the new issue, which bankers said sold out quickly.
The offering, for Auburn Hills Trust, a technical center under construction in Auburn Hills, Mich., is unconditionally guranteed by Chrysler. The 12 3/8 percent issue, which matures on May 1, 2020, was priced at $100. Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which was increased in size from $800 million. It is rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A number of other analysts agree with Mr. Gramley that economic worries are overblown, and that some of the recent run-up in rates will subsequently be retraced.
''I don't see where the supposed strength in the economy is, and I don't think inflation pressures are anywhere near as bad as the market does,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, a senior adviser to the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
 
Rising Volume of Financings
Mr. Chimerine expects the second quarter's economic reports will calm some of the market's fears. But, he said, the rising volume of Treasury debt financings will help to keep interest rates higher than they might otherwise be.
William Melton, a vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis, agreed that the increasing financings were a problem. ''There is a concern that the supply problem is going to get worse and worse,'' he said.
Increasingly higher cost estimates for bailing out the nation's savings and loan industry have created ''a kind of dread that there will be a tidal wave of Treasury bonds in drag,'' Mr. Melton said.
The Resolution Funding Corporation, the financing arm charged with raising the money for the bailout, issues its securities through the Treasury Department, and the quarterly Treasury refunding auctions will take place in early May. Such large-scale borrowing ''will prevent rates from falling back toward 8 percent,'' he said.
 
Notes Fall Sharply
Yesterday's deterioration in Treasury prices was not confined to bonds.
In the secondary note market, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 14/32, down 17/32, to yield 9.05 percent.
And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes auctioned Wednesday at an average yield of 8.90 percent were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 9.04 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose modestly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.81 percent late yesterday, up 5 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 7.99 percent.
The fall in Treasury prices once again took a toll on the secondary market for investment-grade corporate securities. Dealers said prices of most issues fell by as much as 3/4 point.
 
Lower Citicorp Ratings
The announcement that Standard & Poor's had lowered its ratings on $30 billion of Citicorp's outstanding debt was made after most trading had ended.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, dealers said prices of most actively traded issues fell by 5/8 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended April 16. The report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Global Program For Environment

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WITH the ebbing of the cold war, the environmental issue is moving up on the international agenda. And it is also moving up on the corporate agenda, as demonstrated by this week's Exxon stockholders' meeting in Houston at which a series of environmental initiatives were defeated even as top management insisted upon its commitment to environmental protection.
Is the environment a ''motherhood issue''? Indeed, one problem in dealing with the topic is that everybody insists he or she is devoted to preserving the environment, but there is intense conflict over how to do it and at what cost to taxpayers, business or national economic interests.
Last week at Harriman, N.Y., the American Assembly, a forum founded by Dwight D. Eisenhower when he was president of Columbia University, brought together 76 leading scientists, economists, business executives, political scientists and politicians, international officials and environmentalists from 19 countries to tackle the environmental problem. 
After four days of debate, the participants concluded that the danger of global warming was so severe that the United States should take immediate action to lessen it. That conclusion came, as the assembly statement noted, ''just days after a White House conference on the same subject at which the President and other Administration officials refused to acknowledge that the risks of global warming are sufficiently clear to merit immediate action.''
In sharp contradiction to the Administration's position, the assembly declared: ''There is a scientific consensus that rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will cause global climate change. Therefore, the earth is set to experience substantial climate change of unknown scale and rate. The consequences are likely to include sea level rise, greater frequency of extreme weather events, disruptions of ecosystems and potentially vast impacts on the global economy.''
It made specific recommendations on how to reduce those dangers. Warning of the ''irreversibility'' of some threats to the environment unless prompt action was taken, it called for a 20 percent reduction by the year 2005 in global carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline, coal, oil and other fossil fuels. And it recommended that the United States enact a ''large, phased-in increase in the Federal tax on gasoline and the adoption of a carbon dioxide emissions fee applicable to the uses of fossil fuels.''
While a large majority of the participants wanted all countries to impose such taxes on carbons, they insisted that the United States, which has lower gasoline taxes than other industrial countries, should act at once on fuel taxes. But there was no consensus on whether to restrict the use of funds raised from taxes on gasoline and other carbon fuels only for developing safer technologies and other environmental purposes, rather than for other purposes.
Even a heavy fuel tax would be only the beginning of an effective global program. The assembly observed that the environmental threat stemmed from three ''indivisibly linked'' global trends: human population growth, with world population, now at 5.2 billion, headed for 14 billion by the middle of the next century at present rates of growth; tropical deforestation and the rapid loss of biological diversity, and global atmospheric change, including stratospheric ozone loss and greenhouse warming.
On population policy, it again criticized the Administration in urging that family planning be supported and made available ''to those who want it'' throughout the world, which it estimated would cost $10 billion a year by 2000. ''Ultimately,'' the assembly stated, ''no Administration can be regarded as serious about the environment unless it is serious about global population growth.''
The threat to the global environment stems both from poverty and from affluence: poverty in the developing countries, which drives poor people to cut down forests and to have more children for the sake of family security, and affluence in the industrial countries, where rising income leads to an increase of polluting fuels and technologies.
As wealth and poverty can both lead to environmental destruction, so can both Communism and capitalism - and the worst of these is almost certainly Communism, with its restrictions of public pressure on bureaucrats, and with the lack of private property giving scant incentive to individuals to protect their land and other resources.
Delegates from Eastern Europe attending the assembly, which was also sponsored by the World Resources Institute, felt that their physical environments were among the worst in the world. They sought collaboration between their countries and the United States, including private business, on the environment. ''Such collaboration,'' the assembly agreed, ''is a commercial opportunity, and should be one of the more economically efficient ways of reducing environmental degradation.''
Business people from the West insisted that they should not be regarded as ''the enemy,'' but rather as potential solvers of environmental problems. Some called for creation of a ''business forum'' to work with governments and environmental groups. And the assembly reached consensus in urging governments to encourage ''environmental enterpreneurship'' through the use of taxes, subsidies and other signals.
But the environment is no more a ''motherhood problem'' than, say, motherhood itself, as the abortion debate proves.

HEADLINE: Some Savings Fraud Cases Will Slide By, Official Says

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26

 BODY:
The Federal Government is unlikely to prosecute all the major savings and loan fraud cases that are pending or to recover most of the assets of failed institutions, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today.
''Can we reach every major case? Probably not,'' Mr. Thornburgh said. ''Most of these assets have been frittered away.''
In his appearance before the Senate Appropriations Committee he responded to questions on whether the department would be able to handle the backlog of 1,300 major fraud cases against savings associations and their officials.
The cases are criminal referrals to the Justice Department. In some of them an investigation has begun; in others, one is about to begin, financed by the $50 million set aside for such investigations in the savings-bailout bill enacted last summer.
The Justice Department said it intended to assign the cases priority based first on their size and significance, and then on whether the case might face difficulties with the deadline posed by the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations under the bailout bill is 10 years.
''These are extremely difficult cases; we are trying to concentrate on major cases,'' Mr. Thornburgh said.
While weak regional economies, particularly in the Southwest, were initially blamed for much of the savings industry's troubles, regulators now say that fraud played a much larger role than originally thought.
Some Government experts have said the bailout of the savings industry could cost as much as $500 billion over the next 30 years.
Mr. Thornburgh said he was trying to focus the Justice Department's resources on several areas, all of which are competing for attention. They include drug prosecutions and white-collar crime, in addition to savings industry fraud, he said.

HEADLINE: J.&J.'s Profit Plunges 23.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. April 26

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson, the health-care products giant, said today that its profit declined 23.2 percent in the first quarter because of repayment of a loan in Argentina. The company said sales increased 16.1 percent in the quarter. 
Earnings for the period were $244 million, or 73 cents a share, on sales of $2.84 billion, compared with $317 million, or 95 cents a share, on sales of $2.45 billion for the corresponding period last year.
The 1990 results were reduced by a nonrecurring charge of $125 million for paying off an Argentine subsidiary's loan that was growing rapidly because of inflation in that country. Without the repayment, the company said, earnings would have increased 16.4 percent.
''We are very pleased with the 16 percent increase in sales, especially in the light of the extreme competitive environment in the domestic consumer environment,'' Johnson & Johnson's chairman, Ralph S. Larsen, said. ''The increase reflects substantial sales gains from worldwide and professional operations, as well as strong international revenues from our consumer businesses.''

Dollar Moves Up as Traders Await Information on G.N.P.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
After falling in Europe, the dollar finished mostly higher yesterday in dull trading in the United States. The trading was limited, analysts said, as those in the market waited for today's release of first-quarter data on the gross national product.
''It was a corrective uptick,'' said James Chorek, an analyst at Money Market Services in Chicago. ''There wasn't much happening on fundamental ground to move the dollar one way or another.'' 
Analysts said the dollar got some support late in the day when bond prices dropped, pushing the interest rate on the Treasury's key 30-year bond to more than 9 percent for the first time since May. Rising American rates usually bolster the dollar.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a close of 158.77 Japanese yen, from 159.25 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 158.75 yen. By the end of the day in New York, however, the dollar had risen to 159.23 yen, from 158.73 yen late Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6340, from $1.6370 late Wednesday. Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.6342, down from $1.6405 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Wednesday, included: 1.6797 West German marks, up from 1.6780 marks; 1.4575 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6355 French francs, up from 5.6345; 1,231.75 Italian lire, up from 1,231.00, and 1.1603 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1608.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's, included: 1.6810 West German marks, down from 1.6820; 1.4605 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 5.6395 French francs, down from 5.6455; 1.8915 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,234.00, and 1.1602 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1603.
Gold prices fell in New York after rising in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $370.50 an ounce, down from $370.70 late Wednesday. Also in New York, the Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $370.60 an ounce as of 4 P.M., down from $371.25 late Wednesday.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $372.65 an ounce, from $371.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $372.75, from $371.00 late Wednesday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.92 to close at a bid of $373.03.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.96 an ounce, from $4.97 late Wednesday.

Newspaper Executives See Falling Profits

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 26

 BODY:
Executives at some of the nation's largest communications companies said here today that a broad and deep slump in newspaper advertising would hurt profits this year.
''It will not be one of our better years,'' said Warren H. Phillips, the chairman of Dow Jones & Company, adding that the company's long-term prospects remained bright.
Representatives of The New York Times Company, Multimedia Inc. and the Tribune Company expressed similar judgments to analysts gathered here to assess the financial health of the industry at the John Morton Forum, which continues on Friday.
The forum is organized by Mr. Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a Washington brokerage, and has become an annual tradition in which many of the nation's newspaper-oriented communications companies describe their situations before analysts and reporters. 17% Profit Margins Mr. Morton said the forum's fundamental message seemed to be that newspaper profit margins, which have averaged about 20 percent over the last decade, have slipped now to about 17 percent and might decline further, to an average of about 15 percent in the 1990's. 
''It is clear that newspapers are going to be twice as profitable as most other businesses, but maybe not three or four times,'' he said.
Most newspaper-oriented companies have now diversified into other segments of the communications business, like broadcasting, newsprint manufacturing, cable televison, entertainment and electronic data delivery.
And while newspaper profits are being squeezed everywhere, each company's overall situation depends on its particular mix of businesses.
Walter E. Bartlett, the chairman of Multimedia, which publishes The Greenville (S.C.) News and produces the ''Donahue'' talk show, said his company had benefited from having about equal holdings in four communications businesses - newspapers, broadcasting, cable and entertainment.
 
Cable Profit at 55%
While the advertising slump has hurt newspapers and broadcasting, Multimedia's cable and entertainment divisions remain highly profitable. For instance, he said, cash flow operating profit margins at its cable systems were 55 percent or better.
Walter E. Mattson, the president of The New York Times Company, said the company's primary holding, The New York Times, had been badly hurt by the poor economy in New York City and the Northeast.
Mr. Mattson said that The Times was likely to have continued losses in advertising volume in the coming year, but added that he thought that the overall economy would improve, and advertising along with it.
''No one predicts a return to the boom of the 80's,'' Mr. Mattson said, adding that he thought the current slump would bottom out next year and that The Times would show advertising growth in 1992, barring a national recession.
 
Controlling Costs
A recurring theme at the forum was a determination to keep costs under careful control.
Peter R. Kann, the president of Dow Jones, said advertising volume was down by about 4 percent in the company's business publications division, whose principal publication is The Wall Street Journal.
But he said that the division's costs were up by only 1.3 percent in 1989 and that they were holding at that level in the first quarter of this year, while advertising revenues rose because of a rate increase after circulation improved.
The overall result was a 20 percent increase in operating income for the first quarter, compared with the corresponding period in 1989. But Mr. Kann said the division's operating income was off by 50 percent since the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, which had a severe impact on financial advertising.
Mr. Phillips, the company's chairman, said Dow Jones's profits this year would be hurt by start-up costs associated with the company's new electronic foreign-exchange service for currency investors and because of expenses related to the acquisition of the portion of Telerate Inc., the electronic data service, that Dow Jones did not own.
 
Tribune's Outlook
Charles T. Brumback, the chairman of the Chicago-based Tribune Company, said the company's profits for the year would probably be hurt by continuing losses at The Daily News in New York and by costs associated with labor negotiations now under way with the paper's 10 unions. He declined to say what those labor costs would be.
He said, however, that the company's entertainment division was expected to be highly profitable this year. The company also owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
The Tribune Company and The New York Times Company also have newsprint manufacturing operations and have been hurt by depressed newsprint prices caused by oversupply and heavy discounting.
Mr. Mattson and Mr. Brumback said they thought an announced increase in newsprint prices by $35 a metric ton would not be undercut by further discounting.

When an Ad Takes Off but Product Stalls

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
IT is one of the best-known advertising campaigns in the country and yet the product it sells has experienced a slide in market share since the effort began four years ago.
The television commercials of Lintas Campbell-Ewald's ''Heartbeat of America'' campaign for Chevrolet are famed for slow-motion shots of parents frolicking with their children and the insistent thump of the ''Listen to the Heartbeat of America'' song.
Although print ads are often less memorable than television, both ''Heartbeat'' executions have scored consistently high in consumer recall. The ''Heartbeat'' campaign scored No. 3 in Adweek's ''America's Favorite Print Campaigns,'' behind Ford and Pepsi-Cola. 
Yet Chevrolet is losing ground. According to Ward's Communications Inc., a leading trade publisher, Chevrolet's share of the American car market in 1986, when ''Heartbeat'' began, totaled about 15 percent. By 1989, it declined to 13.6 percent.
Bob Garfield, a columnist for Advertising Age, took notice of the gap between the campaign's visibilty and Chevrolet's sales. ''I may be the only person in the hemisphere to think so,'' he wrote recently, ''but my view is that 'Heartbeat' is simply a glitzy, stylish, somewhat sexy, extremely catchy, painstakingly cultivated archetype of puffery - because Chevrolet is not the heartbeat of America.''
He added, ''It's a declining entry-level car brand, and it desperately needs to communicate quality and value, not some fading vestige of ubiquity.''
In its April 14 cover article on the American automobile industry, The Economist, the British weekly, also criticized the ''Heartbeat'' campaign. ''Appeals to national pride, never very effective with America's discriminating shoppers, have backfired,'' the magazine said.
Sean K. Fitzpatrick, who led the Lintas team that developed the campaign, takes both views to task. ''To say the least, they are dead wrong,'' said Mr. Fitzpatrick, now vice chairman of McCann-Erickson Inc.
The Economist critique ignores a fundamental change in the automotive market, Mr. Fitzpatrick said: Many Chevrolet customers have turned to light trucks.
Indeed, it is true that Chevrolet is selling more light trucks, and these vehicles are also a part of the ''Heartbeat'' campaign, he said.
When light trucks are added in, Chevrolet's market share fell less steeply, to 18.1 percent last year from 18.3 percent in 1986, according to Ward's.
Moreover, ''every manufacturer has taken declines because there are more competitors,'' said Dannielle K. Colliver, Chevrolet's advertising manager for passenger cars.
Besides, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, ''advertising does not sell cars, dealers sell cars.''
William J. Ludwig, the current chief of the ''Heartbeat'' campaign at Lintas, makes a similar point. ''Our job is to cause customer consideration - to get Chevrolet on the shopping list,'' he said.
Dealers are happy with the campaign, according to the Lintas and other surveys, Mr. Ludwig said. One out of three car shoppers visits a Chevrolet dealer, he said.
''I think Heartbeat's a great concept that really gets people in the door,'' said Michael A. Inzirillo, the sales manager for B. K. Chevrolet Inc. in Brooklyn, which sells more than 1,000 cars annually.
Before the ''Heartbeat'' campaign, Chevrolet was having difficulty luring customers into the showrooms, Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Ludwig say.
In the 10 years before ''Heartbeat,'' Mr. Ludwig said, Chevrolet had more than 20 campaigns, most of them short-term drives to increase sales rather than efforts to build brand recognition. ''We are USA-1 and USA-1 is taking charge,'' was one such effort.
Chevrolet also suffered from an unusually poor image among young car buyers, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. In 1984 and 1985, ''We asked people what they thought of Chevy,'' he recalled. ''And young girls would tell us that if they looked out the window and saw their date drive up in a Honda, they'd think, 'Must be a cool guy.' But if their date drove up in a Chevy, they wouldn't even come out the door.''
If part of the public was hostile, Chevrolet itself had difficulty knowing its own mind, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. In late 1985 and 1986, Lintas surveyed the company's top 100 executives, asking them what Chevrolet meant to them, and got back 5,000 pages of notes. Lintas boiled the responses down to a 100-word mission statement that became ''Heartbeat.''
The statement said that ''Chevrolet markets a variety of vehicles that are better than you expect, given the cost, and that are excellent cars but without the Tiffany accouterments,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
Recent stylish changes in product line have also helped, he said, because Chevrolet cars used to seem relatively anonymous. ''We used to joke that Cavaliers and Celebrities were the favorite cars of bank robbers,'' he said. ''Get in one and you just fade into the background.''
Will General Motors stick with the ''Heartbeat'' campaign? ''We'll eventually change it, but not for the next few years,'' Ms. Colliver of Chevrolet said. ''Because nothing lives forever.''

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Temporarily Banning Gene-Engineered Drug for Cows

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
In a decision that could spell enormous trouble for the fledgling agricultural biotechnology industry, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin yesterday approved legislation that temporarily bars the sale or use of a genetically engineered drug for use in dairy cows.
The action is the first prohibition of a product of genetic engineering anywhere in the country, and it sets off another temporary ban of the drug in neighboring Minnesota. On Thursday, Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota signed into law a measure barring the drug there for a year; the measure was to become effective only if Wisconsin enacted its ban.
Mr. Thompson, a first-term Republican running for re-election in November, said the temporary ban, until June 1, 1991, would be ''sufficient to allow for additional farmer and consumer education'' on the drug's use and would not ''compromise Wisconsin's ability to compete in the national and international markets.'' The temporary ban was a political compromise between forces favoring a permanent ban and those opposing any ban. 
 
Development of Drug
The genetically engineered drug, bovine somatotropin (soh-mat-uh-TROPE-in), is a nearly identical copy of a naturally occurring protein produced by cows that helps to control milk production. In the early 1980's scientists isolated the gene that produces the protein, duplicated it and inserted it into common bacteria that are capable of producing unlimited quantities of the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the drug next year, but any state bans still in effect would remain in force in those states. Because it is not yet on the market, the immediate economic effects of the bans in the nation's largest and fourth-largest milk-producing states are not likely to be significant, agricultural biotechnology industry executives said.
But the political and symbolic significance to the agricultural biotechnology industry could be profound, said industry analysts. Since the development of genetic engineering in the early 1970's, companies using the technology to invent new microbes, plants and drugs for use in agriculture have been convulsed by waves of dissent from environmental groups, farmers and other opponents.
At issue is whether the products will do more to harm farmers, consumers and rural communities than to help them. Developers of the drug - Monsanto, American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly and Upjohn - say bovine somatotropin is a triumph of technology that will cause cows to produce 10 to 25 percent more milk on less feed, thus raising productivity and profits. Opponents of the drug say it will drive farmers out of business by encouraging overproduction, and they say questions about its effect on human health have not been adequately answered.
The supporters of the temporary ban said Mr. Thompson's action was a turning point for farmers and consumers in a long struggle against technology that they say encourages the extinction of small farms and harms the quality of food.
 
Intense Activity in Wisconsin
Nowhere has the political activity been more intense than in Wisconsin, which has more dairy farms than any other state, and where small dairy farmers are going out of business at a surprisingly swift rate. More than 10,000 dairy farms disappeared from the state's countryside in the 1980's, about a quarter of the total.
''This is going to send shock waves in the investment community,'' said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, a group opposing biotechnology development that is leading the campaign to ban the drug.
''We have clearly demonstrated that we can mount a political campaign to defeat biotechnology,'' he added. ''Some of these products have no redeeming value. This one is bad for the farms. It's bad for the cows. It's bad for taxpayers who will have to pay for all that extra milk. The only winners would be the four companies trying to bring it to market.''
Executives in farm biotechnology reacted to the action with a mix of relief and dismay. They noted that when the campaign to bar the drug began in the Midwest four years ago, the aim was a ban that was permanent.
''It's very positive clear signal that we're not going to be stormed over by emotionalism,'' said Robert E. Walton, president of Grace Animal Services, a division of W. R. Grace & Company, in DeForrest, Wis.
 
Race to Market Hormone
The four corporations racing each other to bring the hormone to the market have spent at least $500 million on its development and had counted on its success as the foundation to their programs in agricultural biotechnology. The worldwide market for bovine somatotropin has been estimated at $500 million to $1 billion a year.
Yet ever since Monsanto announced in 1985 that field trials at Cornell University in New York had produced spectacular gains in milk production, the drug's future has been clouded by political campaigns, protests, boycotts and other actions by opponents. Last summer, for instance, some of the nation's largest supermarket chains said they would not accept for use in their dairy products any milk from herds treated with the drug.
Mr. Thompson said his decision was a compromise intended to satisfy opponents and supporters of the drug. But the drug's opponents saw the decision as a clear victory.
''Although the Governor has tried to dodge the issue, he did in fact finally agree with our point that Wisconsin is not ready for bovine growth hormone,'' said State Senator Russell Feingold, a Democrat, who has led the battle in the Legislature for four years. ''It's a milestone. We've served notice on Monsanto and the others that money alone does not control Wisconsin.''
In St. Louis, Laurence J. O'Neill, a spokesman for the Monsanto Company, which has spent $300 million on developing the drug, said: ''We're disappointed by this temporary setback but don't regard it as significant for the long term future of BST or biotechnology. The real losers are the state's dairy farmers who will not have the same freedom as farmers in other parts of the country to immeidately begin using BST to improve their profitability. The product's merits will carry the day over the long term.''

LITHUANIA REPORTS PROMISING CONTACT WITH SOVIET AIDES

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, April 27

 BODY:
The political impasse over Lithuania's independence appears to be moving closer to a resolution after the intervention of the French and German leaders and backstage contacts between Moscow and the rebellious republic, officials here said today.
The Lithuanian Government expressed interest today in a letter from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and President Francois Mitterrand of France proposing that the republic temporarily suspend enforcement of its declaration of independence as a gesture to get substantive negotiations with Moscow under way.
''Perhaps this could be considered as a compromise,'' said Lithuania's Prime Minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene. ''How far Lithuania can get toward this should be the object of discussion in the Lithuanian Parliament. I do not think that these two countries have taken a position hostile to the interests of Lithuania.'' 
 
Consultations in the West
Mrs. Prunskiene said the idea was ''close to something that has already been discussed'' by Lithuanian leaders. [Despite suggestions that a compromise might be nearer, the Kremlin tightened its economic blockade of Lithuania early Saturday by announcing a cutoff in coal supplies, Reuters reported, quoting a dispatch from the official news Soviet agency Tass. Vladimir Kostyunin, Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supplies, said the supplies were halted because the republic had not paid for coal it had already received, according to the Tass report, which was monitored in London by the British Broadcasting Corporation.] The Kohl-Mitterrand letter came after intensive consultations in Washington and other Western capitals on how best to ease negotiations between Moscow and Vilnius. As a result of the discussions, President Bush, who was inclined to avoid putting the Kremlin in a corner by invoking sanctions, said earlier this week that he had decided not to penalize Moscow for the time being in the hope that this would lead to talks with the Lithuanians.
Lithuanian officials said that after several days of being ignored in Moscow, they were received by high-ranking aides to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. One Lithuanian said that the talks seemed to represent a thaw.
President Vytautas Landsbergis, who has staunchly refused to make any concessions until Moscow and Lithuania begin official negotiations, called the letter ''a step forward toward realization of Lithuanian independence.'' But he stopped short of saying he would agree to the proposal, and called on Moscow to make a good-will gesture of its own by lifting its nine-day-old embargo on oil, gas and industrial raw materials.
Romas Gudaitis, a member of an official Lithuanian delegation that returned today from Moscow, said the leaders of the republic's Parliament planned to meet this weekend to work out a package of measures that could be construed as a gesture of compromise toward Moscow.
He said the measures under discussion included conceding to Moscow the right to maintain military bases in Lithuania and spelling out in law the republic's economic ties to the Soviet Union, but he declined to discuss other steps that might be considered.
''A search is under way,'' Mr. Gudaitis said, adding that ''we need a clever formulation'' to insure that Lithuania goes to the bargaining table as an equal partner with Moscow, and not as a political subject.
 
Reaching a Middle Ground
The carefully worded letter from Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand represents a middle ground between Mr. Gorbachev's demand that the republic return to the Soviet fold and seek independence under Soviet law and the Lithuanian insistence that the republic's declaration of sovereignty is irrevocable.
The two leaders proposed that Lithuania ''suspend for a certain time the effects of the decisions taken by your Parliament,'' without disavowing the declaration of independence.
Lithuania's decrees on independence, the two Europeans added, ''would not in any way lose their value since they are based upon a universally accepted principle: the principle of peoples' right to self-determination.''
Lithuanians said the letter was important because it was highly unlikely that the European leaders would have risked diplomatic embarrassment by offering such a proposal without consulting Moscow.
Moreover, they said, by sending the letter Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand have invested their own political credibility in the dispute. If Lithuania accepts their advice and Mr. Gorbachev spurns it, or if Mr. Gorbachev fails to bargain in good faith in the ensuing negotiations, France and Germany would also have some basis to feel betrayed.
At a news conference today, Prime Minister Prunskiene said that after an earlier snub by the State Department she had been given a visa to enter the United States next week on an unofficial visit to plead with bankers, business leaders and senators for aid during the economic embargo. The United States scuttled an earlier request for a visit out of fear that it would disrupt the climate for Mr. Gorbachev's summit meeting with President Bush in Washington, which begins on May 30.
Even before the Kohl-Mitterrand letter arrived on Thursday, Moscow had begun sending diplomatic feelers probing the Lithuanians' openness to a face-saving settlement.
After several days of being studiously ignored in Moscow, Mr. Gudaitis and his fellow Lithuanian officials spent an hour on Thursday with Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, and chatted with Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, who advises Mr. Gorbachev on military affairs.
 
Earlier Talks Broken Off
Mr. Gudaitis said the talks produced ''nothing new'' but they seemed to represent a thaw. He said that the Lithuanians had earlier begun talks with Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a Politburo member regarded as Mr. Gorbachev's closest ally, but that these discussions broke off after word of them was leaked to the Lithuanian press.
Another member of Mr. Gorbachev's inner circle, the economist Stanislav S. Shatalin, talked on Thursday with Eduardas Vilkas, a prominent member of a bloc in the Lithuanian Parliament that favors a more pragmatic approach to Moscow.
''From his words, it was clear that Gorbachev very much wants to solve this,'' said Mr. Vilkas, the director of the Lithuanian Institute of Economics. Mr. Vilkas said that Moscow itself was paying a high price for its economic sanctions against Lithuania, including industrial disruptions.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
9 G.O.P. Senators Attack Bush on Lithuania

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
President Bush's policy of seeking not to damage relations with the Soviet Union during the Lithuanian crisis came under sharp attack today by nine Republican senators, marking the first serious break in Congressional support for the Administration's handling of the Baltic situation.
The senators called on the Administration to renounce the trade agreement that American and Soviet negotiators reached in principle on Thursday, saying it was ill-timed because of the Soviet crackdown on Lithuania.
Until today, Mr. Bush's decision not to impose sanctions against Moscow for its economic embargo of Lithuania had been greeted mostly with bipartisan approval. But the trade agreement has apparently galvanized conservative lawmakers who privately questioned Mr. Bush's decisions. 
The senators, many of whom have strongly backed President Bush's foreign policy stands, were unusually critical today, though they were careful not to attack the President personally.
 
'Callous,' Humphrey Says
''I am appalled at the lack of sensitivity by the White House towards the Lithuanian people as they desperately struggle to reassert independence,'' said Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hamphshire. ''To announce an agreement liberalizing trade with the Soviets, two days after the President revealed he would assess no penalty against the Soviets for their bullying of Lithuania, is callous and unfeeling in the extreme.''
Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, was not one of the nine senators who criticized the President. But in separate comments today, he suggested that he would ''slow walk'' the trade pact through Congress. ''We shouldn't be doing the Kremlin any favors right now,'' he said. George J. Mitchell, the Senate Majority leader, has also indicated he would consider a slowdown in the negotiations.
The United States announced in Paris on Thursday that it had reached broad agreement with the Soviets on a pact that once approved by Congress could make it possible for the Soviet Union to win most-favored-nation tariff treatment by the United States, giving that country new trade privileges. The agreement is likely to be signed when Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union hold their summit meeting here late next month.
While most of the senators were not ready to suggest that Mr. Bush call off the summit meeting, they did assert at a Capitol Hill news conference that the trade agreement should be shelved from the agenda.
 
'Sellout of Freedom'
''This is a sellout of freedom, and, to be quite frank, it is sickening,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who organized the news conference. ''It is unacceptable for the U.S. to enter into a favorable trade agreement with the Soviet Union while it crushes Lithuanian freedom under a jackboot.''
Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, said that while he usually backed Mr. Bush, he decided to ''respectfully disagree'' in this case. ''If my choice is between Mr. Gorbachev and his policies and the people of Lithuania and their freedoms,'' he said, ''I'll choose freedom every time.''
The other Republican senators who criticized the Administration's expected pact with the Soviet Union were Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, Steve Symms of Idaho, James A. McClure of Idaho, Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and William L. Armstrong of Colorado.
Several Democrats also criticized the Administration's policy on Lithuania today. Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, joined his Republican colleagues at the news conference, and Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, also issued a statement opposing the agreement.
 
Avoid 'Anything Precipitous'
Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said that while ''we are aware of the senators' concerns,'' Mr. Bush ''does not want to do anything precipitous that will affect the process of change'' in the Soviet Union.
Another White House official, speaking on the condition that he not be named, said of the senators' remarks: ''It is damaging. But does it undercut the necessity about being prudent about what you say and what you do? The answer is no.''

HEADLINE: Peruvian Bars Drug Accord Unless U.S. Helps on Crops

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 27

 BODY:
President Alan Garcia has declared that he will not sign an agreement with the United States to combat the cocaine trade if the accord does not include economic compensation for losses from growing coca leaf.
''The war on drugs cannot sustain itself with military aid alone,'' Mr. Garcia said on Thursday. ''I am not going to sign any agreement if it does not include economic aid for crop substitution and to give relief to the balance of payments.''
On Monday, the United States announced details of a plan to provide $35 million in military aid and training to combat drug trafficking in Peru's Amazon basin, which produces half of the world's coca leaf crop.
The military accord was to have been signed on Thursday by Defense Minister Julio Velazquez Giaccarini and the United States Ambassador to Peru, Anthony C. E. Quainton. No signing took place. It is not clear whether Mr. Garcia's comments indicated that he had directed the Minister not to sign.

HEADLINE: 10,000 Are Expected to Lose Jobs to Spotted Owl

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ANGELES, Wash.

 BODY:
The loggers who have been chewing at this peninsula of ancient forest for the last century have weathered hard times from automation, overcutting and recessions. But never have they taken the kind of economic blow expected this summer on behalf of an owl whose life is endangered by the way they earn their living.
With at least 10,000 jobs in the Pacific Northwest expected to be lost so as to save some of nation's oldest trees and the owls that live among them, loggers and sawmill workers here are demanding economic compensation from the Federal Government.
''We don't want to move,'' said Kirk Dahlstrom, whose small lumber company in the timber town of Hoquiam depends on 300-year-old trees from the nearby Olympic National Forest. ''We want to live the way we've always lived. But now we're going to shut down. Is the Government going to take care of us?'' 
 
'A Real Sinking Feeling'
Direct Federal relief seems unlikely. This month, the Senate narrowly voted down a $500 million proposal to aid miners expected to lose their jobs as utilities burn cleaner coal from other areas to meet the requirements being developed for a new Clean Air Act.
''We felt a real sinking feeling,'' Representative Sid Morrison said of the proposal's defeat. Mr. Morrison, a Republican from Washington, is coordinating efforts by the Northwest Congressional delegation to aid the loggers here.
Economists have been predicting the demise of the logging of ancient trees, as both trees and jobs continued to disappear. Then, this month, a Federal study group recommended that 2.5 million acres of virgin forest be set aside this summer to protect the endangered spotted owl.
Few people expected the end to be so sudden, As a result, leaders on both sides of the issue are grasping to find specific solutions.
 
'We'll Have to Get Along'
''There is never a good time to do these things,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''But if it's the will of the public, we'll have to get along. What this proves is that you can't have both a protected old-growth forest and timber supply at historical levels.''
The question now becomes: Can loggers, truck drivers, sawmill workers and coal miners learn to be computer technicians, tour operators or assemblers at small manufacturing shops? Timber jobs pay $8 to $13 an hour; tourism, touted as the best economic alternative for the Olympic Peninsula, would bring salaries half that amount, according to projections by Washington State officials.
The proposal to save the owls' habitat, almost certain to be adopted by the Forest Service this summer, would place most virgin forest and some replanted areas off limits to loggers on Federal land in Northern California, Oregon and Washington. It would reduce the Federal timber harvest in the Northwest by 25 percent.
''Good environmentalism is, for the most part, good economics,'' said Jeff Olson, an economist with the Wilderness Society in Portland, Ore. ''We've seen the end of an era coming for 10 years. The problem is how to ease the transition.''
 
'Proposal Will Outlaw Jobs'
Senator Slade Gorton, Republican from Washington, said in a recent speech to a timber group in this town on the Olympic Peninsula, ''This owl proposal will essentially outlaw your jobs.'' The Senator has proposed setting aside parts of national forests for exclusive use by loggers for generations.
Environmentalists say the present system, under which large sections of national forests are sold to timber companies, already resembles Senator Gorton's plan and has contributed to the loss of large sections of forests.
Less than 500 yards away from the site of Mr. Gorton's speech, old-growth logs were being prepared for shipment to Japan, where they bring nearly twice the price that American timber mills are willing to pay. Thousands of sawmill jobs could be saved if exports were restricted, according to Forest Service estimates.
With 40 percent of Washington's logs exported last year as unprocessed raw material, a ban on exports is gaining acceptance as one solution to the timber crisis. Nearly four billion board feet of logs were exported from the West Coast last year, about four times the amount of wood that would be off-limits to logging because of the spotted owl.
 
Congressional Action Possible
This week, the United States Senate passed an amendment to a trade bill offered by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, that would allow states to ban the export of logs. It would have an immediate effect in Oregon, which has already passed such a law, but would not apply in Washington State until the Legislature enacted a ban. A similar bill is before the House, and prospects appear good for Congessional passage.
Also this week, Japan agreed to drop some trade barriers to finished wood products. American officials have complained that the Japanese accept mainly logs instead of wood products from the United States.
The legislation and Japan's move should help the economically distressed timber towns, Mr. Packwood said.
Some political leaders are urging even stronger export controls.
While some business leaders foresee ghost towns, the mill towns can stay alive if they move quickly to diversify their economies, an Oregon state study says. The best hope for these towns, notched in river valleys among forest lands that have been cut, is to attract retirees, to promote tourism and to move into secondary manufacturing.
But Oregon officials say they do not have money in their budget to help these towns make the transition.
Making furniture, cabinets and stereo equipment out of wood that is usually sent abroad or is sliced into boards is being promoted as a way to squeeze more jobs and money out of the available trees.
 
No Money, Just Trees
The Wilderness Society has recommended that a stiff tariff be placed on log exports and that the money from those taxes be used to help start small businesses making such products or to retrain workers.
But Mr. Dahlstrom, whose Dahlstrom Lumber Company is already making finished products like door frames and windows with his old-growth logs, says he does not need any more money, just wood.
His company, he said, is a victim of historic change. He could move to Seattle, two hours away, where 60,000 jobs were created last year. But he wants to stay where he is, making doors from tight-grain vertical fir from trees that have been on the Olympic Peninsula longer than America has been an independent nation.

HEADLINE: BUSH PRODS NATION ON CENSUS RETURNS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Eager to speed a lagging population count that Republicans hope will help them gain seats in Congress, President Bush today called on Americans ''to stand up and be counted'' by returning their census forms.
Mr. Bush said the large number of people who did not return their forms, or who did not even receive them because of problems in the mailing system, had created ''mammoth'' difficulties for census takers, who began going door to door around the country on Thursday to collect the missing information.
''We really need to get moving on this,'' Mr. Bush said in an appearance before a White House gathering of state legislators. 
''I simply want to take this opportunity,'' he said, ''to urge every American who has not returned the census form to do so, to stand up and be counted.''
 
Second Plea by President
This was the second time that the President, who filled out his own census form during a recent White House photo-taking session, had made such an appeal. Earlier this month he taped a television commercial that was broadcast around the country.
But it was not clear how much Mr. Bush's comments today would help ease the task that has been left for the door-to-door census takers. That task is enormous, because nearly 40 percent of the 95 million questionnaires mailed by the Census Bureau in March have not been returned.
The lists that the census takers are using to make their treks were drawn up according to households that had not returned census forms as of April 20. Addresses could be removed from the list if a form were returned now, but only a huge response to Mr. Bush's plea would have a significant impact.
Mr. Bush framed his appeal in terms of the effect of the census on the financial relationship between Washington and the state and local governments. The Federal Government distributes more than $50 billion to states and localities through 142 programs that are based in whole or in part on population, income and ethnic data.
''Our partnership must begin with an accurate account of the depth and scope of our needs that can only begin with the U.S. Census,'' Mr. Bush said.
 
Important Political Theme
But although the President did not touch on it today, there was also an important political theme behind his remarks.
The 1990 census will be used to apportion Congressional seats to each of the 50 states and, within each state, to draw Congressional districts. Republicans hope the census will favor them by reflecting a substantial population shift from the industrial North to the more Republican Southwest, thus improving their chances of whittling away at the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
But within each state, it is the state legislature that determines the boundaries of Congressional districts. Republicans, including Mr. Bush, have accused the Democrats, who control a majority of state legislatures, of drawing those boundaries to favor their own candidates.
Mr. Bush has made Republican attacks on the gerrymandering one of his top political priorities, touching on it in many of the speeches he has made around the country in recent months.
Another political issue related to the census is that an incomplete count would increase pressure on the Government to adjust the results by using mathematical techniques intended to reflect a truer count of the population and its ethnic and economic makeup.
Democrats believe this would help them, because the adjustment would be intended to compensate for an undercount of the inner-city poor and minority members, who are traditionally Democratic voters.

HEADLINE: Unrelated Amendments Snag Bill on Emergency Spending

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
Senate efforts to complete action on an emergency spending bill that includes money for domestic programs and aid for Panama and Nicaragua slowed to a crawl today as lawmakers battled over scores of unrelated amendments on everything from abortion to the death penalty.
The $3.4 billion spending measure would provide $420 million to help rebuild Panama's economy and $300 million to assist the administration of Nicaragua's new President, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who was sworn in on Wednesday.
''Mrs. Chamorro's term may expire before we get the aid down there,'' said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, as he surveyed the list of proposed amendments. 
 
A Variety of Issues
Domestic programs covered in the bill include food stamps, disaster assistance, veterans' medical care and the 1990 census.
The House approved its version of the legislation earlier this month. But under the Senate's more lax rules, which permit unlimited amendments and debate, the spending measure has become a magnet for pet initiatives that lawmakers might not otherwise have an opportunity to raise. Senators are essentially hoping to attach their proposals to a bill that will ultimately pass in one form or another.
One of the most volatile issues is abortion, and conservative Republicans, led by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, took their first shot by trying to scuttle language adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee that would permit the District of Columbia to use its own funds to finance abortions.
 
Outlook for a Veto
President Bush vetoed a similar measure last year, and he has made it clear that he would do so again if the language is included in the spending bill.
While the abortion measure survived two procedural votes, the Senate suspended further debate on the language and lawmakers appeared headed for a protracted fight.
''As usual, the Senate doesn't know where it's going, or how long it's going to take us to get there,'' said Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican.

HEADLINE: Expansion at the Brooklyn Museum

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Construction will begin Monday on the first phase of a master plan that would more than double the size of the Brooklyn Museum. The museum, one of the largest in the United States, has already raised most of the $31 million for the first stage, confounding skeptics who doubted the project would ever get off the ground.
The plan calls for one of the largest museum expansions since the Metropolitan Museum of Art embarked on a 25-year, $250 million program in 1969. If the Brooklyn plan is completed as envisioned, probably some time in the third decade of the 21st century, the museum will grow to 900,000 square feet at a cost estimated at nearly $250 million.
In the first phase, some 64,000 square feet of space will be rebuilt, producing three new floors of galleries in the west wing. They are to open in 1992 with an exhibition of Spanish Colonial art to mark the Columbus quincentenary. These galleries will be larger than the entire current exhibition space of the Whitney Museum of American Art and will increase the museum's gallery space by 25 percent. This will allow it to expand special-exhibition areas, display more paintings from its permanent collection and reinstall its prized Egyptian collection. 
 
An Auditorium Next Spring
The first phase will also create a 460-seat auditorium and additional art-storage areas. The auditorium is to open next spring and will be the museum's first formal venue for films and lectures since the original auditorium was closed 56 years ago.
''So many people thought the master plan was just pie-in-the-sky drawings and publicity,'' said James Stewart Polshek, the architect who developed the plan with the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. ''No one believed we'd get this going in anything like its current form.''
The scope of the new plan recalls the original one by McKim, Mead & White in 1893. That plan envisioned a monumental 1.5-million-square-foot palace of arts and sciences to establish Brooklyn, then an independent city, as the cultural equal of Paris, London or its rival across the East River. Only one-sixth of that plan was realized by 1927, when construction stopped. Since then, the museum has been largely overshadowed by its richer, flashier counterparts in Manhattan and has been unable to complete the original plan on Eastern Parkway near Grand Army Plaza.
 
Only 5 Percent on View
Nonetheless, the Brooklyn has an encyclopedic collection of some two million objects, ranging from ancient Egyptian and Mayan sculptures to early American decorative arts and European and American works from the 14th century to the present. Only about 5 percent of its holdings can be displayed now.
''It was irresponsible to condemn such a lodestone of treasure to decay,'' said Robert T. Buck, who was named director in 1983. ''But de facto, that's what happened.''
''There were several awful attempts to deal with this unfinished monument over the years,'' he continued. Many designs were commissioned but never realized, and a boxlike new wing was added in the early 1980's. Mr. Buck said, ''Small actions on a building like this look like bandages.''
The new building plan evolved when the museum's art school in the west wing closed in 1985. Mr. Buck asked the school's director, Joan Darragh, for ideas on how to use the space, which has remained empty. After evaluating their priorities, museum officials decided to organize an architectural competition for a master plan.
 
A Unanimous Decision
In October 1986, after receiving submissions from some of the leading architects in the world, they unanimously selected a bold abstract and neo-classical scheme developed by Arata Isozaki & Associates and James Stewart Polshek & Partners. The design, which Mr. Isozaki said ''establishes continuity with the original plan,'' also incorporates decidedly modern elements, like a 150-foot tapered tower with a skylight. Mr. Isozaki designed the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and Mr. Polshek's firm designed the restoration of Carnegie Hall.
While many people in the museum world doubted that the plan would ever be anything more than impressive renderings and models, the Beaux-Arts museum gathered support from government and private sources. It won a $1 million challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, then received pledges from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and the Brooklyn Borough President's office for $14 million.
Although the museum is privately administered, its building is owned by the city, which provides 40 percent of its $15 million annual operating budget.
 
Large Private Gifts
''Their project request was a standout,'' said Mary Schmidt Campbell, New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner. Because of the plan's architectural qualities as well as what she called Brooklyn's ''new artistic vitality'' and the museum's ''leadership position in presenting culturally diverse programs,'' Dr. Campbell said that she had made city support for its renovation ''my highest priority during my first year as commissioner.''
Large private contributions followed, including $3.5 million from Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, $2.5 million from Marty and Robert S. Rubin, $1 million from Alastair B. Martin and $750,000 from Mary P. Oenslager. A 1983 grant from the Vincent Astor Foundation for $1 million was also applied to the effort.
Mr. Buck said he expected to have the remaining money for the first phase within a year. He also said the museum would remain open during the reconstruction.
''I'm rather surprised they raised money so well and so fast,'' said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum. ''It's a testament to Bob Buck and the trustees and reflects the quality of the museum.''
 
No Deals, No Opposition
The Brooklyn Museum plan does not follow the expansion course set by other New York cultural institutions. The Museum of Modern Art, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, for example, all made real-estate deals to help pay for their building plans and operating budgets.
Nor has the Brooklyn encountered the sort of community opposition that has hampered efforts at other museums. Additions to the Guggenheim and the Jewish Museums, to be completed within the next few years, were both scaled down after architects, preservationists and neighborhood organizations charged that the proposed structures would threaten the original buildings' integrity and the architectural character of their neighborhoods. The worst problems have been at the Whitney Museum, which for five years has unsuccessfully tried to gain approval of its expansion plans from the local Community Board and the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.
''Happily, we didn't have the land-encroachment problems that the Whitney and Guggenheim had, because the original 1893 plan gave us our turf,'' Mr. Buck said. ''The site, where the parking lot is, was already designated for the museum.''
 
Next Step Is Undecided
Museum officials have not decided what to tackle next in the master plan. ''Once we finish this, we have to reassess the building and New York's economy, since we're linked to local economic tides,'' Mr. Buck said.
But Ms. Darragh, who has become the museum's vice director for planning and architecture, said further renovations of the current building and new construction are expected to begin in this decade.
Given the task of raising up to $200 million when the city has a severe budget deficit and New York's economy is sluggish, the museum will probably have separate fund-raising campaigns for each phase of construction, said Mr. Rubin, the museum's chairman and a senior executive vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
''The museum and the city are partners in this project, and I think we'll be able to make a convincing case to them for the next phases,'' he said. ''We're also expanding our sources of private interest and funding, and we want to bolster our endowment, now $25 million, because as exhibition space increases, our operating expenses will move upward.''
Mr. Polshek offered a generally optimistic assessment: ''I think there will be another piece completed within 15 years, but resources have changed. Maybe another architect will come along and change the plan, but the museum will eventually be completed.''
Reflecting on the museum's long, tangled construction history and its role as a symbol for Brooklyn, Mr. Buck said: ''To Manhattan's hare, we're the tortoise. We move along step by step.''

HEADLINE: REGENTS APPROVE PANEL ON NEW ETHNIC STUDIES

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 27

 BODY:
The Regents today authorized creating a panel to draft changes in school curriculums to add weight to the influence of non-white cultures on American society.
The makeup of the panel will be largely up to Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol, who in February called publicily for the revisions as a racially sensitive way to teach. 
The names for the 21-member panel will be offered to the Regents in June. Under the plan, the committee is to have two elementary school teachers, two middle school teachers, two high school teachers, two curriculum administrators, two school administrators, one technology expert, two to four university-level scholars in history, geography, anthropology, sociology, political science or economics.
The panel will be formed in the next two months. Mr.Sobol said it would be ''at least a couple of years'' before significant changes might actually appear int he courses taught to the 2.5 million schoolchildren in the state.

HEADLINE: Charlotte Boschan, Developer of Banks Of Data, Dies at 70

 BODY:
Charlotte Boschan, an economist who established the first electronic data bank in the field when she was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research a quarter-century ago, died of complications of surgery on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in New City, N.Y.
Dr. Boschan, who was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's and a doctorate from Columbia University. After working at the Econometric Institute she joined the National Bureau in 1951 and was an early developer of data banks.
At the bureau she helped revise the cyclical economic indicators used by the United States Department of Commerce and the procedure for combining the indicators into indexes of economic activity. She was also largely responsible for constructing the Growth Cycle Program, a method of determining turning points in the economy.
From 1977 to 1986 Dr. Boschan was a vice president of Citibank, which took over the economic data bank, now known as Citibase, from the National Bureau.
Her husband, Paul Boschan, a statistician, died in 1986.
She is survived by a brother, Beretz Ronen of Kibbutz Hazorea, Israel.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate Up by 2.1% For Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27

 BODY:
The economy grew at a moderate 2.1 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year while inflation took its biggest quarterly jump since 1981, the Commerce Department reported today.
Exceptional weather - a record cold December followed by the second-warmest January-March period in this century - affected both sets of figures, however, and economists were not prompted to make a major reappraisal of economic and financial prospects. The expectation continues to be for solid, though perhaps slightly decelerating, growth for the balance of 1990 with prices rising less rapidly than in the first quarter but at a still-unsettling pace.
The growth in the G.N.P. came in at less than many analysts had expected and might have encouraged some in the financial markets to think that this would reduce upward pressure on interest rates. But the dominant view was that the price data would support the Federal Reserve in its resolve to keep inflation under control. 
 
6.5 Percent Inflation Rate
 The price of a fixed list of goods climbed at a 6.5 percent annual rate, compared with 3.6 percent in the final 1989 quarter and 4.5 percent for all of last year, today's report showed. The jump for January to March is the highest since a 7.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1981.
J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, called the news on inflation ''disappointing'' and implied that the Bush Administration would not complain if the Federal Reserve found it necessary to tighten monetary policy to prevent price pressures from intensifying.
''There is no room for complacency on inflation,'' Mr. Villamil said at a briefing for reporters. ''The Administration shares the Fed's goal of maximum growth consistent with price stability.''
At the same time, however, he added that he expected inflation to moderate in coming months, saying that a ''likely unwinding of energy and food prices'' already appears under way.
Private economists generally agreed, noting that the extremes of the weather caused huge gyrations in the price of heating oil and other fuels and in fresh fruits and vegetables. Clothing prices were subjected to unusually big price increases in February and March.
But while today's inflation data may have added to uneasiness over prices, there was little surprise because the Labor Department had reported last week that the Consumer Price Index jumped at an 8.5 percent rate in the January-March period.
Many economists, including Kenneth T. Mayland of the Society National Bank in Cleveland, say that today's inflation figures overstate the severity of the situation and the persistence of inflation. Mr. Mayland said that ''the inflation pressures are easily identifiable and reversible.''
The economic data caused a flurry of activity early in the bond market as traders seesawed in interpreting the data, but bond prices managed to close the day with a slight price rise after declining in 9 of the previous 10 trading days. On Thursday, prices slumped and the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond closed above 9 percent for the first time in nearly a year.
As for the gross national product, the 2.1 percent increase, while lower than recent expectations, was still well above what most economists were predicting at the turn of the year. The result was also nearly twice the depressed 1.1 percent growth rate of the fourth quarter, when the economy slowed substantially, partly because of a strike at the Boeing Company.
 
Gain in Real Final Sales
 Real final sales - a broad measure of the G.N.P. that excludes changes in inventories - advanced at a hefty 4 percent rate in the first quarter, up from 1.1 percent in the preceding three months. When averaged to smooth the various distortions, this gauge has thus risen at about a 2.5 percent rate over the last six months, said Gary E. Schlossberg, a senior economist for the Wells Fargo Bank.
He added that he thought the economy was now ''neither slowing down nor speeding up,'' although the odds favored some ''softening'' in the months ahead as the Federal Reserve keeps upward pressure on interest rates.
Business inventories rose at a rate of only $2.6 billion in the first quarter following two straight quarters of advances of more than $20 billion, today's report showed.
 
Inventory Levels Down
 Reduced inventory levels were a drag on growth in the quarter. In computing the G.N.P. it only matters if goods were produced, not whether they were actually sold. The lean stocks, however, now mean that additional demand would quickly translate to new production.
''Overall inventories are in fairly good shape, adding a positive element for continued economic growth,'' Mr. Villamil of the Commerce Department said.
Cutbacks in automobile output lopped some seven-tenths of a percentage point off the first-quarter G.N.P., but some of the reduction in auto inventories was offset by a rebuilding of oil and coal stocks drawn down during December's extremely cold weather. The cold also raised fuel and food prices in the early part of the first quarter, accounting for about half the increase in the fixed-weight inflation gauge.
 
Big Lift to Construction
 On the other hand, warm weather early this year gave a big lift to construction, with the result that this sector is unlikely to contribute much to growth in the current quarter.
The import-export sector added to growth at a $6 billion rate in the first quarter, down from $9.9 billion in the preceding three months, today's report also showed. Real personal consumption rose $16.4 billion, well above the $3.6 billion fourth-quarter rate.
Measured in current dollars rather than in constant 1982 dollars, the G.N.P. rose at a 7.8 percent rate in the first quarter, compared with a 4.6 percent rate of increase in the October-December period.
An alternate price gauge in the report, the so-called deflator, jumped to a 5.7 percent rate in the latest quarter, from 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter. While this is not a pure measure of inflation because it takes into account shifts in the composition of demand, it is widely watched by analysts. Unlike the fixed-weight index, the deflator captures the fact that when tomatoes, say, soar to $1 each - as they did this winter - people stop buying them.
The savings rate - which is personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income - eased to 5.4 percent in the first quarter from 5.6 percent, today's report also showed.
The Commerce Department revised its estimate of fourth-quarter corporate profits from current production to a rate $200 million higher than it first estimated last month. Instead of being down $9.5 billion at an annual rate, profits dropped by $9.3 billion.

HEADLINE: Anti-Takeover Law Signed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LANCASTER, Pa., April 27

 BODY:
Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the nation's toughest anti-takeover law today in hopes of cooling the threat of corporate raiders aiming at Pennsylvania companies. The law, which took effect immediately, has been the center of a national debate that pitted leading members of the investment community against state labor and business groups. 
For the first time in any state, raiders will be forced to surrender short-term profits from takeover attempts. The law also clamps down on raider voting rights and establishes protections for labor contracts when corporations change hands.
Mr. Casey said the law put the interests of Pennsylvania companies and families above those of corporate deal makers, whose motives are rooted in a zeal for profits. Mr. Casey signed the bill at the Lancaster City Council chambers, only blocks from the corporate headquarters of Armstrong World Industries, the floor covering manufacturer that the legislation was first drafted to protect.
The central provision in the law requires raiders, after a failed buyout or proxy fight, to forfeit any profit made from the sale of the target company's stock for 18 months.
The law would also allow management to give first consideration to employees, customers, suppliers or the community, rather than to shareholders, in weighing takeover bids.

HEADLINE: Trump Says He Might Sell Shuttle

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump said yesterday that he might sell the shuttle he bought from Eastern Airlines as part of a drive to build up his cash so that he could take advantage of new deals.
The New York developer confirmed that he had retained Merrill Lynch & Company to negotiate a possible shuttle sale. But he seemed reluctant to give up the shuttle, whose market share has rebounded in the last few months.
''It's highly unlikely that I will sell the shuttle but I never rule out anything,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I believe that over the next couple of years cash is going to be king. That's why I've built up a large amount of cash and will continue to build up a large amount of cash.'' 
''Interest rates are too high right now to justify a lot of deals if you have to borrow the money,'' he said.
 
Some Potential Buyers
 Mr. Trump said that some airlines had expressed interest in buying the shuttle, which has valuable flight slots and gates at La Guardia Airport in New York, National Airport in Washington and Logan International Airport in Boston.
Most large carriers like American, United, USAir and Delta would have difficulty buying the shuttle because they have extensive operations on the East Coast, posing possible antitrust problems. A sale would be subject to the approval of the Transportation Department.
The most likely bidders would be smaller carriers like America West Airlines, which tried to buy the shuttle last spring but lost out to Mr. Trump, and Midway Airlines.
 
Premium Fares
 Pan American World Airways operates a rival shuttle service. The East Coast shuttles have long had a following among business travelers who are willing to pay premium fares because of the convenience of hourly flights on which they do not need a reservation.
Mr. Trump denied reports in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that he was considering asset sales and new deals because he needs to raise cash to pay off his current interest costs and to reduce his debt.
The reports said Mr. Trump was planning to sell some of his prime assets like the shuttle and doing various deals that would involve the Trump Tower in Manhattan, the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan and his three casinos in Atlantic City.
Forbes magazine in an article about Mr. Trump said it had sharply reduced its estimate of his net worth, putting it at $500 million, or $1 billion less than last year's estimate. In the cover story of the May 14 issue, which Forbes made available yesterday, the magazine said it revised the estimate after examining nonpublic documents submitted by Mr. Trump last year to a government body. The magazine did not elaborate.
Using the list of properties in Mr. Trump's 1989 documents, and updating their values, Forbes said it came up with a total market value of slightly less than $3.7 billion. With nearly $3.2 billion in debt, however, Mr. Trump's cash shortfall may be nearly $40 million a year, Forbes estimated.
The Trump Organization released a statement yesterday saying that Forbes made a ''mathematical mistake or purposeful omission'' because its calculations did not include $160 million a year in anticipated operating profit from the Taj Mahal casino, but did include the casino's debt service costs. A Forbes spokesman said the magazine stood by its story.
When Mr. Trump assumed control of the shuttle from the Texas Air Corporation for $365 million in June, the operation had been devastated by a strike that the machinists' union had begun on March 4 against Eastern Airlines. Its market share, which had been 57 percent before the strike, dropped as low as about 20 percent.

HEADLINE: Japanese Still Fear Trade Tensions With U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 27

 BODY:
A flurry of recent trade accords between the United States and Japan appears to have arrested a deterioration in the two countries' relationship. But the sense of relief in Tokyo is diminished by deep worries about the future.
The reason is that none of the agreements are expected to make a large dent in America's $50 billion trade deficit with Japan, according to both Japanese and American officials and trade experts.
Japanese officials said they were pleased with President Bush's decision not to cite Japan this year for unfair trading practices under ''Super 301'' of the tough 1988 trade law, which calls for sanctions against those cited. 
But they remain anxious about what may lie ahead. One reason is that the yen's steep decline in relation to the dollar in recent months is widely expected to jeopardize the gains made in the negotiations by lowering the price of Japanese products overseas and increasing the price of American exports to Japan. Indeed, the deficit worsened last month, after some improvement in the last year.
 
New Troubles Feared
 The concern in Japan, therefore, is that the trade frictions may have lifted only temporarily, and that deeper tensions are bound to return.
''We have not entered any kind of new era because of these agreements,'' said a senior Japanese negotiator. ''Just as we have been pestered by the American trade people day after day and week after week, so we will be pestered again. Our endurance is down to the barest of threads.''
When the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, cited Japan last year under Congressional pressure, it caused enormous strains with Tokyo. Japan at first refused to negotiate on the issues cited by Mrs. Hills, but eventually it did so, reaching an accord this week on the last of three major items on the American agenda, wood products. Japan agreed to streamline certification procedures and building codes.
The wood products accord built on two earlier, but smaller, agreements providing increased access for American satellites and supercomputers. Altogether, the accords are far below $2 billion in trade volume, a tiny fraction of the trade deficit.
 
A Spurt in Imports
 Indeed, although American exports to Japan have risen in recent years, American imports - particularly automobiles, consumer electronics and machinery - have risen twice as fast.
Japanese officials say they feel lingering bitterness at the way they had to negotiate with the United States under the threat of sanctions, a principal tool of the Super 301 clause.
Japan viewed the Super 301 action as coercive, unilateral and illegal. Mrs. Hills was understood to have been advised by many American negotiators not to use it again this year. The United States Ambassador, Michael H. Armacost, said this week that he thought more progress could be made now in a quieter atmosphere, free of recriminations over unilateral threats by Washington.
But he also acknowledged that foreign pressure, known as ''gai-atsu'' in Japanese, does seem to produce results. ''It is undeniably apparent that much of the movement has come near these deadlines,'' Mr. Armacost said.
Japanese politicians and bureacrats contend, however, that American pressure cannot work again. In the future Japan will contest the legality of Super 301 in international trade forums and refuse to negotiate.
 
'Increasing Irritation'
 ''Within Japan there is increasing irritation among the Japanese people vis-a-vis the United States as a result of the latest talks,'' said Takujiro Hamada, a member of Parliament. ''My constituents are asking, 'Why should Japan do that much?' It is a matter of concern.''
How much Japan has done may be subject to debate. In one breakthrough, Japan agreed recently to revise its copyright law to protect foreign recordings made before 1978. But American negotiators say that the biggest lobbyist for this change was a Japanese businessman - Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony Corporation, which now owns CBS Records.
In another recent accord seeking to reduce so-called structural impediments to trade, Tokyo pledged to spend more on public works projects, ease regulations that protect Japan's small stores, lower Japanese land prices, crack down on collusive business practices and undertake other ''structural'' changes to improve access for imports. But trade officials say that the accord will be difficult to put into effect and that it may not lead to more sales of American products.
The trade problems lying ahead arise from new demands for American access to Japanese markets in semiconductors, construction contracts, telecommunications equipment and for a new product called amorphous metal.
 
Now for the Details
 ''The immediate problems seem now to have been sorted out,'' Mr. Armacost told a news conference on Thursday. ''But we've got to fill in a lot of very important details. As everyone knows in Government work, the devil is usually in the details.''
Japanese economists say, for instance, that the basic monopolistic behavior of business cartels, considered by Americans to be unfair, is considered by Japan to be both fair and legal.
''It's going to be very difficult to change, in a major way, our bilateral balance of trade,'' said Kazuo Nukuzawa, managing director of Keidanren, Japan's most powerful industrial trade association. ''The danger is if there is little or almost no reduction in the trade figures, and the United States links this result with Japanese sincerity or insincerity in implementing the structural changes.''

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Issues Rise a Bit

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities finished with slight gains yesterday after a brief advance early in the session gave way to profit taking.
Dealers attributed the early strength to a smaller-than-expected rise in the first-quarter gross national product that was reported before trading began in New York.
The Government said that the G.N.P. rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter of 1990, up from an increase of 1.1 percent in the last three months of 1989. But dealers said the market had expected a rise of closer to 2.5 percent for the first quarter. Any negative economic news is considered bullish for the fixed-income market because it lessens the fear of inflation and resultant higher yields on new debt offerings. 
 
Depressed by Inflation Gauge
 But the price gain partly eroded when attention apparently turned to the fixed-weight deflator, a major barometer of inflation, which was reported by the Commerce Department to have risen to 6.5 percent, from 5.5 percent in the last quarter of 1989.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether long-term bonds were offered at 94 21/32, up by 5/32, after rising as much as 22/32 early in the day. At 94 21/32, the long bond's yield was 9.02 percent, compared with 9.04 percent the day before and 8.93 percent a week ago.
Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 8 7/8 percent notes of 1992 rose 5/32, to 99 29/32, to yield 8.93 percent; the 8 1/2's of 1994 rose by 5/32, at 98 8/32, for a yield of 9.04 percent, and the long notes, the 8 1/2's of the year 2000, rose 5/32, to 96 16/32, to yield 9.03 percent.
''Given the fact that the fixed-income market is now predisposed to negative news, the size of the rise in the G.N.P. was quickly overshadowed by the deflator number,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at the Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Corporation. ''By midday, dealers and traders who hadn't left for the weekend were focusing on what the market considers will be a week of negative news.'' $31 Billion Expected On Wednesday, Mr. Ricchiuto added, the debt market expects the Treasury to announce an increase in the package of refunding issues that it plans to auction the next week. The market expects the Treasury to sell a total of at least $31 billion of notes and bonds, compared with $30 billion in the previous refunding.
The Treasury's recent practice has been to increase the amount of debt it auctions, partly as an indirect means of providing funds to bail out beleaguered savings and loan institutions. For example, the Treasury said yesterday that it planned to auction $10 billion of new one-year bills next Thursday. At the Treasury's last monthly auction of one-year bills, the sale amounted to $9.75 billion.
''Traders are also concerned about next week's series of Japanese holidays known as 'Golden Week,' which closes down much of Japan's financial market,'' Mr. Ricchiuto said. ''What trading does take place there during Golden Week often produces volatile price moves.''
 
Bracing for Job Figures
 The debt market is also bracing for next Friday's employment figures, which are expected to be swelled by the hiring of an estimated 400,000 full-time and part-time census takers. And because the national minimum wage was raised by 13.4 percent on April 1 for three million workers, Mr. Ricchiuto said, this might produce a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in hourly earnings.
Dealers said that continuing weakness in the stock market, with the Dow Jones industrial average down by 31.53 points yesterday and 50.90 points for the week, caused a shift of some funds to Treasury bills. The discount rate on the 90-day bills fell 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.77 percent; six-month bills lost 8 basis points, at 7.93 percent, and the one-year bills dropped by 10 basis points, to 7.93 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 31.53 as Bonds Offer Competition

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks sank yesterday in the wake of further uneasiness in the bond market, signs of rising inflation, heavy computerized selling and a move by many investors to higher-paying investments.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.53 points, to 2,645.05, its lowest level in nearly two months. For the week, the Dow dropped 50.90 points. 
Volume slumped to 130.63 million shares, from a weak 141.3 million the day before. Declines far outweighed advances, by 1,070 to 403.
 
Weighing the Yield
 In the credit markets, the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond actually fell slightly yesterday, to 9.02 percent, from 9.04 percent the day before. Still, the yield was ample enough to lure some investors from equities. And higher interest rates in general pose a threat to corporate performance, further discouraging investing in stocks.
The big news yesterday was the report that gross national product rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter, which was less than had been expected, and that an inflation indicator for the quarter showed an annualized gain of 6.5 percent.
The bond market briefly rallied early yesterday but then gave up most of the day's gains.
Hugh Johnson, the head strategist for the First Albany Corporation, contended that bond prices might slide further before stabilizing because economic data were pointing to a fairly strong economy, which would keep upward pressure on interest rates.
Even so, one group of money managers, known as asset allocators, was said to be selling stocks and putting the money into bonds.
Birinyi Associates said that program traders instituted eight ''sell'' programs that cumulatively lopped 40.80 points off the Dow yesterday. Two programs totaling 20 minutes alone clipped nearly 16 points.
Illinois Power topped the Big Board active list, falling 1, to 15, on volume of 3.2 million shares, after an examiner for the Illinois Commerce Commission offered a much smaller rate rise than had been requested.
Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle company, rose 1 5/8, to 46 1/8, after Investors Daily published a favorable article.
Black & Decker fell 2 3/8, to 13 3/4, on 1.5 million shares. The power-tool company said Daniel Carasso of Goldman, Sachs & Company had cut his rating and urged investors to sell.
McDonnell Douglas, the aircraft company, fell to a new low of 47 1/2 before ending at 47 5/8, down 3 1/2. Last week it reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profits.
Paramount Communications rose 5/8, to 47 7/8, in heavy trading after an article in Business Week magazine said Chris-Craft Industries might have a stake and might propose a friendly takeover. Paramount declined to comment.
In other moves, Graco, a pump company that earlier reported a rise in first-quarter profits, rose 1 5/8, to 22 1/2. Motel 6, rose 1 3/8, to 16, on new takeover rumors.
Teradata, a computer company, fell 4, to 24 1/2, on 2.2 million shares in the over-the-counter market. Kenneth J. Burke, an analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons of Baltimore, said that the company had reported a rise in profits but that its remarks on foreign business ''suggested trimming fourth-quarter estimates.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.81, to 329.11; the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading fell 3.08, to 417.98, and the Amex market-value index dropped 2.11, to 342.64.

HEADLINE: New England Bank Has Loss

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation yesterday announced a loss of $46.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $42.3 million, or 60 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
The company, which lost $1.1 billion in 1989, continues to be troubled by bad real estate loans in a weakening New England economy. 
Earnings were hurt by the need to add $151 million to its reserves for loan losses in the first quarter, up from a $108 million increase a year ago.
Earnings were also hurt by the need to pay higher interest rates on deposits to attract funds in the midst of its financial trouble.
Losses were partly offset by gains of $173 million from the sale of various assets, including its credit card business.
 
Following guidelines set by
Federal regulators, Bank of New Engalnd is in the midst of a reorganization and trying to raise more capital. As part of that plan, the company has contracted to about $24.9 billion of assets from $32.6 billion a year ago.
The company's stock slipped 12.5 cents a share yesterday, to $3.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Down As Mark and Yen Dominate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most major currencies yesterday in trading dominated by the West German mark and Japanese yen. News that inflation picked up this year initially caused heavy dollar buying but it tapered off by late morning.
Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded within a narrow range as most of the buying and selling was directed toward the mark and yen. 
''The day was dominated by cross trading, particularly the mark-yen,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston.
Traders snapped up dollars in the morning after the Government reported that inflation jumped 6.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, the steepest increase since a 7.7 percent advance in the fourth quarter of 1981.
Analysts said the report might prompt the Federal Reserve to pursue a tighter credit policy, which would lead to higher interest rates. Higher rates would increase returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to increase demand for dollars. But the buying enthusiasm soon waned. Traders apparently concluded that the central bank would not adjust its policy in the immediate future.
 
G.N.P. Figure Largely Ignored
 The inflation reading came in a report showing that the gross national product grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1990. That was in line with expectations and therefore had little impact on the dollar.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 159.08 Japanese yen, from 158.77 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell to 158.80 yen. In New York, the dollar climbed to 159.30 yen, from 159.23 late Thursday.
The British pound rose to $1.6360, from $1.6340 late Thursday. Sterling also strengthened in New York, rising to $1.6350, from $1.6342 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's quotes, were: 1.6775 West German marks, down from 1.6797; 1.4530 Swiss francs, down from 1.4575; 5.6290 French francs, down from 5.6355; 1,230.00 Italian lire, down from 1,231.75, and 1.16375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1603.
Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, were: 1.6755 West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.4560 Swiss francs, down from 1.4605; 5.6240 French francs, down from 5.6395; 1.8845 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8915; 1,228.00 Italian lire, down from 1,231.00, and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602.
Gold prices fell modestly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery was down 30 cents, to $373 an ounce, in an abbreviated session because of a communications problem.

HEADLINE: Druce's Overtime Goal Finishes the Rangers

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
James Patrick had referred to it as a buzz in the air. The not-entirely-unrealistic current of excitement concerned a run by the Rangers at the Stanley Cup, and it both lighted up people's imaginations and crackled inside Madison Square Garden.
There was, after all, no prohibitive favorite, no defending champion, no reason the Rangers couldn't dream like the other remaining National Hockey League teams.
The buzz went dead last night, and the Rangers, although they didn't go quietly, went into yet one more tenure of springtime unemployment when John Druce, the no-name who had become a nemesis, deflected in a goal 6 minutes 48 seconds into overtime to give the Washington Capitals a 2-1 victory and the right to represent the Patrick Division in the Wales Conference final. 
 
Capitals Make History
Druce, who has 12 goals in the playoffs, 9 of them in the five-game series against the Rangers, stuck his stick in front of John Vanbiesbrouck to redirect Geoff Courtnall's centering pass into the net.
The Capitals, who demonstrated the gifts of grit and passion throughout the series, accomplished with successive triumphs in overtime what had eluded them for their entire history as an organization and moved out of the Patrick Division.
In the Stanley Cup semifinals, the Capitals will play the Boston Bruins, who eliminated the Montreal Canadiens last night.
 
Sad Final Thought
For the Rangers, the defeat meant they would celebrate the 50th anniversary of their last Stanley Cup in the sorry but familiar solitude of the golf course, or in front of a television set.
''The only thought that went through my head when the puck went in was that it was over, everything was over,'' said Vanbiesbrouck, who may have played his finest game in four years in holding the Capitals to a single goal for more than 66 minutes. ''I don't think there was a guy in this room who didn't think we had a legitimate shot at the Stanley Cup.
''You finish first in the Patrick Division for the first time ever, and you think: Maybe, just maybe. And why can't you go to bed at night dreaming? I know I did.''
 
Relentless Opponent
Speaking of Druce, Vanbiesbrouck added: ''The guy had as good a series as a player can have in the National Hockey League, bar none. To come to terms with that is pretty tough.''
The Capitals made everything tough for the Rangers in the series. They outhit them in all three zones and in every game. They rocked them in the second and third games of the series, outscoring them by 13-4, knocking them off their feet and off their game plan. And then they devastated them with consecutive triumphs in overtime.
''I can't say enough about how well so many of them played,'' James Patrick said of the Capitals. ''Are they the better team? Right now, they are. Maybe a month ago they weren't, or a month from now they wouldn't be. But they are now. It was closer than a 4-1 series, but you certainly can't argue with the result.''
 
Short Ray of Hope
The result looked like it might be different when John Ogrodnick, a minute into the extra session, blasted a shot from the left wing.
Mike Liut, the Washington goaltender, blocked the puck with his right shoulder, but then had it crawl over his back and dribble down toward the goal line.
''I started getting excited again when I saw that,'' Ogrodnick said. ''I thought maybe I had a hope again.''
''We lost the series in Games 2 and 3,'' said Roger Neilson, the coach of the Rangers, who evened the close, bruising game with a goal by Normand Rochefort early in the third period. ''And in Games 3 and 4, we didn't get a break.''
 
Still More Injuries
Had they, though, other factors would still have made prevailing against the Capitals a long shot.
Darren Turcotte, the often deadly scoring center, broke a bone in his left foot in the second period and would have been lost for weeks.
And Mark Hardy, whose return to the defense had restored some strength to a beleaguered unit, re-injured his right ankle and probably would not have been of any use until next season.
''Funny things happen in the playoffs,'' Neilson said.

HEADLINE: Employers Balk at High Cost Of High-Tech Medical Care

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
In a dramatic illustration of the way rapid advances in medical care in the United States sometimes collide with the will to pay for them, an employer is objecting to a $1.25 million bill for a worker's spouse who became the first person to receive a new heart, liver and kidney in the same operation.
The 26-year-old patient, Cindy Martin, was an ebullient former high school cheerleader and executive secretary from Archbald, Pa. She died March 26 after almost four months in intensive care at Presbyterian University Hospital here.
''They did everything they could,'' said her husband, John. ''They tried to make her life better. But she suffered for four months in the hospital and nothing was really accomplished.'' 
Mrs. Martin was covered under the health insurance of her husband, a 31-year-old engineer at the Loral Corporation, a military contractor. Loral repeatedly declined to comment on the case, and the insurance company that administers Loral's health plan will say only that payment is being withheld because it is not satisfied with the billing information provided by the hospital.
 
Growing Number of Challenges
But physicians, benefits consultants and ethicists say a growing number of challenges to medical bills are part of a revolt by employers against soaring health care expenses that erode their profitability, competitiveness and ability to raise wages.
They say employers are increasingly asking whether they are overpaying for medical care, and even questioning whether in some cases the enormous cost of an operation might outweigh the benefits when the chances of prolonging a life seem small.
Most experts agree that taking heroic measures with little thought of costs is the American way of delivering health care, at least for those with comprehensive insurance. Economists estimate that advances in high-technology medicine contributed at least one-fifth of the 10.1 percent growth last year in spending on health care, costs that the Commerce Department says will exceed $660 billion in 1990. In 1980 such spending came to $248 billion.
The issue is only expanding, what with expensive advances that include transplants of not only organs but also bone marrow, whose supply is virtually unlimited, in contrast to organs. Other costly advances include heart bypass operations, computerized diagnostic scans and genetically engineered drugs.
While heroic medical efforts are well intended, some experts wonder whether, in cases where the chances of success are small, the money might better be used in ways that might benefit more people. Among them: preventive health measures like vaccinations and prenatal care, and cleaning up the environment.
Indeed, some countries like Britain and Canada and states like Oregon are trying to give priority to primary care. But where such policies are practiced, expensive high-technology medicine is rationed by budget constraints on hospitals and doctors.
Elsewhere, the ability of patients or their insurance companies to pay for costly medical care has rationed such care.
 
'Rationing by Price, Excluding the Poor'
 ''We have always been rationing by price, excluding the poor,'' said Dr. William B. Schwartz, a professor of medicine at Tufts University. ''The new phenomenon is non-price rationing, where you have Blue Cross but you can't get it anyway,'' he said, referring to certain types of health care.
In this country, a few experts would like to see guidelines that would determine when an operation's cost is not warranted, given its chance of success.
''We need an accountable body that could issue some sort of rules,'' said Arthur L. Caplan, who heads the University of Minnesota's Center for Biomedical Ethics. He suggests a ''government commission, which can come up with policies and guidelines that would govern experimental and innovative medical interventions.''
But Gail Wilensky, an economist who heads the Federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, said it would be ''very difficult, if not impossible, for this country to try to set up rules about who should not be able to have the use of medically beneficial technologies.''
The case of Cindy Martin encapsulates the difficulty of deciding not to go ahead with an attempt to save a life, even an extremely costly effort.
Mrs. Martin, who came from a family plagued by early deaths associated with heart disease, had already undergone a heart transplant in October 1985 at the hospital, a unit of the University of Pittsburgh's medical center. That procedure, which generally costs about $150,000 with follow-up care, was covered by her employer, the McKinney Products Company, a Scranton hardware maker.
John Martin said that after the first transplant, his wife returned to work for a time but that starting in 1987 she was ''constantly in and out of the hospital.''
Her doctors said that her heart was weakening and that a drug that transplant patients must take was destroying her liver and kidneys. ''She was a patient dying, with three organs failing,'' said Dr. Thomas Starzl, a prominent transplant surgeon.
He said the hospital had a commitment to Mrs. Martin in part because it provided her first transplant. ''The options were wash your hands or not abandon her,'' Dr. Starzl said.
The hospital said after the operation in December that Mrs. Martin might live five to 10 years. But surgeons acknowledge that even in a single-organ transplant, there is a 15 to 25 percent chance of death within months. If the operation fails and is repeated, the odds against the patient rise.
 
7 More Operations, And More Problems
 The Pittsburgh transplant doctors said they do not concern themselves with who will pay or how much, pulling back only in hopeless cases like advanced stages of cancer.
''If the patient understands the situation and wants to go ahead, my job is to deliver health care,'' said Dr. David H. Van Thiel, medical director of the University of Pittsburgh transplant group.
After the 21-hour three-organ transplant in early December, Mrs. Martin underwent surgery seven more times, her husband said. ''She encountered other problems, including pancreatitis; that almost killed her in December,'' he said.
Eventually she contracted hepatitis. Dr. Starzl said the doctors then considered providing yet another liver, which would have been her fifth transplant. He rejected the idea, and Mrs. Martin herself agreed, as did her family.
Her death was attributed to infections that often follow transplants.
Although the hospital declined to make the disputed bill available, it provided details of payments it receives from Blue Cross and Blue Shield, on average, for a $120,000 liver transplant when there are no complications.
The main items include $28,000 for hospital and intensive-care rooms; $20,000 to acquire a donor organ; $20,000 for surgeons, anesthesiologists, a radiologist, internist and neurologist; $15,000 for various tests, including radiology, ultrasound and CAT scans; $8,000 to administer blood; $7,000 each for use of the operating room and the pharmacy charges, and $4,000 each for anesthesia and pulmonary services.
In Mrs. Martin's case, many of the charges would have been multiplied. At least 36 people worked on her three successive transplants: 11 surgeons, 6 anesthesiologists, 15 nurses, a physician's assistant, 2 blood technicians and a liver technician.
 
113 Days Spent In Intensive Care
 There were also charges for the seven surgical procedures and 113 days in the intensive-care unit as the doctors struggled to save her.
John W. Paul, a vice president with the medical center, said the hospital had received approval from Loral's insurance administrator, the Cigna Corporation, before proceeding with the treatment. He added: ''They had people come in and do ongoing reviews. What is unusual is that on the basis of those two things, they didn't make payments.''
The Pittsburgh medical center, which is the nation's busiest transplant center, says enormous expenses are involved in such cases, including training and paying surgeons, nurses and other sophisticated support people.
''We can more easily justify our terribly expensive care because we are providing the most intensive and, in some cases, unique care for very ill patients,'' said Jeffrey Romoff, an executive vice president with the medical center.
Indeed, the medical center receives $110 million a year in Federal research money, half of its research budget.
But Cigna, like all health-insurance administrators, has been under pressure from employers to find ways to hold down medical costs. So it has insisted on inspecting the records in the Martin case to insure that the charges are valid before paying.
But the hospital refuses to permit an audit of its bills until payment is made.
 
$1 Million Question: Who Pays the Bill?
 ''The hospital has refused our repeated requests to have access to medical records and to do a hospital-bill audit,'' said Amy De Marco, a Cigna spokeswoman. ''We're talking about a customer's dollars'' and possibly the family's dollars.
Employers have sometimes refused to pay for high-cost procedures that they say are experimental and unproved. But Cigna said Mrs. Martin's coverage did not exclude experimental treatments and so this was not an issue in her case.
While Loral would not comment on its costs, the million-dollar bill could by itself raise the annual health-care bill by 3 to 5 percent for a company of its size, 12,000 employees. (A smaller company's costs would rise by an even higher percentage.) Meanwhile, Mr. Martin, who spent three years caring for the woman he began dating when she was 15, is in theory responsible for the portion of the hospital bill that exceeded the $1 million limit in Loral's employee health plan. But the hospital said it would ''take a very realistic look'' at his ability to pay.
''Sometimes we don't collect 100 percent,'' said Jane Duffield, a hospital spokeswoman.
What Loral and Mr. Martin do not pay, someone else might. The hospital could compensate by raising its rates for other customers, including patients covered by private and Government insurance, and by seeking more Government research money.
''The bottom line is: We all pay either through insurance premiums, out of pocket or in higher taxes,'' said Roger Evans, a senior researcher at Battelle Seattle Research Institute.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Lithuania Pays the Price And Acquires a Stoicism

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, April 28

 BODY:
By squeezing Lithuania's economic lifeline, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may have brought his conflict with the errant republic closer to compromise, but many Lithuanians say his embargo has had another, unintended effect: the quick maturing of an independent Lithuania.
From factory managers to taxi drivers, from the grocery stores to the President's office, Lithuanians say Mr. Gorbachev has unwittingly forced them to think more seriously about how they will live outside the paternalistic Soviet system.
In the short run, although the selective economic blockade now in its second week has not yet caused serious hardship here, it has concentrated the politicians' attention on the quest for a compromise.
Lithuanian political leaders realize that it is only a matter of weeks before their citizens begin to suffer. Mr. Gorbachev no doubt recognizes that Lithuania in misery would distract attention from his meeting next month in Washington with President Bush.
 
Way to Save Face
The appeal by France and Germany on Thursday for the republic to temporarily suspend enforcement of its March 11 independence declaration seems to have given both sides a face-saving way to the bargaining table. The Lithuanians can portray any concessions as a gesture to the European leaders rather than capitulation to the Kremlin's economic pressure. 
But the deeper effect of the sanctions, Lithuanians interviewed here say, appears to be quite the opposite from what Moscow intended. The blockade of fuel, industrial materials and other goods has unified Lithuanians more than ever in their feeling of alienation from Moscow and hardened their resolve to be free.
The layoffs and black market gasoline prices, Lithuanians say, have introduced market economics faster than the republic's leaders might have dared on their own. The workers raised with the security of the Soviet safety net are now getting a small lesson in unemployment and inflation and seeing that it is unpleasant but bearable.
An estimated 10,000 workers have been sent home from factories idled by the fuel embargo, and officials predict the number will triple in a week. But it will be several weeks before they exhaust unemployment benefits and begin to feel the pinch.
 
Encouraging Independence
The embargo has also spurred the independence Government on a search for direct economic ties with the West and with insurgent city councils and factories inside the Soviet Union.
Nothing much has come of it yet. A few factories have reportedly managed small freelance deals with neighboring Soviet republics, bartering bricks for a truckload of fuel oil or meat for machinery.
Nonetheless, Prime Minister Kazimieras Prunskiene said, people are beginning to calculate the real value of what they produce.
''Up to now our entire economic structure, everything we buy and everything we sell was based on Moscow,'' she said today. ''Now those connections are being demolished, not by us but by Moscow, and we are trying to manage on our own.''
Officials say the embargoes of oil, natural gas and now coal have has forced industrial managers to begin contemplating conservation, which never mattered when oil and everything else came from Moscow according to a plan.
Most striking, the showdown with Moscow has introduced a sobering note of pragmatism into the sometimes romantic politics of independence.
 
Kicking the Giant's Shins
From a distance, the Government of Lithuania sometimes resembles a comic opera, in which the amateur leaders of a pipsqueak republic kick the shins of the lethal giant next door.
In fact, judging from talks here with dozens of Lithuanians, their political leaders are playing out deep national feelings of pride and suspicions of the Soviet Union - feelings that are almost always locked behind a stoic Northern demeanor. But then there are such moments as the one when a woman suddenly bursts into tears in a crowded grocery store recalling her childhood in a Stalinist camp for Lithuanian deportees.
''Moscow does not understand why France is afraid of them, Germany is afraid of them, and little Lithuania is not afraid,'' said Virgilius Cepaitis, a member of Parliament and a fervent nationalist. Mr. Gorbachev, he adds, ''seems to forget that from 1944 to 1953 we fought against the Soviets. Longer than Vietnam.''
The Lithuanians' intense national pride and deep mistrust of the Soviet Union are embodied in the republic's president, Vytautis Landsbergis, a musicologist whose public pronouncements sometimes seemed to flow from a kind of mystic nationalism.
 
A Visceral Distaste
Mr. Cepaitis, who works closely with the Lithuanian President and shares his visceral distaste for the notion of placating Moscow, talks of the conflict with Mr. Gorbachev as a climactic battle, one which will speed the demise of a doomed Soviet system.
''Moscow only understands one language, the language of strength,'' Mr. Cepaitis said.
''We understand that this is a big inconvenience for the whole world,'' said Mr. Cepaitis, wearily acknowledging the Western views that Mr. Gorbachev's stability outweighs Lithuania's liberty, but suggesting that the collapse of the Soviet Union would be a blessing. ''It is our duty to the world to destroy this empire.''
In the new world of Lithuanian politics, this strain of messianic nationalism struggles with a more conventional political pragmatism.
While few deny that Mr. Landsbergis represents the aspirations of many Lithuanians, many questioned his political tactics, his seemingly boundless moral stubborness that could not be more remote from the cut-a-deal politics of Mr. Gorbachev.
By most estimates about one-third of the Lithuanian Parliament shares Mr. Landsbergis's reluctance to compromise. Another third is loyal to Mr. Landsbergis, but ambivalent about his tactics. The remaining third, while no less committed to independence, supports the idea of dealing more flexibly with Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Gain for Compromise
Arvydas Juozaitis, a young politician who dropped out of the leadership of the Lithuanian independence movement because ''I personally don't trust feelings in politics,'' said this week that he believed the conflict with Moscow may embolden the pro-compromise faction.
''The absolute majority of Lithuanians are not satisfied with the Landsbergis position, but at the same time the absolute majority does not see how to overcome what they have already done,'' said Mr. Juozaitis, who caused a stir last month with an article calling the election of Mr. Landsbergis ''a historic mistake.''
''The support for Landsbergis is still strong because there is no clear alternative program,'' he said.
Eduardas Vilkas, one of the most influential members of the group favoring compromise, said he senses that Mr. Landsbergis is moving slowly toward a more conciliatory stand.
Mr. Vilkas favors a six-month moratorium on the independence declaration, accompanied by a guarantee from Mr. Gorbachev to honor Lithuania's sovereignty afterward.
''Inflexibility is also a kind of strategy, but I do not think it is the right one,'' he said. ''We can hold out against economic sanctions for quite a long time. A lot of people are prepared to ride it out to the end. But there is no purely economic solution to the blockade, unless we learn to live without oil.''
 
Caring About Neighbors
Mr. Vilkas said Lithuania will never be safely free until people in the Soviet Union themselves have absorbed enough democracy to care about their neighbors.
''I used to think the democratization of Russia would take three to five years, but it is happening much more quickly,'' propelled by the example of Eastern Europe.
''It is dangerous to live with angry neighbors,'' said Mr. Vilkas, explaining why Lithuania has an interest in Mr. Gorbachev's fate.
''The position of the West is understandable, because the risk to the world is great,'' he said. ''If there is serious instability in the U.S.S.R., this will not be simply the civil war of 1917. Now it is a question of nuclear weapons, atomic power stations, chemical factories. All of this represents a global danger.''

HEADLINE: Concern Rises Over the Cost Of Statehood for Puerto Rico

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28

 BODY:
Although supporters say legislation authorizing Puerto Ricans to decide the status of their commonwealth is likely to pass the Senate this year, there is growing concern in Congress over the potential costs of statehood.
Approval of a bill authorizing a Puerto Rican plebiscite is predicted by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee. That panel held a hearing on Thursday to discuss the economic impact of any change in Puerto Rico's status. President Bush, who has expressed a preference for Puerto Rican statehood, has urged Congress to pass the bill. 
But some lawmakers are alarmed by the projected cost of statehood to United States taxpayers, $2 billion, and by the prospect of phasing out tax inducements now provided to those who invest in businesses on the island.
 
Warnings on 2 Fronts
The cost of bringing Puerto Rico's social welfare programs up to the level of other states' would be borne by the Federal Government. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said at the hearing that the Administration must say where the money would come from.
In a report prepared for Mr. Bentsen, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that if Puerto Rico became a state its growth would be slowed by subjecting United States companies to Federal taxation on profits earned on the island.
Supporters of statehood say any economic losses would be more than offset by the stability of joining the union. Pointing out that Hawaii grew rapidly after it was admitted as a state, they argue that statehood would provide the basis for economic advances.
Many opponents of statehood say Puerto Rico's future would be better served by an ''enhanced'' and more flexible commonwealth.
In recent opinion polls, Puerto Ricans favoring statehood lead those who want it to keep commonwealth status. Adherents of independence, while influential among Puerto Rican intellectuals, have fared poorly in elections and polls.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, called for passage of the bill before the Senate panel and chided the House for not acting on a version of it. Ron de Lugo, the Delegate from the Virgin Islands who heads the House subcommittee responsible for island affairs, said a draft bill before his panel was awaiting an agreement from the three factions in Puerto Rico - those favoring statehood, continued commonwealth status and independence.

HEADLINE: Mistrial Declared in Case of Congressman

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, April 28

 BODY:
A mistrial was declared Friday in the bank fraud trial of Representative Harold E. Ford after the jury said it was hopelessly deadlocked.
''I'm hopeful now that I can put this episode behind me,'' said Mr. Ford, a 44-year-old Democrat from Memphis. 
But United States Attorney John Gill said in an interview from Knoxville that the case would be retried.
Mr. Ford was accused of taking $1 million in loans that prosecutors said he was never expected to repay. The loans came from Jake Butcher and C .H. Butcher Jr., brothers whose banking chain went out of business in 1983 in one of the nation's worst bank collapses.
The foreman of the jury, H. O. Robinson, reported the deadlock after Federal District Judge Odell Horton dismissed one juror for failing to disclose a past felony conviction. That development did not figure in the mistrial, lawyers said, because the jury could have continued deliberating with 11 members.
Mr. Ford was charged with 19 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud and mail fraud. The only black member of Congress from Tennessee, he complained after his indictment that he was the victim of racism, an allegation the Government has denied.

HEADLINE: Man Says He Put Dead Friend Outside His E. 68th St. House

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
The police were awaiting autopsy results yesterday after a man said he had left the body of a friend outside his brownstone on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
The friend , Lourie Sue Rosenthal, 29 years old, of Jamaica, Queens, apparently died late Wednesday or early Thursday in the apartment of a former Buildings Department official, a senior police investigator said.
The cause of death has not yet been determined, said a spokeswoman for the Chief Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove. 
The former official, Peter Franconeri, who resigned this month effective on Friday as an assistant commissioner, told the police that the woman visited him on Wednesday night, the authorities said. The investigator said Mr. Franconeri had told the police that when he went to sleep, Miss Rosenthal was still in the apartment at 36 East 68th Street and that when he woke up several hours later she was dead. He said that, in a panic, he dragged her downstairs and left her.
 
From Office to Station House
The body was found after 8:55 A.M., when the police received an anonymous call to the 911 emergency telephone number. The police said they believed Mr. Franconeri was the caller.
When the police arrived, Miss Rosenthal, who had lived with her parents in Queens, was lying near the trash cans in front of the brownstone, dressed in jeans and a cotton blouse. Her handbag with identification was nearby.
Detectives notified Miss Rosenthal's parents, who gave them Mr. Franconeri's beeper number, which was written in the woman's address book. Investigators called Mr. Franconeri, who was at his job as an $83,459-a-year official in charge of centralized inspections, largely elevators and boilers. He went voluntarily to the 19th Precinct station house for questioning about 4 P.M. and met with detectives until midnight, when he was released.
A spokesman for the Buildings Department, Vahe Tiryakian, said Mr. Franconeri had been with the department about 10 months and that his resignation had nothing to do with the events of Thursday morning.
 
'Our Only Daughter'
''This other matter is nothing work- related,'' Mr. Tiryakian said. ''It's a matter of his private life, and it took us by surprise.''
Mr. Tiryakian said the department was restructured several weeks ago, and Mr. Franconeri's duties were distributed among other officials. ''His resignation was expected for some time,'' Mr. Tiryakian said.
Miss Rosenthal's mother, Seil, said her daughter had known Mr. Franconeri for about a year. Mrs. Rosenthal said her daughter, who was unemployed, called her on Wednesday night, apparently from Mr. Franconeri's apartment, and complained that she felt ill. She told her mother that she wanted to take a nap and would return home shortly.
''She's our only daughter,'' Mrs. Rosenthal said. ''I don't know how I will ever get over this.''

HEADLINE: Weicker's Senate Successor Wins Rapid Prominence

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut narrowly won election in 1988, it was widely considered a fluke, a victory that reflected a rejection of the three-term Republican incumbent, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., more than widespread support for the state's lesser-known Democratic Attorney General.
But in the last 16 months, Mr. Lieberman has become one of the more prominent and visible new members of the Senate, winning praise from Democrats for his grasp of environmental issues and from Republicans for his support of an aggressive foreign policy and a cut in the capital gains tax.
Perhaps more than any political issue, though, Mr. Lieberman has been applauded by members of both parties for his engaging personal skills, particularly since he succeeds Mr. Weicker, who was regarded by many as a brash and enigmatic loner in a legislative body as courtly and cliquish as a country club.
''The Senate is a great forum, great issues are debated, but it is ultimately 100 people,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Your ability to get things done is dependent on the quality of your goals, the quality of your argument and also the ability to develop mutually respectful working relationships with your colleagues.'' 
 
Environment Is Cornerstone
Thus far, Mr. Lieberman has made his greatest mark on environmental legislation. Aside from attacks on Mr. Weicker's effectiveness, environmental issues were the cornerstone of Mr. Lieberman's 1988 campaign.
The Senator has urged the Environmental Protection Agency to create a Long Island Sound office and obtained $2.4 million for two studies of the Sound by the E.P.A. and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Protecting the Sound is perhaps the largest environmental issue in Connecticut.
''He has done an excellent job in terms of Long Island Sound,'' said Christopher Percy, president of the Sounds Conservancy, a private nonprofit agency.
In the recent Clean Air Act compromise, Mr. Lieberman helped create a regional organization to monitor air pollution and enforce regulations in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
 
'Mastering the Fine Print'
''Joe demonstrated a real dedication toward mastering the fine print of Clean Air amendments, the kind of work that doesn't get much attention but commands respect from his colleagues,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana and chairman of the Environmental Protection subcommittee.
Senator Lieberman also introduced strong oil spill liability legislation, parts of which were included in the Senate bill approved last year. And he played a large role in legislation that led to a voluntary agreement by Uniroyal Chemical Company of Middlebury, Conn., to withdraw the ripening agent Alar from any use on food, after it was linked to cancer in laboratory animals.
''I have found Joe Lieberman to be a valuable ally,'' said Senator Harry M. Reid, a Democrat of Nevada and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Toxic Substances, Environmental Oversight, Research and Development. ''He's tough, fair and doesn't settle for easy answers. When my committee was leading the fight to ban Alar, Joe was right there.''
Much of Mr. Lieberman's environmental work was accomplished because of his seat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, an appointment he sought and won largely because of his support in helping to elect Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine the Democratic majority leader. He also sits on the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Small Business Committee.
 
Broke With Party Leaders
Mr. Lieberman, however, broke with Mr. Mitchell and the party leadership in seeking to attach several stricter amendments to the Clean Air Act, including one that mandated tougher automobile emission standards.
Mr. Lieberman stepped out of line with his party on other occasions. Two months before the United States invasion of Panama in December, he was one of only three Senate Democrats to support a failed amendment by Republican Senator Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina that authorized President Bush to use force to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. He also is one of nine Democrats in the Senate who have called for diplomatic recognition of Lithuania. ''To me this is a moral crisis, a critical moment in history,'' he said. ''We've made this promise to the Lithuanian people, and it's not a time to mumble - it's a time to act.''
His independent streak was noticeable in the annual ratings of Senators made by various organizations, particularly in comparison with ratings for Mr. Weicker, a liberal who was often at odds with his own party.
The American Conservative Union gave Mr. Lieberman a rating of 32 out of 100; the average rating for Democratic senators from the East was an 11. ''Lowell Weicker got a zero sometimes,'' said Robert Billings, the legislative director for the organization.
The liberal Americans for Democratic Action, however, gave Mr. Lieberman a 75 out of 100. The National Journal, an influential political magazine, labeled him as the most conservative of all Eastern Democratic senators and less liberal than five Democrats from the South.
''We think we are going to get a vote from him now and again,'' said Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican of Minnesota. ''Not as often as it should be, but what can you do?''
 
Favored Capital-Gains Tax Cut
The Senator was also one of only six Democrats who supported a cut in the capital-gains tax rate, which was adamantly opposed by party leaders and defeated by the Senate last year.
Mr. Lieberman, however, does not always take a conservative, free-market approach to business and economic matters. For example, he introduced legislation last year that would allow state and local governments to re-regulate cable television prices.
He also helped draft a bill that would create housing for 135,000 low-income and homeless families by rehabilitating existing buildings. That legislation, which is pending, would allow homeless families and individuals to move into rental apartments without first posting a security deposit.
 
National Park in Connecticut
Of particular interest to Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman has proposed legislation to create Connecticut's first National Park at Weir Farm in Ridgefield and Wilton. He also obtained $630,000 for the McKinney Wildlife Refuge, in the Norwalk Islands in the Sound, and $7 million for Lyme disease research.
Mr. Lieberman's constituent service program includes a Senate office in a van that travels around the state to help residents tell staff members their concerns.
Since taking office, Senator Lieberman has not spoken to Mr. Weicker, who is now running for governor as an independent third-party candidate.
Keeping a 1988 campaign promise, Mr. Lieberman has not accepted honoraria or speaking fees. He also has not missed a roll call vote on the Senate floor, an issue on which he frequently criticized Mr. Weicker.
''It's been a very exciting and satisfying year for me,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Look, I'm just plain thrilled to be here. In some senses, I consider it a miracle that I'm here, and I'm grateful for the miracle, and I want to make the most of it.''

A Teacher's Edict Breaks Tradition On Class-Cutting

DATELINE: WORCESTER, Mass.

 BODY:
William Koelsch, a professor of history and geography at Clark University, last week became the first faculty member to break with an 87-year-old tradition, approved by the administration, that let students skip classes on one day of the term.
Taking his cue from Winston Churchill, Professor Keolsch said, ''Up with this I will not put,'' as he informed his classes in a memorandum that any absences on Spree Day would be tantamount to missing a one-hour examination and would lower the absent student's final grade a letter.
His stand put him at loggerheads with the administration. 
The date of Spree Day, which celebrates the arrival of spring, is kept secret until students awake to find the campus transformed into a playground. Last Tuesday's Spree Day featured a hot-air balloon, giant slides, popcorn machines and a carnival.
Historically no classes are held on Spree Day. But this year many administrators and teachers were disgruntled to learn that the administration had approved a date that fell near the semester's end, leaving them little time to reschedule review sessions for final exams.
''The issue here is not Spree Day,'' said Professor Koelsch, himself a Clark alumnus. ''It's Spree Day held on the last week of classes.'' The timing, he said, suggested that the administration placed Spree Day above academic priorities.
Mona Olds, the dean of students, said in an interview that ''the administration respects Spree Day as a tradition,'' and that students who believed they had received an unfair grade because they were absent from class could appeal - first to the teacher involved, then to the head of the teacher's department and finally to the dean of the college.
Daniel DiSano, a senior in economics from Melrose, Mass., and co-chairman of the 10-student Spree Day committee, said that the April 24 date had been approved last month by the offices of the dean of students and the provost, with the understanding that teachers would be notified through department heads so they could prepare.
The scheduling became an issue in the wake of Professor Koelsch's class memo. At a meeting on April 20, teachers adopted without dissent a motion to ''accommodate the traditional sense of collegiality between students and faculty and wherever possible to make accommodations for Spree Day.'' But the motion left it to individual professors to act as they saw fit.
Edward Dzialo, a junior in history and theater from Fall River, Mass., who is in Professor Koelsch's class, said the decision to require attendance had suprised him, since he considered the professor a ''Clark enthusiast.'' Mr. Dzialo said it was not fair that Professor Koelsch should hold students accountable for an administration decision.
Other class members agreed. A sophomore, Joseph Rodio from Webster, Mass., who is majoring in history, said, ''It's not right to punish us for other people's mistakes.''

A Major Imperiled By Popularity And Understaffing

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
A shortage of professors and a growing number of students is leading the University of Chicago to suspend a program started after Watergate called Politics, Economics, Rhetoric and Law.
The program combines the four areas with junior and senior research papers. Recent topics have included a study of integration at universities near here, the rhetoric of the Little Rock, Ark., desegregation crisis and the social structure of the southeast side of Chicago. 
Students and faculty members met last week on the possibility of reviving the major. The program, with 28 students, had 40 applications for seven spots last year, said its chairman, Dennis Hutchinson, a professor of legal history.
''It's a question of manpower,'' he said, noting that three professors ''present at the creation of PERL'' would retire next year.
Although Professor Hutchinson and many students agree that the papers, which require two professors as readers, are ''the heart and soul of PERL,'' finding the professors became a challenge.
 
Called Too 'Time Consuming'
''More and more people have too many other things that they're doing to take on something this time consuming,'' said Charles Gray, a history professor and the master of the new collegiate division, which oversees the program.
Four classes a year were required. Mr. Gray said in-class teaching was just the beginning. In addition to preparing lectures and grading papers from the five or six courses he usually teaches, he said he supervised senior papers and tutorials and advised graduate students.
Professor Hutchinson, who is teaching four classes this year, noted that one has almost 100 students. Neither he nor Mr. Gray uses teaching assistants to grade papers. ''I'm lucky if I get five hours a week for research during the school year,'' Mr. Hutchinson said.
The college has grown from 2,981 students in 1984 to more than 3,300. ''Why is the political science department overburdened with its own papers?'' Professor Hutchinson asked. ''Because we have more students than we did five or six years ago.''
 
'Don't Have Enough Professors'
He added that the problems confronted other interdisciplinary majors, because many professors have work in their disciplines. A member of the program faculty, Wayne Booth, a professor of English, said some extradepartmental projects required professors to spend time on background research.
Jennifer Nessmith, a senior from Freeport, said: ''We simply don't have enough professors for all the students. We need to hire more.'' Ms. Nesmith said the program was one of the only majors here that allowed students to combine theory with practical concerns.
Eliminating the junior or senior paper would be a mistake, said Mary Johnston, a third-year student from Washington, adding, ''They're the best part of the program.''
Although projects ''do not always fit in comfortably with my schedule,'' said Barry Karl, a history professor who is frequently a reader, they are ''intellectually exciting and built on ideas.''
The suspension of the program ''will leave a noticeable hole in the sense of myself as a teacher here,'' he said.
Mr. Gray foresees a one-year hiatus and hopes to have a new program ''like PERL, only better'' by next spring. A new major would have to be ''less labor intensive,'' he said.
''I don't think it's going to be revamped,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. ''In two years it will be history.''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
WILLIAMS SHOCKED AMERICAN THEATER INTO MATURITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD GILMAN; Richard Gilman, the author of ''The Making of Modern Drama'' (Da Capo), is a critic and professor at the Yale School of Drama.

 BODY:
The story is told that when Andre Gide was asked who was France's greatest writer he replied, ''Victor Hugo . . . helas.'' In the same way, the answer to a question about America's best playwright might be, ''Eugene O'Neill (or, to some minds, Tennessee Williams) . . . alas.'' Though both responses express sorrow, the cases are different. Gide's point was that Hugo, a forceful but not especially profound or original writer, was so wrapped in the apparel of literary fame that he dwarfed all other reputations, whereas the point about O'Neill and Williams is that our history of writing for the stage, writing seriously, is so thin and insubstantial compared to Europe as to make them our masters by default.
The two suffer from the invidious effects of such comparison, particularly among those we might call the theater intelligentsia. In both cases, their gifts existed in the midst of grave deficiencies, embarrassments of an intellectual and esthetic order. In the oeuvre of both, very few plays measure up to, indeed most fall drastically short of, the standards established by the dramas of Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Shaw, Pirandello, Brecht and Beckett. 
Yet why play the rating game? In the matter of Williams, about whom we've all been reminded by the presence on Broadway of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' with Kathleen Turner (and earlier this season by Peter Hall's production of ''Orpheus Descending'' with Vanessa Redgrave), he should not be allowed to drift off, a fringe figure, a dubious case, to some third or fourth tier of theatrical renown. For it's not too much to say that Williams brought American drama to maturity in a way that not even O'Neill had done. Williams once said he wanted to air out all those ''closets, attics and basements of human behavior,'' which is just what he succeeded in doing. He brought a darker, more violent side to our stage imaginings, brought the unconscious into prominence; after him there was no clear artistically obnoxious line between normal and abnormal, no excuse for evasion. One specific triumph was that he changed the way women are portrayed on our stage, offering us articulate and powerfully erotic beings where the ordinary range had been between charmers and bitches.
It's hard to keep in mind that Williams was once our most scandalous dramatist, ''the one,'' as he wryly said of himself, ''who writes all those dirty plays.'' I suppose there are still a few moralists around who make faces at the mention of his name, but otherwise his ''disturbing'' subjects have long since been assimilated into theatrical and public consciousness, though the cannibalism of ''Suddenly Last Summer,'' spoken of in the play and absurdly made partly visible in the film version, has hardly become a common theme.
But the rest of it, the hunger for erotic contact (but seldom simply for the erotic), the secrets of lust, the range of sexual phenomena from adultery to sadomasochism, the castrations and abortions, above all the homosexual dispositions and implications, sometimes disguised as a concession to the times as heterosexual arrangements (well, Proust did that magnificently, too) - all this no longer has any power to shock. That is why it's so important to remember, or understand for the first time, the dismally cautious, safely ''liberal'' bloodless atmosphere of the American theater at the time - the late 40's, early 50's - Williams made his dangerous, irreverent appearance. Drama has been called the ''impure'' art and if Williams's is notably impure, the best of it retains, or more accurately seems to have regained, a legitimate place in our affections and esteem, whatever the skepticism of the absolutists. After a long period of decline, the result primarily of the series of inferior and sometimes catastrophically bad plays he kept desperately turning out for the last 20 years of his life, his reputation, insecure as it continues to be, appears to be on the rise.
Over the last six or seven years since his death in 1983 three or four dozen productions of his plays have been put on by theaters around the country, a new biography by Virginia Carr, the biographer of Carson McCullers, will be published by Scribner's in the next couple of years and an exhaustive two-volume literary biography by Lyle Leverich is in the works. There have been several large-scale television productions (the most recent an unfortunate ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' last fall with Elizabeth Taylor) and he has returned to Broadway in considerable triumph, or at least with much fanfare, with ''Cat,'' a production that though overlong and unevenly acted, allows the text to survive its playing.
The way that a text can be said to ''hold up'' is that it resists being confined to its period, something Williams's less harsh detractors like to do with nearly all his plays; the harshest deny him any virtues at all except perhaps for a wan exoticism. What may date in Williams are details, local references, the catch phrases and iconography of an era, but not, in his best or better work, his deep motifs, his obsessions, the singularities of his vision, his having written for actors roles with real weight and intensity. Even less likely to date are the pleasures his dramatic language can now and then give - unsurpassed by an American dramatist.
The consensus is nearly absolute as to what his best works are: ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1945) and ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1947). After that, opinion tends to splinter. In my own case I see a little below those two plays another quite admirable pair: ''Suddenly Last Summer'' (1958) and ''The Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' (1964), Williams's rewriting of and improvement on ''Summer and Smoke.'' And below them, managing to hang on to some minor territory of theatrical permanence, or semi-permanence, ''Orpheus Descending,'' ''The Rose Tattoo'' and ''Cat,'' with ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' and ''Night of the Iguana'' asking us to look as kindly as we can on their severe frailties, and ''Camino Real'' remaining visible as a noble if almost totally failed experiment.
Not surprisingly the best of Williams's plays are the best constructed - their dramatic progression marked by economy, coherence and the absence of wayward issues competing ruinously for the playwright's attention. They are also the ones most free from intellectual fog, into which Williams, like O'Neill, was so prone to disappear.
And they're freest, too, from false lyricism, a vocabulary of pseudo-poetic longing and pained amorousness and from flaccid melancholy, sorrowfulness so free-floating it can attach itself to nothing instructive. (Williams, who had rather more self-awareness than he's usually credited with, once told an interviewer that his chief debility ''has been a tendency to what people call . . . to poeticize, you know.'') The last hapless plays, with their angels, ghosts, apparitions and avatars of Williams himself as suffering poet and doomed lover, are full of these qualities of maimed dramatic speech, though they can crop up in his work at any time.
But when he's using his ear well (the ''ear'' in a good playwright, or novelist for that matter, is never for the details of speech but its rhythms) and his emotions are under artistic control, the language in his plays is as inventive and evocative as any we've had. Blanche Dubois's painful, self-serving memories, Tom's speech in ''The Glass Menagerie'' about going to the moon, or Val's in ''Orpheus Descending'' about the bird that sleeps on the wing are characterized by a splendid fusion of imaginative verve and exact diction.
These examples, however, are dramatic high points, arias that anyone familiar with Williams will know. It's in the humbler speeches, dialogue that neither soars nor celebrates, that Williams's forever beleaguered mastery of language can best be heard. Out of a wealth of possibilities two little speeches from ''The Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' make the point.
One is by Alma after her father has told her of her mother's ''cold spite'' and that such women shouldn't get married. Alma: ''I know, but they do, they do. They are the ones that marry! The ones that could bring to marriage the sort of almost - transcendental tenderness that it calls for - what do they do? Teach school! Teach singing! Make a life out of little accomplishments.''
The other is by the father to Alma: ''Little things like that, an accumulation of them, Alma, little habits, little mannerisms, little - peculiarities of behavior - they are what get people known, eventually, as - eccentrics. And eccentric people are not happy, they are not happy people, Alma.''
The rhythms, the strategic repetitions, the exactly chosen emphases and beautifully functioning hesitations - all this quietly demonstrates Williams at his craftsmanlike best. But often in the last plays, Williams fell into dialogue of an almost hysterical incoherence, as in this outburst from ''The Red Devil Battery Sign'' (1975), perhaps his worst play: ''Yes! Human! To enter my life something human is special, this day, this night, this place, suddenly - you - human! Here! What?'' The speech is by a character called the Woman Downtown, whose abstract name suggests the Expressionistic influences (more broadly the dated avant-gardism) to which Williams came to succumb in his fever to get past the naturalistic limitations - as he, reluctantly, and others, cruelly, saw them - of the plays of his heyday. A late two-character short play, ''I Can't Imagine Tomorrow,'' has, for example, a woman called One and a man called Two, indicative of the ''experimental'' tics that more and more afflicted his writing.
The itch to do something technically ''new'' was likely the result of the scorn in which his later realistic plays were increasingly held by sophisticated critics. During the 50's, when Williams was flourishing, the European avant-garde - Beckett, Genet, Ionesco, Pinter - was seizing the imaginations of Americans concerned with the laggard condition of our dramatic art. And even those writers' (distant) American cousins, Edward Albee in his earliest work, Jack Gelber in ''The Connection,'' had begun to shift attention from Williams's ''old-fashioned'' dramas. But this old-fashionedness, the quality of bold sequential narrative and mimetic fidelity, is just what makes for Williams at his best.
If Williams maintains his place in our theater it's because his frequently elegant imagination is its own justification. To see ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' now is to become aware again of how that imagination worked. Proof that in Williams the erotic is seldom present for its own sake is abundant in ''Cat.'' Brick's anguish over his possible homosexuality, his and Maggie's marital Armageddon, are subsumed under a much larger and more complex rubric: that of ''mendacity,'' lying about oneself and to the self.
In Williams, sexual passions always conceal and at the same time give body to themes of besieged spirit, loss, anguish and the demands of moral integrity. The erotic is the scene of defeat and despair but also at times of affirmation, generosity. The ''heroes'' in his plays, I once wrote, are those who, however faulty or maimed in other realms remain fully human in this one; his ''villains'' are the envious, the vindictive, the converters of love into use.
Sometime in the 70's, the years of Williams's decline and despair, several students of mine made a pilgrimage to his house in Key West, Fla. They deeply admired his earlier work and had the crazy idea that they could convince him that he didn't have to keep trying to prove himself. ''You've done enough,'' they said. ''What we feel for you isn't going to evaporate.'' He was flattered, moved and defensive. He fed them and sent them on their way. Yes, their mission was naive, even foolish, but they were right: he did do enough.

The Milken Guilty Pleas
 
It began as a noble enterprise: Open up the credit markets to the daring and the imaginative, the untested companies snubbed by the ossified old firms that rule Wall Street. Rattle the complacent managers of the bloated corporations those older investment banks count as their clients. At times, the strivings of Michael R. Milken had all the romance of a revolution. But his financial career, if not his financial revolution, apparently ended in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday with his guilty pleas to six felonies carrying penalties and fines of $600 million. He admitted to cheating customers, rigging the market for some stocks and bonds and helping a friend illegally avoid taxes. A prison term is all but certain. How long might depend on whether a judge agrees with Mr. Milken's lawyers that the nation is better off for his efforts, or with regulators who say that criminality became the essence of his work. 
 
 
Arabs, Yen, Oil, Saks . . .
 
It is no fluke that Arab investors outbid the Japanese for Saks Fifth Avenue. Investcorp, whose shareholders have included several oil ministers, agreed last week to pay B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. of London $1.5 billion for the chain. Investment bankers were heard to say it was a ''full price'' - Wall Street talk for ''too much.'' A group including the Tobu Department Store Company of Japan and Saks's management bid only $1.25 billion. For the Japanese, the yen's depreciation has made American investments more expensive. If the yen were still 125 to the dollar, instead of 159, the Japanese could have as easily afforded $1.6 billion. With oil prices stabilizing and America's oil imports increasing, the Arabs are likely to ship more of their earnings to the United States. As David T. Mizrahi, editor of the Mideast Report, said, ''In the 70's, we had the Arab era. In the 80's, we had the Japanese era. Within two years, we're going to see the Arab era again.''
 
 
. . . And a Rebuff to Sir James
 
B.A.T. went through with the Saks auction even though it has been freed from a takeover threat. Sir James Goldsmith dropped his $21 billion bid for the conglomerate last Monday. To defend against his assault, B.A.T. had bought back stock, raised its dividend and agreed to sell several divisions. ''The bird would have been nearly carved,'' said an official of Sir James's investment group. But his withdrawal lessens the chances that American-style corporate carving and takeovers will spread across Europe.
 
 
Profits Up, Outlook Mixed
 
Corporate profits are getting a reprieve from a stronger economy. Economists say that first-quarter earnings, while not booming, are producing at least as many pleasant surprises as disappointments. Several computer and technology companies, like International Business Machines, which depend heavily on business investment, have come through well. Many traders were braced for a round of results as poor as the fourth quarter's. Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, says he didn't expect profits to rebound until later this year. Now, he says, rising interest rates and inflation might stall corporate performance in the second half.
 
*
 
Earnings reported last week were shaky, but special factors accounted for much of the news:
* Exxon profits down 29.3 percent to $1.28 billion after a one-time gain from an accounting change last year.
* RJR Nabisco, a $222 million loss from interest expenses, but strong operating profits.
* Sears, Roebuck profits down 58.8 percent to $106.3 million as the stores posted a loss.
* USX profits of $176 million, 40.5 percent lower with the steel division hardest hit.
* Time Warner, a $187 million loss due to interest expenses and the acquisition of Warner.
 
 
The St. Louis Sun Blues
 
Was it debt or was it the newspaper slump that killed the St. Louis Sun? Those gathered at the American Newspaper Publishers Association last week doubted Ralph Ingersoll 2d's newspaper would survive, but they were surprised it failed so soon. On Wednesday, he published his 213th and last issue. It is easy enough to point to his own particular problems - staggering debts, a slack local economy, slow circulation gains and a more secure competitor in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But some analysts say Mr. Ingersoll's tabloid was also swept away by the ills of the industry. ''The newspaper business is going through a very, very severe downturn, and there doesn't seem to be any upturn in sight,'' said Kenneth T. Berents, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons.

INTERNATIONAL
 
Tokyo Ups the Holiday Ante
 
The Japanese Government has finally found a way to get obsessively dedicated workers out of their offices: pack the calendar with more holidays. Tomorrow will be Japan's first Greenery Day. The holiday is meant to encourage the planting and cultivation of natural vistas celebrated in Japan's art but rare in its cities. It was marked as Emperor Hirohito's birthday until he died last year. Now, the birthday of his son, Emperor Akihito, is being celebrated as well, on Dec. 23. A spokesman for the Japanese consulate in New York had difficulty listing all the official holidays. He came up with 13, three more than the Government and several more than most businesses observe in the United States. Many of the days have high-minded themes - Culture Day and Exercise Day, Children's Day and Respect the Elders Day - that encourage workers to think of the observances as virtual obligations.
 
 
Deciphering the Soviet Economy
 
Talk about shifting international alliances. When it comes to estimating Soviet economic strength, some Soviet economists said at a conference in Washington last week, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Kremlin are, in effect, on the same, overly optimistic team. The intelligence agency says the Soviet gross national product is half that of the United States; try 28 percent, said a Soviet economist. And to the Soviet Government's claim that its agricultural output is 85 percent of America's, another Soviet economist estimated 55 percent. Soviet officials have been so successful at hiding their true economic statistics, its seems, that now neither they nor the C.I.A. can find them.
 
 
Those Generous Germans
 
What's a few billion marks between old friends? To smooth the process of reunification, West Germany has offered to buy East German marks at a generous, one-to-one rate - at least for wages, pensions and some household savings. The black market rate is five to one. Many West German economists fear the plan's inflationary expense.
 
 
 
ECONOMY
 
 
Interest Rates: Inevitably Up?
 
A sharp rise in an inflation index could force the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates. An inflation measure used to adjust the gross national product rose at a 6.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the steepest increase since 1982. The Commerce Department also reported on Friday that the G.N.P. itself rose 2.1 percent - healthy, but not as large a gain as economists had recently predicted. Signs of renewed inflation and growth pushed rates on long-term Treasury bonds past 9 percent last week for the first time in a year. With both inflation and the G.N.P. growing faster than targeted, the Fed is likely to raise the Federal funds rate one quarter of 1 percent in the next couple of months, said Roseanne Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''They are on record as pursuing an anti-inflationary policy, and if they don't do something, they lose credibility.''
 
 
Playing the Derby Nags
 
Battered by the bond market? Sick of stocks? For some less-risky investments, and maybe some equine arbitrage, check out next Saturday's card at Churchill Downs. Value investors at the Kentucky Derby might favor the poor boy from the tropics, Mister Frisky. A $15,000 horse bred in Florida and raced in Puerto Rico, he swept all 16 of his starts - including the Santa Anita Derby, whose winners have gone on to victory in the Kentucky Derby two years in a row. Bettors who prize Kentucky heritage and breeding instead will lay their investments on Summer Squall. By Storm Bird out of the Secretariat mare Weekend Surprise, he was sold at the Keeneland auctions in Kentucky two years ago for $300,000. He returned there to win the Blue Grass Stakes on a track as muddy as a Marine training course. As the local favorite, Summer Squall is bound to be overbet at the track. The arbitrage-minded might take Mister Frisky there, then hedge by having friends wager for them on Summer Squall in New York, where Off-Track Betting has its own pool and its own odds.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Time to Test the Country Funds?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Single-country funds, the glamour stocks of the closed-end mutual fund group, have taken investors on a dizzying downhill ride since they peaked in mid-January. But some analysts say the overheated market has finally cooled, leaving good buys for speculators and people who want to fill the high-risk end of portfolios.
''The group is beginning to look quite reasonably valued and, in some cases, even cheap,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser, who said many funds in the group are trading at prices lower than the value of the stock in their portfolios.
Single-country funds, which invest in foreign equities, lost 27.1 percent between mid-January and mid-April, said Mr. Herzfeld, who specializes in closed-end fund investment and analysis. Closed-end funds trade on major exchanges like common stock, at a premium or discount to the value of the stock in their portfolios. 
Although country funds have always been the most volatile component of the closed-end fund industry, many investors were caught by surprise when the bottom fell out of the market this year. Disenchanted with wide price swings, many investors have bailed out. Others are having second thoughts, especially as they watch Europe's wobbly efforts to redefine itself.
Clearly, only investors with a strong appetite for risk should consider country funds, analysts warn. But there may be some big gains to be had. Last year, for example, four such funds - the Asia Pacific Fund, the Thai Fund, the Spain Fund and the Germany Fund - were among the top 10 performing shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The crash of the Tokyo market earlier this year has not affected single-country funds that invest in the Pacific rim, according to Steven M. Cress, senior analyst for closed-end funds at Prudential-Bache Securities. He noted that the Japan O.T.C. Equity Fund has been a spectacular performer this year and he expects the Pacific to be a solid performer at least through the end of the year.
He also recommends the R.O.C./Taiwan Fund, which is trading at a 28 percent discount while its counterpart, the Taiwan Fund, trades at a 15 percent discount. He says the discrepancy occurred because the established Taiwan Fund has paid out large capital gains distributions. He predicted that after the R.O.C./Taiwan Fund builds a track record, it will probably do the same, shrinking the size of its discount.
Mr. Herzfeld considers Southeast Asian countries to have some of the best growth rates in the world. One of his favorite funds is Asia Pacific, now trading at a 20 percent discount, compared with a 43 percent premium in January. He also likes the First Philippine Fund, which traded at a 34 percent premium in Janaury and is now at an 18 percent discount. He believes the Philippine economy will grow strongly this year.
The Turkish Investment Fund, which traded at a 2 percent premium in January but now is at a 32 percent discount, is another of Mr. Herzfeld's picks. The fund's portfolio manager is predicting that the Turkish stock market will rise sharply this year and Mr. Herzfeld thinks that would almost double the fund's price.
Much of the turbulence in the single-country fund market has centered on Europe. Market prices began their runup in mid-1989. Perestroika, the progress toward unifying Western Europe's trade and monetary policies, and the crumbling of the Berlin wall and the Communist bloc - all heightened investor interest in country funds.
At the turn of the year, only 24 funds were up and running and, overloaded with new money, they began trading at huge premiums. Underwriters soon fell over each other to set up new funds. Since the beginning of 1990, 11 new ones, most of them in Europe, have come to market, pulling the total to 35 - a 46 percent jump in only four months.
Four funds created to invest in companies in East and West Germany are doing business now and four more are in the works. The Germany Fund, created to back West German investment, traded at a 100 percent premium to its net asset value early this year, but now trades at a 3 percent premium.
Mr. Herzfeld especially likes the Future Germany Fund. Its price has dropped to about $14 a share from about $19 when it came to market in February at a 15 percent premium. The proliferation of Germany funds has put pressure on prices, but Mr. Herzfeld expects that to keep underwriters from launching similar issues. Once supply stabilizes - later this year, he thinks - prices of Germany funds should recover.
But Germany is not the only European country to warrant investor interest. Mr. Cress of Pru-Bache favors the Growth Fund of Spain, which is trading at a 9 percent discount while the the Iberian Fund and the Spain Fund trade at premiums. Mr. Cress says that the Spanish Government now is keeping to a tight monetary policy to control inflation. As inflation cools, interest rates should drop and that will let the Spanish market reflect its strong earnings growth, he said.
 
 
 
THE SWITCH IN FUNDS
In the early 1980's, investors flocked into money market funds as yields rose as high as 16 percent. In 1981, almost 80 percent of the people who invested in mutual funds owned money market funds - a level that has not been seen since.
But as rates fell - and the long bull market began - stock and bond funds outpaced money market funds. And despite the 1987 market crash, they continued to attract many more investors than money funds. Indeed, if rates stay stable and the stock market doesn't take a nosedive, investors will stay in stock and bond funds this decade, said Louis S. Harvey, president of Dalbar Financial Services, a Boston-based mutual fund research group. ''I think that we'll see a continuing movement into stock and bond funds because the returns are better,'' he said.
Stock fund investors have earned annual rates of return of just over 18.7 percent since 1980, Dalbar said, while bond funds averaged returns of 9.4 percent and money funds yielded 8.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Japan's Stubborn Overseas Bank

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
As Japan's longtime financial ambassador to the world, the Bank of Tokyo became used to seeing its fortunes mirror the international successes of corporate Japan. But in a striking example of how deregulation and competition are transforming the financial system here, this proud institution is now in the fight of its life.
The bank's century-old role as the engine for much of Japan's international growth has been eroded by the expanding foreign presence of much bigger and more aggressive Japanese rivals, like the Sumitomo Bank, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan. The bank has also been hurt by the loosening of the country's rigid financial regulations. The liberalization, for example, has ended its monopoly on the foreign-exchange business of Japanese corporations.
But most of all it is suffering for simply doing what it was designed to do: focus on overseas business and not worry about the home market. Its heavy international involvement made it vulnerable during the last two decades to the same financial turbulence that nearly ruined a number of American banks, leaving it with the same third-world debt problems, while it largely missed out on the economic boom in Japan. 
But despite the weight of its troubles, the bank - 19th largest in the world and 14th largest in Japan - has no plans to change direction, top executives say.
''We're an international specialist bank,'' insisted Kaoru Hayama, the bank's key strategist and managing director of its planning department. ''That is what makes us unique. We are operating in a more competitive world, and customers tend to shop around rather than assign their business to just one bank. That's why our specialty in international business matters is a strength.''
It is a strategy that leaves analysts skeptical. ''Their position as a specialty foreign-exchange bank made them very important to Japanese corporations at one time,'' said James E. Russell at Merrill Lynch Japan. ''But everywhere you turn today, they have some disadvantage. In some ways they are being pushed back into fringe markets.''
The bank has spent heavily, for instance, to build its presence in California, where it owns the Union Bank. And the Bank of Tokyo's chairman, Yusuke Kashiwagi, has said repeatedly that he sees Asia as the most promising market for expansion. But analysts say it is just purchasing market share in the United States. And in Asia, they add, the bank is finding it harder to compete.
In Asia, ''they no longer have any real advantages,'' said Brian Waterhouse, a banking analyst with James Capel Pacific. ''They're steeped in history, but there's not much they can do that Mitsubishi Bank or I.B.J. or Fuji Bank cannot do.''
Meanwhile, there is little room to grow at home, where the bank has just 32 offices, compared with 295 abroad. Its chances of expanding that domestic base to match any of its bigger rivals - Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the country's largest bank, has 377 offices in Japan - are slim. Since the Government tightly regulates the number of new offices, the only effective way to expand is by acquisition, and prices are prohibitive.
''We can manage,'' said the 55-year-old Mr. Hayama. But the trouble signs remain. Although the Bank of Tokyo has reduced its exposure in recent years, it still has by far the largest portfolio of problem third-world loans of any Japanese lender, equal to 92 percent of its equity.
And sharply rising interest rates over the last six months have depressed the bank's basic profit spread, the difference between its return on all its assets and the rate it pays for its capital. According to Merrill Lynch, that spread has tumbled from a relatively healthy 0.74 percentage points three years ago to an estimated -0.20 now. Certainly, all Japanese banks have suffered, but those whose deposits come largely from companies rather than individuals, like the Bank of Tokyo, have been hit hardest. This is because the rates paid to companies tend to rise faster than those paid to consumers.
That trend will contribute to the expected decline in the Bank of Tokyo's consolidated net income to an estimated 50 billion yen, or about $320 million, for the year that ended March 31, down from 60.7 billion yen the previous fiscal year.
Several analysts are now asking whether the bank would be better off combining with another institution. Some say it would make an ideal merger candidate with a regional Japanese bank that has a strong domestic branch system.
''They need a partner,'' said Stuart Matthews, an analyst here for Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''They're getting killed in so many ways, precisely because they're just an international bank.''
Added James Capel Pacific's Mr. Waterhouse, ''They have excellent management, their products are excellent and they are in all the important markets. But for every international advantage there's a domestic disadvantage. At some point I imagine they'd want to overcome their domestic weaknesses, and they can't do it on their own.''
Adding more pressure for a merger is deregulation of Japanese bank deposits. In the compartmentalized system established after World War II, the regular commercial banks, known as city banks, were permitted to take deposits for terms only up to two years. A group of special institutions, the long-term credit banks, were allowed to take deposits, in the form of debentures, for up to five years, but they could only make long-term loans. The Bank of Tokyo was in a category by itself: it could sell three-year debentures, which gave it a big advantage over the city banks in attracting deposits.
In recent years, however, the Finance Ministry has been tearing down those barriers, and the city banks are expected to be able to sell certificates of deposit for up to three years, and possibly longer, in the near future. That will give banks with wide domestic branch networks far greater access to Japan's huge pool of private savings.
Ironically, the troubles now being faced by this quintessential Japanese institution are not much different from what many American banks are encountering as they try to match financial muscle with the Japanese banking behemoths.
Coddled in the protected domestic market for years, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and the others have grown far larger, more powerful and much more aggressive than the Bank of Tokyo - and the Americans.
Notwithstanding the recent turmoil in the Japanese financial markets, the domestic bases of most major Japanese banks are still the envy of the industry, and the absence of such a base at the Bank of Tokyo is its most glaring weakness. Indeed, analysts say, the bank's situation is underscoring a lesson that Americans need to learn as well: it is very hard for any major global bank to compete internationally if its base at home is weak.
Weakness is a relatively new word to use in connection with the Bank of Tokyo. The bank and its prewar predecessor, the Yokohama Specie Bank, had been Japan's premier international financial institution since the mid-19th century, when the country began its headlong rush toward industrial development. (See box.) The true measure of how much things had changed came during the domestic boom of the 1980's: When the other major Japanese banks were raking in billions of yen by lending to wealthy individuals, real estate developers and corporate borrowers at home, the Bank of Tokyo was busy making risky loans to third-world nations.
Because it was putting most of its capital abroad, the bank did not benefit as much as its competitors did from the skyrocketing prices on the Tokyo stock and real estate markets. Japanese banks are permitted to own up to 5 percent of the shares of corporations, and all the big banks have huge stock portfolios. (Those portfolios have been buffeted by the recent Tokyo stock declines, but the values of shares are only back to where they were about six months ago.) Besides providing a major source of profits in the past few years, the huge portfolios helped the banks bolster their capital bases. Under international banking rules adopted by the major industrialized nations, big banks must increase their capital as a proportion of their assets to a ratio of better than 8 percent by 1993. Banks can raise those sums by retaining some of their profits, issuing new shares - or selling off some of their portfolios.
The Bank of Tokyo also had to contend in the early 80's with the end of its monopoly in the foreign-exchange business. By the first half of fiscal 1989, the bank had only the fourth-highest pretax income among Japanese banks from foreign-exchange trading.
Given all these changes, it is unclear just how long the bank can afford to remain committed to its international strategy, particularly in light of the looming increase in capital requirements.
''The capital issue makes it harder for them to get over their problems,'' said Mr. Matthews of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''They have less flexibility. They have some decisions to make.''
 
 
 
 THE CHRYSANTHEMUM AND THE BANK
The Bank of Tokyo has played a unique role in Japanese history, serving as the main conduit through which this once-isolated country dealt with the world.
The bank was founded in 1880 as the Yokohama Specie Bank and was partly owned by the Imperial family. The country's rulers had decided to transform Japan into the biggest industrial power in Asia, so the bank was stocked with the best and brightest graduates from the country's top Imperial universities, a source of prestige to this day.
The bank was indispensable to the Government in the 1930's, when Japan forcibly transformed Manchuria, the northeastern portion of China, into the puppet state of Manchukuo. Japan poured capital and technology into the region to create an industrial colony to feed its military machine and the Yokohama Specie Bank played a key role in financing and organizing the strategy.
Because of its wartime role, the bank was ordered to reorganize by the American occupation forces. What emerged was the Bank of Tokyo. It became privately owned, but was granted exclusive status as the foreign-exchange bank and helped finance Japan's burgeoning foreign trade. The bank became an innovator. It led a number of important large syndicated loans and put together the first Euroyen bond offering.
Despite all the regulatory changes and increased competition from larger Japanese rivals, the bank retains a special relationship with the Government. Its modern new headquarters in central Tokyo sits prominently beside the Bank of Japan. And the bank still acts as the Government's agent and financial adviser in distributing foreign aid to developing countries.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Who's to Settle Cross-Border Spats?

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Congress and the securities industry may not yet be prepared to do much about the arbitration process that Wall Street administers to settle disputes between investors and their brokers. But they certainly seem willing to study it.
On Jan. 31, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of that committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, asked the General Accounting Office to initiate a broad study of the investor arbitration process.
Late last month, five members of the Senate Commitee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, including the chairman, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, chimed in with a list of their own questions for the G.A.O about the process. 
Last week, Representatives Dingell and Markey sent a letter to Charles A. Bowsher, the Comptroller General, saying that the Senators' request could undermine the ''objective nature'' of the G.A.O. study. To buttress their argument, they noted that the Securities Industry Association, the brokerage industry's trade organization, was trying to raise funds to commission a Rand Corporation study of the arbitration process.
But while applauding all this studiousness, a few important figures on the arbitration scene suggest that a critical issue is being neglected in all these surveys: As the securities markets become increasingly international, where will cross-border disputes between investors and brokers be settled? By whom? And at what cost?
The securities association's own research shows that there has been a remarkable rise in the volume of cross-border investments in recent years. The pace of foreign equity purchases in the United States has increased at a fairly steady clip since the early 80's. In 1989, net purchases of foreign equities by American investors exploded to $13.7 billion, from just $1.5 billion in 1988.
No doubt a substantial percentage of those investments has been made through brokers in the investors' home countries. But it would be naive to assume that this dramatic increase in cross-border business will not generate any of the rancorous disputes that crop up between investors and their brokers in the domestic market.
Robert Coulson, the executive director of the American Arbitration Association in New York, which competes with the securities industry's arbitration process, endorses the various plans to study his rival but wishes the focus would be expanded to include cross-border disputes. ''Americans are really still very parochial,'' he said. ''The securities markets are becoming increasingly global, and this could be one of the most creative things these studies could come up with.''
Mr. Coulson points out that the legal framework for international arbitration is already quite sound. It rests on a cumbersome-sounding international pact known as the New York Convention on the Enforceability of Arbitral Awards, adopted in 1958 by almost every country with commercial relations with the United States.
For example, the 1958 pact provides that the parties to the dispute should have the right to select their own forum.
''It is obviously totally unfair to make foreign investors come to the United States to arbitrate,'' Mr. Coulson said. ''We wouldn't stand for it if we were required to go abroad.'' In fact, Mr. Coulson's association has already handled several cases involving foreign investors and American firms.
Deciding where these cases will be heard is not as simple as just flipping a coin. For starters, the arbitration association must consider which country's laws apply, where the witnesses live, what language the dispute will be conducted in and where the case was originally filed. The nationality of the chosen arbitrators is another ticklish issue. ''Very often,'' Mr. Coulson said, ''the people involved want arbitrators of a different nationality than either of the parties, out of some fear of partisanship, I guess.''
Such subtleties have not yet invaded the arbitration policy at the National Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory organization (S.R.O.) that handles the largest share of domestic arbitration cases.
Eno Hobbing, a spokesman for the N.A.S.D., said that he knew of ''maybe a dozen cases where foreigners proceeded against a United States firm'' by seeking a hearing before an N.A.S.D. panel. ''Those hearings were held here, but the investors were fairly substantial people and had no problem getting on a plane and coming here,'' Mr. Hobbing said. ''If these cases started coming in spades, it would raise some issues of how to cope. But we're a long way from that.''
Maybe not. With the sharp increase in cross-border investment, that day may come sooner than S.R.O.'s like the N.A.S.D. and the exchanges think.
Constantine N. Katsoris, a professor at the Fordham University law school and a specialist in securities arbitration, warned in a recent article in the Fordham Urban Law Journal that providing for foreign arbitration sites will simply exacerbate the already intense financial pressures on the current arbitration system.
''Indeed, the aggregate arbitration expenses at competing S.R.O. forums are escalating, with no apparent end in sight,'' noted Professor Katsoris, who calls for a single, independent arbitration forum for securities disputes. ''The demands for securities arbitration will escalate beyond the abilities of various S.R.O. forums to fund them adequately.''
And an inadequately funded arbitration process, the professor warned, has little chance of offering ''a level playing field'' to either investors or brokers.

The Swiss Franc Moves Up

 BODY:
This was the week of the Swiss franc as it moved higher against the dollar, the West German mark and the yen. A week ago, it took 1.4900 francs to buy a dollar. By last Friday, it took only 1.4530. The franc has been helped by the country's relatively high interest rates and by comments at week's end by the head of Switzerland's central bank supporting a strong currency and a sustained fight against inflation. In the foreign exchange market, that means interest rates will be pushed higher if necessary. Meanwhile, the pound ran into some trouble in the middle of the week as the British trade deficit jumped in March to 2.18 billion, from 1.39 billion in February. The yen stayed below 160 to the dollar for another week, a success of sorts for the beleaguered Japanese currency.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Latin America Develops a Longing For Aid and Investment From Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
TO impress Japanese investors, Brazil's President-elect performed karate kicks before photographers while in Tokyo in January. To master the Japanese language, the children of Mexico's President attend a bilingual school in Mexico City. And to win votes, the front-runner in Peru's presidential campaign has declared that his Japanese ancestry will help his nation attract $3 billion in aid and investment from Japan.
Japan fever is running high in Latin America, a region traditionally under the sway of the United States. If present economic trends continue, Japan will emerge in the 1990's as the region's second-largest foreign investor, creditor and trading partner. 
Newspapers speculate excitedly about fantastic Japanese-financed deals: building a road to link Colombia's Pacific and Atlantic coasts; building a road from Peru to open Brazil's western Amazon for logging operations, and trading gold-mining rights in the Amazon to erase Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt, the largest in the third world.
''It seems like the Japanese are dominating the world - all radios and watches come from there now,'' Ruben Ricapa Guerreros, a Lima slum dweller, said when asked why he voted this month for Alberto Fujimori, the Peruvian candidate.
But for Latin America, the courtship of Japan could prove to be a case of unrequited love.
Using the calculus of low political risk and high economic benefit, Japanese businesses have targeted only two nations in the region, Mexico and Chile, for more investment in manufacturing and mining, the kinds of industries that create significant wealth for the host country and thereby help repay foreign debt.
''The uncertain political climate, both regionally and in individual countries, deters investments,'' Gretchen Green, an international consultant, wrote this month in a report prepared for the Japan Economic Institute, a Japanese Government organization.
On paper, Latin America compares favorably with Asia and Europe in attracting Japanese investment. From 1984 through March 1989, Japan invested $32 billion in Asia, $30 billion in Europe and $32 billion in Latin America, the Caribbean and Bermuda. (By comparison, the Japanese invested $72 billion in the United States.) But Latin America attracts mainly ''paper investments'' - ship registries in Panama and investments in tax havens like the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Netherlands Antilles. Only 17 percent of Japanese investment in Latin America is in manufacturing.
Chile, with a free-market economy and political stability, was the only Latin American economy to join the Pacific boom in the late 1980's. In the last half of the decade, Chile quadrupled its trade with Japan, to $1.8 billion in 1989. Japanese investment in 1988 was $123 million - 10 times the total for the previous 10 years combined.
Japanese interest is also high in Mexico. Japanese investment is expected to nearly double this year, with $1.5 billion worth of new projects planned. Most of the investment is in border assembly plants that import components free of duty, assemble them with cheap Mexican labor and export the finished products to the United States, which charges low duties. Beyond sending his children to the Liceo Mexicano-Japones, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has a political incentive to court the Japanese -Mexico's eternal search for a counterbalance to the overwhelming influence of the United States.
Recognizing Mr. Salinas's efforts to open his economy to foreign investment, Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, visited Mexico last September. In recent months, the Japanese have allocated to Mexico 20 percent of a $10 billion third world debt-relief fund. They have extended a $1 billion low-interest loan to reduce pollution in Mexico City, and a $500 million line of credit to help Mexico develop its Pacific Coast oil resources.
 
Brazil's new President, Fernando
Collor de Mello, seeks to match Mexico's bid for Japanese investment.
Since taking office last month, he has introduced a radical anti-inflationary program that has led to a recession.
Japanese business executives apparently believe it is prudent to wait and see what happens, given Brazil's long history of failed wars on inflation.
''Japanese investment in Brazil was practically stagnant during the 1980's,'' said Toshiro Kobayashi, chairman of the Brazilian subsidiary of the Bank of Tokyo. ''This tendency is not going to change quickly.''
In the 1970's, a big draw for Japanese companies was the 1.2 million Brazilians of Japanese descent, the largest such community in Latin America. With high education levels, the Japanese-Brazilians have formed a support pool of executives, secretaries and translators for 360 Japanese companies.
But hard times are taking a toll on this community, centered in Sao Paulo. Many Japanese-Brazilians are leaving for Japan to seek high-paying menial jobs now spurned by the Japanese. The descendants of Japanese immigrants are also leaving Argentina and Peru for Japan.
Peru, with Latin America's second-largest Japanese immigrant community, illustrates the rule that Japanese capital follows opportunities, not sentiment.
For many Japanese business executives, the prospect of a Fujimori presidency and the presence of a Japanese enclave in Lima are outweighed by Peru's failure to pay for an $800 million oil pipeline built by Japan in the 1970's and by the terrorist slaying of the Bank of Tokyo's representative in Peru this year.
To dampen expectations that a Fujimori victory in the coming election would unleash an avalanche of aid and investment, Masaki Seo, Japan's Ambassador to Peru, said this month, ''Japanese aid is to countries, not individuals.''

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
High-Tech Business Loses A Friend at the Pentagon

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
AS reports circulated late last year that the Bush Administration was planning to cut back support for high-technology programs, Andrew S. Grove, president of the Intel Corporation, the Silicon Valley computer chip maker, sent a violin to Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director. ''If what I hear is true,'' Dr. Grove wrote in a terse note, ''you'll need this to fiddle with as the high-tech industry burns.''
The gesture points to a rising frustration among many electronics industry executives with the Administration's opposition to programs the executives say are needed to help American industry compete with Japan. That frustration turned to outrage a week and a half ago when Craig I. Fields was abruptly removed as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a division of the Pentagon that is charged with sponsoring university and corporate research that could be of importance to the military. Dr. Fields has been an advocate of programs to help industry with high-definition television, high-speed semiconductors and other research - a position out of line with the free-market philosophy of some powerful White House officials. 
Some executives say that the Administration is becoming so out of touch with the needs of American industry that the Republican Party is at risk of losing the support of business leaders. ''Electronics is heavily Republican,'' said J. Richard Iverson, president of the American Electronics Association, an industry trade group. ''Now we're confused. I think the Democrats have a great chance of picking up some followers.''
Several Democrats, including the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee and Representative Mel Levine of California, have condemned the removal of Dr. Fields and have proposed bills in which Government would support high-technology industry. A group of Democratic legislators is trying to tie the separate bills into a competitiveness package. Not everyone thinks the Republicans are in danger. Representative Tom Campbell, a Republican whose district covers much of Silicon Valley, said he does not see a loss of support for his party. The Democrats, he said, ''burned many, many bridges'' with industry by fighting a reduction in the capital gains tax last year. Still, Mr. Campbell said he has been urging the Administration to come up with its own high-technology policy to try to blunt the criticism.
Ten years ago, leaders of the electronics industry generally viewed themselves as can-do entrepreneurs who wanted nothing more from Government than to be left alone. While some still feel that way, a decade of battering by competition from Japan has caused many to question the idea that the industry should go it alone. ''I think that is an idealistic view that the late 20th century can't afford,'' said Charles E. Sporck, president of the National Semiconductor Corporation.
Mr. Sporck and many other executives have come to believe that they cannot compete effectively without Government help in such areas as opening up Japan to American exports and, in some cases, providing subsidies to overcome the inability of American companies to raise capital as easily as Japanese companies can.
The Reagan Administration seemed to go along with some of these ideas, such as Sematech, a semiconductor industry consortium that is financed half by industry and half by Government. But the Bush Administration, led by Mr. Darman, John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Michael A. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has been much more ideologically opposed to such programs. While it supports programs to help industry in general, the White House has fought any plan that smacked of favoritism to a particular industry, arguing that it is not the Government's role to make decisions that should be made by the marketplace.
 
A Civilian Alternative?
The Administration has come close to killing Government efforts to help the United States develop high-definition television systems. It turned a deaf ear to recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors to set up a corporation to provide low-cost capital to American electronics companies. With Dr. Fields's departure from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, there is a fear that many programs financed by the agency might also be slashed, such as research in high-speed computer chips, advanced computers and possibly even Sematech. Dr. Fields generally supported and even championed such programs, arguing that if the Pentagon was to get the technology it required at an affordable cost, it would need a healthy American electronics industry that could make high-volume consumer products as well as specialized military ones.
Some officials in Congress and industry say it was never ideal that the Pentagon be involved in helping industry. The transfer of Dr. Fields is likely to renew efforts in Congress to create a civilian version of his agency to handle such tasks. But for now, many say, it appears that ideology has triumphed over technology.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
New York Subways Run Into Another Round of Trouble

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED by rising crime, long lines at token booths, vandalized turnstiles and the presence of homeless people and beggars on trains, many New Yorkers are abandoning the subway.
In a recent report by the New York City Transit Authority, weekday subway ridership in February declined, by 2.8 percent to 3.6 million passengers, from 3.7 million in the same month last year. After several years of steady increases in ridership during the late 1980's, it was the third consecutive and significant monthly decline from year-earlier levels.
''I think most people feel that no one is in control of the subways anymore, and they avoid going down there except when they have to,'' said Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a consumer group that advises the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency. 
''The system is filled with smelly homeless people, hustlers and fare beaters,'' Ms. Dolinsky said. ''It's gotten so bad that nice middle-class people are just walking through the gate without paying.''
Transit officials attribute the drop in paid fares to a weakening of the economy in the metropolitan area, layoffs in the financial-services industry and a sudden rise in the number of people who are riding without paying.
In February, about 5.2 percent of the riders did not pay, compared with 4.2 percent in the same month of 1989, according to Transit Authority estimates. ''The simple truth is that if people don't have jobs, they are not going to ride,'' said Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the authority. ''A lot of people are still taking the system. It's just that they aren't paying, and that shows up as a drop in ridership.''
The agency bases its ridership tallies on the number of tokens deposited in turnstiles as well that of students, elderly or handicapped riders, who may use passes or coupons. Its count misses those riders who pass through the turnstiles or gates without paying, and it does not take into account people who transfer to other trains within the 27-line system.
Transit officials acknowledged that the increase in subway and bus fares from $1 to $1.15 on Jan. 1 has caused long lines at token booths. Although some of the wait is a result of riders whose hoards of the cheaper token have dwindled, most of it can be laid to clerks who need extra time to make change. Some riders have waited as long as 10 minutes to buy tokens during rush hour, and many become so exasperated they walk or take a taxi - or walk through the gates.
The increased level of subway crime is also prompting people to stay above ground. In February, the number of felonies like assaults, grand larcenies and necklace snatchings rose to 1,362 from 1,088. Last year a record 16,906 felonious crimes were committed in the subways, an 18 percent increase from 1989.
''The reasons for the drop in ridership go far deeper than an economic downturn and a fare increase,'' said Joseph Rappaport, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, a consumer-advocacy group. ''Our riders want reliable service that gets them to their destination on time, and they want to feel safe using it. Right now they are not getting that.''
Alan F. Kiepper, who took over as president of the Transit Authority in February, has said that improving the general quality of life on the subways is a top priority. Last month, Mr. Kiepper hired a new transit police chief from Boston, William Bratton, who promises a crackdown on crime. Mr. Kiepper is also formulating plans to overhaul stations and to deal with the homeless problem.
One solution to fare beaters, transit officials say, is automated fare collection, an electronic system that allows passengers to pass through turnstiles using a prepaid fare card; such a system is in use in the Washington subway. But the electronic turnstiles, which cost $675 million, are not expected to go into operation until late in the decade.
Robert R. Kiley, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's chairman, once said that ridership is the measure of the agency's success or failure. Consumer advocates say that one way for the authority to increase ridership is to convince the public that it is in control of the subway system and that the service is worth $1.15.
Mr. Kiepper's predecessor, David L. Gunn, won praise for overhauling the mechanics of the city's subway system - the tracks, switches and signals - and for ridding cars of graffiti. As a result, ridership increased. Passengers responded positively to boarding cars that were clean, air-conditioned and on time.
Today, riders want the Transit Authority to go a step further, consumer advocates say. They want clean, well-lit stations, shorter lines at token booths, greater security, better information on service delays and incentives like discounts and weekend passes. But continuing the overhaul of the subway system and enhancing service will cost money at a time when the state and city, struggling with budget difficulties, are looking for ways to cut programs, not expand them.
''A lot will depend on the city's economy, but I don't think ridership will improve very much in the short term,'' Mr. Lebow said. ''We will try a number of programs to make the system more pleasant and attractive. Hopefully some of them will work.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Despite the Deficit, at Least One Tax Looks Untouchable

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
OVER the last two decades, New Yorkers have seen their taxes rise on just about everything. But not on gasoline. When this year's state budget is finally adopted, taxes on dozens of goods and services will likely rise once again. But not on gasoline. In politics, it seems, some things are indeed sacred.
The constancy of New York's gasoline excise tax, which has remained at eight cents a gallon since 1972, stands in stark contrast to the upward trend in other states. Overall, New York State has one of the highest personal and corporate income tax rates in the nation. Yet its gasoline tax is now the third lowest in the country. Only Georgia and Florida have a lower excise tax on gasoline, although those two states and New York, unlike most others, also impose a sales tax on gasoline. As a proportion of personal income, New York's gasoline tax burden ranks absolute last. And over the last decade, New York, according to the Highway Users Federation in Washington, is one of only three states that has not raised its gasoline tax. In some states the tax has doubled or even tripled since 1980. 
In many ways, the steadiness of New York's gasoline tax defies logic. Profoundly indebted, the state could certainly use the income that higher gasoline taxes would provide. Each penny's increase in the tax is worth about $60 million. New York's smoggy air, many environmentalists argue, would also profit from higher fuel prices, which could discourage needless driving. And since in real terms the cost of motor fuel has actually fallen by almost 50 percent over the last decade, it would seem to make sense to raise the tax at a time when the state is desperately looking for new revenues.
''New York certainly should raise its gas tax,'' said Philip Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group. ''But there is nothing more visible than gas taxes.''
Last month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo made a passing attempt to raise the gasoline tax to help the state fill its budget gap. But the effort seemed tentative at best. Mr. Cuomo floated the idea one day at a late afternoon news conference, refusing even to say how much he thought the tax should be raised. Within hours of the Governor's news conference, legislative leaders had dismissed the proposal as politically impossible. It has not been mentioned since.
With negotiations on a new state budget still continuing four weeks beyond the legal deadline, officials here in Albany say that the taboo on increasing the gasoline tax is a product of the regional split that dominates politics in New York State. Roughly half of the state's residents - and their elected representatives - live in New York City and depend mainly on mass transit to get around. The other half live in suburban and rural areas and rely mainly on automobiles. To this second group, trying to raise the gasoline tax is tantamount to declaring civil war.
''The central impact of the gasoline tax is on upstate, middle-income people,'' said State Senator Dale Volker, an upstate Republican. ''The issue is very politically charged.''
 
Bearing the Brunt
State consumption figures confirm that it is upstate and suburban residents who bear the brunt of the gasoline tax. New York City motorists consume only 20 percent of the gasoline in the state. Another 20 percent is used in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Westchester and Rockland Counties consume 10 percent, and the remaining 50 percent is consumed upstate.
Opposition to the gasoline tax has long been centered in the State Senate, where the Republican Party owes its majority to its strong showing in rural and suburban areas. But even in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, where most of the majority party members come from New York City, there is only lukewarm support for increasing the tax. In part this is because many of the most politically vulnerable Assembly Democrats come from areas like Rochester and Long Island, where higher gasoline taxes are unpopular. In addition, Assembly members say, gasoline taxes, like all sales taxes, are regressive because they are not based on the ability to pay and affect the poor proportionally more than the rich.
Many state legislators say that the only way to make higher gasoline taxes politically palatable in New York would be to earmark the proceeds for highway projects instead of putting the revenues into the state's general treasury.
''There's a simple consensus that if you're going to do gas taxes, you've got to dedicate them to a highway fund,'' said the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat. This is something that more than half the states in the country already do and something New York State appears likely to do in a year or two, legislators say, when money from the state's most recent transportation bond issue runs out.
Environmentalists are disturbed by such a plan. They contend that gasoline tax revenues should not be used to expand highways and encourage more driving, but to discourage the use of automobiles and subsidize mass transit. To many environmentalists, the nearly two decades that have passed since New York last raised its gasoline tax have been a wasted opportunity.
''The gasoline tax offers a chance not only to potentially reduce pollution, but to provide a permanent source of funding for mass transit,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Manhattan. ''New York has been too slow in raising it.''
The relationship between gasoline prices and gasoline consumption and, by extension, pollution is one that has been studied extensively, with mixed results. The short-term effects of higher prices, according to Mr. Verleger of the Institute for International Economics, are small. But longer term, as people switch to more fuel-efficient automobiles, the effects in reducing consumption are more dramatic.
''From a conservation point of view, it makes sense,'' Mr. Verleger said. ''But the public does not like gas taxes, and politicians are not very courageous.''
 
WHAT THE STATES CHARGE
State gasoline taxes as of Jan. 1, 1990. All states charge a gasoline excise tax. The nine marked with an asterisk (*), including New York, also impose a sales tax on gasoline; for those states, the figures below represent the total of excise and sales taxes. Several states, including Connecticut, plan to increase their gasoline excise taxes this year.

HEADLINE: TOPICS OF THE TIMES;
Monet's 90's, and Ours

 BODY:
For a century now, those who love beauty have reveled in the lucid landscapes of Claude Monet. But an exhibition of 95 of his works at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston makes the surprising case that Monet was a political artist as well. ''Monet in the 90's,'' which closes today, reopens May 19 at the Art Institute of Chicago. It sends a timely message to America's heartland.
Monet's 90's - the 1890's - were as dizzying as our own. In the decades following a painful loss in the Franco-Prussian war, France was beset by fierce economic competition, an alarming rise in consumption of drugs and alcohol, poisonous bigotry and a banking crisis. Yet each day brought technological advances that transformed society. ''Is it decadence or progress?'' asked one bewildered Frenchman. Monet's response was to show his countrymen the true nature of their home.
According to Paul Hayes Tucker, the exhibit's curator, the artist's serial paintings of stacks of grain, poplar trees, water lilies and the solemn face of Rouen Cathedral celebrate the enduring glory of France. The fertile farmlands and Gothic wonders, chased by light and shadow, survive time and weather. Rows upon rows of poplars stand for a proud and liberty-loving populace. Each ''Morning on the Seine'' reflects the depth of France's natural strength, endlessly renewed.
Perhaps only the French fully grasp Monet's meaning; perhaps not. For the basic message of ''Monet in the 90's'' is plain. The artist proved that truth is not the secret knowledge of the rich, the learned or the powerful.
It is there, in living color, for all who open their eyes.

HEADLINE: More, Not Less Aid to Afghan Rebels

BYLINE: By Henry J. Hyde and Charles Wilson; Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, and Charles Wilson, Democrat of Texas, are members of the House Intelligence Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Just a year ago, following the Soviet troop departure, we were counting the days until the mujahedeen took over in Afghanistan. But so far President Najibullah's staying power has proved far stronger than anyone imagined, bolstered by more than $300 million a month in Soviet economic and military assistance.
To salvage our interests, we've got to sustain the pressure on Mr. Najibullah and the Soviets, squeezing them until they realize that U.S. resolve has not slackened one iota. To get this job done, we need to be prepared to continue providing substantial aid to the mujahedeen - though this will be far less than what the Soviets give Kabul. 
Conventional wisdom says Americans are not good at playing a long end game; we prefer ''quickie'' actions like Grenada and Panama. There may be truth to that thesis, but we've also demonstrated staying power. Look at our long-term commitment to NATO and the billions it has cost us. Look at the results in Eastern Europe.
We must do the same in Afghanistan. We've been helping the mujahedeen for 11 years. That's only a fraction of the time (and involves only a fraction of the money) we've spent assisting our friends in Western Europe, Israel and South Korea.
Victory will not be easy, but we offer a recipe. First, stop the bickering in Washington. The jubilation of last year has turned to finger-pointing. Rather than looking inward to find out why we didn't win last year, let's look to the future and rejuvenate the forces that ousted the Soviet Army.
Second, allow the Afghans to choose their own form of government -don't impose one. Tribalism has been the rule in Afghanistan for centuries. We are not going to change that overnight. At our urging, the mujahedeen are laudably trying to form a more representative government. But we are placing more hope in this process than is reasonable.
Third, exploit opportunities exposed by the recent coup attempt against Mr. Najibullah. For instance, the mujahedeen should return to what worked in the past: step-by-step strangulation of Government strongholds. As the resistance draws the noose tighter, key cities will fall and so eventually will the regime. But this takes time.
Finally, up the ante with more support, more political pressure and, yes, more sophisticated weaponry to demonstrate to Mr. Najibullah and the Soviets the futility of hoping that we are short of breath.
Pravda reported on March 20: ''The main paymaster behind the bloody deadlock in Afghanistan - the Congress - has increasingly . . . begun to show signs of dissatisfaction and criticize the White House for its lack of flexibility toward the efforts to achieve settlement.'' Comments by our colleague Stephen Solarz, Democrat of New York, were cited to authenticate this analysis.
Some argue that both sides should stop delivering arms to their clients. This plays into the hands of the Soviets. Despite all predictions, it is unclear who will be the main beneficiary from a cutoff in arms. Moreover, there would be immediate repercussions for the U.S.
Pakistan, a loyal ally through the war, would be left isolated with more than three million Afghan refugees within its borders. Influential moderate states in the Arab world, generally sympathetic to U.S. interests, would see us as an untrustworthy partner that will not stay the course. Our departure would open the door to the Iranians, angering our moderate Arab allies and leading to unknowable consequences.
The Soviets cannot be expected to hand us another victory. They, too, have lost many lives and have squandered more than $70 billion. We must give them a chance to extract themselves from their own mess.
Equally important, the Soviets will be reminded that we do not desert our friends when the going gets tough. That's a reminder that will significantly strengthen our hand in future Soviet-American efforts to resolve other third world conflicts.
In the euphoria over the Soviets' departure, we lost sight of the ultimate goal: ouster of the regime of Mr. Najibullah and his associates.

BYLINE: By J. William Fulbright; J. William Fulbright was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 15 years.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is a matter of concern that after many ups and downs over the years, educational exchange is once again coming on hard times. Despite rising costs, it appears that the Administration and Congress intend to let stand a flat budget for Fulbright scholarships for the fifth straight year. In doing so, they will ratify a 23 percent decline in the number of participants over this five-year period.
It is a small item in the Federal budget, but a highly significant element of our foreign policy and national interest. 
The year 1945 and the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki marked a profound break in the thread of human history. Only in the last few years have the dimensions of that break become apparent to the leaders of the military superpowers. Hesitantly and haltingly, they seem to be beginning to recognize how profoundly, criminally and stupidly wasteful it has been to squander the greater part of humanity's creative energies on war and the preparation for war.
Even before the failure of Marxist economics led Mikhail Gorbachev toward a new approach at home and abroad, there began to dawn an awareness of the obsoleteness of war. In Europe and East Asia, people have discovered that wealth is power in the new international system. While the superpowers expended vast sums on vast military establishments, the European Community, Japan and some smaller Asian countries captured world markets, enabling their people to live in growing freedom, prosperity and dignity.
How has this come to pass? For the most part from experience - but experience can be vicarious, too. Sometimes we profit from historic as well as proximate example. That is what education is all about.
The Fulbright exchange program, initiated in 1946, has been a long-term, low-cost investment and it is beginning to yield high dividends. Nearly 50,000 living American alumni, among 60,000 grantees over all, have gained knowledge and perspective on other nations by participating in the Fulbright program.
Some are now contributing to the education of another generation; some are strengthening American competitiveness; and a considerable number are serving with distinction in the executive and legislative branches of our Government.
The rewards are perhaps even greater from the contributions of foreigners who study here, numbering to date about 116,000. Fulbright alumni hold influential positions in countries all over the world, over 30 of which now contribute substantially to the costs of the exchange. The West German Government, for example, now pays almost 80 percent of the costs of its exchange.
Three members of Poland's Solidarity-led Government are Fulbright alumni; so are the majority of the South Korean Cabinet. Many of the Chinese students who demonstrated last year in Tiananmen Square were returnees from study in the U.S. It is a fair guess that among the many thousands of Chinese who have been and are still studying in America are some who will govern China when the frightened old men who now rule have passed from the scene.
It doesn't take many to make a difference. A single leader or a few legislators or writers who know something about what other countries are like can contribute to making a wise decision or to forestalling a disastrous one. If Khrushchev had had more than a rudimentary sense of what the United States was like, there might have been no Cuban missile crisis. If President Johnson or his senior advisers had had a deeper understanding of the Chinese and Vietnamese, we might have been spared the Vietnam War.
Conversely, I think it quite likely that President Gorbachev has a more realistic perspective on the United States because of the advice he receives from his friend and senior adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev, who studied American history and wrote on the New Deal as a Fulbright scholar at Columbia University in 1958.
There is power here - immediate and potential, the kind of power that counts in the new post-cold-war world. I hope that President Bush and the Congress will give close and careful consideration to restoring and strengthening the Fulbright exchange. I may be prejudiced, but I think it's a terrific investment.

HEADLINE: BETWEEN TWO WORLDS

BYLINE: By BILL BRYSON; Bill Bryson, an American writer living in England, is the author of ''The Lost Continent.''

 BODY:
SYDENHAM IS A DISTRICT of London famous for, well, nothing. It is one of those gray, anonymous, slightly tattered neighborhoods where the hairdressing salons have names like World of Hair and most businesses seem to deal in video films, plumbing supplies or fish and chips. About a third of the shops on the street are vacant, their windows soaped and covered with faded posters for pop concerts and wrestling matches. It's the kind of neighborhood where you turn up your collar and pass on.
Around the corner from a gas station lives Kazuo Ishiguro, in a modest semidetached house distinguished from its neighbors by little more than the number plate on its door. It is a somewhat surprising choice of residence for one of Britain's hottest, and lately wealthiest, young novelists.
Even more surprising perhaps is that Ishiguro, who was born in Japan 35 years ago but has lived in England since he was 6 years old, has achieved this blend of fame and wealth with just three books, none of which offers the reader much in the way of violence, sex, greed, jokes or even plot. ''I try to put in as little plot as possible,'' he says with an engaging grin. 
What the reader gets instead is a quiet, spare narrative, often full of melancholy and irony, disarmingly unflashy in its presentation and yet clearly constructed with immense care. Ishiguro is happy to devote six years to a novel, and he anguished for weeks over just one line in his latest book, ''The Remains of the Day,'' which was published to general acclaim in America last fall.
''Brilliant and quietly devastating,'' Newsweek called it. Lawrence Graver, writing in The New York Times Book Review, used words like ''dazzling,'' ''masterly'' and ''strikingly original.'' At least two reviewers likened Ishiguro to Henry James.
In Britain the book has hovered around the summit of the best-seller lists more or less continuously since its publication last May. In the United States, where Ishiguro was largely unknown, it has already clocked up sales of about 50,000. In October, it won the Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award; he had already won, for earlier books, the Whitbread Book of the Year and Winifred Holtby prizes. Film rights to ''The Remains of the Day'' have been bought by Harold Pinter, and there is talk of a movie to be directed by Mike Nichols.
''He has clearly become one of the best young writers in Britain today,'' says the critic and novelist Malcolm Bradbury, who taught Ishiguro when he was a creative writing student at the University of East Anglia. ''Thanks to him and six or seven other very good young writers - Salman Rushdie, Timothy Mo, Julian Barnes, Martin Amis and Jeanette Winterson, for instance - the novel has become exciting again in Britain in the 1980's, rather in the way it was in the 50's when writers like Iris Murdoch were rising to prominence.''
Ishiguro is naturally pleased to be a well-paid part of this literary resurgence, but scarcely overwhelmed by it. He and his wife, Lorna, a social worker, would like to move closer to the fashionable West End of London, not out of any particular desire to be in the thick of things but rather to be nearer to her job. His unostentatious life style - a Roland piano, bought with some of the Whitbread prize money, and three acoustic guitars are the only outward signs of self-indulgence in his living room - reflects the suddenness of his success, but it's largely a matter of choice. ''I've never had any ambition to have a Porsche or anything,'' he says. ''Frankly, I don't understand the idea of having a car that costs 12 times more than another car. If you feel you have to spend that kind of money, why not buy 12 cars?'' Instead he is content to spend the money on more modest ambitions, ''like phasing British Rail out of my life,'' and on buying himself time to do a proper job on the next book.
In conversation, Ishiguro is relaxed, genial, composed. He speaks in measured tones, his outsized glasses and custom of dressing entirely in black lending him a solemn air, which is frequently and rather startlingly dispersed by a flash of boyish grin. Though it is never explicit in his novels, humor of an ironic and self-deprecating kind is seldom far away from anything he says. It appears to be impossible to find anyone who knows him who does not like him a lot.
''He's just a very, very nice guy,'' a close friend, Robin Robertson of the British publisher Secker & Warburg, told me. ''On the day of the Booker Prize, just to give you an example, he arranged to meet John Banville'' - the Irish novelist who was considered with Ishiguro to be the joint favorite to win the award - ''for tea at the Ritz beforehand, because they had never met before and he thought it would be more pleasant for both of them if they arrived at the award ceremony as friends. That sort of thoughtfulness is very typical of him.''
Ishiguro's novels - ''A Pale View of Hills,'' ''An Artist of the Floating World'' and ''The Remains of the Day'' - are preoccupied with certain recurring themes: self-deception, devalued ideals, unuttered sentiments, the high cost of misplaced loyalty. Each takes place largely in the past - the first two in Japan just after the war, the third in England in 1956 at the time of the Suez crisis - yet each moves freely and often skillfully across time.
In all three, fragments of crucial information are exposed gradually, piece by piece, often seemingly in passing, so that the reader collects clues and arrives at the truth rather as in a murder mystery. Often the most basic information is only vaguely alluded to or withheld altogether. ''A Pale View of Hills'' is set in Nagasaki just after the war, yet not once is the atomic bomb mentioned. In ''An Artist of the Floating World,'' the setting appears to be Tokyo, but we are never told. In ''The Remains of the Day'' we never learn the narrator's first name. In each of the books, the truth is revealed to us through the words of narrators who themselves largely fail to see it.
A striking characteristic of Ishiguro's books is how remote they are from his own experiences of time, place and even - in the case of ''A Pale View of Hills,'' which is narrated by a woman - sex. Two of his novels were set in a Japan that Ishiguro had not seen for almost 30 years - he made his first trip back to the country last fall - while ''The Remains of the Day'' is narrated by a butler, about whose profession Ishiguro happily professes large-scale ignorance.
''I've always found it easier to be intimate and revealing with central characters who are not like me,'' he says. ''Partly it's to do with not being of an exhibitionist kind of nature, but also I think it serves me as a form of artistic discipline.''
''When you're dealing with someone not like yourself, you have to think much harder about why that person behaves in certain ways, why certain things have happened to him or her. I think one of the dangers of having a kind of alter ego in fiction is that you drag in all kinds of things that are irrelevant in an artistic sense simply because they are things that you are concerned with as a person yourself.''
Having lived most of his life in England, Ishiguro claims that his ''Japaneseness'' is not something that he is particularly conscious of. ''It's a thing I think about only when people ask me. I never asked myself about it when I was growing up. I'm reluctant even now to try to quantify how much of me is Japanese and how much British.'' Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki in 1954, but came to England in 1960 with his parents and two sisters. His father was an oceanographer working in an area that was of peripheral interest in Japan but of some moment to the British Government, which was then on the brink of developing oil fields in the North Sea. The family settled outside London in Guildford, the county town of Surrey and quintessence of the Home Counties - ''the sort of place,'' as Ishiguro puts it, ''where an Agatha Christie mystery could have been set.''
''I didn't think of myself as particularly different from my friends,'' he recalls. ''I can't remember any instances of racism. Basically I had a happy and very typical middle-class southern English upbringing.''
For most of his childhood it was assumed that the family would eventually return to Japan. ''It was always going to be next year or, at the most, in two years' time. It wasn't until I was 15 that my parents finally said, 'Well, we're not going to go back,' '' Ishiguro remembers. ''They just liked it here, I think. There's a surprising amount of similarity between Japanese culture and the sort of culture you find in places like Guildford. But there was also a measure of freedom that I think they - and particularly my father - found appealing. When Japanese people move to another country, one of two things will usually happen. Some of them just flounder and find they can't cope at all where there isn't a clearly defined rigid code of behavior. But others find it liberating, and my father is clearly of the latter sort. I think he realized that the idea of having to go back to all those social obligations, having to drink with your pals every night, just wasn't his scene.''
In the meantime, Ishiguro's parents had continued the Japanese side of his education. Every month for years a parcel of books would arrive from Japan and he would have to plow through them. As a result he grew up intimately acquainted with a Japan that existed almost entirely in his head, a compound of childhood memories, text(Continued on Page 44) book facts and imagination. This is the Japan that appeared in his first two novels.
''I recognize that I have a Japanese dimension to me and that derives from my having been brought up by Japanese parents in a Japanese-speaking home,'' Ishiguro says. ''I think I've always learned to use that in my favor. I'm certainly aware that at least part of the reason for my success has to do with the unusual nature of my profile. When I published my first novel, in 1982, that was exactly the time when people in the literary world were looking for a different kind of young writer. Salman Rushdie had just broken through as the Booker Prize winner. People had started to read writers like Kundera and Marquez. Everyone was hungry for young writers who had an international flavor about their writing - and, if possible, about their person.
''There's no doubt I got far more coverage and a more favorable reception than if I had been just a white English guy. So while I've not consciously exploited my background, I think it's always been an instinct.'' On the other hand, it has sometimes been an encumbrance. It disturbs Ishiguro that people regard him as an expert on a country that he barely knows. The tendency to regard his first two books as literal representations of life in Japan is particularly exasperating. ''I sometimes feel that if I had written a book like Kafka's 'Trial,' people would say to me, 'What a strange judicial system the Japanese have.'
''I get a lot of very strange requests. One of the British television networks rang me up during rumors of a U.S.-Japanese trade war and asked me if I would go on a program to discuss things from the Japanese side. Quite apart from the consideration that I'm not an economist, you're talking about a country that I hadn't been to at that point for 29 years, since I was a 6-year-old child. It's crazy.''
A rueful grin gives way to a sudden burst of earnestness. ''I'm very aware that I know very little about Japan, particularly modern-day Japan, and I found it disturbing that many of the reviews of my first two books were saying things like, 'Read this book if you want to understand how Japanese people think.' That was worrying to me because I didn't have that kind of authority.''
Although his parents returned on periodic visits, Ishiguro himself did not go back until last fall when the Japan Foundation paid for him and his wife to make a visit. It was nothing like the Japan he remembered from his childhood. ''Apart from the fact that both places are called Japan I might as well have been to different countries.'' Even the language was different from the familiar form he had used at home. ''It was odd because I found that I could sometimes carry on fairly elaborate conversations with an academic or somebody but would be completely flummoxed trying to order a snack in a restaurant.''
Why did it take him so long to go back? ''When I was 19 or 20 and got a chance to travel, I wanted to go to places like California and Amsterdam - the sort of places my friends were all going. It didn't seem an unnatural thing not to go to Japan since no one I knew was going there then.''
Instead, Ishiguro devoted himself to odd jobs, peripatetic traveling and a brief but resoundingly unsuccessful attempt to become a singer-songwriter. Before and after studying philosophy and literature at the University of Kent he hitchhiked around the United States and Canada and worked at a variety of jobs - as a grouse beater on the Queen Mother's estate, as a community worker helping homeless people in Glasgow and London. It wasn't until 1979 that he decided, suddenly and at the somewhat advanced age of 25, to try writing. He applied for and was accepted at the now-celebrated but then little-known creative writing course at the University of East Anglia run by Malcolm Bradbury.
''I suddenly panicked,'' Ishiguro recalls, ''because I'd never really written anything before and was afraid I would be exposed as a fraud.'' He spent the summer before the first term locked away in a farmhouse in Cornwall and wrote four short stories. Bill Buford, editor of the literary magazine Granta, remembers receiving one of them: ''It was remarkably accomplished. You could tell right away that he was a writer of considerable potential.''
Faber & Faber, the London publisher, bought three of the stories while Ishiguro was still a student and published them in a volume of stories by promising young writers called ''Introductions N7.'' It also offered him a small advance for his first novel, ''A Pale View of Hills,'' which he began writing at East Anglia in 1980. Published in 1982, it is the story of a widowed, middle-aged Japanese woman living in England whose daughter from a previous marriage in Japan has committed suicide. As with his two later books, the action drifts across time - from an unhappy visit by the woman's surviving, English-born daughter in the present to a more lengthy recollection of a summer just after the war when the narrator, Etsuko, was a young housewife in Nagasaki.
The book was widely praised in Britain and translated into 13 languages, but it sank without a trace in America. So, too, did Ishiguro's second book, ''An Artist of the Floating World,'' which sold fewer than 2,000 copies. It is the story of Masuji Ono, a retired artist who unwittingly reveals in his rambling, self-absorbed ruminations that he is neither so accomplished in his work nor so admirable in his character as he himself clearly believes.
Though ''An Artist of the Floating World'' failed to attract much notice in this country, it enjoyed outstanding success elsewhere. Foreign rights were sold in 14 countries and it was a paperback best seller in Britain, achieving for Ishiguro a measure of financial independence that allowed him to give up his job working at a hostel for London's homeless and write full time.
Writing does not come easily to him. ''Every time I've got another novel to write I just can't believe that I ever managed to write one before,'' he says. ''I do desperate things. I make notes. I spend a lot of time thinking. I'd do almost anything to get it going.'' Typically, he spends a year writing the words but two years planning what he's going to say. ''I'm not the kind of writer who can put a sheet of paper into the typewriter and improvise. I have to know more or less the whole structure of the book beforehand.''
Though he has been widely praised for the assuredness of his prose style, Ishiguro is curiously dismissive of his handling of language, insisting that he has little natural talent for expressing himself and that any felicities of rhythm and tone surface at a late stage in the writing process. ''I don't actually pay a great deal of attention to the prose in my books,'' he says. ''That's something I do right at the end when I go through it all and tidy everything up - actually, I don't just tidy it up because my prose is really terrible until I go through this fairly thorough editing process. By any standards it's terrible.''
Ishiguro's restrained approach may seldom dazzle, but he has a true gift for making the mundane compelling. It is difficult indeed to pick up one of his books and not find oneself being buoyed along, gently but helplessly, by the words. Consider the opening lines from ''An Artist of the Floating World'': ''If on a sunny day you climb the steep path leading up from the little wooden bridge still referred to around here as 'the Bridge of Hesitation,' you will not have to walk far before the roof of my house becomes visible between the tops of two gingko trees. Even if it did not occupy such a commanding position on the hill, the house would still stand out from all others nearby, so that as you come up the path, you may find yourself wondering what sort of wealthy man owns it.''
Or take the first sentence from ''The Remains of the Day'': ''It seems increasingly likely that I really will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.'' Who could fail to venture on from that deceptively beguiling introduction?
The narrator here is Stevens, a dull, self-important butler who has devoted his life - quite literally, since in his view a good butler is never seen to be off-duty - to the smooth running of Darlington Hall and to the comfort of its eponymous master, the shadowy Lord Darlington. He is an almost comically pathetic character, blindly subservient to his employer, so dedicated to duty that he leaves his father's deathbed to serve cocktails, so out of touch with his own feelings that he cannot recognize love when it flutters into his life, so blinkered that his one recollection of a visit by George Bernard Shaw is of Shaw's being impressed by the shine on a well-polished spoon.
It is a thoroughly convincing portrait, larded with long, oddly absorbing disquisitions on the art of managing a large house, yet Ishiguro has never met a butler and most of Stevens's emphatic opinions on such matters as where to acquire the best silver polish or deal with guests who show up three days early spring entirely from Ishiguro's fertile mind.
Ishiguro chose an English setting as a deliberate reaction to the labeling of him as a Japanese writer living in England. ''Before I knew anything about the book, I knew that it wasn't going to have anything to do with Japan or Japanese people,'' he says. Yet the book reprises many of the earlier themes and underscores the closeness in temperament between the British and Japanese - the suppressed emotions, the unwillingness to be explicit, the almost ritualistic politeness, and, at least where servants are concerned, the high personal and emotional cost of unstinting loyalty to one's employer. It is an immensely accomplished book. As Malcolm Bradbury puts it: ''To get so convincingly into the mind, the language, the habits and feelings of someone from a different period and completely different background is an enormous achievement.''
Ishiguro isn't at all certain that Britain is the most desirable locale for modern fiction. ''The younger generation of writers in this country is much more conscious now of addressing an international audience. They don't make the assumption that perhaps some older writers did that Britain is somehow culturally very central to the world, that you can just write about English issues and about English life and it will be automatically of international interest.
''I go to these big international conferences and here are all these writers, a lot of whom have been in prison and really have been in the front line of recent developments. I was in Budapest at a conference and I was very (Continued on Page 80) conscious that the British contingent and to a certain extent the French and Italian and even possibly the Americans looked very much like provincial little communities of writers discussing rather trivial things. For me it's difficult to find a stance that is appropriate given that I live in this quiet, little, safe, democratic, prosperous country at the edge of Europe.''
Although many of Ishiguro's closest friends are writers or work in publishing, he has little to do with the literary life of London. ''You could almost make a career out of just going to publishers' parties here,'' he says. ''And in fact some people more or less do that. But to me it's basically a distraction.'' For much the same reason, he has always declined to write book reviews or undertake journalistic assignments. What he's really interested in is making progress as a novelist.
''What impresses me most about Ishiguro,'' says Granta's Bill Buford, ''is not so much what he has done - though that is impressive enough - as what he is likely to do. Each of his books has been a clear progression from the previous one. I think he's going to just keep getting better and better.''
Ishiguro himself is certainly determined to try. ''I don't know how long it's going to take me to do the next book. It may take three years, it may take six. But I think it's important to produce something that is in some sense a step forward. One of the problems with success is that it becomes harder and harder to do new things, partly because you are under some pressure to come up with another book to capitalize on the commercial success of the previous one, and partly because there's a lot of psychological pressure of your own making. If you've been praised in your books for doing A, B and C well, you are naturally a little scared to write a book without A, B and C in it.'' He pauses and smiles. ''That's the position I'm in now.''
So has he started his next book? ''Uh . . . not really. Well, maybe. I'm not quite sure.'' He smiles again and pushes back a shock of hair. ''Ask me that in a couple of years.''

HEADLINE: FOOD;
POTATO POTENTIAL

BYLINE: BY LINDA WELLS

 BODY:
A SIMPLE BAKED POTATO IS FINE. AND A NICELY TURNED, boiled potato with parsley is perfectly pleasant. But they are to food what sensible shoes are to fashion. More and more, the potato is a medium of culinary inspiration and flights of fancy. Potato slices are masquerading as ravioli and stuffed with pigs' cheeks. They are spread to form sheets of lasagna, curled into cannelloni, shaved and sealed around scallops and slid into terrines of salmon or monkfish. They are pureed and stacked between foie gras and duck confit. Even mashed potatoes are treated with more respect - and more flair - than they get with the standard butter and cream.
''It's supposed to be the honest era, right?'' says Christopher Idone, the owner of Ten Twenty-Two, a restaurant in New York. ''We're all going to be eating this stuff.''
The potato's rise to prominence can be explained by a sagging economy, a reaction against conspicuous consumption and a desire for the familiar. ''People aren't intimidated by potato dishes,'' says Joachim Splichal, the chef and co-owner of Patina in Los Angeles. But maybe it's more basic than all that: quite simply, people like them. And on restaurant menus, potatoes sell. At Aureole in Manhattan, Charles Palmer, the chef and co-owner, has lamb with couscous on the menu. ''People order potatoes on the side,'' he says. ''They want to eat the couscous, but they also want the potatoes just in case.'' 
Splichal turned to potatoes as a reaction against pasta. ''There isn't a restaurant in town that doesn't serve pasta, even if it's a French place,'' he says. ''I didn't want to fall into that trap. So I took pasta dishes and did them with potatoes.'' Sheets of potato are wrapped around salmon and basil, then called cannelloni. Ravioli holds potatoes and oysters; lasagna is made of potatoes layered with wild mushrooms and chives drenched with truffle sauce. On his vegetarian menu, one course, called Idaho Three Ways, consists entirely of potatoes - the lasagna, ravioli stuffed with potatoes and yams, and a flamboyant potato pancake wedged with truffles.
''Some of the potato dishes may seem gimmicky,'' Palmer says. ''But the potato is so versatile; almost anything you put with it will work.'' He stuffs duck confit into small yellow Finnish potatoes. Thin slices, filled with pork, sealed and fried become ravioli. Salmon with potato and pesto form a bright, summery terrine.
Not all potato dishes are new and flashy. At Park Bistro, in Manhattan, ''We create the dishes of our grandmothers,'' says Max Bernard, a part owner. ''Everyone in the Lyon region knows how to make these potatoes. They're not a new thing.'' Some dishes, though, are slightly altered. The meltingly rich potato tart with goat cheese, basil and mesclun salad was conceived by Jean-Michel Diot, the chef. ''In France, there is a dish of potato salad with goat cheese, a gratin,'' he says. ''That's too heavy for a first course, so I added salad and vinaigrette to it.''
Ten Twenty-Two is the kingdom of mashed potatoes. They are whipped with butter, milk and a handful of herbs. They are showered with Roquefort or sheep cheese and served with steak. ''We're painting the lily,'' Idone says. He has been known to tuck a ball of fresh mozzarella inside a mound of mashed potatoes, coat the whole thing with bechamel and bake it. ''You stick a spoon inside and pull out mashed potatoes, bechamel and a long string of this wonderful, fluffy cheese,'' he says. ''It's a little twisted. But if you're going to eat mashed potatoes, you might as well go whole hog.''
All of this may seem to be heavy going for spring and summer. Most chefs will replace the creamed and fried potatoes of winter with boiled potatoes tossed with vinaigrette. Idone indulges in a lusty potato salad made with homemade mayonnaise and dill pickles - but only in the privacy of home. At the restaurant, the potato salad will be tossed with steamed mussels and a Champagne vinaigrette. Mashed potatoes will also disappear from Idone's menu, but not from his personal repertory. ''In the country, there is nothing like spreading mashed potatoes on grilled steak and letting the juices blend into the potato,'' he says.
Potatoes are emotional, basic, elemental. They are, more than any other food, an object to be transformed and elevated, re-created and redesigned. As Charles Palmer says, ''This wouldn't happen with the turnip.''
 
SPRING SALMON, POTATO AND PESTO TERRINE
(From Charles Palmer, Aureole)
4 starchy Maine potatoes, each about fist size
1 1/2 pounds salmon - use center cut fillet - boneless, skinless
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
2 shallots, peeled
2 cups chicken stock
1 tablespoon, plus 1 1/2 cups, olive oil
 3/4 cups pesto
1/3 cup red-wine vinegar
Zest of 1 lemon
Juice of 1 lemon
1 bunch basil, leaves shredded
1 cup mixed greens, such as arugula, mache, purslane, etc.
 1/2 cup walnuts, toasted (see note).
1. Peel the potatoes and place in a large pot. Cover with cold salted water. Cook until the potatoes are tender, or when a knife inserted in the center of the potato slides out easily. Drain and allow to cool only long enough to handle. Slice the potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
2. Cut the salmon into 3 pieces and season both sides with salt and pepper. Slice 1 shallot and place on the bottom of a shallow pan. Put the salmon on top of the shallot and pour in the chicken stock and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. There should be enough liquid to cover the fish. Brush a piece of wax paper with oil and place over the fish. Cook over medium heat. When the liquid has come to a boil reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook 8 minutes, or until the fish is slightly pink in the center. Remove the salmon from the liquid and cool. Then break the meat with your fingers into small - about 1 1/2 inches - pieces.
3. Line a terrine mold or bread loaf pan approximately 3 1/2 by 7 by 3 inches with wax paper, cutting the paper to fit the mold precisely.
4. Place an even layer, about 1/4-inch deep, of salmon on the bottom of the mold. Press the salmon evenly into the mold. Using a pastry brush, brush the salmon with pesto.
5. Place a layer of potatoes on top of the salmon-pesto layer. Trim the potatoes to fit the mold precisely. Brush the layer of potatoes with pesto.
6. Repeat the process until there are 3 layers each of salmon and potatoes.
7. Cover the top of the terrine with plastic wrap and weight down with heavy cans that fit within the terrine. Refrigerate overnight.
8. Prepare the vinaigrette by mixing the 1 1/2 cups of olive oil, red-wine vinegar, lemon juice and zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Mince the remaining shallot and mix into the vinaigrette. Just before serving, add the shredded basil and pieces of broken walnuts.
9. Dress the greens, reserving some vinaigrette for saucing the terrine. Divide the greens among eight plates, placing the greens in the center.
10. Cut the terrine into eight slices. Place a piece on the greens and drizzle on the remaining vinaigrette.
Yield: Eight servings.
Note: To toast walnuts, spread the pieces on a cookie sheet. Cook in a preheated, 350-degree oven. About every 5 minutes, toss the pieces to assure even cooking. Cook until slightly darkened and crisp, about 15 minutes.
 
PETATOU DE CHEVRE FRAIS
(Potato tart with goat cheese, from Jean-Michel Diot, Park Bistro)
1 1/2 pounds new potatoes (preferably Yukon Gold)
1 cup heavy cream
1 egg yolk, beaten
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 bunch fresh basil, chopped
1 bunch fresh thyme, chopped
1 bunch fresh tarragon, chopped
1 bunch Italian parsley, chopped
3 shallots, chopped
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 10-ounce log goat cheese, cut in 6 even slices, preferably Coach Farm
 1/2 pound mesclun salad greens.
1. Place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold, salted water. Cook until the potatoes are tender. Drain, peel and slice into 1/2-inch rounds.
2. Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks, then gently fold in the egg yolk. Set aside.
3. In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar with half the herbs and shallots. Slowly whisk in the oil. Set aside.
4. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper to taste. Toss with the remaining herbs, the shallots and all but 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. Place the potatoes in the bottom of 6 small metal pastry rings set on a cookie sheet. Place a slice of cheese on top of each, pressing the cheese with a spoon to the edge of the ring. Refrigerate for half an hour.
5. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
6. Remove the rings from the potatoes. Place the potato-cheese rounds in the oven for 7 minutes. Spread 1 tablespoon of cream on top of each and glaze briefly under the broiler. With a spatula, carefully transfer to 6 small plates. Garnish with mesclun and drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over all.
Yield: Six appetizer servings.
 
HERBED MASHED POTATOES WITH ROQUEFORT
(From Christopher Idone, Ten Twenty-Two)
4 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and halved
1 cup milk
 1/2 cup heavy cream
7 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks less 1 tablespoon)
2 to 3 gratings fresh nutmeg
 1/4 cup mixed fresh herbs (use any combination of parsley, chives, thyme, rosemary or tarragon)
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
 1/4 pound Roquefort, crumbled into small pieces (see note).
1. Place the potatoes in lightly salted cold water to cover. Boil until their centers can be pierced easily with a knife, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes.
2. In a medium-sized saucepan, scald the milk and cream. Add the butter and continue cooking until the butter melts.
3. Place a ricer over a large saute pan and push the potatoes through the ricer.
4. Place the pan with the potatoes over medium heat and, stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually pour in the scalded milk. Mix until the potatoes are smooth and creamy.
5. Fold in the herbs and seasonings.
6. Serve on warm places and sprinkle with Roquefort cheese.
Yield: Four to six servings.
Note: Goat or sheep cheese can be substituted for Roquefort. To do so, cut the goat or sheep cheese into 1/4-inch disks. Place two disks over each portion of mashed potatoes.
 
POTATO LASAGNA WITH WILD MUSHROOMS AND HERB SAUCE
From Joachim Splichal, Patina restaurant)
4 large Idaho potatoes of equal size
8 ounces unsalted butter
3 ounces shiitake mushrooms (see note)
3 ounces oyster mushrooms (see note)
3 ounces white mushrooms
3 ounces chanterelles (optional)
1 large shallot,
 1/2 bunch parsley
Half a bunch, or 8 ounces, celery, diced
2 ounces leek, diced
1 ounce shallots, diced
1 ounce onions, diced
1 ounce butter
1 cup dry white wine
1 clove garlic
1 branch fresh thyme
Juice of 1/2 lemon
8 ounces butter
1 ounce diced tomatoes.
1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
2. Peel and cut the potatoes into rectangular shapes, about 3 by 1 1/2 inches.
3. Using a mandoline, a vegetable slicer or a sharp kitchen knife, slice each potato rectangle into 5 slices.
4. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and brush the parchment with the melted butter. Spread out the potato slices on a cookie sheet. Butter another piece of parchment paper and place, buttered side down, on the potatoes. Cook in the oven until the potatoes are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Chop all the mushrooms. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a saute pan and add the mushrooms. Cook over medium-low heat until they are soft. Add the finely chopped shallots and cook for 2 minutes more, or until the shallots are translucent.
6. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the diced celery, leeks, shallots and onion. Saute for about 5 minutes. Add the wine and, over high heat, reduce the liquid until it almost totally evaporates. Add 1 cup of water, the garlic, thyme and lemon juice and reduce it by a fourth. There should be 6 ounces of liquid. Strain through a sieve, pressing on the vegetables to release the juices. While the liquid is hot, pour it into a blender. Whir the liquid, adding 8 ounces of butter tablespoon by tablespoon. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the broth back into the pan and stir in the chopped parsley and diced tomatoes.
7. To serve, alternate slices of potato with mushrooms. Spoon the celery sauce over the potatoes and serve.
Yield: Four servings.
Note: If these mushrooms are unavailable, any variety can be substituted.

HEADLINE: Is America Abandoning Sick Patients?

BYLINE: By Susan Gilbert; Susan Gilbert is a freelance journalist and an editor of The Good Health Magazine.

 BODY:
WHEN 79-YEAR-OLD Ernesta Springer entered Doctors Hospital in New York for surgery on her right leg, she was in excruciating pain but she was able to walk. A month later, she was still in great pain. And now she could not get out of bed on her own. But because the treatment was completed for the particular ailments for which she had been admitted - a blocked artery as well as gangrene, both associated with diabetes - the hospital sent her home.
A week later she was back for more surgery on the gangrenous wound. Again she was discharged, still in pain and unable to walk. This time the hospital arranged for a nurse to visit her daily to change the dressing on the wound and monitor her condition. The nurse, Madalyn Benjamin, felt that Ernesta Springer should not have been at home: ''The wound was huge. The pain was huge. She was given no medication except Tylenol. The wound wasn't going to heal.'' Benjamin telephoned the patient's doctors, and she was admitted to the hospital yet a third time for surgery. 
Cases like this one, in which a patient is released from a hospital in unstable condition only to return days or weeks later for further treatment, are becoming more and more common, according to many medical professionals. And there is evidence that such cases are directly related to a cost-cutting measure instituted by the Federal Government known as diagnostic-related groups, or DRG's.
Virtually everyone involved in health care - physicians, hospital administrators, Government officials and insurers - agrees that DRG's have brought about profound change in the practice of medicine in the United States. Instead of allowing hospitals to set their own fees for in-patient care for Medicare recipients, the DRG system sets them. In doing so, it has given hospitals a powerful incentive to look for ways to save money, whether this means ordering fewer diagnostic tests or denying patients certain treatments. But the crucial question is this: has the incentive to save money led to more efficient medical care, or has it caused a general decline in the quality of medicine?
Today this question primarily involves care for the elderly, but it is becoming increasingly relevant to the medical treatment everyone receives. DRG's initially applied only to Medicare patients, most of whom are over the age of 65. But several states have adopted DRG's for administering Medicaid, the joint Federal and state health care program for poor people. And such private health insurance companies as The Travelers and Aetna Life & Casualty have recently begun using a reimbursement system similar to DRG's.
Some health professionals express strong convictions that the system is diminishing the quality of medical attention elderly patients receive. Doctors, nurses and social workers recount stories of patients being denied admission to hospitals, being told they cannot get certain kinds of treatment when they are admitted and being released while they are still sick. ''The fallout is that patients don't get as good care,'' says Dr. Thomas H. Dailey, a surgeon who is also president of the medical board at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
Many doctors, whether speaking on the record or not, say that DRG's have caused hospitals to cut back on costly services, such as intensive care and the use of state-of-the-art technology. Therefore, these services may go only to the sickest patients or to those who have private insurance or are wealthy enough to pay for treatment out of their own pockets. ''Most people don't realize there's rationing taking place,'' says Dr. Roger C. Bone, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. ''I see a trend developing in which some patients receive less and less medical care.''
MEDICARE WAS INSTITUTED IN 1965 AFTER Congress passed a law mandating that the Federal Government provide health insurance to all Americans age 65 and over, as well as younger people who are disabled. Approximately 33 million people are now enrolled in Medicare, all but three million of whom are elderly. (This figure includes people who are still employed and covered by private health insurance.) By the early 1980's, when medical costs were rising faster than the rate of inflation, the Reagan Administration had come to look upon Medicare as a gravy train for hospitals, because they could bill for an unlimited number of tests, surgical procedures and days a patient occupied a bed. The Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicare would run out of money by 1988, leaving millions of the sickest Americans without any medical insurance. In response, Congress passed legislation in 1982 requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to find a way to curb reimbursements.
The department turned to a novel system designed by two Yale professors that placed thousands of illnesses in about 500 categories called diagnostic-related groups. Each category was then assigned a fixed fee. There were regional variations in the fees for each DRG, and hospitals in large cities were paid more than rural hospitals, because their costs were presumably higher. In 1983 the department began implementing the system for all in-hospital services provided to Medicare recipients. Outpatient care and doctor visits, which cost less than hospitalization, are still paid for on the conventional fee-for-service basis. But the department is considering extending DRG's to them, too.
The DRG system has achieved its goal. The rate of increase of Medicare reimbursements for in-patient care declined dramatically, from nearly 19 percent from 1981 to 1982 to just 4 percent from 1987 to 1988. The incentive to cut costs has in some instances forced hospitals to operate more efficiently. Before DRG's, for example, it was not uncommon for patients to sit around the hospital for a day or so before receiving any treatment. Now, hospitals do not admit patients until the day medical procedures begin. There is also less superfluous testing. ''In the old days,'' Dr. Bone says, ''expensive tests were repeated, like putting catheters into the heart to test for heart failure.'' Not only is there less repetition of such tests today, but hospitals think twice before doing them at all.
THE DRG SYSTEM HAS ALSO had some troubling side effects, in addition to encouraging the premature discharge of patients like Ernesta Springer. For one thing, it's hard for patients to get admitted to a hospital unless their symptoms fit squarely into a DRG. ''If you have an old woman with swelling in her legs and shortness of breath who's too sick to get out of bed, you used to be able to bring her into the hospital for a cardiogram,'' says Dr. Dailey. ''Now, she has to sit at home until she has pulmonary edema and then be admitted through the emergency room.'' The first sign of pulmonary edema, or fluid in the lungs, is sometimes swelling of the legs, and early detection can help prevent respiratory failure - and save lives.
Some Medicare patients are denied services for which the Government reimbursement is so low that hospitals lose money. For example, a report in The New England Journal of Medicine last fall found that many hospitals won't give Medicare recipients a relatively new operation for deafness - the cochlear implant, widely regarded as the only treatment for severe deafness - because of the financial loss involved. The average cost for such an implant is $14,000, whereas the average Medicare payment for ear surgery is $10,000.
The reason hospitals are discharging patients earlier than they did before DRG's went into effect is that they can no longer bill Medicare for each day a patient stays. Under the old system, even after patients no longer needed daily care, they could spend a few extra days in the hospital just to rest. No more. Now, they are sometimes released even if they are still weak and in considerable pain from surgery.
''There might be someone who has just had a heart attack and is still paralyzed, and I'd have to talk to the family about discharge,'' says Elizabeth B. Dakin, a social worker who until recently helped coordinate discharge planning for St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York. ''I'd get pleas from families that weren't ready to take an invalid home. I'd explain to them that hospitals operate differently today.''
According to a report to be published this year by the Rand Corporation - the largest to date on the effects of DRG's - greater numbers of elderly people are being released from hospitals in unstable condition, with such medical problems as chest pain, rapid heartbeat and confusion. The researchers studied the records of 16,762 Medicare patients age 65 and over who had been admitted to 297 hospitals across the country. They found that the death rate for patients discharged in unstable condition was significantly higher than for those who had remained in the hospital until they had recovered. For example, 17 percent of the patients admitted with congestive heart failure who were discharged with three or more instabilities died within a month of the day they had entered the hospital, compared with just 5 percent of those released with no medical complications.
There is also evidence that recovery takes longer when patients are released from the hospital too early. A 1988 study in The New England Journal of Medicine looked at the records of 586 elderly patients treated for hip fractures at an unnamed Midwestern hospital before and after DRG's went into effect. Under the DRG system, patients were released about nine days earlier than before, and the percentage of those still recuperating in nursing homes a year after leaving the hospital had nearly quadrupled, from 9 to 33 percent.
IN THEIR DEFENSE, HOSPITALS contend that they have been forced to change their policies because they are losing money under the DRG system. Hospitals across the country are losing, on average, 8 cents on every dollar they spend caring for Medicare patients, according to the American Hospital Association. This adds up, because Medicare patients typically make up about 40 percent of a hospital's admissions. The financial burden is so great that since DRG's went into effect, record numbers of hospitals have shut their doors. Many have managed to stay in business only by eliminating or cutting back on certain costly services. These cutbacks are felt not only by the elderly, but by everyone.
In no area of medicine have cutbacks been more drastic than in intensive care. Although there are few figures available, doctors and hospital administrators say that some hospitals have either eliminated their intensive-care units or reduced their intensive-care services, because the financial loss can run into tens of thousands of dollars for each Medicare patient. In Chicago, for example, there is now just one respirator for every 50 chronically ill patients who need it, according to Dr. Bone. ''The patient who can benefit the most from it -and who can pay for it - gets it, and the rest have to wait,'' he says. ''They're sitting and waiting in emergency rooms, sometimes for days.'' Not everyone in the health care field agrees that the overall quality of medical treatment in America has suffered - yet. ''Appropriate high-quality health care is still in place,'' says Larry D. Krupala, chief executive officer of Cuero Community Hospital in rural Texas. ''But we're all fighting against a system that is dislodging that quality.'' Unless Medicare makes more money available to hospitals, he warns, ''quality will slip or access to medical care will slip. There will be a two-tiered system in which Medicare patients are denied intensive care and patients with money will get it.''
The Government maintains that health care has not deteriorated as a result of DRG's, and discounts the fear that this will happen in the future. ''Our responsibility is to assure access to quality medical care and to pay our fair share, and we're doing a perfectly adequate job,'' says Louis B. Hays, an administrator for the Health Care Financing Administration, the office within the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees Medicare. Hays also believes that hospitals overstate the financial strain that DRG's have placed on them. ''Medicare is not designed to assure the financial viability of hospitals,'' he says coolly. ''It is supposed to pay for the cost of treating patients and, on average, it does that. That doesn't mean that every case admitted does well under the system and that all hospitals do well.''
CRITICS OF DRG'S ARGUE that they have not really saved any money at all, but merely redistributed costs from the Government to individuals - closer to the way things were before Medicare. Elderly people who can afford it can buy extra hospital time or treatment either by paying for it themselves or by taking out supplemental insurance. The premiums for these so-called Medigap policies, like all private insurance, have risen dramatically in recent years, in part because increasing numbers of elderly people are filing claims to cover what Medicare doesn't. Those who can't afford to pay for hospital services beyond what Medicare provides may end up paying in other ways. If they leave the hospital in unstable condition, they will certainly need further care, either in a nursing home or from a visiting nurse or home-health aide in their own home. Indeed, many will require 24-hour monitoring. But Medicare pays for only 100 days in a nursing home and eight hours a day of home-nursing care for three weeks, and it does not cover the cost of a visiting home-health aide.
Whether or not patients who need 24-hour monitoring actually get it depends, again, on how much money they have. Those with enough money can pay for extra care, either through a Medigap policy or on their own. In some parts of the country, round-the-clock home-health care for a year can easily run $40,000. Patients with low incomes, and the figure varies from state to state - $459 per month for a single person in New York, for example, and $600 in California - can rely on Medicaid to pay for home-health care. But the vast numbers of elderly people in the middle class get stuck.
They have two options, neither of them appealing. One is to do without professional health care and rely on relatives and friends. ''Sometimes we must teach a significant other what to do,'' says Judith H. Levy, director of patient services at Home Health Services of Westchester Jewish Community Services, in White Plains. Even such complex procedures as using a suctioning device to draw excess fluid from the lungs may fall to a relative or friend. The patient's other option is to spend so much of his income and savings on home care that he becomes poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. This is what people in the home-care industry refer to as ''spending down.'' To avoid having to spend down, and to be eligible for Medicaid from the start of their illness, some elderly people have become adept at seeming poorer than they really are - for example, by transferring their assets to their children or other relatives.
The Government's savings under DRG's have also forced younger, privately insured patients to pay more. Hospitals acknowledge that they count on insurance companies to pay more for treatment than the Government. ''That's a fact of life,'' says Larry Krupala, of Cuero Community Hospital. By way of example, he says, if Medicare pays $3,500 for a particular operation, a hospital might charge a privately insured person $5,000 for the same procedure in an effort to recoup its loss.
''There always was a differential between Medicare reimbursement and private reimbursement,'' says Elliot Wicks, an associate director at the Health Insurance Association of America, in Washington. ''But our tentative research shows that private insurance companies have been paying even higher prices as a result of DRG's.'' This is one reason why premiums for some individual and group health insurance policies have jumped by 100 percent or more in the last year. It is also one reason why some private health insurers are attempting to trim their reimbursements by turning to systems modeled on DRG's. As more insurance companies follow suit, hospitals will have a more difficult time shifting their costs, and many more will probably have to close their doors.
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE solution is largely a matter of money. But the United States already spends a greater portion of its gross national product on health care than any other country in the world - and 20 percent flows to administrative costs alone. So, rather than spend even more, the solution is likely to be to spend money more intelligently.
Many doctors and policy makers have come to the opinion that the only way to insure quality care at an affordable price is to revamp the entire system of health care delivery. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, has identified reform of the health care system as a major national issue, and proposals for several alternatives are being hammered out in the Government as well as by private researchers. A group of doctors based in Cambridge, Mass., have formally proposed the unthinkable: national health insurance. Under this proposal all hospital and medical care for every citizen would be paid for by the Federal Government; there would be no private insurance, no insurance premiums and no deductibles. The doctors allow that some sort of tax increase would be needed to finance their plan, but they estimate that the increased taxes would be no greater than what individuals now pay in premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket medical expenses.
There's no guarantee that a new health insurance system would be any more successful than the present one at delivering high-quality medical care to all unless health experts come to an agreement on just what high-quality care is. Few people would argue that when a person dies because he or she has been discharged from a hospital too soon, the quality of care is less than it should be. But beyond that there is considerable debate. The Rand Corporation and other research institutions are studying a wide range of medical procedures in an effort to determine which ones work for particular patients and which ones do not. Only when this is clearly understood will insurers be able to make their cuts with surgical precision and will patients no longer have to settle for second best.

HEADLINE: A LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE

BYLINE: By GODFREY HODGSON; Godfrey Hodgson, the foreign editor of The Independent of London, has published several books on United States politics, including ''America in Our Time.''

 BODY:

OUR COUNTRY
The Shaping of America From Roosevelt to Reagan.
By Michael Barone.
805 pp. New York: The Free Press. $29.95.
Around 1980, Michael Barone remarks in a somewhat lofty vein at one point in ''Our Country,'' his new history of modern American politics, ''the standard paradigms which members of the American elite used to understand and explain events'' began to cloud rather than clarify their understanding. Those ''paradigms,'' he explains, were ''analyses of the leaders of big American units,'' as well as ''a focus on domestic markets and domestic elections.'' 
The remark may or may not be pertinent: it is in any case a little surprising, since the method of this serious and thoughtful attempt at both telling and interpreting the last 60 years of American history is to examine those very three dimensions, in particular the first and last of them.
The method is easy to parody, even to mock. Mr. Barone is a senior writer for U.S. News and World Report and one of the authors of ''The Almanac of American Politics,'' a reference book that is indispensable to politicians and their handlers, political scientists, reporters and others involved in the business of politics, not to mention amateur enthusiasts like the present reviewer.
Sometimes the spirit of the ''Almanac'' steps out from the curb and gives Mr. Barone the historian a speeding ticket. As the narrative of ''Our Country'' moves toward Watergate's finale, for example, the author, in search of illustrations, returns - as he does quite often -to his native Michigan, and dumps the reader in ''the heavily Republican sugar beet and bean fields of the so-called Thumb of Michigan's mitten-shaped Lower Peninsula - the descendant of the district which in another special election in November 1931 had first signaled that the bottom had fallen out politically for Herbert Hoover.'' Sandbagged by electoral and agrarian expertise, this reader sank to his knees in those Republican bean fields. It took a perceptible effort of will to rise and leave that unmemorable contest and follow Richard Nixon to the end of his political night.
Yet if the writing is occasionally pedestrian, and the reader sometimes overwhelmed with political ephemera, Mr. Barone has a story to tell whose sweep is irresistible: nothing less than the fortunes of the United States from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, or from Herbert Hoover to George Bush (it doesn't sound quite such a long way, somehow, if you put it like that).
Mr. Barone starts in the 1920's with contrasting portraits of William Howard Taft, former President and incumbent Chief Justice, and Charles F. Murphy, sachem of Tammany Hall, as emblematic representatives of ''two contending approaches to American politics and two different cultures,'' which Mr. Barone calls the ''Yankees'' and the ''Ellis Islanders.'' He rounds off his story, by way of cadence and symmetry, with a picture of Ronald Reagan, Ellis Islander and ''son of a WPA worker,'' standing side by side with George Bush, ''the son of an investment banker,'' to receive the ''surrender'' of Mikhail Gorbachev.
As that image suggests, Mr. Barone's tone is what used to be called Pollyanna-ish: his purpose is to show how everything has turned out for the best in the best of all possible countries, and incidentally to deliver a few passing kicks to those who spoil the chorus of self-congratulation by asking awkward questions.
One of his themes is the resolution of the former antagonism between Yankee and Ellis Islander in a contemporary society that he finds, in almost theological terms, at once perfectly unified and infinitely pluralistic. He is less interested in the resolution of other ancient schisms in American life: between North and South, black and white, have and have not.
Such unresolved conflicts would be out of place in his picture of a country ''that emerged confident from years of turmoil and stayed resilient after years of alienation . . . a country that belonged not just to the many different kinds of Americans but to peoples all over the world.'' Such language is neither historical nor reportorial but inspirational and nationalistic.
It is Mr. Barone's contention that after 1947 - that is, after the four years of rapid economic growth that occurred during World War II -the country was so well-off that ''the politics of economic redistribution,'' which had dominated the 1930's, had been swept aside by continuing prosperity. It is true enough that in the United States, as everywhere else, growing prosperity has allowed people to focus less on economic survival and more on other issues, whether pride or prejudice or what are somewhat loosely known as ethics. But you would have had to be a saint to tread the halls of Congress these last 20 years and remain unaware that a considerable amount of economic redistribution has been on the agenda, even if by no means all of it has been from the rich to the poor.
Another of Mr. Barone's organizing themes is the shift from the collective to the fragmented, or, as he puts it, from big units to small units. When Roosevelt took office in the crisis of 1933, Mr. Barone rightly says, ''the country wanted action; it wanted order; it wanted control. . . . Franklin Roosevelt promised these things, and he delivered.'' Moreover, not only was the action collective, the philosophy underlying it was collectivist.
By 1977, however, ''the faith that government could solve all problems was vanishing.'' And by 1980, ''the idea of common effort came to seem absurd.'' From 1940 to 1965, Mr. Barone asserts, most jobs were created by ''big units,'' that is, by major corporate and government institutions, but from 1965 to 1980 they came from ''small units.'' These are just three examples of his willingness to fall into wild generalizations that may be in accord with prevailing political and intellectual fashion, but would need to be supported by far more evidence than he adduces before they could be taken very seriously. Nowhere does Mr. Barone seem aware, for instance, that one reason why so many jobs have been created by small units is because the managers of big units perceived advantages for themselves in subcontracting and shedding overhead.
That is only one example of Mr. Barone's limitations. He has written a thoughtful and energetic account of American history since the Great Depression. But when he looks for the causes and mechanisms of change, all he seems to find are his own convictions, those of a well-informed neoconservative who writes with nostalgia of the old Democratic mainstream and with ill-temper of the new Democratic Left, and who thinks Lloyd Bentsen, had he been at the top of the Democratic ticket, might have won the 1988 election.

ENTERPRISE
The Dynamic Economy of a Free People.
By Stuart Bruchey.
645 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press.
Paper, $24.95. Cloth, $49.50.
In ''Enterprise,'' Stuart Bruchey, a professor emeritus of economic history at Columbia University, writes a rich and comprehensive survey spanning four centuries of the American economy. The narrative opens in 1607 with the image of ''three small ships carrying 105 colonists'' sailing into Chesapeake Bay. The well-known epoch then unfolds - colonization, the Revolution, the founding of the Republic, all filled with hope and promise. By the close, however, when Mr. Bruchey reflects on the relative economic decline of the United States, the mood becomes somber as he asks: ''Can America keep [its] heights?'' 
In the intervening 540 pages, Mr. Bruchey presents a wealth of material on American economic growth and development. He enlivens his narrative with the debates of past historians and the findings of contemporary research. He shows how statutes, judicial decisions and government intervention at all levels helped or hindered the workings of enterprise.
Mr. Bruchey also taps important literature from outside the realm of economics to consider the values animating individual and corporate action. (Particularly noteworthy is the evidence from David C. McClelland's book ''The Achieving Society'' about the psychological factors that give rise to motivation in children.) In general, the book proceeds by defining the historical issues, offering the evidence from various sources and weighing the alternative views. The reader, engaged in a kind of Socratic dialogue, is left to make the final judgment. Indeed, Mr. Bruchey's admirable effort at providing objective balance is pushed at times almost to a fault.
From the nation's beginnings, as Mr. Bruchey recounts, businessmen, farmers, merchants and budding industrialists took perilous risks where established corporations feared to venture. At the same time, scarce labor commanded higher real wages than back home in England and on the Continent, a powerful incentive for the United States work ethic that has persisted until very recent decades. Along with political and religious freedom, the Promised Land held out the attraction of privately owned homes, businesses and farms, as well as the lure of membership in a substantial, propertied middle class that dominated society, at least in the North, even before the Revolution.
Yet, as Mr. Bruchey writes, studies have shown that despite high real incomes, vast untapped natural resources and unusually fertile soil, poverty emerged on an ''appalling'' scale in Boston, Philadelphia and New York before 1776. ''Desperately poor'' lived near ''fabulously wealthy.'' Thus, inequities of income and wealth were features of the American scene long before robber barons appeared in the 1880's. Throughout this history, Mr. Bruchey follows income disparities as they widened (notably in the decades around 1900 and in the 1920's) and narrowed (in World War I and during 1930-50) and then sharply grew again in the 1980's.
As Mr. Bruchey progresses from agriculture to commerce, industry and finance, it becomes clear that even enterprising Americans have always readily turned to government for help. And government has responded: to expand markets, sustain competition, promote economic justice and control the business cycle. Agriculture is a prime example, presenting, in Mr. Bruchey's words, ''one of the truly amazing facts of American history'': whereas, in 1790, 85 percent of the American labor force was required to satisfy the agricultural needs of the new nation's four million people, by the 1980's less than 3 percent fed a population exceeding 230 million, while generating huge surplus crops for export that turned the United States into the world's breadbasket. As America's green revolution took off after World War II, Mr. Bruchey writes, the miracles of agricultural science and applied technology often ''completed what government . . . had begun.'' How different this revolution might have been if the Government had not granted homesteads to new settlers (Homestead Act, 1862); established land-grant colleges (Morrill Act, 1862), agricultural research stations (Hatch Act, 1887) and local cooperative services (Smith-Lever Act, 1914); and fostered a partnership with farmers and agribusiness that continues to this day.
What is striking about the role of government, particularly during the 1930's, is how much Presidential decisions, both Republican and Democratic, were determined by the need to make the American economic system work. It was the Republican Herbert Hoover, not the New Dealer Franklin Roosevelt, who pressed for ''a cooperative system in which public and private organizations worked together to achieve national objectives.'' Hoover sounded more Keynesian than did the early Roosevelt: cutting wages, in his view, would only ''deepen the depression by suddenly reducing purchasing power and bringing about industrial strife.'' He pushed for lower income taxes to spur consumption and advocated public works to counter the collapse of business investment. His policy ideas - certainly ''not . . . imprisoned by an ideology of laissez faire'' - eventually became the Federal Farm Board, Home Loan banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
''At stake,'' says Mr. Bruchey, ''was the viability of American capitalism.'' The safety net created by the Federal Government during the 1930's caught not only individual farmers and workers, but also endangered financial institutions. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, for example, lent more than $2 billion to 8,500 banks and invested $1 billion in the capital stock of 6,000 banks - one-third of the system's total capital in 1933. How different from the Reagan philosophy of the 1980's, when government was considered part of ''the problem,'' not part of the solution!
On turning the final page of this book, the reader is struck by what Mr. Bruchey has achieved. His grand pageant of American economic history reveals a powerful private and public ethic that shaped the course of ideas and events. Mr. Bruchey's title, therefore, seems inadequate to the story he tells. Yes, ''enterprise'' per se explains much of the dynamic economy of a free people. But one can only speculate how the United States might have fared without often wise and visionary government intervention that gave impetus to free enterprise in the 1860's, that restrained its excesses in the 1880's and 1890's, that rescued the very capitalist system in the 1930's and that sustained and nurtured growth after World War II. Enterprise and government in partnership describes more fully the historical dynamic of America's economy.
In any event, scholars and students will reap dividends for years to come from Mr. Bruchey's 25-year investment in researching and writing this book. It offers the well-informed citizen an illuminating perspective on how the nation's economic performance in the 1980's strayed from the mainstream of American history, and the challenges that aberration poses for the 1990's.

THE FAMILY
By Buchi Emecheta.
239 pp. New York:
George Braziller. Paper, $8.95. Cloth, $17.95.
''The writer with the tin ear,'' wrote John Gardner, in his book ''On Becoming a Novelist,'' who is good enough at other things, ''may in the end write deeper, finer novels than the most eloquent verbal musicians.'' It was the writer's facility with those ''other things'' -the development of ''character, action, setting'' and ideas, which Gardner called ''profluence'' - that compelled the reader to turn the page. 
There are, of course many novelists whose prose is both poetic and profluent: Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison, Nathanael West. But some of the most highly regarded novelists (Balzac, Crane, Orwell), as Gardner suggested, are no poets at all.
Most readers, no doubt, would include the works of the Nigerian writer Buchi Emecheta in the latter category. The prose in her latest novel, ''The Family,'' like that of her earlier works (particularly ''Double Yoke'' and ''The Slave Girl'') is generally vivid, plain and clear - the kind of prose that illuminates rather than buries the characters and settings it describes: ''Winston was everything Gladys said he was, so why did she feel this eel of distrust coiled about [his] memory?'' But there are times when the language is barely firm enough to carry images and ideas: ''Gwendolen was not the cleverest of people. She could be slow, but she was not thick-skinned.''
Nevertheless, occasional lapses such as this do not hinder our being moved and intrigued by the novel's principal character, Gwendolen Brillianton, a young girl from Granville, Jamaica, whose mother and father leave her with her grandmother, Granny Naomi, to seek a better life for themselves in England, the ''Moder Kontry.'' Very soon after their departure, a close family friend molests the 8-year-old Gwendolen. And because ''she did not like Uncle Johnny troubling her at night, and she did not like to see Granny Naomi unhappy,'' Gwendolen flees to the home of her paternal grandmother, Elinor, who lives in Kingston. But before she is even fully reacquainted with her family in Kingston they rebuff her, intimating that because they are fair-skinned and Gwendolen dark, she does not belong. Thus far, less than one-tenth of the narrative has been traversed. Gwendolen will see and feel much, much more once her parents finally send for her.
In this rich, complex and fast-moving novel, one breathlessly follows Gwendolen from Granville to London in her search for love, family and a place ''where she could be herself - happy, trusting Gwendolen again.'' And through this journey we see her suffer rape, incest, racism, teen-age pregnancy and loneliness. She endures the indignities of illiteracy and remedial education, falls in love with a boy her mother describes as a ''dirty white'' and veers toward madness. We witness the social and economic dynamics that force both Gwendolen and her mother to ''remain alive for others. . . . to look after members of their families, to boost the ego of the man in their lives, be the man a father, a husband, or even a son. And they were to nurture and act as agony aunts to their offspring. But to live for themselves was not to be.''
In many ways Ms. Emecheta probably speaks from experience. Not only is she a novelist, a research fellow at the University of Calabar, Nigeria, and a member of Britain's Advisory Council to the Home Secretary on Race and Equality, but she is also a mother of five. She speaks from a vantage point that few of us know. Her London, for example, is a cold, gray, multicultural world, a world made up of Ibos, Anglos, Yorubas, Jamaicans - both fair and dark - Greeks, Indians, the educated, the undereducated, the dispossessed, the alienated. Ms. Emecheta's novel shows us - as do many other important works of African and African-American literature - that a large number of the problems that plague the African diaspora - rootlessness, ''hue prejudice,'' self-hatred and perhaps even some of the sexual violence that nearly destroys Gwendolen - are the direct result of slavery and colonialism. But Buchi Emecheta is no ideologue; her characters do not utter or think words that would not come from them; they are not mere representatives of larger social movements but real, complex human beings, shaped by the vicissitudes of class, culture and sexual politics. She raises the right questions, but never harangues. She writes with subtlety, power and abundant compassion. ''The Family'' is a good book, and one not easily forgotten.

THE MEDICAL TRIANGLE
Physicians, Politicians and the Public.
By Eli Ginzberg.
314 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $27.50.
If anyone can make sense of the mammoth American health system and explain it to a lay person, it is Eli Ginzberg. Director of Columbia University's Conservation of Human Resources Project and the author of this collection of essays, Mr. Ginzberg has been a keen observer of the American health scene since before World War II and continues to be a strong voice in the debate on this nation's health policy. Unlike so many experts pronouncing on that subject today, though, he has never been a captive of a particular ideology or of a well-heeled interest group. He tends to report the truth as he perceives it, and these essays, all of which have been previously and separately published, are no exception. 
In the first part of the book, Mr. Ginzberg harks back to the good old days, when medical care was cheaper and the health system rested firmly on three stable pillars: the dominance of the medical profession in all matters of health policy; reliable local sponsorship of the community hospital as the doctor's free workshop; and the widely accepted principle that the care of poor patients is best financed through hidden cross-subsidies, whereby the premiums paid by insured patients cover the care of uninsured patients. In the past 30 years, though, this idyllic world, so Mr. Ginzberg says, has been increasingly ''destabilized'' by a few major factors: a surplus of physicians and hospital beds (New York City being the one place actually plagued by a shortage); the opening of the health sector to unbridled entrepreneurship; and the collectivization of health care financing under private or public health insurance.
Until the late 1960's, most health care was relatively simple, and much of it could be paid for by patients when they were treated. Because physicians and other providers of health care were then in short supply, they could count on good incomes without having to charge patients anything near what the traffic would have borne. In such a world, doctors and hospitals easily gained the affection of the community and were thus at peace with the world.
Furthermore, because health care was then simpler, kindly acts toward the poor came at a low price. One was not talking about bestowing upon an indigent patient the equivalent of a Mercedes-Benz (roughly the total cost of a coronary bypass in many parts of the country - certainly in New York City) or of a Rolls-Royce (often the cost of helping a premature infant to enter this world or a dying patient to leave it with greater comfort).
But in the 1960's, as the system became flooded with doctors and hospital beds, and third-party health insurance coverage became common, medicine inevitably became more commercialized, which simply meant that fees and the proverbial bottom line preoccupied health care providers more and more. In such a world, there was bound to be growing anxiety on the supply side and deep suspicion on the demand side - in short, rancor all around. What also emerged was a greater reluctance to lower the bottom line through charity care.
Although Mr. Ginzberg does not put it quite this directly, that is what ''destabilization'' is really all about. He appears to deplore this trend and argues that it must be slowed and reversed, but does not say how. To be fair, the answer is certainly not obvious, at least for this country. Unless Americans are willing to countenance the regulatory strictures of the more stable health care systems in Canada and Europe - which they are unlikely to do - destabilization is here to stay, and we had better all get used to it.
After illuminating the general situation at the beginning of his book, Mr. Ginzberg trains his spotlight on selected facets of the health care system. There are essays on academic health centers (medical schools combined with hospitals), on needed reforms of medical education, on the role and fate of community health centers, on the supply of physicians, on the nursing shortage, on the rationing of health care, on health care for the poor and on many more topics.
Throughout the book, Mr. Ginzberg debunks the many myths and contradictions that so often distort the public debate on health policy. In his chapter on nursing, for example, he bluntly reminds nursing's leaders that ''there is something contradictory in a policy that both advocates expanding the supply [of nurses, through subsidies to nursing education] and insists on raising the salaries.'' In an earlier chapter, he quite ably defends the proposition that ''the competitive market [in health care] is an opponent, not an ally, of cost containment'' - a thesis that many economic theorists will find counterintuitive, but that seems compatible with the data. Mr. Ginzberg does not see any prospect for the much-heralded large-scale privatization of American health care beyond current levels, and indeed argues that our increasingly fragile private health insurance system might not even survive a deep recession.
Other observers of American health care might assume a strident tone for such a book, but that is not Mr. Ginzberg's style. His attitude reminds one of an elder who beholds the unruly behavior of teen-age grandchildren with loving and bemused detachment. Throughout the book, he strives to be evenhanded. For example, physicians will be pleased to read that he admires American medicine's many achievements. (After all, he notes, few foreigners come here any more to study how we make cars, cameras or machine tools; but legions still come to learn at the side of America's physicians.) At the same time, physicians will be chagrined that he does not cast lawyers as the chief culprits in the malpractice crisis, and instead chiefly blames medicine for failing to police its own ranks.
Mr. Ginzberg's essays are not aimed at well-read students of American health policy who require the more penetrating analysis he easily could have supplied. Instead, the book seems pitched at the uninitiated - patients and health care providers alike - who so often find our medical system bewildering and, therefore, both frustrating and frightening. For these readers, this volume will illuminate the workings of the institutions that sooner or later will touch them more intimately than even their houses of worship do.

HEADLINE: NOTED WITH PLEASURE

 BODY:

Plenipotent
 During the Revolutionary War, Benjamin Franklin was sent to Paris to woo France for the infant United States. The all-inclusiveness of his wooing irritated John Adams, the future President, who wrote this priggish letter home. It is quoted in ''Mon Cher Papa: Franklin and the Ladies of Paris'' by Claude-Anne Lopez (Yale University).
 The Life of Dr. Franklin was a Scene of continual discipation. I could never obtain the favour of his Company in a Morning before Breakfast which would have been the most convenient time to read over the Letters and papers, deliberate on their contents, and decide upon the Substance of the Answers. It was late when he breakfasted, and as soon as Breakfast was over, a crowd of Carriages came to his Levee or if you like the term better, to his Lodgings, with all sorts of People; some Phylosophers, Accademicians and Economists . . . but by far the greater part were Women and Children, come to have the honour to see the great Franklin, and to have the pleasure of telling Stories about his Simplicity, his bald head and scattering strait hairs, among their Acquaintances. 
 
You Can't Kiss Fame
 Fame and even favorable reviews were not enough for Alfred Tennyson. Here we see the great poet hungering for more homely gratifications. This report by a friend is quoted by Christopher Ricks in the second edition of his ''Tennyson'' (University of California).
 On my way in, paid a visit to Tennyson, who seemed much out of spirits, and said that he could no longer bear to be knocked about the world, and that he must marry and find love and peace or die. He was very angry about a favourable review of him. Said that he could not stand the chattering and conceit of clever men, or the worry of society, or the meanness of tuft-hunters, or the trouble of poverty, or the labour of a place, or the preying of the heart on itself. . . . He complained much about growing old, and said he cared nothing for fame, and that his life was all thrown away for want of a competence and retirement. Said that no one had been so much harassed by anxiety and trouble as himself. I told him he wanted occupation, a wife, and orthodox principles, which he took well.
 
After Love, Give Me Air
 When people make love in Frederick Busch's novels, they breathe up all the air in the room. This is from ''Harry and Catherine'' (Knopf).
 Now I lay me down to sleep, she thought. Thanks for the tomatoes in the pantry waiting to be washed, and the peppers and zucchini, the oregano and thyme. But I have to ask, she thought, pressing her nose and mouth into the side of his neck, its salty taste, what's supposed to happen next? To remind us for sure that we are not supposed to wait a long time and love long-distance and finally hop in the sack to find truth, justice, contentment, and measured form while living sweetly, stupidly, happily forever after?
And what happened was that she woke. Nothing saddened or disturbed her, and the falling temperatures and rising wind, the gentle, expected music of windowpanes shaken, were soothing, not unsettling. But she'd been asleep, in deep, exhausted, grateful sleep, and then she lay with her eyes open, a light sweat on her skin, and her breathing just a little fast. As if he sensed her unsettlement, Harry pulled at her. . . . He was a comforting and greedy man, she thought. But she felt that what she needed more than his needful generosity was air. She heard it outside, and she thirsted for it.
I Can't Imagine You Either
 Teen-agers can also be profound. This is 15-year-old Jimmy O'Neill, who was born with cystic fibrosis. He is one of 14 children in ''How It Feels to Fight for Your Life'' by Jill Krementz (Little, Brown).
 My life is different from those of other kids but because I've grown up with it, it's something I've gotten used to. It's probably as hard for you to imagine what my life is like as it is for me to imagine how some other people live. I can't see how a stockbroker might get up at three-thirty in the morning and not get home until ten at night. . . . I suppose there are all sorts of people who are so used to what they have to do that it doesn't seem weird. It's how they live. I think in some ways I'm better off than some kids who get paralyzed or go blind all of a sudden. It's so much easier if you don't know what you're missing because you've never had it to begin with.
 
Ambling, Not Shambling
 Here's a postcard view of our grandfathers 200,000 years ago. They were handsomer than we generally suppose, says Michael H. Brown in ''The Search for Eve'' (Harper & Row).
 They lived where the rhino took dust baths, where the gazelle gathered, and where the giant buffalo roamed. By day they could be glimpsed making their way across the vast savannah, vague upright forms that were decidedly not animals and yet lithely intermingled with them. They moved from tree to acacia tree, foraging among the ambling giraffe, the skittish, dust-kicking wildebeest, the swollen zebras, sticks in hand, wary of lion, their gait purposeful and yet very cautious - a slow and steady and gliding gait. Certainly it was not the stooped and lumbering image commonly accorded to cavemen. Some carried ostrich eggs and kindling twigs, others water baskets woven with hide and ambary fibers, still others wooden poles or slender stone blades.

NELSON ALGREN: THE MESSAGE STILL HURTS

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BANKS; Russell Banks teaches creative writing at Princeton University; his most recent novel is ''Affliction.''

 BODY:
It shouldn't surprise me that Nelson Algren, clearly one of the best novelists of his time, is not much read these days. It's the ''kill the messenger'' syndrome, I suppose, for the news that Algren's works brings us is not good news: if the world he describes is at all like our own, then it's not morning in America, and it hasn't been for a long, long time. In an Algren novel or story, the only thing that trickles down to where most folks live is disdain, violence and sometimes, on a good day, benign neglect; racism, greed, sadism and misogyny are the warp and woof of our social fabric; the workers are not happy and a lot of them are pregnant teen-agers, have no homes, no food, no jobs and no prospects for same.
Of course, he's writing about another time and a faraway place, right? In ''A Walk on the Wild Side'' it's the early Depression, east Texas and New Orleans, old Perdido Street; his characters are pimps and prostitutes, con men, drug addicts and alcoholics, homeless wanderers, illiterate whites and blacks trying to ''make an honest dollar in a crooked sort of way.'' In ''The Man With the Golden Arm,'' it's Chicago's back alleys and mean streets in the 1940's, derelicts and dopers, bitter castaways and undeserving castoffs. 
And what's that got to do with America a half-century later in the go-go 1990's? All too much, I'm afraid. Which may be the reason we'd rather leave Algren unread on the shelf, him and the writers he was influenced by: Theodore Dreiser, Upton Sinclair, Frank Norris, Sherwood Anderson, Richard Wright. We want to think them irrelevant, because if they're not, if the truth they have to tell about America still holds, then we're in deep trouble, friend, so we better kill the messenger.
But Nelson Algren's hard to kill. When he was around, he was feisty, funny, resilient, and until his 60's - when he wearied of the fight to gain the respect that his lesser, more polite contemporaries gathered with ease - prolific. He left us a significant body of work, much of which has been out of print for some time and is being reissued by two presses (see box). But more to the point, he wrote well. He wrote brilliantly, especially in ''A Walk on the Wild Side,'' and ''The Man With the Golden Arm, which are, to my mind, his best, most artistically successful books. His language lasts: the voice of an Algren story or novel is unmistakably his, as permanently, flat-out American as Twain's and Crane's and more authentic than Hemingway's. There's a combination of layered and compressed writing (a truly rare combination of virtues; writers usually have one or the other) that reminds me of Eudora Welty and William Kennedy at their best.
''A Walk on the Wild Side,'' in particular, suggests Mr. Kennedy, who was understandably irritated when told that in ''Ironweed'' his subjects were ''just bums'' - as if his characters were too marginal, too ''simple,'' to care about. I've heard the same thing said about Algren's characters, and in response have felt that if they are marginal, then so are we all. Algren's antiheroic protagonist in ''A Walk on the Wild Side,'' Dove Linkhorn, is an illiterate homeless kid with a broad back and a good sense of humor who tries to make it in a world that has no place for him (a character not unlike Fielding's Tom Jones, say, or Voltaire's Candide, or, in another guise, Salinger's Holden Caulfield - someone losing his innocence by trying to get by in a fallen world). And he's a hell of a lot more like most of us than is Hemingway's Nick Adams or Thomas Wolfe's Eugene Gant, young American males who want only to go home again, romantic heroes longing to leave the real world, boys who dream of a prelapsarian maternal lap and, failing to obtain it, dissolve in elegiac bitterness.
I was lucky enough to know Nelson when I was young. Childless, he took a lot of young writers under his wing (Terry Southern, Bruce Jay Friedman, numerous others), providing fatherly protection, encouragement and example all at once. I was a 23-year-old pipefitter in Concord, N.H., who hadn't gone to college but had written a novel that, despite a few striking paragraphs here and there, was quite simply awful. I took off work for a week and lugged my manuscript to the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont, where Algren was on the staff, more or less. (John Ciardi, the director, thought less; Algren thought more.) He read my manuscript, as he was paid to do, quickly located those few striking paragraphs and pointed them out to me and made it clear that I was supposed to do the rest myself (and what more can an apprentice writer ask of a master, anyhow?). But meanwhile, he said, since I had wheels and we were stuck up here on this mountain surrounded by writers drinking sherry with their little fingers in the air, and since he, like Jack Kerouac, didn't drive, why didn't I take him to Middlebury for a beer and then maybe we'd go on to visit his pal Paul Goodman, who had a summer place somewhere nearby? We did, and that was the end of my tour at Bread Loaf, more or less.
Algren in person was a lot like his books - large-hearted, funny, angry, lonely. He spoke the truth to power wherever he met power (and he saw injustice where most people preferred to see only good intentions gone awry, which made him no friend to bourgeois academics and intellectuals: he trusted a brutal, racist Chicago cop more than a suburban Republican banker). To those of us who loved him, he could sometimes seem perversely self-defeating: he was unable to resist any chance to tweak the beard of somber authority.
In the mid-1960's, I helped get him invited to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (where I was at last in college) for a reading and talk. To fatten the embarrassingly thin honorarium, the university had offered to pick up the tab for his expenses while in town, but instead of staying at the Carolina Inn, an antebellum establishment that offended his sensibilities, Nelson chose to stay with me and my wife at our tiny off-campus bungalow. When the university refused to pay for his expenses, Nelson submitted an itemized bill for everything he had eaten and drunk in my home, plus laundry charges, for a total of $62.80. When they still refused to pay, Nelson got a friend in Chicago, who may or may not have been a lawyer, but at least had stationery, to write threatening letters to the bursar, dean and president. And when that didn't work, Nelson wrote letters to all the local newspapers, which they gladly published, until he had a full-blown negative publicity campaign under way. Finally, just to make him go away, the university coughed up a check for $62.80, which, in triumph, he immediately made over to me. That was, of course, the last time I was allowed to invite speakers to the University of North Carolina.
''The Man With the Golden Arm,'' published in 1949, was the winner of the first National Book Award for fiction, and it may be the best book they ever gave it to. Algren never recovered from Otto Preminger's misappropriation of the novel for Frank Sinatra's film - there's always something indecently innocent about a streetwise writer. Only Walt Whitman would have been more offended by a film version of his work. But the novel has outlived the film, as the good ones inevitably do. And I suspect that Frankie Machine will outlive Frankie Sinatra.
''A Walk on the Wild Side,'' which Algren at times seemed to think little of, is to my mind an American classic, a home-grown version of the European Bildungsroman, to be read alongside ''Huckleberry Finn,'' ''The Red Badge of Courage'' and ''Native Son.'' Driven by a permanent democrat's righteous wrath at injustice, informed by unsentimental respect and unabashed affection for the powerless, in language colored throughout by the pain of some unnamed, deeply personal wound whose nature we can only intuit, the novel is at once a radical critique of the American economy and a grief-stricken portrait of its victims. And finally, that's what makes this book so wonderful - the people who live inside it. Dove Linkhorn, the east Texas drifter who, like a youthful Willy Loman taken to his logical Marxist extreme, can succeed as a salesman only by becoming a pimp; Kitty Twist, a 17-year-old runaway who's looking for a good pickpocket to settle down with; all the other women who work on Perdido Street - Five, named for the shape of her navel, and Hallie Breedlove and Frenchy - tough, smart women who survive and love one another and keep on cracking hard-edged jokes, even though ''the courts were against them, the police were against them, businessmen, wives, churches, press, politicians and their own panders were against these cork-heeled puppets.'' Because ''A Walk on the Wild Side'' is a permanent part of our literature, these people, who continue to live among us, will continue to be heard. That's all Nelson ever wanted his work to accomplish, and what writer could want more?
 
 
 
This essay has been adapted from the foreword to a reissue of ''A Walk on the Wild Side,'' to be published next month by Thunder's Mouth Press.

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT;
Derby Love, Same Time Each Year

BYLINE: By WILLIAM MURRAY; William Murray's latest novel about the track, ''The Getaway Blues,'' will be published by Bantam this summer.

 BODY:
''You're going to the Kentucky Derby?'' my friend Angles Beltrami asked me a couple of weeks ago. ''What for? How can you put up with all that aggravation?''
We had bumped into each other at an off-track betting site in Del Mar, Calif., where I live, and had been discussing this year's crop of 3-year-olds, strictly as a betting proposition. Wagering on race horses is the only thing in life that interests Angles, who, like many horseplayers I know, has no visible source of income but somehow manages to stay in action. 
When I revealed to him that I was on my way to Kentucky to see for myself about the 3-year-olds, he was appalled. Why would I get up from my comfortable table facing a large TV screen in the Turf Club at Del Mar, only a short stroll from a parimutuel window, to subject myself to the expense and horrors of modern travel simply to be part of the huge crowd flocking into Churchill Downs on Saturday, May 5?
''You ain't even going to see the race that good,'' was Angles's parting shot.
He's probably right, but does it matter? If you love the game, as I do, then occasionally you have to subject yourself to its realities. You have to be there, with the horses and the people they represent, see all the sights, smell the smells, mingle, become a part of it.
The economic future of horse racing, a sport that is under increasing pressure from having to compete with state lotteries (even Kentucky has one) and other forms of legalized sports betting, probably depends on the spread of the offtrack facilities and the huge pools being created by so-called exotic wagering: triples, double triples, pick-threes, pick-sixes, pick-nines.
These propositions, with payoffs to bettors often in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, create headlines and useful publicity, but they are not what the sport is essentially about. Its soul is still the animal itself, as those of us can testify who have fallen in love with various great horses over the years. And often it's at the Kentucky Derby that the true quality of a contender is established. In every sport, certain events transcend the hype that engulfs them, though I'm not sure I could explain that to Angles.
Last year by this time I was already in love - with trainer Charlie Whittingham's feisty colt Sunday Silence. Most of my friends in the East were committed to Easy Goer, and much was made of the East-West rivalry that dominated the sports pages for months.
I never took it seriously, because, after all, both horses were bred in Kentucky, but the publicity generated tremendous excitement, until Sunday Silence finally settled matters at the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park last fall. Good for the game, as they say.
There have been other great rivalries that have distinguished various Derbies, such as the outstanding one between Affirmed and Alydar in 1978, but a great rivalry doesn't seem to be essential to public interest in the race. Often it's simply the presence in it of a horse who has captured the public's fancy. Secretariat went into the Derby as an odds-on favorite and demolished his rivals, and continued to receive correspondence from admirers until his death last October.
We all retain certain firmly rooted images from every Kentucky Derby, more than from any other Triple Crown race. From recent ones I recall, for instance, the way Bill Shoemaker rode Ferdinand like a cowboy, weaving recklessly through horses down the stretch to bring Whittingham his first Derby victory; the way a plodding outsider, Gato del Sol, suddenly exploded out of the pack to claim his moment of glory with an effort he was never able to repeat, and the way the big roan filly Winning Colors humbled her field, leading every step of the way over Churchill Downs's deep, tiring course, a performance that capped her career, and that she, too, was never able to duplicate.
An equine athlete, like a human one, will sometimes rise to a great occasion and accomplish feats quite beyond himself, like a chorister at the Met suddenly taking center stage to sound like Domingo. Nothing seems to bring this quality out in an animal like the Kentucky Derby.
This year, the 116th edition of the race has acquired a flavor all its own. Most of the best horses seemed to be in the East, but there was no outstanding athlete, and the contest was coming up as a typical scramble, with half a dozen major contenders on the boards, and a host of obscure candidates poised to swoop out of the wings. But over the last couple of months, the field seems to have shaken itself down to two major competitors, Summer Squall and Mister Frisky.
At first glance, there would seem to be some obvious parallels to last year. Summer Squall is royally bred, cost $300,000 as a yearling, and has done all of his racing in the East, having lost only once, in a sprint to a top speed horse and after a long layoff. Mister Frisky cost only $15,000, was sired by a cheap stallion, is undefeated and has been running in California lately.
There, however, the similarities end. Summer Squall is a small colt who was delayed in getting to the track this year by a bleeding episode and has been raced hard to get into condition. Mister Frisky has also been raced hard, a total of 16 times in his brief career, and has beaten no one, as horseplayers put it. Thirteen of his victories were registered in Puerto Rico, and his victories at Santa Anita were over second-raters in unimpressive times.
So although they have lost only one race between them, Summer Squall and Mister Frisky are still not considered dominant by the horsemen, and there will be at least several other animals in the field with a legitimate chance to win.
Among them will be a maiden named Pendleton Ridge, who ran a closing fourth in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct last Saturday, and whose trainer, Bobby Frankel, ought to know better. After all, the last maiden to run in a Derby was a nonentity named Great Redeemer, who finished a distant last in 1979.
Still, you never know. Broker's Tip was a maiden when he won in 1933, and before him two other maidens found themselves draped in roses in the winner's circle, Buchanan in 1884 and Sir Barton in 1919. That's the beauty of the Derby, and it's the main reason I'll be there this year, with a parimutuel ticket in my pocket and a dawning love affair in my heart.

Trouble for Forte

 BODY:
He was a star basketball player and an acclaimed television sports executive, but things have changed for Chet Forte. The former high-scoring guard and playmaker for Columbia, who went on to receive nine Emmy Awards as a producer-director during his 25-year career with ABC, is now broke. He is also suffering from cancer and facing a series of Federal fraud and tax charges carrying penalties upon conviction of more than 70 years in prison and millions in fines.
Among other things, the 54-year-old Forte is charged with fraudulently obtaining $1.47 million in bank loans by overstating his net worth on applications.
At an initial hearing in Newark on Friday, Larry Lustberg, an assistant public defender, told the court that Forte was an unemployed compulsive gambler who had lost millions of dollars at Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City casinos and was now being supported by his wife's family.
Forte, whose television credits include ''Monday Night Football'' and the 1968 and 1984 Summer Olympics, left ABC in 1987 to become an independent producer and director. He was an all-American at Columbia in 1957.
After the hearing, Forte was released on his own recognizance and told to find someone to post $500,000 bond for him by Tuesday. No arraignment date was set.(AP)

Daytona Gets V6 Power

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON

 BODY:
There was a time that I wanted a Dodge. No, that doesn't say it. I lusted after a Dodge. It was 1969 and the car was a Charger R/T hardtop, maybe the most beautiful Dodge ever built.
It was as quick as it was pretty, with a 440-cubic-inch Magnum V8 that put out 375 horsepower. It was quiet and comfortable and I still find that Coke-bottle shape pleasing. 
At the time, though, I was smitten with everything about the car, particularly after a test drive at the dealership.
I put my hot breath and my fingerprints on it and sort of jumped up and down. I worked out a budget and my wife said I could buy it. The bank looked at the budget and said I couldn't.
But even before that sad denouement, while I was still there demonstrating my long-term inability to dicker for an affordable price, I kept casting an eye at the star of the showroom. It was a Charger, too, but it was bright orange, with a long fiberglass nose and a sky-high spoiler on the trunk.
It was spectacular, a cousin of the Plymouth SuperBird, but nobody in his right mind would have driven such a vehicle. And, in truth, no one was expected to. Dodge was heavily involved in Nascar racing then, and the car, one of 505 that were built, was in the showroom solely so it could be raced as a ''production'' model.
It was, appropriately, the first Dodge Daytona.
The car lasted two years and the name didn't surface again until 1983, when Dodge's parent, Chrysler Corporation, showed up at the New York Automobile Show with a 1984 model based on the K-car platform.
In the intervening years, Dodge and Plymouth had pretty much abandoned racing. Formerly proud badges were applied to this or that econobox, many imported from Japan, and the accent went from Magnums to mileage. The Daytona, though, was built in America, and that was big news for a company struggling to survive on the backs of captive imports.
Daytona is still a domestic product, assembled in St. Louis, but it has been around for seven years now and it is long of tooth. In fact, the company gives a nod to that with 1990 literature that says Daytona is ''still an image leader.'' Dodge also hastens to point out that there is new power and a restyled interior.
The new power consists of a 2.2-liter four with variable nozzle turbocharging, and the 3-liter Mitsubishi V6 that was in the test car, a black ES model. The turbo now puts out 174 horsepower, 32 more than the 1984 Daytona, and the V6 pumps out a smooth 141 horses.
Back in 1984, the hatchback coupe left some things to be desired, but by 1987 almost all of the complaints had been answered. The Daytona was a very slick four-passenger front-wheel-drive automobile.
Unfortunately, the latest version is an example of change for change's sake, and the new interior is as bad as the original. The rim of the curving dash panel contains inset and contoured light switches, for example, and they are very hard to find in the dark.
Also, there are four of them, instead of the sensible single knob that used to work so well on every manufacturer's car. Another complaint regards the tiny and impossible horn buttons that flank the airbag in the center of the steering wheel. And then there is the turn-signal flipper, which has moved from the steering column to a less accessible position on the dash.
Seat adjustments are also a bit strange, although not as odd as the originals, which pumped up lumbar support with a squeeze bulb. Now, the seat's lumbar and wing controls are powered. But fore and aft adjustment remains a manual exercise.
The cloth-upholstered seats, buckets front and rear, are flat and offer little real support. As might be expected in a sporty coupe, there is not much room in back or anywhere else. The glove box is tiny, there is a console bin to hold cassettes, and the doors have map pockets that are two inches deep. And that's it.
Still, performance is what Daytona has always been about, and the V6's 141 horses move the 2,750-pound coupe from 0 to 60 in about nine seconds. You can keep track of that on a highly optimistic 140-m.p.h. speedometer, and the instruments include a 7,000-r.p.m. tachometer with a 6,000 redline.
The test car had an automatic transmission, but a five-speed is available for more fun, and the fair-to-middling zoom doesn't cost a lot in terms of gas. Economy is rated at 19 miles per gallon, city, and 27, highway.
In fact, if there is one thing to be said for the new Dodge Daytona, it is that the bottom line is a real surprise. Back in 1984, the base was $10,447, and today's sticker is barely more at $10,995. Unfortunately, options, including the V6 package at $2,415, add up quickly, and the as-tested price was $16,548.
That puts the car into some tough company. It might be that it's time for Dodge to come up with a new Charger.

HEADLINE: A Troubled Transition for the Ansonia

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
AFTER a five-year struggle, the owners of the Ansonia Hotel, one of the city's architectural landmarks, have put forth a plan to convert the building into a condominium residence.
Of the 462 units in the ornate, turreted structure, which occupies the entire western blockfront of Broadway between 73d and 74th Streets, 50 are available to outside buyers for prices ranging from $101,000 for the smallest studio unit to $939,000 for a 2,700-square-foot apartment.
The conversion of the 86-year-old apartment hotel is possible now because of a settlement reached 15 months ago between the owners, Ansonia Associates, a consortium of three investment groups, and the building's largest tenant organization. The agreement resolved some of the bitter disputes over rent levels, repairs and improvements. For more than a decade the Ansonia's tenants, now split into two groups, have battled the owners over issues ranging from hazards like exposed wires and a leaky roof to the color scheme for new wallpaper in the corridors. 
''The Ansonia is a special place for many reasons,'' said Jesse Krasnow, one of the principals of Ansonia Associates, which has owned the building since 1978. ''People are passionate about it. So problems have been complicated by emotions on all sides.''
Ansonia Associates, which is three separate partnerships headed by Albert Schussler, Stanley Stahl and Mr. Krasnow's father, Herbert, is in the midst of a multimillion-dollar upgrading program for the building. The plans include renovating worn-out mechanical systems and restoring some of the special architectural features.
In many respects the Ansonia today is a faded beauty with both an illustrious and a troubled past. It was conceived and built at the turn of the century as a residential hotel catering to wealthy, part-time New Yorkers. Over the years it has been home to many luminaries, among them Enrico Caruso, Igor Stravinsky, Arturo Toscanini, Billie Burke, Sol Hurok and Babe Ruth.
Still a prized address in its Upper West Side neighborhood, it is now favored in particular by performing artists and music teachers because of the soundproofing nature of its thick walls and proximity to Lincoln Center. Dwarfed by modern residential towers to the south, the Ansonia nevertheless stands out on Broadway because of its lively facade of balconies and limestone figures topped by cupolas.
But these days it owes its notoriety as much to the historic animosity between tenants and owners as to its flamboyant Beaux-Arts design and the fame of its residents. Over the years, tenants have used rent strikes, suits and an unending stream of petitions to city and state housing agencies to protest deteriorating conditions.
ONE such suit, Ansonia Residents Association v. New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, resulted in a State Court of Appeals decision last November reaffirming the right of landlords to permanent rent increases for Major Capital Improvements. The tenants had argued that once landlords recover the costs of a capital improvement the increases allowed to pay for it should be removed.
For years the Ansonia had the fattest case file in Manhattan's housing court, where unresolved complaints await hearings. The State Division of Housing expects to make a determination soon on rent overcharge complaints and the building's former status as a residential hotel. The agency expects that once this issue is settled hundreds of other overcharge complaints can be resolved. Records also show 22 still outstanding Department of Buildings violations. According to a department spokesman, these range from minor repair work to failure to file plans for renovation work done in the building.
Last March, the ceiling in a pastry shop in one of the building's ground-floor retail spaces collapsed, killing one patron and injuring others. The ceiling, Buildings Department inspectors concluded, had been weakened by holes drilled to accommodate pipes and electrical lines for the store.
Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said an investigation is under way - standard procedure in accidents that involve deaths - to determine if the collapse was a result of criminal negligence. Mr. McKelvey also said the office is looking into charges from some tenants that some tax abatements the owners took in connection with the building's J-51 status were inappropriate.
Despite the often bitter protests over conditions, tenant representatives acknowledge that by the time the current owners took over, greed and mismanagement by previous owners had put the structure in an extremely fragile state. Although the exterior remained basically intact, the interior had been robbed of many details and irreplaceable fixtures.
In many ways the struggles at the Ansonia exemplify the issues that contribute to some of the city's most vexing housing problems.
Many of the residents are there only because of the rent-regulation system. As is often the case in buildings that are as old and as large as the Ansonia, its regulated rents do not cover the costs of maintenance, let alone of modernizing improvements. Apartments there are under both rent control and rent stabilization and rents, as a result, vary from less than $100 to $3,350 a month. Thus it is probable that the Ansonia could never work as a profitable rental property.
It was not an apartment house but a grand hotel that the Ansonia's builder, William E. D. Stokes, had in mind when work began in 1899. To carry out his plan, Stokes, who owned a construction company and was responsible for many other residences in the neighborhood, brought from Paris the architect Paul E. M. DuBoy, who designed a huge residential hotel with 400 suites.
When it was completed in 1904 the Ansonia was, at 17 stories, one of the tallest residential structures in the world. It had nearly every luxury of its period, including two swimming pools, Turkish baths and restaurants decorated in the style of Louis XIV. The generosity of the design extended even to the corridors, which average 11 feet in width and have floor-to-ceiling windows.
Although built to a luxurious scale with elaborate layouts, few of the original apartments had full kitchens. Instead, the residents' meals were prepared in basement kitchens and then whisked by dumbwaiters to serving pantries in the apartments above.
Stokes, who lived in the building, was said to have kept animals on a rooftop garden and filled the lobby fountain with baby seals.
But this level of luxury for the Ansonia was short-lived. By the 1920's a transformation was under way to convert the hotel's suites to the needs of families of more modest means. Kitchens were added and many of the large suites were divided.
For the next several decades the Ansonia struggled to survive as operating costs outpaced rents. Today the building has a mix of apartments in bad repair, with falling plaster and worn wooden floors, and those that have been so lovingly restored and embellished by their occupants that they could be featured in the pages of glossy decorating magazines.
Within the Ansonia's high-ceilinged apartments are such original features as oval living and dining rooms, wood floors laid in herringbone designs, French windows with window seats, frosted-glass lighting fixtures and ornate wood and plaster moldings.
Ansonia Associates say they will put $9 million to $11 million into capital improvements and restoration to public areas and spend the money necessary to make promised repairs and improvements to some apartments. Their budget includes $4 million that will be put into a reserve fund once the conversion has been completed.
According to Mr. Krasnow of Ansonia Associates, completed work includes replacement of the flat roof and repairs to the mansard roof, upgrading of the wiring system, installation of storm windows, replacement of the switchboard with a computer-based internal telephone system and addition of a new boiler. In the last several years the storefront facades on the Broadway side have been restored in accordance with the requirements of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Work still to be completed includes installing ducts and fans in kitchens and bathrooms of 250 apartments to improve ventilation, adding kitchens to apartments that still do not have them, further upgrading the electrical distribution system, removing asbestos-contaminated material from all apartments and service areas, refurbishing elevator cabs, redecorating the lobby and sitting rooms and adding a roof deck.
Renovations done on apartments sold to outside buyers will include the installation of new bathrooms and kitchens, the refinishing of floors and the addition of new hardware designed to look like the original doorknobs.
AMONG the most ambitious components of the restoration plan is reconstructing the original main entrance on 73d Street. Work is currently under way to restore the ornate porte-cochere, which had been covered in one of the earlier modernization efforts.
The old entrance had arched windows and terra cotta tiles in its vaulted ceiling. Frank P. Farinella, the architect responsible for the restoration, said that in addition to repair work, lost portions of the architectural detailing will be recast and pieced together with the original work.
According to the owners' conversion plan filed in early February, Ansonia Associates will retain control of the building's retail spaces as well as the garage added in the early 80's in a space once occupied by Plato's Retreat, a nightclub catering to swingers.
IT is not possible to say how many residents will buy their apartments. They were presented with the sponsor's noneviction conversion plan late in February and have until May 29 the exclusive right to buy their units. The offer to the tenants is approximately 50 to 60 percent below the asking price for apartments to outside buyers. One 757-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, for example, carries an insider price of $122,662 and is $293,000 for outside buyers.
The owners would have to sell about 5 percent of the units - or about 25 units to tenants - to fulfill the 15 percent requirement for a conversion plan to be accepted by the Attorney General's office.
The leadership of both tenant organizations say they are neither for nor against a conversion plan per se, but each has taken its own approach in response to the conversion initiative.
On the one hand, the Ansonia Tenants Association, which represents occupants in about two-thirds of the building, has held that the owners' push to convert offers the best leverage for negotiating any significant improvements and repairs.
But the Ansonia Tenants Coalition, comprising mainly tenants who opposed a 1980 settlement that ended a year-long rent strike, maintains that a conversion is premature as long as there are outstanding violations against the building. Thomas Soja, its president, said a key reason why he feels the conversion is inappropriate now is that he does not believe the owners' stated budget will cover the cost of needed repairs.
''The work done so far amounts to a Band-Aid approach,'' said Mr. Soja, ''when what is required is drastic surgery. The owners are talking about spending approximately $10 million for work, including the $4 million they have promised to put in a reserve fund. Our estimate is that this figure will not cover one-tenth of the problems that exist here.''
In response, Mr. Krasnow said the owners are spending more than legally required.
''The legal requirement is that we spend 3 precent of the value of the apartments' inside price,'' he said. ''That would be about $600,000 in improvements and $1.2 million in cash reserve. As it is we are putting forward over three times as much cash as we have to and doing eight times as much work.''
At one time the New York State Attorney General's office, which has jurisdiction over all proposed cooperative and condominium plans, required that violations be remedied before a plan could be accepted for filing. But landlords successfully challenged the agency's authority to set such policy, which is not part of the state's cooperative and condominium laws. As a result, sponsors are now required only to disclose outstanding violations in the conversion plan documents.
Andrew Hughes, the president of the Ansonia Tenants Association, which negotiated for more than four years before the conversion plan was completed, declined to be interviewed. Kent Karlsson, the group's attorney, said that the timetable provided in the agreement has not been followed.
''From our perspective,'' said Mr. Karlsson, ''work is not proceeding at the pace it should or under the conditions to which we agreed. Our survey indicates that more than half of the work that was supposed to be completed by now remains undone.''
Mr. Karlsson cited as an example the replacement of the roof. The owners said work on the roof has been completed but tenants say that some tenants are still subject to leaks in rainy weather.
FOR their part, the owners concede that some of the contractors working on the building have not met deadlines and add that they have had difficulty getting access to some apartments.
Mr. Krasnow, who characterizes his relationship with the tenants as a marriage that works rather than a romance, said:
''With a project this large and complicated, there are bound to be delays. But there is nothing in the way we have conducted ourselves to suggest that projects that have been scheduled won't be completed. We want to sell apartments here. It is in our interest to make the building the best it can be.''

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Queens Expansion;
T-Shirt Maker Chooses To Stay

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
The balloon over Robin's head in the latest products from the Bowe Industries factory in Middle Village, Queens, might carry the words: ''Holy logo, Batman, we're staying in New York!'' Indeed, after considering a move to the South, the owners of Bowe will remain in New York and expand their T-shirt factory as a result of a $4.1 million bond financing arranged by the city's Industrial Development Agency.
Believed to be the only T-shirt factory in the city, Bowe Industries has grown rapidly in recent years - production doubled last year alone - and will make more than 7 million T shirts this year. 
The co-owners, Daniel Barasch and Marek Kiyashka, were friends who started silk-screening distinctive T shirts by hand in 1973 as a part-time basement business and selling them to classmates at Stuyvesant High School. They incorporated in 1976 and opened a tiny factory in Forest Hills, then moved to a larger facility in Middle Village three years later.
In 1984, they began buying licensing rights allowing the use of film and television characters on their products. These have included characters from Saturday Night Live, the Honeymooners, Mighty Mouse, the California Raisins, Batman and - their biggest seller lately - the Simpsons.
Needing room to expand, the partners approached the Industrial Development Agency and, through the sale of the bonds, were able to buy a building at 70-10 74th Street at Cooper Avenue; it will be doubled in size, to 45,000 square feet, at a cost of $5 million and is expected to be finished in a year.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Noisy Air-Conditioner
Question: I live in an apartment building with casement-style windows. Under the living room window is a metal sill and frame that encase a radiator. The tenant above has a window air-conditioner; whenever the machine is on the window wall of my apartment vibrates. He says he has tried to soften the vibration with foam packing. With warm weather approaching I am searching for ways to rectify this problem. Do I have the right to insist that he or the management find a way to solve the problem or that he refrain from using the air-conditioner? . . . R. M., Brooklyn 
Answer: Yes. You are entitled to a peaceful living situation. ''The landlord of the building is required to provide 'quiet enjoyment' and to insure that there is no breach in the 'warranty of habitability','' said Ronald Sher, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters. ''The conditions described may very well constitute violations of these legal precepts.''
From a practical standpoint, you might suggest that your neighbor get in touch either with the person who installed the air-conditioner, to make sure it has been put in properly, or the manufacturer, who might be a source of information on the correct way to install it so vibration would be minimized.
 
Apartment Paint Job
Question: I own a building that has seven apartments, two of which are occupied by my family. One of our rent-controlled tenants who lived here many years before we bought the building has suddenly started complaining that we have not painted her apartment. She understood that the previous landlord did not include this service in the rent. Are we obligated now to paint her apartment? . . . M. L., Manhattan
Answer: Yes. The city's housing maintenance code requires that landlords paint apartments every three years, and the code supersedes the state's rules governing rent-controlled apartments. In rent-controlled situations, if a landlord did not provide a service as part of the original rental agreement, a new owner may not have to provide it later on. But, according to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the city's code takes precedence.
 
Condo Common Charge
Question: Can the board of a condominium approve a maintenance increase - over 20 percent - and order that the increase be retroactive to cover eight months of the previous fiscal year? . . . G. O., Hoboken, N.J.
Answer: Maybe. The board of managers' right to make such increases retroactive would depend on the terms of your association's declaration of condominium documents. But according to Douglas Kleine, director of research for the Community Associations Institute, it is an unusual tack.
''It sounds like the board was faced with an unexpected shortfall,'' said Mr. Kleine, ''and power is granted to a board of directors so it can respond to things that are unforeseen or uncontrollable. The typical response in such a case would be a one-time assessment for such unforeseen or unusual circumstances as a tough winter or an unexpected payment.''
Mr. Kleine said it would be awkward to administer such an increase. The association may not be made up of the same residents. ''How would it impact on owners who had moved,'' he said, ''or newcomers who were not even in the community eight months earlier?''
A retroactive increase would be more understandable, Mr. Kleine said, if it were instituted early in the condominium's existence because a sponsor had set the original operating budget too low. In that case the sponsor would have to share the burden of any maintenance increase.

Statistics Say It Too Well: All Our Children Need Our Support

BYLINE: By Laura Lee Simon; Laura Lee Simon is chairwoman of the Connecticut Commission on Children.

 BODY:
JUST a few weeks ago, I had the joyous experience of sitting in Yale-New Haven Hospital holding my newborn grandson in my arms. He was just 12 hours old, my fifth grandchild. I thought, how lucky this beautiful little boy is.
He is healthy - a strapping nine pounds - and he has two loving parents and a wonderful brother. His mother had the best in prenatal care, and he was delivered in a world-class hospital. He will be nurtured and safe and secure. He will be well nourished. When his parents are working, he will be in a superb early-child-care program. He will be eager and ready when it is time to go to school. And he will grow and thrive along with his brother. If only all the children in this nation and every child in every town and city in Connecticut - this richest state in the nation - could be assured of the same healthy start in life as my grandchild. 
The State Commission on Children knows that as mounting economic pressures have squeezed the middle class and budget cuts have worsened the plight of many poor people, childhood has become far more precarious and less safe for our children. In our collective experience, it is difficult to identify a time more fraught with peril for our children than now.
The complex problems facing our children as they grow up today are more difficult and changing faster than are our institutions, some of which are reeling under the burden of trying to respond.
We know only too well that reduced budgets and token commitments no longer hold the promise of ameliorating the stress borne by so many of our children and their families.
We know only too well that if we fail to pay adequate attention to the physical, emotional and educational needs of all of our children, everyone will pay dearly.
And still these problems remain:
* More than 90,000 children in Connecticut live in poverty - 11.8 percent of the children in our state. Every other child in Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport lives in poverty. Nearly half of this state's single-parent families live below the poverty line. Thousands of children suffer from poor health, crime-infested neighborhoods, school failure and premature parenthood.
* Approximately 25 percent of Connecticut's pregnant women do not get care until the third trimester.
* Some 10 percent of pregnant women are estimated to be in need of substance-abuse treatment. And 50 percent of pregnant women using the prenatal clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital have used cocaine during pregnancy, potentially leading to the birth of severely damaged babies.
* Since 1980 the birth rate for girls under 15 has doubled and has increased by 29 percent for young women 15 to 19 years of age.
* Some 94,000 children in Connecticut live in families with no health insurance.
* In one New Haven neighborhood, 25 percent of families with children have serious hunger problems or are at risk of being hungry.
* Only 91 of the 245 schools designated ''severe need'' participate in the school breakfast program.
* Connecticut has the highest infant -mortality rate in New England and ranks 40th in the nation in low birth weight of nonwhite babies.
* About 18,400 citizens sleep in shelters for the homeless; 20 percent of them are employed. And 10 percent of families living in shelters have children under the age of 5.
* The average monthly rates for a two-bedroom apartment without utilities range from $485 in Naugatuck to $615 in Hartford and $1,150 in Stamford. Yet the maximum cash benefit for a single parent with two young children on Aid to Families with Dependent Children in Connecticut is between $534 and $623 a month.
* Among those eligible for nutrition services through the Women, Infants and Children program, 30 to 40 percent do not receive them. There are 4,000 women, 5,000 infants and 14,500 children between the age of 1 and 5 who are eligible to receive these services. For every dollar spent on the program, $3 is saved by reducing prematurity and low birth weight.
* Gun violence has become epidemic among children. Ten American children are killed every day in handgun suicides, homicides and accidents. Children are increasingly manifesting the trauma of such experience.
* Early-childhood services in Connecticut are meeting only a small percentage of the need. Head Start, a program that has proven lasting benefits, serves only one of five eligible youngsters.
* Last year, 20,233 children were referred to the Protective Services agency, about double the number in 1979. These figures do not reflect the number of cases that were not investigated despite reports of abuse or neglect. Caseload ratios in the state exceed national standards by 60 percent.
We are deeply concerned that these hard facts and more cast an alarming shadow over our future. But we know that this is a time of unprecedented opportunity. We are sustained in our efforts by the knowledge that within our reach are tested, truly effective preventive programs and remedies on which to base social policies that will assure a bright future for all our children.
We are heartened by the growing commitment among legislators to children's needs. Much is being done for Connecticut's children, but much more is called for in the light of contemporary concerns.
It is heartening to know that more than 160 organizations representing thousands of voters from all corners of our state have joined with the Commission on Children to form a Coalition for a Children's Platform. Together we support a child and family agenda that has been before our legislature and would address the unmet needs of Connecticut's children. It would promote improved delivery of services and substantial cost savings. If adopted, the agenda will bring in millions of previously unavailable Federal dollars to promote the healthy growth and development of our children.
Underscoring the importance of children's health, the agenda includes measures that will ease access to prenatal care, insure preventive pediatric care and increase the participation of pregnant women and children in essential nutrition programs. It includes support that will strengthen Head Start, increase participation in school breakfast programs and promote the development of early-childhood programs.
We recognize that we cannot afford to lose this generation to guns and drugs. Our agenda highlights comprehensive gun control and nonpunitive services for substance-abusing pregnant women. We also support measures to promote family strength and values and to help all parents - those who work and those who do not - to protect our most vulnerable children.
If we are all committed to equity, decency and a prosperous economy, we must generate the political will to support comprehensive, cost-effective policies that deal with our social deficits. Piecemeal approaches will no longer suffice.
Children's needs must be paramount, as policymakers deliberate about the legislation and budgets before them.
Our children can't vote or write editorials or make speeches or publish reports or meet with their legislators. We must speak with one voice on their behalf. Our responsibility is to translate our knowledge, our numbers and our concerns into public policy to assure our chidren's future and our own.

Is Overpopulation Too Grim a Tale?

BYLINE: By William A. Burley; William A. Burley, principal of the John Pettibone School in New Milford, is a member of the population committee of the Connecticut Sierra Club.

 BODY:
NO problem facing the earth looms larger than the growth in the reproductive rate of the human species. Virtually all degradation of the environment, all exhaustion of natural resources and substantial human suffering can be attributed to the crushing effect of a population that is too numerous for our planet.
The belief among many cultures that children are the equivalent of wealth is a bankrupt social and economic theory. In the last decade of the 20th century, fewer children mean a better life and a healthier environment. 
Consider pollution. It is but one strand in a Gordian knot involving industry, demand for consumer goods, petrochemical use, energy consumption and waste disposal. It knows no national or geographic boundries. Human effluence despoils the beaches of Cannes as well as those of Niantic. The skies are fouled with noxious gasses that haunt us in the form of health-harming particulates, acid rain and ozone depletion.
Increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide contribute to global warming. Landfills spill over with toxic chemicals contaminating water supplies. Nuclear-waste stores are time bombs waiting to detonate.
Like it or not, the nations of the northern hemisphere must assume most responsibility for worldwide pollution. To a large degree, third world people suffer the consequences of first world gluttony.
What about the depletion of natural resources? All people shoulder some blame. The industrialized nations gobble more than their fair share of irreplaceable fossil fuels and mineral resources, but poorer nations, too, are guilty of clearcutting rain forests, overfishing the seas, stripping the hillsides for firewood and exhausting the soil. Perhaps the most valuable commodity of all, fresh water, is being reduced at an alarming rate. In short, the resources essential for sustaining life - food, clean water, energy, shelter and a safe environment - are in imminent peril of becoming eroded beyond repair.
The number of humans is astonishing. World population stands at 5.3 billion in 1990, and will double to 10 billion in 40 years. The earth's population is growing by 90 million a year, the equivalent of the entire population of Mexico.
Many nations, especially in Africa and Asia, are teetering on the edge of social collapse. Wholesale famine in these countries is probable in five years. Tens of millions will starve to death. The United States and other agriculturally rich nations will be unable to prevent starvation, since first world food-producing capabilities are stretched to the limits. In 1988 the United States had to import grain for the first time.
This is grim stuff at any age, so how can it be appropriate to teach to children? How will they react to information about the portent of cataclysmic events?
My experience is that children know something is fundamentally wrong with the world, and they are eager to listen to the message. They do not suffer undo emotional stress. For one thing, they know about pollution, recycling and conservation. They're involved with these activities when they attend Scout meetings or eat at McDonald's. The news is full of stories about toxic hazards, polluted water sources and medical wastes on beaches. They know about global warming and the destruction of the rain forests.
What they don't know are the facts about the other side of the ecology equation, the burgeoning human population. And without a grasp of the details, their knowledge of conservation is only half an education.
What are reasonable things to teach children about the population explosion? First, tell them the numbers, but equate the numbers with more concrete concepts. For example, the population of the United States is growing every year by 2.5 million people, roughly the number of people in Connecticut.
Next, tie population growth to environmental issues. Discuss acid rain and global warming. Talk about the local landfill. Guide them to see that the earth cannot withstand mistreatment by hoards of people. And show them how the American life style is particularly damaging to the environment.
Finally, offer suggestions about how they can become involved and make a difference. Discuss taking political action. Encourage them to write letters to state and Federal legislators asking that they sponsor a bill calling for a national policy on population reduction.
Give them bibliographies of appropriate readings. Provide names and address of organizations working on conservation and population issues. And counsel them that they can make a difference, but they will face some difficult choices in their lives about family planning and consumer habits.
Should we teach children about the population problem? The real question ought to be: can we afford not to educate our young about the realities of their future?

HEADLINE: Big Project in Sound Arouses Concern

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
A DESERTED island in Long Island Sound just off the New Rochelle coastline is the focus of a bitter dispute over a proposal to build a $1 billion residential community for 3,700 people.
The David's Island project, the largest ever proposed for Long Island Sound, has pitted development advocates in New Rochelle, an economically stagnant city of 69,000, against environmentalists in nearby communities on both sides of the water. They say that massive building on the island, once the home of Fort Slocum, will turn the already fragile waters of the western part of the Sound into a ''Dead Sea.''
Robert Funicello, president of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, one of the environmental groups opposed to the project, said ''there are portions of Long Island that are closer to David's Island than parts of New Rochelle,'' noting that Sands Point is only 1.9 miles away.
 
Georgraphy Issue Cited
He added that water quality and the visual qualities of the western Sound would be severely affected by the David's Island project. 
Karen Sesky Propper, a member of the New Rochelle Board of Education for the last 11 years, disagreed. ''There will be no adverse effect on anybody,'' she said. ''The problems of Long Island Sound predate David's Island by about 70 years.
''This project isn't going to add to those problems, and they are problems we shouldn't be blamed for. This project is not a luxury, it's a necessity.''
As advocates for both sides assembled in New Rochelle last week to testify before a joint hearing of the state's Department of State and its Department of Environmental Conservation, the issue was clear:
Can New Rochelle exercise the right to determine its own future or are those coastal development rights limited in a world with no environmental borders?
Advocates of the plan, including a coalition of school, government and business leaders, insisted at the hearings that they were supporting a project that would not harm the Sound. In addition, they said, it will provide a desperately needed, $26 million-a-year boost to the New Rochelle economy, plus 2,000 constuction jobs and a long-awaited stimulus to restore the city's decaying downtown.
The project proposed for the 78-acre former Army post includes 1,750 condominium units, many of which would be in 31-story towers visible on a clear day to residents of Long Island's North Shore; a marina with 800 slips, a heliport and a private bridge to the Westchester County mainland, two-thirds of a mile away.
Xanadu Properties Associates, the proposed developer of Davids Island, is an international partnership of real estate developers and builders that includes Bruce C. Stark, the largest real-estate developer in Hawaii; Gordon Marshall, a New York real estate lawyer and developer; and three Japanese corporations, Kawasaki Steel, Aoki and Kumagai Gumi. The Japanese concerns have provided $10.5 million of the $17.2 million invested in the project so far. ''We're ready to build immediately,'' Mr. Marshall said.
 
Sewage-Treatment Plant Promised
Xanadu plans to build a tertiary sewage-treatment plant on the island that would remove 90 percent of the harmful nutrients and the estimated 500,000 to 700,000 gallons of treated effluent discharged into the Sound each day.
The New Rochelle City Council will require the developer to build such a plant, and Xanadu has agreed to do so if unable to use the existing county-owned facility in New Rochelle.
If, however, a state moratorium on the existing New Rochelle plant is lifted, the David's Island developer would prefer to use the existing plant, which provides secondary treatment only.
The overall project, its supporters say, has been given a ''clean bill of environmental health'' by the Coast Guard.
However, the release of the final environmental statement, which was prepared by the developer, does not constitute approval of the project, both Coast Guard and state authorities said. Questions of public access, building height and density and water quality issues must be addressed by the relevant state agencies before permits for the project can be issued.
New Rochelle development advocates believe that the proposed project for David's Island, which many consider a deteriorated blot on the coastal landscape, will enable their self-appointed ''Queen City of the Sound'' to live up to its billing.
Economic salvation has been long in coming. Despite the success of some commercial developments, including recent approval of a $30 million expansion of the New Rochelle Mall, assessment rolls have increased by only 1 percent in the last decade. The school tax bill has been increasing rapidly and a loss in state aid has added to the city's financial burdens.
 
Quality of Water Cited
Elly Doctorow, who served on the New Rochelle City Council for 12 years and is a sister of the writer E. L. Doctorow, is a strong supporter of the David's Island project. She has a summer home in Sag Harbor. She believes the project has ''passed environmental muster,'' adding: ''It costs money to run a city, and New Rochelle is a city with financial needs. All we are trying to do is solve our own problems.''
Opponents of the project have made it clear that they have little sympathy for a solution that may be good for New Rochelle, but that they consider an environmental disaster for a body of water already filled with sluggish or dead fish.
''David's Island will be very bad for fishing interests on Long Island,'' said Kathryn Clarke, president of the Long Island Sound Task Force.
This Stamford-based organization is directing public education for the Long Island Sound Study, a six-year, federally sponsored research project to develop a plan to clean up the Sound with support from New York and Connecticut.
The project constitutes what Ms. Clarke called ''a direct threat to the livelihood of anyone who earns a living from the marine resources of Long Island sound.''
Researchers, Ms. Clarke said, have documented growing evidence of hypoxia, or oxygen depletion, occurring in the western portion of the Sound as a result of ''nutrient loading'' from treated sewage flowing into the water at the rate of more than a billion gallons a day.
Oxygen levels were so low in l987 and again last summer, she said, that fish life essentially ceased. New information from the Long Island Sound Study indicates that the major hypoxia ''hot spot'' is in an area almost midway between David's Island and Hempstead Harbor, Ms. Clarke said.
A coalition of national and regional environmental groups, including the National Audobon Society, the National Resources Defense Council and the Long Island Sound Task Force recently agreed to join the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County and a group of citizens opposing the project.
Long Island residents who testified at the the public hearing last week, or who submitted written opinions, were unanimous in their opposition to the David's Island project, which the Long Island Regional Planning Board has said would lead to ''the further degradation of water quality in a severely stressed portion of the Sound'' and would harm outdoor recreation opportunities.
The board also contends that the buildings and bridge would be ''totally out of scale with the environment in which they would be located.''
''A project of that size is certainly a concern to us,'' said Ralph J. Naranjo, president of Friends of the Bay, a l,500-member organization fighting development of the Oyster Bay waterfront. The group has submitted testimony opposing the David's Island project.
''We are a microcosm of David's Island,'' Mr. Naranjo said, describing his organization's efforts to prevent the construction of a series of condominiums and hotels proposed for the Oyster Bay harbor area and that its members believe would pollute the North Shore's only remaining oyster beds.
They oppose the David's Island project, Mr. Naranjo said, because it would add more nitrogen to the water, reducing dangerously low oxygen levels still further.
He called the project ''grossly in accord with today's overdevelopment theme,'' but completely contrary to the state's Coastal Zone Management Plan to protect the shoreline.
The public hearings, the last in a series that have been held over the nearly 10-year debate regarding the project, precede a final state study that will determine whether the project will be built.
The Department of State must now determine if the project meets the 44 conditions of its Coastal Zone Management Plan, the nine-year-old document that governs the environmental protection of the state's coastline, and the Department of Environmental Conservation must decide if the plan meets its requirements.
''Is the Department of State going to administer the Coastal Zone Management Plan?'' Mr. Funicello asked. ''Will the Department of Environmental Conservation protect water quality or is this a massive paper-shuffling sham? Are we going to protect Long Island Sound or are we just going to talk about it?''

Life in a Borderless Greenback Empire

BYLINE: By KENICHI OHMAE

 BODY:
The following is an excerpt from ''The Borderless World: Power and Strategy in the Interlinked Economy,'' to be published in August by Harper Business, a division of HarperCollins Inc. Kenichi Ohmae is managing director of McKinsey & Company's Tokyo office.
 
We can all recite the litany. The United States has a serious and, apparently, structurally irremovable trade deficit with several of its major trading partners, especially Japan. For an economy so powerful, export levels for many categories of products are embarrassingly low. No wonder the dollar has fallen to such dismal levels. The only surprise is that it has not gone lower. 
Even so, a formal policy of keeping the dollar weak does not make sense when you consider that in currency-related terms, the United States enjoys a unique position in the world. Because almost all of its trade transactions are dollar-based, the United States has in effect extended its domestic economy across national borders, creating in the process a huge ''greenback empire.'' For Americans, it makes little ultimate difference to their national indebtedness whether they buy oranges from California or television sets from Taiwan. Both amount to much the same thing. Americans in New York don't worry about running up a trade deficit with California. They don't need to worry about Taiwan either.
The dollar is the internationally accepted currency of trade settlement. In fact, it is virtually the only currency the United States uses to settle its external trade.
Other countries have to earn and save dollars one way or another and have to maintain these dollar-based reserves to pay for their various imports. If these countries run out of dollars and cannot borrow them somewhere, they cannot purchase the critical resources they need or the luxuries they want.
But this does not apply to the United States itself. The United States has - or can print - all the dollars it wants. To America's trading partners, this feels like being swallowed up in a single, immense dollar-based empire - which is, in currency terms, merely an extension of the American domestic economy. Simply stated, the United States has no foreign trade. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the health of the domestic economy, but statistical trade balances are not among them.
For the Japanese, the dollars earned by exporting to the United States are less like money to be put in the bank than a promissory note to buy American goods in the future. On the way back, the dollars may well make a detour though the Middle East, where the Japanese need them to pay for oil. Or they may go back home via the London market. Whatever route they take, the point is that they do not stay in Japan. We in Japan would like to be able to treat the yen the same way the United States treats the dollar and deal with all other nations in yen. We would like to trade places with the United States. We cannot, at least not now. But if the dollar continues to decline for the wrong and artificial reason reflecting erroneous political and macroeconomic perceptions, America's trading partners will stop accepting dollars for the goods and services they sell to Americans. At that point, America becomes a Brazil. Why should the United States give up unecessarily the advantage that it now enjoys?
With so many dollars in the hands of other countries, is the United States vulnerable should circumstances prompt these investors to unload? If the American economy really does go sour, all smart money will flee - American money too. When Houston's oil-based economy went into a steep decline a few years back, it was not just the foreigners who pulled out. Americans did too, and just as fast. Money is money. It's the most purely rational thing there is. Foreign capital is in the United States because it is attractive for capital to be there. When that stops being the case, it will go away in a hurry.

HEADLINE: Future Role Still Unwritten For Theater Saved by State

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
SEVEN years after the state took over the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, it still has no long-range artistic mission - and no short-range schedule of performances. The managers of the American Festival Theater, as its is now known, are struggling to assemble a brief summer season. But they say they are trying to avoid the problems they encountered last summer, when they hastily reopened the theater for six weeks.
''We're working very hard to put together a season of some sort,'' said Mark L. Schneider, the theater's acting executive director. ''There are no contracts signed yet, but we hope to put together a series of summer concerts and perhaps a fall show schedule for students.''
The theater needs extensive renovations, however, and even after five years of planning, the state is still not ready to seek bids for the work. 
Mr. Schneider, an executive on loan from the International Business Machines Corporation in Stamford, said the earliest he expects a full year-round schedule would be the 1991-92 season.
In 1983, the state bought the bankrupt nonprofit theater and its 11.4 parklike acres of woods, marsh and lawns along the Housatonic River just north of Long Island Sound. The purchase encouraged optimism, but since then, some state residents have accused officials of walking what Shakespeare called a ''primrose path of dalliance.''
''If it was privately owned, the project might be on a different schedule,'' acknowledged Arthur J. Hedge Jr., an I.B.M. vice president who has headed the theater's advisory board since he was appointed by Gov. William A. O'Neill in 1983. ''But there's a set of practices and procedures that have to be followed, because this is a state project. And I think the board is sympathetic to that.'' Mr. Hedge said the board was pleased with the level of community support - more than $700,000 was raised from ticket sales and donations during last year's six-week season, when the theater presented a San Francisco troupe's productions of ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and ''Saint Joan'' as well as two weeks of concerts by the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein and a one-man reading of ''The Tempest'' - the only Shakespearean words to be heard in the hall since 1982.
Mr. Hedge said he was confident that with design work nearly done, construction could get under way by next year at the latest.
At the State Department of Environmental Protection, which now owns the theater, a program supervisor, Jeanne L. Shelburne, said, ''This whole type of park is a pretty dramatic departure from what we normally manage.'' The department normally runs swimming, hiking or fishing areas, she said, not cultural centers.
''And we've had some unfortunate occurences lately,'' Ms. Shelburne said. The park manager retired last year, as many senior state employees accepted the early retirement package offered as an economy move, she said, and staff shortages have plagued the D.E.P.'s regional office.
The state's fiscal constraints meant that a major renovation plan had to be scaled back significantly. ''The original proposal was really out of line with the resources we had available,'' Ms. Shelburne said. It suggested, among other things, construction of a second theater on the grounds.
The Bureau of Public Works is now preparing a renovation proposal that would include reconfiguring the seating to improve sight lines, slightly reducing the number of seats from the original 1,477. The work is also expected to include fire code repairs, some landscaping improvements and renovation of the lobby.
''Really, what we'll be doing is refurbishing the theater so it will be useable,'' Ms. Shelburne said. ''We're hoping to get into construction within a year.''
Mr. Hedge said that while the project might not be moving forward as quickly as some would like, the state is putting up all the money, ''and nobody ever wants to have construction projects take as long as they do.''
 
History of Triumph
The theater was also promised some support last year from the Town of Stratford, Mr. Schneider said. But that was before cutbacks in state funds affected every town in the state.
''With the budget crisis, they weren't able to do what they had hoped to do, and what we were hoping for,'' Mr. Schneider said.
The theater's history was not always so tragic. Katharine Hepburn, Jack Palance, Raymond Massey and other internationally known stars trod the stage of the gray teakwood building that opened in 1955 solely for the presentation of Shakespearean plays. Several of the theater's productions went on to Broadway, including the 1982 ''Othello'' starring James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer.
More than three million people, most of them from New York, attended the Stratford performances, bringing an estimated $1.5 million a year in tourist revenues to the town. But the theater always depended more upon private benefactors than box-office receipts to stay afloat.
As donations became harder to attract and time took its toll on the building that had been designed after Shakespeare's own Globe Theater in England, the theater went bankrupt in 1981 and closed with a production of ''Hamlet'' in 1982.
At the time the theater changed hands, state officials said they hoped it would resume a full production schedule within a couple of years. But the closest it has come was last year's six-week run.
The delay in reopening the theater has left Fairfield County without use of the theater.
And theatergoers have apparently found other outlets.
 
'Audience Is There'
''Almost a third of our audience comes up from Fairfield County,'' said David Mayhew, a spokesman for the Long Wharf Theater, in New Haven. The city is also home to the Yale Repertory Theater.
Mr. Mayhew said that Long Wharf's 1989-90 subscriptions fell just 20 short of the 18,343 record of the 1987-88 and that the recent Long Wharf production of ''The Crucible'' broke all attendance records.
Other theaters have survived by developing a varied program. The Shubert, also in New Haven, has seen its subscription base grow to 12,000 from 1,400 five years ago, said a theater spokesman, Morton Langbord. ''Beyond subscriptions, each show is supported well,'' he said. Mr. Mayhew agreed that ''the audience is there.'' ''I think Fairfield County would easily support a regional theater,'' he said.
Mr. Mayhew noted that the four major regional theaters that have survived in Connecticut - Long Wharf, Yale Repertory, Hartford Stage Company and the Goodspeed Opera House - are all about 25 years old. The Shakespeare Theater's age has been one of the reasons given for its problems; after 35 years, it was in need of a massive infusion of cash for long-delayed building maintenance.
 
English Namesake
A $74,000 grant the year after the state took it over went for a new roof, and $100,000 worth of work prior to last year's short season went largely for rigging, lights, a sound system and electrical work.
Last year's season was planned to honor Stratford's 350th anniversary. (The town, named for Shakespeare's home in England, was purportedly founded by a friend of the playwright's family.) But when the theater reopened, the air conditioning system failed, resulting in heat so intense the lead actor in one of the productions fainted.
Mr. Hedge said he hoped to ''keep something happening at the theater,'' but not if it is going to result in problems like that.
Last year's brief season ''was supposed to be a statement that the theater was back,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''And we really rushed it a little.''
This year, he said, there will be no rushing. ''We don't want to ruin our reputation.''
Theater consultants from New York have recommended a phased renovation over several years at a cost of $15 million to $20 million, Ms. Shelburne said. But the Department of Environmental Protection, with its own budget problems, is planning a more modest $4 million to $5 million makeover.
Even once the work is done, however, the theater will probably not return to its heritage.
''To build any kind of theater, you're talking about a number of years, probably more than three, before you build up a large enough subscription base,'' Mr. Schneider said, ''although a lot of that is going to depend on how well the productions are received by the public. And I don't think we're going to be able to do it with a schedule that's all Shakespeare.''

HEADLINE: Optimistic Forecast For Shore

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

DATELINE: BELMAR

 BODY:
LOCAL and state tourism officials, real-estate agents and merchants say they are expecting a better summer season at the Jersey Shore this year than last year.
The optimism, they say, is based on an estimated increase in preseason rentals - 20 percent or more above last year's at this time; an earlier effort at cleaning beaches, the offering of better vacation packages and a trend of vacationing closer to home.
''We have plenty of rentals left,'' said Roy Childers, a real-estate agent and tourism promoter from Lavallette. ''But many of our prime properties have been rented already, which is a very good sign.''
Mr. Childers and others said the optimistic outlook for a successful summer was in part attributable to rental costs that have been stabilized in order to lure back vacationers who stopped coming because of reports of coastal pollution, and to new marketing efforts that feature a variety of Shore vacation packages and attractions. 
Nevertheless, most agreed in recent interviews that it would be difficult to produce the banner season that was predicted as early as March by George Zoffinger, the Commissioner of the state's Department of Commerce, Energy and Economic Development. The last banner season was in 1986, real-estate agents and merchants say.
State environmental and tourism officials say the economic decline in beachfront and related businesses that occurred in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May Counties in 1987 and 1988 ran as high as 30 to 60 percent each year in some communities. Polluted surf waters and debris-cluttered beaches were blamed for sporadic beach closings.
Although state officials say there has never been a valid economic study of Shore tourism, the downward spiral in the Shore economy has seen more than a billion in tourist dollars lost since 1986, according to the state's Division of Travel and Tourism. Modest increases in revenue last year renewed hope for some, and this year real-estate agents have told Mr. Zoffinger that the general downward turn in the economy will lend an even greater boost to tourism as savings-minded consumers look to the cheapest and closest vacation spot - the Jersey Shore.
Boardwalk arcade owners and tour bookers confirmed that things were looking up for the summer. Michael Dinnebeil, manager of arcades and amusements for Jenkinson's South in Point Pleasant Beach, said that when the weather was good in the last month the crowds were heavy, an indicator, he said, of a good summer to come.
''The signs are good for a strong year,'' he said, adding that so far there have not been the usual reports of ocean pollution or predictions about beach closings.
Denise Putlock, the manager of group sales for Casino Pier and Waterworks in Seaside Heights, said tour bookings were up over last year's. The tourists come mostly from northern New Jersey and Staten Island, and Ms. Putlock said that increases this year had resulted from ''a lot of marketing over the winter,'' including Casino Pier and Waterworks' participation in tourism trade shows.
''It has begun to pay off,'' she said.
 
'If the Weather Is Good'
As always, the proof of a successful summer is to be found in warm, sunny weather, inviting water temperatures and the absence of beach closings. ''If the weather is good and the ocean is good, we will have a good summer,'' said Maria G. Hernandez, the Mayor of Belmar, adding that ''all you need is something like an oil spill, a bunch of hypodermic needles on your beach or a lot of rain and your season is shot.''
Summer rentals in Belmar are up over last year, Mrs. Hernandez said, and the population of this Monmouth County community, 6,200 people, can easily soar to 60,000 on a good weekend.
Roy Childers, a real-estate agent with offices in Normandy Beach, Lavallette and Ortley Beach in Ocean County, said that renters this year included many who had tried beaches in Maryland or Virginia last year but returned to their ''traditional'' vacation spots.
''They tell us that they found that the drive was too long,'' he said, ''and that these other beaches do not have the attractions and facilities that New Jersey has.'' He estimated that summer rentals were up almost 20 percent.
The Anderson Agency in Long Beach Township on Long Beach Island also estimates a 20 percent increase in rentals. There, Larry Peacock, an agent, said business was brisk, with just over 60 percent of available rentals taken so far.
''The season is shaping up pretty well,'' Mr. Peacock said. ''It is going to be a better summer than the last two, no doubt about that.''
Rentals in Cape May and Wildwood have increased over last year's, too, said Richard J. Cammarano, president-elect of the Cape May County/Greater Wildwood Board of Realtors in Lower Township.
 
A Decrease in Rents
Paul Rosengren, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said a contributing factor in this year's positive rental climate had been a decrease in rents because so many properties had gone unoccupied in the last three years.
''A downward trend in Shore vacation rentals was occurring before the pollution incidents,'' he said. ''Rental prices had skyrocketed, and taking a vacation at the Shore was on a par, costwise, with more exotic vacations on tropical islands. The pollution shock brought prices back down to where they are affordable.''
David Wyrsch, a broker with the Van Dyk Group, a real-estate concern in Long Beach Township, said that rental prices had gone up dramatically each year from 1985 to 1987, but that they have remained relatively stable since then. He said, for example, that the cost of a two-bedroom house or apartment away from the oceanfront, which rented in 1987 for $500 to $800 a week, had changed very little.
''We really have not recommended that our rental owners raise their rates for the last two years or so,'' he said.
 
Economic Surveys Assessed
Asked about the credibility of the economic impact surveys that had been commissioned by the Division of Travel and Tourism since 1987 to gauge the economy of the Shore, Mr. Rosengren acknowledged that the conclusions the surveys reached were not based on accurate information.
''These are not real scientific data,'' he said. ''You have got to take these extrapolatory studies with a grain of salt. It is important to see over time how some things change in the Shore economy, where people are going to vacation, for example. Directional changes can have significance and make the surveys worthwhile, even if we can't be sure of the magnitude of the change.''
Mr. Rosengren and Mr. Childers admitted that the tourism surveys were not true measures of the actual beach-based economy because all the casino revenues and visitors to Atlantic City were lumped together with the rest of the Shore statistics.
''The state does not provide the county-by-county and month-by-month breakdown of the New Jersey state sales tax, so anybody can say anything they want about the Shore economy and get away with it,'' Mr. Childers said. Without such a breakdown, he said, ''it is impossible to report losses or gains.''
Nonetheless, Mr. Childers and others are encouraged by the preseason rentals this year and what they said was a greater cause for optimism concerning clean beaches.
 
Cleanup Programs Continued
Eric Evenson, acting director of the State Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Water Resources, said that two successful programs put in place last year to clean up plastics, wood and other floatables were being continued this season.
One of the programs, Operation Clean Shores, used prison inmates last year to remove 5.9 million pounds of debris from New Jersey beaches. Mr. Evenson said the $1 million program had received an additional $500,000 this year to include river and bay shorelines in northern Monmouth County.
The debris can include medical and other wastes from New York and New Jersey harbor areas and wood from dilapidated piers or sunken barges in northern New Jersey and New York, he said. That kind of debris is monitored from above by a special helicopter that alerts state-leased fishing boats with special scoop nets and collection vessels maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers as floatables are spotted in the New York Harbor area or are heading toward a New Jersey beach. The floatables are skimmed from the surface and disposed of legally.
Mr. Evenson and others in the department said that the health danger of the state's bathing waters had been grossly exaggerated in 1987 and 1988 and that 1989, in fact, had fewer beach closings, 12, than any of the last several years.
The state's surf and offshore waters are tested for bacterial content once or twice a week by a combination of local health officers and officials of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Evenson said. The testing is more thorough than in most states, he said.
 
Assurance on Beach Safety
''When you go to a beach in New Jersey,'' he said, ''you are assured that it is safe. If it is not safe, all the regional agencies will see that it is closed, so there is not that much reason for concern. Most other states can't say that.''
The percentage of beach closings along the 127-mile oceanfront of New Jersey is ''very small,'' Mr. Evenson said.
Local tourism officials and environmental groups have held numerous Shore community cleanup activities. They began in the middle of this month and were scheduled to culminate yesterday in the New Jersey Marathon/Trash-a-thon, a statewide program of festivities at Island Beach State Park including a massive beach cleanup by participants.
William DeCamp Jr., president of the Ocean County chapter of the Izaak Walton League, said that clean ocean water and the public's perception of it were often two different things.
''Shore tourism is closely related to people's perception of water quality,'' he said, ''and most people's perception of it only remotely corresponds to reality.''

HEADLINE: After 15 Years, Thieu and Ky Offer To Help Bring Down Hanoi's Rule

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 29

 BODY:
Fifteen years after the fall of Saigon, the two most prominent former leaders of South Vietnam - Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky - are becoming active again, seeking to find a role for themselves in the future of the country they fled.
Encouraged by the fall of Communist governments in Eastern Europe, they have recently begun touring the United States, Europe and Asia, seeking to build a personal following as they agitate for changes in Vietnam.
Their activities have raised eyebrows among some overseas Vietnamese, who question the credibility of the leaders of the failed Saigon Government.
In separate interviews last week on the eve of the April 30 anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the two men, like seasoned politicians, denied personal ambitions but offered themselves to help rebuild a post-Communist Vietnam. 
The two former political rivals, who now live in the United States, were reached by telephone during their separate travels, Mr. Thieu in Paris and Mr. Ky in Bangkok, Thailand. They made it clear that for them, the Vietnam War is still not over.
''The whole people of Vietnam are ready to stand up against the oppressor and to launch a national revolution,'' said Mr. Thieu, 66 years old, who was President of South Vietnam during its final years and who now lives mostly in Boston. ''I am ready to participate with them in the struggle by any means available.''
He said that if that struggle became violent, he stood ready to offer whatever support he could.
 
Ky Sees 'Final Victory'
Mr. Ky, 60, a former Prime Minister and Vice President who now lives in Westminster, Calif., said, ''With all the changes in Eastern Europe and even in Soviet Russia, we now have more hope, more confidence that soon the Vietnamese Communists will have to accept change.
''I think Americans and Vietnamese can achieve today what we could not achieve during the Vietnam War: a final victory over the Communists,'' he said.
Among overseas Vietnamese who sounded a skeptical note was Dam Phuong Tran, who heads a private group in Washington called the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam. ''When they were in power, all that money and all those armed forces poured in from this country, and they failed,'' she said. ''What do they think they can do now?''
Both men said they were operating on their own as they re-entered public life, and there was no sign that they were receiving encouragement or support from Washington.
''Is there a buck to be made in Vietnam? That is one possible objective,'' said Douglas Pike, director of Indochina studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ''Another objective could be a maneuvering for what you might call the leadership, the eminence grise, or emperor of Vietnamese abroad.''
Until recently, both Mr. Thieu and Mr. Ky led relatively quiet lives while the highly factionalized and sometimes violent world of Vietnamese emigre politics swirled around them.
After first fleeing to Taiwan, Mr. Thieu lived for many years in London, rarely speaking or appearing in public. His higher profile began only in recent months after he moved last year to join family members in Boston.
His supporters would say little about his activities or his means of support during his years abroad.
Mr. Ky, who said he saw his future role in Vietnam as helping to rebuild the economy, has not found economic success in the United States.
He owned a liquor store from 1977 to 1984, when he declared bankruptcy, and subsequently failed in a shrimp fishing venture in Louisiana. He now lives with a sister in the Vietnamese community in Westminster, near Los Angeles.
In 1984 the columnist Jack Anderson accused him of being involved in Vietnamese criminal gangs in the United States. Mr. Ky heatedly denied the accusation.
The former fighter pilot has been somewhat more politically active than Mr. Thieu, particularly among Vietnamese war veterans. He drew attention a year ago when he called for political and economic pressure on the Hanoi Government, saying the time for armed resistance by guerrilla groups had passed.
That position, which Mr. Thieu now also voices, has in the past prompted violent attacks and even some killings by hard-line Vietnamese emigres who oppose any contacts with the Communist Government.
Doan Van Thoai, a writer and political speaker, was shot and badly wounded in Fresno last August after voicing a similar position. In an interview last month, he said changes in the Communist world and growing cynicism among overseas Vietnamese had led men like Mr. Thieu and Mr. Ky to shift toward his more moderate stand.
Referring to events in Eastern Europe, Nepal and Mongolia, Mr. Thieu described a number of factors that he argued could touch off an uprising in Vietnam, including divisions in the Communist Party and the military and tensions between officials from the northern and southern parts of the country.
''I would like to say that sooner or later there will be an explosion,'' he said.
''I have no political ambition,'' Mr. Thieu said. ''I only want to participate, to do the best I can do to support the movement for democracy and freedom inside Vietnam.''
He said he was determined to return home, possibly even before a change of government.
Mr. Ky, rather than speaking of an uprising, said he advocated diplomatic and economic pressure to force changes by the Hanoi Government.
''The Government is corrupt,'' he said. ''The people are unhappy. They are going out begging for economic aid from the so-called capitalist countries, and my idea is to use that kind of pressure to make changes in Vietnam.''
''As for my personal role, I would like to do something to help in the eocnomic field,'' Mr. Ky continued. ''I am 100 percent sure I will not be involved in politics in Vietnam.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
East German, in Moscow, Calls for Changes in NATO

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 29

 BODY:
East Germany's new Prime Minister called for changes in the ''structure and strategy'' of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization today as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reiterated the Soviet Union's opposition to a united Germany's belonging to NATO.
In his first Kremlin visit since taking office two weeks ago, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany said he and Mr. Gorbachev had ''differences of opinion'' about potential NATO membership for a reunited Germany.
But the Prime Minister expressed optimism that progress on the issue might be possible at the coming negotiations on German unification to be held by the foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the four wartime Allies: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
After Mr. de Maiziere left here following his daylong Kremlin visit, Mr. Gorbachev was quoted on national television as declaring, ''The Soviet Union's attitude toward unilateral, unbalanced proposals of the entry of a future German state into NATO remains negative.'' 
 
Wants 2 Issues Synchronized
At the same time, Mr. Gorbachev stressed his existing position urging a ''synchronization'' of the two issues of German unity and the search for future security structures in Europe.
Within this position, however, the Kremlin previously indicated some flexibility on the unification issue. In a White House visit this month, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze signaled that Moscow was prepared to drop its demand that a unified Germany be neutral. Mr. Shevardnadze confirmed this in an interview Saturday with The Irish Times.
Mr. Shevardnadze had said in his Washington visit April 6 that Moscow was open to any number of proposed pan-European security structures, and even to the idea that a united Germany could belong to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
In opposing simple NATO membership, Mr. Gorbachev previously had called for radical changes in the roles of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, placing greater emphasis on political and economic missions now that European disarmament was an ongoing process.
 
Wartime Sacrifices Cited
American and West European officials say they believe that Moscow wants to keep troops in the eastern part of Germany for several years after unification, and that Mr. Gorbachev may feel pressure from Soviet veterans and military men not to withdraw quickly from the country that cost 20 million Soviet lives to conquer in World War II.
It remains to be seen in future negotiations whether this position leaves room for progress along the lines proposed today by Mr. de Maiziere for NATO changes that he did not otherwise specify.
The Prime Minister said after his talks with Mr. Gorbachev and other officials that the East German position now was that ''NATO should change its structure and strategy to discuss the issue of our membership.''
''Neutrality is not a solution to the problem,'' he added, without discussing Mr. Shevardnadze's latest mention of a possible nonaligned status for a new Germany.
Mr. de Maiziere said it was important to ''obviate'' the East-West security blocs, not to emphasize them by having neutral states. ''We do not want to play the role of a buffer zone,'' he said.
 
'New Approaches' Sought
In stressing that the Soviet attitude toward a united Germany's membership in NATO ''remains negative,'' Mr. Gorbachev said, ''Such an attitude is dictated by political realism and serious concern about the prospects for Europe and about the prospects for new approaches to its problems.''
He added, ''We favor the synchronization and coordination between the process of German unification and the formation of security structures on the European scale.'' He did not elaborate on how or when such an approach might be managed.
Mr. de Maiziere described his talks as ''important and useful.'' He said East Germany had no intention of entering NATO under its current doctrine, presumably a reference to its cold war roots.
On other issues, the Prime Minister stressed that East Germany intended to live up to existing economic obligations with the Soviet Union and hoped to increase those ties. In this regard, he said, a rapid transition to convertible currencies was needed in particular.

HEADLINE: In Boston, an Example Of Service and Diversity

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
On the wall of the headquarters of City Year, a youth service program here, hangs a copy of an American Indian prayer: ''Great spirit, grant that I shall not criticize my brother or sister until I have walked a mile in their moccasins.''
The founders of the program say it lets young people walk with, and help out, Boston's most vulnerable residents: the poor, the homeless and the physically and mentally disabled.
And as Congress considers legislation to establish an urban version of the Peace Corps nationwide, the Boston initiative has stirred special interest because its 50 recruits are a racially diverse group, some from affluent suburbs and Ivy League colleges, and others jobless high-school dropouts, from inner city neighborhoods.
''I'm unaware of any other youth corps that brings together so diverse a group of young people,'' said Greg Petersmeyer, director of the Office of National Service, which was created by President Bush to engage Americans in solving social problems in their communities. Mr. Petersmeyer recently came to Boston, where he watched City Year members build a soup kitchen in a Baptist church. 
For City Year members, who are 17 to 22 years old, their ethnic, economic and social diversity is a source of pride, especially in a city that has been repeatedly split by racial tension. Last year, in a case that transfixed and divided Boston, the police carried out extensive searches in black neighborhoods for a suspect in the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman. Weeks later, suspicion turned to the woman's husband, who then apparently committed suicide by jumping off a bridge here.
 
'Race Is a Nonissue'
''For a time we felt we were a last oasis in a city gone nuts,'' said Michael Cheroutes, a 20-year-old corps member from Denver who is on leave from Tulane University. ''We wanted to say, 'Hey, look at us, we've built a world where race is a nonissue' ''
He and Thomas Lowenstein, 20, a Milton Academy graduate, teamed up with Kenny Lopez, 22, and Cory Israel, 19, to share an apartment. The four jokingly boast about being ''two preppies and two inner city guys'' who are living together and forging bonds they expect to outlast their year of service.
It was two other roommates, Alan Khazei and Michael Brown, both 29-year-old graduates of Harvard Law School, who set out in 1987 to create City Year, the country's first privately financed youth corps. They raised $1.2 million from corporations and foundations, enabling City Year to supply a stipend of $100 a week and a college scholarship of $5,000 to each of 50 recruits who completes a year of service.
The two are unabashed in expressing their blue-sky idealism, saying: ''We were searching for a way to change the country for the better. We enlisted each other.''
Mr. Khazei and Mr. Brown say they drew inspiration from President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. And the framed Indian prayer hangs beside a photograph of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in City Year headquarters.
 
Effort to Fight Poverty
''We started City Year really out of a sense of optimism and hope that together, we can build a better community,'' said Mr. Brown. Mr. Khazei broke in to say: ''And also out of frustration that we have the richest country in the world but also some of the deepest poverty and high infant mortality. Here in Boston, 3,500 homeless likely slept on the streets last night.''
After graduating, both worked in Washington where lawmakers were sifting proposals for a federally financed youth corps. One such bill, pushed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, for a National and Community Service Act with a $125 million pricetag, passed on March 1, and another version has been introduced in the House. Both would provide money for youth service corps that are operating in several cities and for establishing new programs.
The founders of City Year are not holding their breath waiting on Federal money. For now, the group is housed rent-free in a cavernous loft provided by the Boston Wharf Company and renovated without charge by 25 companies and seven labor unions.
Their biggest grant, of $175,000, came from the Bank of Boston. Ira Jackson, a bank senior vice president, calls it ''an investment in an idea whose time has come for Boston and for all American cities.'' He added: ''These kids just make me melt.''
Not all of the corps' experiences went according to plan. Early on, six recruits were dismissed because they could not meet the demands of the rigorous program, and three quit. Regardless of weather, members are expected to show up weekdays at 8:30 A.M. in uniform for an hour of calisthenics in front of the Federal Reserve Building and then work until 4:30 on assigned projects.
 
Corps' Accomplishments
But members prefer focusing on City Year's growing list of accomplishments. The corps created and now manages an after-school program for children at a low-income housing development in Egleston Square. It salvaged and distributed 130 tons of surplus food, painted a shelter for the homeless, and repaired and cleaned the homes of senior citizens in East Boston.
At the Blackstone Elementary School, which has the city's largest percentage of Hispanic pupils, corps members have tutored scores of youths in reading and math, but ''their bigger achievement was serving as role models,'' said the principal, William Ubines.
Before City Year began in September, the organizers ran an experimental summer program, modeled in part on New York's City Volunteer Corps, started in 1984.
Michael Brown, in fact, spent a year working in the New York program, a city-financed undertaking that enrolled 5,000 young people in parttime and fulltime jobs. Unlike Boston, which sought a small, diverse group, New York wanted to put hundreds of young people into service quickly. Black and Hispanic youths make up 90 percent of the group, and white and Asian youths make up 10 percent.
Elsewhere, a consortium of private foundations is promoting urban youth corps in 15 other cities under a program developed by Public/Private Ventures, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit research orgnization, and the National Association of Service and Conservation Corps.
A number of Boston's City Year members aspire to careers in national politics, and Mr. Brown and Mr. Khazie maintain that their community service will give them the ''integrity'' to speak from first-hand experience.
Whatever work he chooses, the corps experience has made Kenny Lopez, who was born in Roxbury, certain of one thing: He will not move away from the city that is his home. ''I know now I can go out and be somebody,'' he said. ''I intend to make it here in Boston.''

HEADLINE: Military Aid vs. Drugs? Yes, but . . .

 BODY:
Washington is finally about to release $230 million in aid money, much of it for military support, to help Andean governments combat cocaine. Is expanded military aid and advice the right way to address the drug problem in Latin America?
The answer is yes, with three conditions: Military aid should be funneled through civilian governments with due attention to supporting democracy. U.S. advisers have to abstain from any combat role. And the aid has to be part of a broader strategy that includes economic development. 
Some argue that the cocaine supply can't be reduced enough to affect drug use on the street. And it's true that only a cut in supply large enough to force a dramatic increase in prices could make a difference. It's also true that Andean coca farmers feeling pressured in one area have plenty of opportunity to plant in another.
But this futility theory is premature. The serious attempt of Andean governments (Bolivia, Colombia and Peru) to reduce cocaine production began only last year. And until now, Washington has provided only minimal support.
Even so, there are some surprisingly positive results. Colombia's campaign against drug traffickers, followed by a less publicized campaign in Bolivia, broke up the production pipeline, making it harder for growers to sell their crop. As a result, the price for raw coca leaves plummeted. The hundred pounds that once brought $60 now sells for around $10, well below the $30 cost of production.
In Bolivia, the market collapse has impelled coca growers to sign up in impressive numbers for a program paying them to tear up coca and plant other crops. In all of 1989, crop substitution eliminated only 2,500 hectares of coca; so far this year the acreage eliminated exceeds 3,000. Meanwhile, U.S. drug officials note that the wholesale price of cocaine in American cities has increased since last September by 10 percent to 25 percent, while purity of cocaine on the street has decreased by 10 percent.
However modest, these are promising signs and reason to welcome the $230 million in new aid money. Yet the prospect of greater military aid still stirs concern about Vietnam-style escalation. Perspective is important: yes, the new aid might double U.S. military advisers in the Andes, but only to about 400 for the three countries. And they would be there to support police, not combat operations.
The Administration also has to be very careful about Peru at a time when the civilian government is in the process of changing hands. The aid ought to be given in a way that does not feed anxieties about supporting the Peruvian military.
Finally, and most important, there is a danger of too much reliance on military solutions. A policy of military pressure alone risks replacing narcoterrorism with severely disrupted economies. Washington officials dismiss such concerns by pointing to plans for $175 million in economic aid next fiscal year. But skeptics worry over the firmness of that commitment given budget pressures.
Reassurance is important, both at home and in Latin America, and there is one obvious way to achieve it: Give Bolivia more money for its expanding crop substitution program right now. Such an investment in agriculture could also yield big dividends in credibility throughout the hemisphere.

HEADLINE: Blacks in College: Numbers and Rate

 BODY:
The number of black students in college increased between 1986 and 1988, after nearly a decade of decline, the U.S. Department of Education reports. It's encouraging news, but there's still cause for concern.
In 1980 the figure for black undergraduates was 1,028,000. It dipped to 995,000 in 1984-85. Since then, the numbers have climbed again, reaching 1,039,000 in 1988. But meanwhile, other numbers present a more dismaying picture. 
One reason concerns college enrollment. In 1988, 75 percent of blacks between the ages of 18 and 24 had completed high school, compared with less than 70 percent in 1980. But the proportion of blacks going on to college remained stagnant, at about 28 percent, and that was down from the peak of 33 percent in 1976. By comparison, the high school completion rate of whites remained at about 81 percent but the proportion going on to college increased, from 32 to 37 percent.
A second reason for concern is variation by sex. Among blacks who do go to college, three in five are women. A growing gap between educated black men and women gives reason for worry about the future of black families and the nation's work force.
Why aren't more blacks going to college? One reason is cost. During the Reagan years, the proportion of Federal financial aid in grants declined relative to loans, and benefits per student did not keep pace with inflation. That helped to discourage blacks - more often poor, less likely to borrow.
For many minority students, however, the problem begins long before college. Despite recent improvements in college aptitude scores, many black high school graduates remain unsure of their academic skills, and many poorer students lack family and community support for a commitment to college.
Those problems add more weight to the case for aggressive early intervention programs to help disadvantaged minority youngsters, particularly boys, do better in elementary and secondary school. In the meantime, colleges could step up outreach programs, especially those that offer a taste of higher education. Private colleges, which accounted for an impressive 7 percent of the latest enrollment increase among blacks, show the worth of aggressive programs to recruit and retain minority students.

Europe's Borders: Faint - or Fragile

BYLINE: By Leon V. Sigal

 BODY:
Flows of trade and investment can surmount political borders between states. States can raise higher walls, but at a fearsome price. This tension between openness and insularity now arises on Poland's border with Germany. 
Some borders in Western Europe are fast becoming geographers' formalities. As one looks down on the German-Belgian frontier from the air, nothing demarcates one country from another. Trains roll back and forth with barely a pause. Customs inspectors no longer open luggage. Control officers stamp no documents.
But the insecure nations of Central and Eastern Europe may insist on shoring up borders they regard as fragile. Even as the Iron Curtain disappears, past transgressions leave enduring scars. And even as Poles, Hungarians and Czechoslovaks open their markets to international trade, they see their borders as symbols of sovereignty.
That's why Chancellor Kohl's calculated ambiguity about Germany's border with Poland seems so parochial and retrograde. His Germany has an enormous stake in economic internationalism, throughout Europe. By his reluctance to guarantee the Polish border against change by force, he intensified the suspicions of Polish nationalists who want to resist German economic domination.
No thoughtful German today contemplates a military push east. But Germans who thrill to newfound economic power see investment and trade with Poland as a way to extend influence. And Germans who see a need to overcome the legacies of the past want to help Poland prosper.
Poles desperately need foreign trade and investment if they are to pull themselves out of their economic quagmire. For too long, they have had to depend on sales to the Soviet market, a dependence that will continue until the quality of Polish products improves. That's why Poles are eager for foreign investors to help them replace obsolescent plant and equipment.
But Poles worry that Germany's eastern boundary has never been clearly demarcated in German minds, regardless of where the line is drawn on German maps. It's of little consolation to Poles that today's temptation takes economic, not military, form. They regard the border as a barrier to German penetration. They want an international guarantee of the border, and they've allowed the Red Army to remain in Poland until they get it.
To balance German economic influence, the Poles are encouraging trade and investment from others - especially the United States and France. The economic balance of power inside Poland may matter more to them than the military balance of power outside Poland.
Mr. Kohl's neighbors don't believe that Germany intends to transgress borders. But he has missed an opening for Germany to transcend them.

HEADLINE: Costly Homes Foil Hopes Of Buyers

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Despite a recent drop in prices, the goal of home ownership in the New York metropolitan region is far more elusive today than it was 10 years ago.
While median incomes increased by half in the 1980's, the median price of houses and apartments escalated at three times that rate. Economists say the growing gap between housing prices and incomes is among the most serious threats to the region's vitality.
Among those hardest hit by the surge in prices - which was the largest ever in the metropolitan area - were young people seeking to buy for the first time, blue-collar families, households with only one wage earner and those coming to New York from other parts of the country.
Some people were forced to leave the region during the decade for areas where housing costs were lower. Corporations, along with cultural and educational organizations, found it much more difficult to recruit people to New York. Some companies that left the area, including the Mobil Corporation, blamed the high price of housing and the resulting difficulty of recruiting young executives. 
 
'Housing Has Become Unattainable''
Unless incomes rise significantly or housing prices drop further, some economists say, the New York region is likely to become less able to compete with most metropolitan areas in the fight for new jobs and industry.
''Housing has really become unattainable for many people,'' said Rosemary Scanlon, the chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which monitors regional trends. ''Many people at the low- and middle-income level found it impossible to do anything. And my guess is that a whole chunk of young middle-income people, the baby boomers, are way behind people in other regions.''
The statistics paint a stark tableau. The median price of a single-family home in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut areas soared to $183,200 last year from $70,500 in 1982, when the rise began, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Cooperative and condominium prices in Manhattan nearly doubled in the same period, rising to an average of $486,180 in 1989 from an average of $247,700 in 1982, according to a survey by the Corcoran Group, a real-estate brokerage firm. Housing prices peaked in 1988, and have fallen, on average, about 5 to 10 percent since then.
The increases over the decade far outpaced advances in income. Median family income rose to $38,820 last year from $25,500 in 1982 in the 17-county area of New York and northern New Jersey served by the Port Authority, the agency's projections show.
Median income thus went up by 52 percent, compared with a 160 percent increase in the median price of a single-family house. Nationally, the median price of a house went up only 37 percent between 1982 and 1989, reaching $93,100.
''The market simply isn't serving the average family,'' said Bonnie Brower, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development, a federation of nonprofit community groups in the city. ''It's a grim picture.''
 
Financial Help From Parents
But many people whose incomes were above the median were able to afford housing, even at vastly inflated prices. So were those who could muster financial help from parents and other family members to pay large down payments, thus limiting the size of their mortgages. And many people who owned relatively inexpensive housing in 1980 saw their equity increase two- and three-fold during the decade.
But for those not yet in the market, the purchase of a house or apartment became ever more unattainable. Experts summarized the severity of the problem this way: In 1980, many families with the median income, $25,500 a year, could manage, with some belt-tightening, to buy the median-price house, at $77,100, even though interest rates were then at record highs.
But in 1989, most families with the median income of $38,820 a year simply could not buy the median-priced, $183,400 house. Economists estimated that fewer than 20 percent of all families in the New York area could purchase a house in the conventional way: with a 20 percent down payment and a mortgage of about $150,000.
 
'It's Barely Existent'
''We face a situation where the housing market exists for a tiny percentage of the population,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that helps develop government subsidized, middle-income housing. ''It's not so much that the market is dysfunctional; it's barely existent.''
The only way that a family with a median income could have bought the median-priced house would be by taking out a mortgage of $100,000 - the largest for which such a family could qualify - and paying a down payment of nearly half, or $83,000.
''How do you do that?'' asked Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group. ''You either have relatives or you already own a house that you are selling.''
 
Foreclosed That Option
In addition to closing many families out of the home-buying market, the surge of prices had other consequences: it enabled the city to retain many middle-class people who in earlier decades might have left for the suburbs, Ms. Wylde said. The price escalation in the suburbs foreclosed that option for many city residents.
Corporations had increased difficulty recruiting people to come to work in the region. Executives living in large, pleasant houses in places like Chicago, Houston or Detroit had to pay two or three times the selling price of their homes to find comparable housing in New York. Many chose not to make the sacrifice.
An executive from Kansas City recently terminated negotiations for a position with a New York bank after a conversation about the cost of housing. The executive told bank officials that his four-bedroom home, with a backyard pool, in a Kansas City suburb would sell for about $150,000. He asked what that sum would buy in Westchester. The answer: not much.
Cultural and nonprofit groups, from museums to orchestras to social-welfare organizations, had similar difficulties, particularly because those groups do not typically pay high salaries.
Economists say many factors produced the price escalation. Among them were a pent-up demand caused by the huge interest rates of the early 1980's; a slowdown in new construction; demographic shifts that saw many baby-boomers seeking their first house; the rise of the two-income family, and investor confidence fueled by an appreciation in the value of homes that reached 20 percent or more a year.
Ms. Scanlon of the Port Authority said that soaring incomes on Wall Street also helped bid up the price of housing. In 1988, the average wage in New York's securities and investment banking industries was $80,000 a year, while the average for all other workers in private companies was $28,000. Wall Street wages increased four-fold percent between 1977 and 1988, while all other wages rose 87 percent.
It was not coincidental, Ms. Scanlon said, that housing prices began to drop soon after the stock market's collapse in October 1987.
And while many people who purchased a house or apartment at the market's peak have lost money, economists and housing experts said the drop in prices should also bring some benefits. It could make New York more competitive with other regions, and it could begin to make home ownership available to more of the population.
''The price break is beneficial to the region,'' Ms. Scanlon said. ''It breaks the inflationary cycle, but it is still not sufficient to make housing more affordable.''

HEADLINE: Beirut Captors Say They Will Free Second American;
Bush Hopeful but Cautious

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29

 BODY:
President Bush expressed hope that the pledge to release Mr. Reed would prove true, but declined to say more.
''I've learned not to speculate on the hostages for the reasons I keep explaining. I just won't say anything,'' said the President, who was asked about the report as he was playing a round of golf on a course at nearby Andrews Air Force Base. ''If that proves to be true, it's wonderful.'' 
A State Department official who refused to be named said that there was ''some movement'' toward the release of Mr. Reed and perhaps other hostages as well. How long that movement might last is not clear, he said.
He said he knows of no tradeoffs made or promised to Iran by the United States to secure the freedom of Mr. Reed or Mr. Polhill.
Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, seems to be leading efforts to free the hostages, but other Government leaders are resisting the move.
A leading Middle East political expert, Graham Fuller, said that the spate of hostage actions ''is clearly intended to get the issue finished, to clear the decks for Rafsanjani's own domestic and economic internal agenda.''
''If it was simply the United States'' demanding the hostages' release, ''Rafsanjani could go on without a great deal of concern,'' said Mr. Fuller, a Rand Corporation expert and the top Middle East analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency until 1987.
''But since the European states have also said that the resolution of the hostage crisis is necessary to any normalization of relations, that places much more distinct pressure on Rafsanjani himself,'' he said.
 
Family Encouraged by Report
BOSTON, April 29 (Special to The New York Times) - The daughter of Mr. Reed said today that she was ''very excited but yet apprehensive'' after learning that Lebanese kidnappers in Beirut had announced they would free her father within two days.
Mr. Reed's daughter, Marilyn Langston, said the statement was the first word the family has had about Mr. Reed since he was kidnapped in Beirut in September 1986.
''What's encouraging is that it helps us to see that he is alive,'' said Mrs. Langston, who lives in Malden.

HEADLINE: 36.6% Rise In Orders For Tools

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Rising to their highest level since September, new orders for American-made machine tools increased 36.6 percent in March, with both domestic manufacturers and foreign customers increasing their orders.
A monthly report to be released today by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, the trade association for the machine-tool industry, said that the level of new orders rose to $265.8 million in March, up from $194.55 million in February.
But compared with the March level a year earlier, new orders were down by 8.5 percent, the association said. The level for the first quarter of this year was also down by 17.6 percent from the comparable period in 1989. 
 
Rebound in Spending
The monthly surge in new orders reflected a rebound in capital spending, analysts said, adding that many manufacturers had begun to spend on plant modernization after months in which such programs had been suspended. They cautioned, however, that it was too soon to tell whether a sustained period of more robust capital spending was imminent, since machine-tool orders fluctuate widely from month to month.
''Even though there was an increase in March, the level of new orders is still fairly low,'' said James J. Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian in Omaha. ''There was weak first-quarter activity in the automobile industry and in other industries.
''We are seeing some buying going on now for new automobile models,'' Mr. Paper added. ''But one month does not make a trend.''
The higher March levels included a 20.6 percent increase in domestic orders, to $189.67 million. Foreign orders more than doubled, to $76.3 million, the association's report said.
 
'Slight Improvement'
Thomas J. Czech, the chief economist with Blunt, Ellis & Loewi in Milwaukee, said the higher tool orders reflected ''slight improvement in the manufacturing sector in the last few months.'' He said the figures indicated ''that the economy is not yet going into a recession.''
''It's a good level of new orders,'' he said, ''but it is not an outstanding reading.''
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production. Economists consider machine-tool sales patterns to be important indicators of capital-spending patterns by manufacturers.
Albert W. Moore, the president of the trade association, which is based in McLean, Va., said that the March increase was welcome but that he was concerned that much of the gain came from foreign orders.
''America's apparent reluctance to invest in the face of strong global competition contrasts with foreign manufacturers - who are investing, and investing heavily in modern productivity-improving machines.'' he said. ''Foreign manufacturers invest, while we in America sit on our wallets steadily losing competitiveness.''
 
Strong Foreign Orders
John F. Townsend, the vice president of planning and business development for Giddings & Lewis Inc., a machine-tool producer based in Fond du Lac, Wis., said orders had been strong from foreign customers, particularly from the aerospace and construction-machinery industries.
''Our inquiries for new orders are high from foreign customers,'' he said. ''And domestic inquiries have been up also. Things seem to be getting better all around.''
Still, the machine-tool industry has been particularly hurt by the downturn in the American automobile industry, which typically accounts for about a third of machine-tool orders. Consequently, many tool manufacturers have begun to look to Europe, where demand for new tools is growing at a faster pace. $198.2 Million in Orders Orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were up by 70.4 percent in March, to $198.2 million, the association said. That segment of the industry typically accounts for about three-fourths of machine-tool orders.
New orders for metal-forming tools increased by 2.6 percent in March, to $206 million, from February's level, the association said. The shipments of machine tools were up by 7.8 percent in March, to $288.9 million, from February's $268 million.
The order backlog for March stood at $1.68 billion, down slightly from February's $1.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Push to Link Europe's Markets

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 29

 BODY:
The European Community's program for economic unity has unleashed forces that are driving the community's stock exchanges to create a pan-European market for trading the shares of Europe's biggest companies.
Once again, national self-interest is making European unity much easier to talk about than achieve. And once again, business is driving the recalcitrants forward.
The business opportunities that are expected to flow from the European Community's program for economic unification and the crumbling of Communism in Eastern Europe are pushing large companies to become more pan-European. This is increasing their need for capital and stimulating the interest of international investors in European stocks. 
 
Clamor by Institutions
As a result, big financial institutions around the world are clamoring for an efficient trading and settling system for the shares of the top 100 to 300 European companies.
Salomon Brothers Inc. estimates that about 75 percent, or nearly $40 billion, of the $52.92 billion in new money invested in the international equities market last year was invested in European markets.
And Salomon notes that this figure only takes into account European shares bought in their domestic markets by foreigners and not, for example, turnover in foreign stocks on the London Stock Exchange or in the form of American depository receipts. A.D.R.'s are the equivalent of shares in particular foreign companies and can be traded in stock markets in the United States.
But banks, other investment firms and European multinational corporations argue that many local exchanges are ill-equipped to satisfy the rapidly growing appetite for European equities. They note that liquidity - the ability to buy or sell a large stock holding - varies greatly across Europe as does the quality of clearance and settlement systems.
Some financial institutions are threatening to form an exchange themselves. Companies like Reuters Holdings P.L.C. have the technology and the information systems to enable them to carry out such a plan.
Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. gave the exchanges a scare in March when it sold a large number of Nestle shares by posting the price on Reuters screens and then clearing the purchases of the Swiss company's shares through Euroclear, a system owned by financial institutions and operated by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
''That was the entire purpose: to create a stir and tell the stock exchanges to create something or the free market has shown it is perfectly capable of addressing the problem,'' said Hans-Jorg Rudloff, chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Already worried by what they believe to be a rising amount of off-exchange trading that has been made easier by electronic networks, officials of Europe's leading stock markets agree that the danger of financial institutions creating a blue-chip exchange is real.
''The exchanges have to get together to organize that marketplace as quickly as they can,'' said Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London exchange.
But leaders of the three most important exchanges - London, Frankfurt and Paris - have differing ideas on how to go about it. That is not surprising, given the competition among the three cities to be Europe's pre-eminent financial center.
Regis Rousselle, head of the Paris Bourse, wants the top stocks to be traded simultaneously on any of the European Community's exchanges that choose to do so. Trades would then be reported to all markets through Pipe, a financial-information network that the Federation of Stock Exchanges in the European Community hopes to create.
''If we improve demand for securities in each country and encourage issuers, liquidity will be higher than now and it will not be necessary to create a central market for block trading,'' one of Mr. Rousselle's lieutenants said. Many suspect Mr. Rousselle hopes to win back business for the Paris Bourse, which has lost a large amount of trading in French blue chips to London.
 
'Why Reinvent the Wheel?'
Mr. Hugh Smith wants a central exchange for the top 300 or so European stocks. Although he insists he is flexible, he says it would make sense for such a system to be based on the five-year-old SEAQ International, the computerized, ''screen-based'' price-information system that has made London the leader in trading European equities. ''Why reinvent the wheel when we've got one?'' he said.
Mr. Hugh Smith has approached the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the biggest of West Germany's eight, about forming an alliance. But Frankfurt officials do not seem eager. Friedrich von Metzler, president of the Frankfurt exchange, would like Pipe to be turned into the central trading and settlement system for big stocks.
''Why should we support a system based in London?'' said Rudiger von Rosen, executive vice chairman of the Federation of German Stock Exchanges. ''How could we have influence in a system that is the backbone of the London exchange?''
Although financial institutions often attack the exchanges for being too parochial, it is unclear whether the West German banks and others that now dominate trading in their domestic stocks will be less parochial.
Noting that institutions are under pressure from investors, Barthold von Ribbentrop, executive vice president of the Deutsche Bank in West Germany, predicts that a central market will be formed.
''There is no national pride left among financial institutions or investors,'' he said. ''And the interests of intermediaries and investors are strong enough to overcome any bickering among the exchanges.''
While Mr. von Ribbentrop called the Pipe proposal ''interesting,'' he said that ''we are far from saying that is the system; we are in favor of any system that would increase liquidity.''
Many companies and financial institutions say one of the main problems is that many local exchanges do not provide sufficient liquidity.
 
Spain and Italy Cited
Mr. Rudloff of Credit Suisse First Boston said big Swiss multinationals like Nestle ''don't get the valuations they deserve'' on the four Swiss exchanges. ''Therefore, it is much more expensive for them to raise capital. The problems are even bigger in the Spanish and Italian markets.''
While the Paris Bourse, which now has market-makers that put up their own capital and make quotes, has made great strides in recent years, some companies say they still cannot depend on it to get a good price for large blocks of stocks. There are similar complaints about the West German exchanges.
Even the London exchange, which is considered the most liquid in Europe, has its critics. Robert B. Horton, the new chairman of the British Petroleum Company, complains that B.P. is too big a stock for the exchange.
Rather than solving the liquidity problem, many bankers and brokers fear Mr. Rousselle's proposal would only compound it. ''If you want to create liquidity, you have to concentrate demand and supply in one place,'' Mr. Rudloff of Credit Suisse First Boston said.
While some financial institutions are less concerned about liquidity, virtually all agree that more efficient clearance and settlement systems are needed. ''Settlement will be the thing that drives markets together,'' said David I. Neeson, managing director of Morgan Stanley International in London.
 
Germans Most Efficient
The West Germans are among the most efficient: deals on their exchanges can be settled in two days. It can take up to three weeks in London and as long as a month on the Paris and Milan exchanges. And Spain's settlement system is so complicated that some big institutions avoid Spanish stocks altogether.
Euroclear, the system operated by financial institutions and operated by Morgan Guaranty Trust, uses a computer to transfer payment and ownership of securities simultaneously between customers' accounts. The securities, which are held in a depository network, do not physically move. Financial institutions also like the fact that the cost of using private clearers for a cross-border transaction is a fraction of the $25 to $100 it typically costs to clear and settle in the local market.
''If we could use them for all our Continental business, it would be much more cost-effective,'' said Nigel Davis, head of market-making in Continental stocks at James Capel & Company, a London-based broker.
For its part, Reuters, the leading provider of price information for stocks trading in Europe, is expanding its capability to execute trades. Its Instinet service acts as an electronic broker for British and American stocks traded in Europe and it plans to add some French and West German stocks.
Reuters is also expanding its Dealing 2000 electronic trading system, which now dominates worldwide foreign-exchange trading. The system, which is expected to soon be able to match the best bids and offers in a matter of seconds, is the basis for Globex, the service that Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and France's futures exchange, Matif, the Marche a Terme des Instruments Financiers, are setting up for trading financial futures. And John L. Stephens, a Reuters deputy managing director, notes that the technology could be used for trading other financial instruments, including stocks.
 
Wants to Aid Exchanges
Mr. Stephens stresses that Instinet belongs to various stock exchanges and that Reuters does not want to assume the regulatory responsibilities of an exchange. The company is also wary of alienating the exchanges: it hopes to make a big business out of helping them go electronic.
Reuters and Euroclear are the only ones that can offer such services. Euroclear's main competitor is Cedel, which is based in Luxembourg. Other information services include Telerate, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company; Citicorp's Quotron; Japanese-owned Quick and Telekurz, a service owned by Swiss banks.
In what could be just a first step into Europe, the National Association of Securities Dealers plans to begin operating a service in London in September for trading American stocks and foreign stocks in the form of American depository receipts.
So Europe's exchanges had better start moving, Credit Suisse First Boston's Mr. Rudloff said. ''We don't care whether it's this idea or another; what we really care about is that something efficient is developed,'' he added.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Expectations Of Fed Move Are Growing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A growing number of analysts say that the recent sharp rise in bond yields has intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to tighten monetary policy.
If the Fed does decide to act, these analysts said any action would probably come before May 8, when the first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction is expected to begin.
The case made by these analysts over the last couple of weeks was that a quick move by the Fed to raise the overnight Federal funds rate from its 8 1/4 percent level would not only reconfirm the central bank's credibility as an inflation fighter, but would also help stem any further increase in long-term interest rates.
''Prompt action might stabilize the bond market, while delay would likely foster a further selloff that could push yields to 9 1/4 percent to 9 1/2 percent,'' said Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers. 
Despite a mild rally at the end of last week, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 ended late Friday at 9.02 percent. On Thursday the yield was at 9.04 percent, its highest level in nearly a year.
''The question of whether the Fed might tighten is a very viable one,'' said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''The Fed has to have been bothered by some of the recent economic statistics, particularly the inflation figures.''
 
Fed May Wait for Economic Data
But given the recent spate of poor economic reports, including the biggest quarterly jump in inflation since 1981, there are some Fed watchers who think that if the Fed has not taken any action by early May, the central bank will wait to see more data on economic activity in the second quarter, particularly the consumer price data due in mid-May.
Reports expected this week will provide market participants with their first look at economic activity in the second quarter. Unfortunately, they do not appear likely to dispel the sour mood of the credit markets.
''We are still in a mode where you should sell on rallies,'' said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''There is no reason to think we have found bottom here.''
The odds appear good that the April survey of the nation's purchasing managers, due Tuesday, will show that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved from March.
April employment figures to be released on Friday will be artificially inflated by the hiring of an estimated 250,000 Census workers. As a result, participants are likely to disregard the payroll numbers.
 
Inflation Fears
But a number of analysts said that other key elements of the report, including a possibly sharp rise in average hourly earnings, will be difficult to ignore. Another increase would be the third in a row, and would probably intensify worries about inflation.
Finally, Wednesday's announcement from the Treasury on the size of its quarterly refunding auctions in May could be surprising.
Until recently, most analysts had been anticipating that the Treasury would sell a total of $30 billion of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds at the auctions.
But those estimates have been ratcheted upward recently.
Griggs & Santow estimates the Treasury will sell a total of $30.75 billion worth of new securities: $10.50 billion of 3-year notes, $10.25 billion of 10-year notes and $10 billion of 30-year bonds.
''There is some wishful thinking on the part of the market that the Treasury will sell $30 billion,'' Mr. Santow said. ''When you look at their needs and the kind of money they have to raise, I think our estimates are closer to the mark.''
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president and chief executive of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., said that a refunding total ''considerably'' more than $30 billion ''could act as another factor dampening prices'' in the credit markets.
While the amount of new Treasury issues to be sold could increase, investors in the investment-grade corporate bond market are having a difficult time finding new debt securities issued by commercial banks.
 
Downgrading Banks
The reason is fairly straightforward: troubled real estate portfolios, tougher regulatory requirements and generally poor earnings have led ratings agencies to downgrade 44 banking companies so far this year, including Citicorp, the nation's largest.
As a consequence, yields on outstanding issues have risen, in some cases sharply. At current levels, few banks are willing to issue new securities.
So far this year, an average of $169 million worth of new bank issues have been priced each month, according to data from Salomon Brothers. In 1989, by comparison, the average monthly total was $947 million.
Even with serious problems confronting many banks, yields on bank notes and bonds compared with Treasury securities of comparable maturity are very high.
An example can be seen in a recent financing for First Interstate Bank in California, the nation's 16th largest.
Last week the bank priced a $112 million seven-year note through Salomon Brothers. The issue, rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, carried a 12 3/4 percent coupon and was priced at $100, which was 3.75 percentage points above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
''Yield spreads available for bank paper rated BBB or better are certainly outpacing anything else that is out there right now,'' said William J. Downs, a vice president at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
Mr. Downs and others said that at current levels some issues are beginning to attract speculative investors, a generally unknown element in the usually stable market for bank bonds. Thus far big portfolio managers, however, have remained on the sidelines. Moreover, the bargains have not yet persuaded executives at large commercial banks to start buying back outstanding issues.
''We are not yet past the period of the most intense pressure on the banks,'' said Marshall B. Front, an executive vice president at Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based investment advisory firm that manages close to $10 billion in fixed-income securities. ''As a consequence, I suspect that yields could go higher over the next couple of weeks. At that time we could well see a better buying opportunity.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Magazine Industry Bracing For Shakeout as Ads Drop

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
After a heady decade in which the number of new magazines soared and advertising revenues more than doubled to $6.6 billion, the magazine industry is bracing for a shakeout.
Many small but highly visible publications are closing or searching for badly needed money, and advertising has begun a decline that media analysts expect to persist through this year and perhaps well into the next.
For the first quarter, the total advertising pages of the so-called consumer magazines, those with a general readership, dropped an average of 3.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. Of the top 100 magazines, 60 showed declines. But advertising revenues rose a slim 1.5 percent because of substantial increases in advertising rates. 
''There's no doubt about it,'' said Charles Elbaum, the president of Publishing Economics, a media consulting company. ''It may be a mini-recession, but it's a recession.''
Analysts say there is not likely to be any improvement soon. The second quarter is expected to be even softer. And the second half of the year, at best, may be flat. ''I'm projecting that consumer-magazine advertising spending will be down from 5 percent to 6 percent for the year,'' Mr. Elbaum said. ''And I don't know if next year will be any better.''
Analysts say publishers are getting an early warning signal to make important changes in the industry. There will have to be a substantial reduction in the circulations of many big magazines in order to keep profit margins healthy and an even deeper cut in the total number of titles.
Publishers must also start offering advertisers greater marketing reach through complex media programs that use in-store promotions, books and videocassettes in conjunction with magazine ads.
The declines in advertising at some well-known magazines are significant. Advertising for automobiles, liquor and cigarettes - all important categories for magazines - has been cut back significantly this year.
Car advertising, which accounts for more than 13 percent of all magazine advertising, fell nearly 9 percent, to $184 million, in the first quarter. This cutback significantly reduced the overall ad pages in the weekly news magazines: Time lost 12.4 percent, Newsweek 13.5 percent and U.S. News & World Report 10.2 percent. Cigarette advertising, which has been declining for the last few years, continued to drop and was a primary reason for lower advertising at other magazines: Sports Illustrated was down 17.8 percent, People 18.4 percent and TV Guide 10.1 percent.
A severe slump in retail advertising has hurt city magazines like New York, which was down 16.2 percent. And a dearth of retail and cosmetics advertising caused problems for the fashion magazines: Vogue lost 8.2 percent and Elle 11.7 percent.
 
Drop in Trade Advertising
Trade publications also suffered. Although statistics on first-quarter business-to-business advertising are still being analyzed, many magazines have had declines, said a spokeswoman for MMS-Rome, which tracks ad spending in the business press.
''We're seeing a lot of softness in advertising, too,'' said John Emery, president of the Association of Business Press. But the drop in ad pages for trade publications does not seem to be as drastic as that in consumer magazines, he said, because advertising in the business press has been depressed for the last three years.
As a result of the advertising dropoff, analysts said, some publishers of consumer magazines are offering substantial discounts - sometimes as much as 60 percent - from their published ad rates.
Most media executives point to uncertainty over the economy as the primary reason for the downturn in magazine advertising. ''Advertisers are more cautious than they were last year,'' said Paul DuCharme, the director of print media at Grey Advertising. ''They've already committed a lot of dollars to television, so one of their few options is to hold back spending in the magazine category.''
 
Looking for a Rebound
Publishers are hoping that automotive advertising will rebound in the fall when General Motors is expected to begin an extensive advertising campaign for its new Saturn car and will also start a new corporate campaign focusing on quality, said Jim Guthrie, the executive vice president for marketing for the Magazine Publishers of America.
But analysts said it would take more than a rebound in auto advertising to rejuvenate the industry.
Analysts said that to lure back advertising dollars that have been switched from print to television -especially cable television - or allocated instead to sales-promotion programs, magazines will have to offer integrated marketing packages that get the advertisers' messages out in a variety of ways.
''Magazines are going to have to work harder,'' Mr. DuCharme said. ''Along with advertising in their publications, some media companies will have to offer extras like advertising tie-ins on videocassettes and with books and special point-of-purchase promotions.''
 
'A New Game for Everyone'
That is exactly what some media companies are beginning to do. ''This is a new game for everyone that is going to become very important for magazines in the future,'' said Donald Elliman, executive vice president for marketing at the Time Inc. Magazine Company. Time has proposals pending with advertisers for packages that could include the company's magazines, Warner television projects, books and videocassettes.
The Meredith Corporation has put together a ''custom marketing'' program for Kraft Foods using its well-known Better Homes & Gardens cookbook. The 3.4 million copies of the special Kraft version come, as did the original, with the cookbook's trademark red-plaid cover. To help promote the book, which was offered to consumers in March, Kraft ran eight pages about recipes in The Ladies Home Journal, Better Homes & Gardens and other Meredith magazines.
Special marketing programs like this are being credited with helping magazines to attract more food and packaged-goods advertising, which have usually relied more heavily on television, said Mr. Guthrie of the publishers group.
 
Fewer Magazines Expected
Analysts said that declining advertising would also force many magazines, especially those at such large media companies as Time Warner Inc., to cut costs by trimming circulation to keep future profits healthy.
But the biggest cuts will have to come in the overall number of magazines, analysts said. During the last 10 years, the number of large consumer magazines audited by the Publishers Information Bureau has increased to 166 from 102. These magazines account for 85 percent of all magazine advertising revenue.
In addition, hundreds of smaller publications have been started during the last three years.
''There are just too many magazines now,'' said Nancy Smith, media director at Young & Rubicam. ''You can only slice up the advertising pie so much and still have a piece for everyone.''
 
Awaiting a Shakeout
The best thing that could happen, some analysts say, is a huge shakeout in the magazine industry. It may have already begun. Recently, 7 Days magazine in New York and the Long Island Monthly ceased publishing, and analysts said other magazines might cease publication soon.
''Something has to give,'' Mr. Elbaum said. ''To survive, the industry needs to wash out the most vulnerable magazines.''

HEADLINE: Arab Investment Overseas: A Vast Empire

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
On a chilly morning 10 years ago, Nemir A. Kirdar stood outside the Emir's palace in Bahrain, watching the traditional procession of ministers, ambassadors, supplicants, coffee servers and falcon keepers going into the ruler's ornate hall for the weekly reception, known as the Majlis.
Mr. Kirdar, an Iraqi of Kurdish origin who was then an officer at Chase Manhattan Bank, was about to leave to set up his own investment group and was giving up his only day off merely to shake the Emir's hand. It was time well spent, he told a visitor to the palace, since in the Arab world such gestures help gain trust.
Mr. Kirdar succeeded in earning enough trust from hundreds of wealthy Arab investors to help him start Investcorp Bank E.C., which on Wednesday agreed to purchase the Saks Fifth Avenue retail chain for $1.5 billion. Since its founding in 1982, Investcorp has grown into a large and powerful investment group. In recent years, it has put together deals worth more than $3.5 billion, involving well-known corporate names like Tiffany and Carvel in the United States, Guccio Gucci in Italy and Chaumet, the prestigious French jewelry maker. 
Though notable, Investcorp's spending spree represents a tiny fraction of the vast pool of Arab overseas investments, which total an estimated $680 billion, Arab bankers and economists say. The huge Arab investment abroad is a legacy of the oil wealth that soared beginning in the late 1970's when oil prices jumped sharply.
With oil prices having leveled off, the growth of the Arab investment cache abroad has slowed, but it is still growing briskly, largely because of income from those investments. Kuwait, for instance, now earns more on its overseas investments than it does from its oil exports.
The composition of Arab investment abroad is extremely diverse. It ranges from the enormous holdings of the government investment authorities of oil-rich monarchies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the personal nest eggs sent abroad as ''flight capital'' by merchants and laborers in less-developed Arab nations like Egypt, Jordan and the Sudan.
 
Private Arab Investment Groups
Among private Arab investment groups, Investcorp is joined by a handful of large, well-known concerns. One of the most successful is the Olayan Group, headed by Suliman S. Olayan of Saudi Arabia, widely known in Arab circles as the ''dean of Arab investors abroad.'' His multibillion-dollar privately held organization holds stock in many companies, including Chase Manhattan, Occidental Petroleum and CS First Boston.
Hekmat Nashashibi, a senior adviser here for the Arab Banking Corporation and former chairman of the Arab bankers association, said private Arab investors primarily from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain hold a pool of about $150 billion.
Yet these private investors are dwarfed by the huge, Arab government investment agencies from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which have huge investments in the West.
 
Big Government Investments
The Kuwait Investment Authority, for example, holds an estimated $80 billion to $100 billion in foreign investments. Sometimes, its investments have attracted public attention, like when it bought Santa Fe International in 1981 or when it built up a 22 percent stake in the British Petroleum Company two years ago, before Kuwait agreed with London to sell its dominant stake. Similarly, Saudi Arabia raised eyebrows when it bought half of Texaco Inc.'s distribution and marketing system in the East and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.
But for the most part, the government fund managers have put their money quietly and conservatively in investments like United States and Japanese government bonds.
The government fund managers of Saudi Arabia - like the Saudi central bank, SAMA; the Kuwait Investment Authority; the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and the Governments of Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain - hold an estimated $200 billion in overseas investments.
 
Flight Capital
The pool of Arab money abroad is swelled by the addition of flight capital, much of it from poorer, non-oil-rich Arab nations. These savings go overseas because of a lack of investment opportunities at home and fear of nationalization or political instability. The flight of capital badly needed at home clearly hinders the development of economies of the poorer, debt-burdened countries.
For example, Ali Negm, chairman of the Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises in Paris, who was Egypt's Central Bank governor, estimates that private individuals in Egypt have accumulated roughly $40 billion to $60 billion, much of it held in foreign banks.
''That is equivalent to Egypt's external debt,'' Mr. Negm noted.
Frequently, flight capital represents savings squirreled away by Egyptians, Jordanians, Yemenites and Sudanese, who work as expatriate Arabs in oil-rich nations including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emriates, Iraq and Qatar. These expatriates build roads, teach in schools and work in hospitals.
 
Perspective on Size of Holdings
When measured against national domestic product, Arab foreign investment is even more striking, Mr. Nashashabi of the Arab Banking Corporation said. Japanese foreign investment, estimated at $400 billion, for example, is relatively small compared with Japan's gross domestic product, which is in the trillion-dollar category. By contrast, Arab flight capital alone often exceeds gross domestic product.
The growth of Arab flight capital has continued even as the debts of many Arab nations pile up. Henry Azzam, an economist at the Gulf International Bank in Bahrain, calculates the official debt of the Arab nations at $140 billion in 1988, up from $68 billion in 1982.
Mr. Azzam said in a recent interview in Bahrain: ''While several Arab governments were borrowing internationally on a larger scale during the 1970's and 1980's, residents of these countries were acquiring foreign assets at a rapid rate, depriving their countries of domestic sources of capital. The pool of flight capital from the indebted Arab countries is enormous by every estimate.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
In Magazine Publishing, Gloom but Not Doom

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Joseph J. Hanson, the publisher of Folio and Publishing News, has an analogy for the current state of the magazine business.
''It's sort of like the music of Richard Wagner,'' Mr. Hanson told the Spring Magazine Publishing Congress in New York last week. ''It's much better than it sounds.''
Despite the gloom cast by a 3.5 percent decline in advertising pages for the first quarter of 1990, magazine executives and media analysts say there are still bright spots in the industry and that the much heralded shakeout may be less drastic than some have predicted. 
 
More New Magazines
Start-ups, for example, are still strong. In 1980, the Publishers Information Bureau listed 102 general consumer magazines. In 1989, there were 166. Six years ago, 171 new magazines were started; last year, the number had risen to 584, according to Samir Husni's Guide to New Magazines.
In addition, editors and publishers are taking innovative steps to increase circulation and develop additional revenues to help them weather the current economic downturn.
The pessimism about the last three months' decline is ''a potentially dangerous reaction to short-term news'' in an industry that is basically strong, said Reginald Brack, chief executive of Time Inc. Magazines.
Ted Kruckel, marketing director for Elle Decor, agreed, adding that magazines are ''rethinking themselves and being more clearly repositioned.''
''A number of publications have folded and some areas of the market have been clearly overextended, but circulation-wise most magazines are doing well,'' Mr. Kruckel said. ''If the readers are there, advertising will follow.''
 
Intensifying Competition
There is no doubt that competition among the thousands of American magazines is intensifying. The fight for space on the newsstand has led magazines like McCall's, Essence, Cooking Light and Self to redesign themselves to stand out from the crowd.
''There was a time when a redesign was sort of secondary to marketing and editorial considerations, but now it really is one of the main things that is considered,'' said Roger Black, a leading magazine designer.
Attempts to lure readers are varied. Articles are shorter. Colors are bolder. In deference to readers' short attention span, whole pages in some magazines contain nothing but one-sentence snippets of information.
To offset the decline in advertising, magazines are offering increasingly generous discounts and even free issues to persuade readers to subscribe or renew. Ms. magazine, which suspended publication in November and is expected to reappear in June, has given up advertising entirely and will try to exist on circulation alone.
 
'Revenue Streams From Readers'
''We are dealing with an industry that was 75 percent dependent on advertising revenues a generation ago,'' said John Veronis, chairman of Veronis, Suhler & Associates, an investment firm specializing in media properties. ''But publishers in the last couple of decades have developed revenue streams from the readers.''
In general, magazines now derive half their revenue from advertising and half from circulation.
Analysts point out that the magazine industry is particularly resistant to generalizations about its health because it is composed of so many varied publications that have no relation with each other. A decline in revenues for Life or Manhattan,inc. has little bearing on, say, how Skateboard magazine is doing.
''I think there is a lot of confusion; the public and the press tend to lump all magazines together,'' said Dale W. Lang, president of Lang Communications, whose magazines include Working Woman, Sassy and Working Mother.
 
Increase in 'Niche' Magazines
The industry has seen an increase in ''niche,'' or special-interest, publications. Some are hot for a while, then falter. For instance, the market for outdoor magazines and some sports magazines has grown soft recently.
In the last decade, the magazine industry faced and fought off threats posed by cable television and videocassette recorders - somewhat similar to the threat from the advent of television in the 1950's, which cut into the readership of many general-interest magazines.
In addition, the surge of women into the work force has created significant changes in shopping habits that have affected magazines. Instead of having those long waits at supermarket checkout counters with ample time to browse through the magazine racks, more and more women are dashing in and out of convenience stores on their way home from work.
Meanwhile, supermarket chains have cut back on display space to make room for other products. And the proliferation of new titles has meant that more magazines are fighting for a smaller amount of space on the racks.
 
Single-Copy Sales Decline
The result has been a steady decline in single-copy sales, with women's service magazines generally taking the biggest hit. For instance, in 1980 the single-copy sales for Women's Day, which is almost entirely dependent on newsstand sales, were 7.5 million. By the end of 1989, they had dropped to 4.6 million.
''Magazines are off tremendously on the newsstand,'' said Dan Capell, editor of Capell's Circulation Report.''For the most part, this has been offset by subscription gains.''
In 1980, the average paid circulation from single-copy sales of all magazines measured by the Audit Bureau of Circulations was 91 million copies per issue. In 1989 it had decreased to 80 million.
Subscriptions, however, rose during the last decade. In 1980 the average paid circulation from subscriptions averaged 190 million copies per issue. In 1989, they had risen to 288 million copies per issue.
 
Questions About Money
Editors and publishers say that their challenge in the next few years will be how to tighten their budgets.
''Where will the money come from if not from ads - from reduction in editorial costs?'' asked John Mack Carter, editor in chief of Good Housekeeping. ''That is serious stuff.''
The industry is going through a soft period, said Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast. ''This is a phase that will certainly separate the men from the boys.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Harvesting Exotic Crops To Save Brazil's Forest

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAUS, Brazil

 BODY:
From the wharves of this steamy Amazonian river port, sacks of brazil nuts have started an odyssey that will end this summer at the cookie counters of Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
Also this summer, the Body Shop, an organic cosmetics chain based in Britain, is to start marketing a hair conditioner based on brazil-nut oil. And the Ralston Purina Company is to start test-marketing a breakfast cereal that includes ingredients from the Amazon rain forest.
Packaged to appeal to the heightened environmental consciousness of American and European consumers, the products are part of a new effort to make the rain forest economically productive. By creating a market for the nuts, roots, fruits, pigments, oils and essences that can be regularly harvested here, environmentalists and Indian groups hope to discourage the timber industry and ranchers from further deforesting the region. 
 
A Dozen New Products
''We are trying to use the market to save the rain forest,'' said Jason W. Clay, the research director of Cultural Survival, a Boston-based group. An anthropologist by training, Mr. Clay recently translated his concern for the world's dwindling jungles and native peoples into the creation of a nonprofit trading group, the Rainforest Marketing Project.
Mr. Clay predicts that about a dozen products using ingredients from the Brazilian Amazon will enter the American market this year. Today, the leading client of the new trading company is Community Products Inc. of Montpelier, Vt., which expects to import 350,000 pounds of brazil nuts this year. The company produces a brittle candy, Rainforest Crunch, and resells the candy in bulk to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream Inc., also based in Vermont, for the production of an ice cream flavor, Rainforest Crunch.
''It's a moral reason to munch,'' Ben Cohen, the president of Community Products and a founder of Ben & Jerry's, said in a telephone interview. The candy has been so popular that Mr. Cohen is negotiating licensing arrangements with producers in Britain and Canada and on the West Coast of the United States. A new product, Rainforest Crunch cookies, is to go on sale at Macy's and Bloomingdale's in coming months.
Recent studies have shown that systematic harvesting of products from the Amazon rain forest can be more profitable than cutting down the trees for timber and running cattle on the land. About 10 percent of the two-million-square-mile Amazon rain forest in Brazil has been deforested, largely for cattle pasture of low quality.
Over 50 years, harvesting of forest products could provide twice as much money as cattle ranching - $6,330 compared with $2,960 for each hectare - according to a recent study of the Peruvian Amazon by Charles M. Peters of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden.
 
Reserve Lands
While figures vary according to region and markets, the idea of ''extractive reserves'' - which guarantee long-term harvesting rights, largely to rubber tappers and gatherers of brazil nuts - is taking hold in Brazil.
Logging is forbidden in these reserves, which were started this year., Since January, Brazil has established four big reserves, covering 8,351 square miles, roughly the size of Massachusetts. Ten more Amazonian reserves are under negotiation.
''They won't solve the problem of deforestation, but they are a good idea and should be established as quickly as possible,'' Philip M. Fearnside, an American forestry ecologist, said in a recent interview here at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon.
The Inter-American Development Bank is negotiating $5.3 million in loans and grants to help establish a series of reserves, including a 3,747-square-mile area in Acre, a state in the western Amazon.
Mr. Clay of Cultural Survival predicts that American consumers will soon be using products based on Amazonian ingredients they have never heard of: assai-flavored sherbet, cupuacu yogurt, babacu oil, patchouli-root soap, copaiba shampoo, priprioca perfume, and condoms made of Amazonian latex.
To date, Mr. Clay has taken 350 product samples out of Brazil to show to about 40 companies in the United States and Europe.
Mr. Clay concedes that he may be creating a surge in demand that the Amazon's rickety marketing system will be unable to meet.
''The Body Shop wants 80 tons of copaiba oil a year,'' Mr. Clay said of a product that could be used for shampoos, face creams, lotions, soaps and massage creams. ''At present, Brazil only produces 60 tons of oil.''
 
Aid for Gatherers
To help the supply meet the demand, Cultural Survival is using grants from international aid groups to help gatherers form marketing and processing cooperatives. The group last year helped to pay for a new factory capable of shelling and packaging 50 tons of Brazil nuts a year.
Shelling increases the value of brazil nuts 10-fold and reduces their shipping weight by 60 percent.
As always, the goal is to make harvesting the rain forest viable. The typical native family that gathers brazil nuts earns 3 cents an unshelled pound. In New York, a shelled pound sells for $1.10 wholesale.

HEADLINE: THE RACES IN TEANECK: A SPECIAL REPORT;
Killing Reveals Racial Divide Beneath Model CommunitiesSection A; Page 1; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLEBy JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
The accounts by Mr. Jemmott and Dr. Mack - the physical encounters of a youth, the suspicions of a prosperous adult - are among many angry, and, to many whites, often surprising complaints by blacks in these two suburbs known for their racial integration.
 Both communities are attractive, middle-class towns with sizable minority populations, in large part because whites in both places welcomed integration. Blacks there often live in large homes, drive nice cars and work in the professions. Their circumstances seem to spell triumph, not only for themselves but for an American society that has pledged racial equality. But the story, as some of them tell it, is more complicated than that.
 
Despite Outward Appearances
 In the weeks after the shooting of a black youth by a white police officer in Teaneck, The New York Times arranged informal group conversations with two dozen black residents of varying ages and occupations, and with a separate white group. 
 Because an event like the killing in Teaneck could have a sudden effect on opinions, a discussion group was also arranged in Bloomfield, a similar town but one whose reputation for racial harmony has not been disturbed by a crisis. The opinions by blacks in both towns appeared to be quite similar.
 Despite outward appearances of success, many blacks in both towns described being treated like second-class citizens. No group spoke in unison, but many participants spoke angrily of police harassment, housing discrimination, job bias and social slights.
 
Charges Surprise Whites
 While discussion groups do not scientifically sample public opinion, they can open windows into a community's thoughts and emotions.
 In Teaneck, most blacks said the rioting came as no surprise, and some even called it "inevitable." In Bloomfield, many spoke of a "hidden agenda" by white society to keep blacks down.
 But some Teaneck whites had sharply different racial perceptions. Most of the whites said the rioting, and charges of racism, came as a complete surprise. Housing discrimination, in their view, was nonexistent.
 Members of the white group sometimes spoke more guardedly than blacks and cautioned that they did not want to sound critical.
 By no means was every note one of sourness. Blacks and whites alike told stories of interracial friendships and marriages. Many spoke proudly of their record of integration and promised to rededicate themselves to civic harmony. Blacks and whites were interviewed separately; some people in both groups said they would have preferred to meet together.
 Still, the volume and variety of black complaints in Teaneck and Bloomfield stand out precisely because those communities have seemed so placid. The depth of discontent suggests that racial division in America may be an even deeper wound than it often appears, and ostensible goodwill a limited balm. Teaneck Police
 
Minor Affronts, Bitter Memories
 Teaneck is a town of 39,000 people in Bergen County, eight miles west of Manhattan. Its population is 67 percent white and 24 percent black, In discussions, Teaneck blacks turned first and most heatedly to the town's police department, which is eyed with suspicion by blacks of widely varying age and income. The speakers included students, a teacher, a psychologist, an unemployed man and a nightclub manager.
 Nicky McLaren, a student at Teaneck High School, said he was riding his bicycle home from work one day when the whoop of a police siren sounded behind him. An interrogation ensued: What's your name? Where are you going? Where did you get the bike?
 "I mean, hey, on my bike, you know," he said with a tone of exasperation. "Of course if I was white, I don't think he would have done that."
 Tony McNeil, a 42-year-old New York City bus driver, recalled an encounter that concerned, of all things, a pooper-scooper. As Mr. McNeil tells the story, it is minor yet revealing, a small humiliation but disturbing enough to bear retelling seven years later.
 
Sometimes Overzealous
 Mr. McNeil said he was walking his dog one night, scooperless, when a white police officer stopped him. He admits he was in the wrong, but what disturbed him was the officer's manner: the graphic way he outlined the regulations on excrement.
 Though he collected his dog and went home, he said the incident had the potential to escalate; a wisecrack back could have led to trouble. "I question whether he would have spoken to a white man my age the same way," said Mr. McNeil.
 Many whites, ranging from a college student to a 65-year-old salesman in a hardware store, also described the police as overzealous; until recently, for example, officers had to meet monthly ticket-writing quotas. But some doubted the claims of racial bias.
 "I think I've been stopped as much as anyone else," said Don Ware, the hardware salesman.
 Karen Willick, a student at Muhlenberg College who graduated from Teaneck High School in 1986, said she was not sure whether blacks were hassled by the police more than whites. But she said, "As soon as they hassle the blacks, more is made of it."
 "The white boys will just take it, if it's by a white cop, and go off and say, 'Oh, that stupid cop' or whatever," she said. "The black boys will say, 'They're doing it just because we're black.'
 "I'm not blaming them for saying that," she said, "because if it were me, I'd probably react the same way."
 
Steering Continues
 Can blacks in Teaneck live wherever they wish? All the whites agreed with Carol Otis, a junior-high-school teacher in Teaneck, who said, "If they have the money? Oh yes, I think so."
 But two different groups of blacks spoke of housing barriers. Two families said real-estate agents had urged them to resell after they became the first blacks to move onto a block.
 Jeff Locke, whose mother is white and father is black, said the discrimination showed on his block, where six or seven black families now live, though none lives just several blocks away. "Steering is still going on and I don't think that's any secret in this world," he said.
 Mr. McNeil, the bus driver, said he and his wife, Diane, were the first blacks to move onto their street almost 20 years ago. Several days later, he said, a neighbor put up a fence - but only on the side adjoining his house.
 He said he later helped the neighbor, an elderly white woman, clean her gutters, and she rewarded him with a gift-wrapped bottle. "I said, 'Oh, gee, this is great of this neighbor, she gave me a bottle of scotch,' "
 It turned out to be Thunderbird.
 
Bloomfield

 
Electoral Victory Leaves Bitterness
 Bloomfield is a town of 39,000 where 65 percent of the population is white and 35 percent is black. Just as whites in Teaneck organized a campaign to stem white flight in the 1960's as blacks began moving in, so too did those in Bloomfield.
 The seven blacks in the Bloomfield group - all, like Dr. Mack, adults who worked in the professions - said police harassment was not a problem. But they did talk just as angrily on another topic: town politics.
 Last fall, the town elected its first black mayor, Joseph M. Suggs Jr. While to outsiders, that may seem like a triumph, Bloomfield blacks said the election emphasized racial discrimination rather than disproving it.
 Bloomfield's nine city council members choose a mayor from among themselves. In recent years, Mr. Suggs said, the decision was easy, since the biggest vote-getter in the general election was also the incumbent mayor.
 But last year there was no incumbent and Mr. Suggs received the most votes in the general election. Afterward, he said, there was some discussion of elevating another council member.
 Mr. Suggs said he did not suspect a racial motive. "I do understand how others may have that perception," he said.
 
'Cold, Deliberate, Planned'
 And indeed they do; blacks in the Bloomfield discussion group uniformly characterized the circumstances as evidence of clear racial prejudice.
 Dr. Mack said the election had the same emotional meaning for Bloomfield as the shooting did for Teaneck. If Mr. Suggs had been denied power, he said, "That would have been the stimulating factor to get black people out and raise a lot of hell."
 The mayoral election was just part of what this group described as a larger effort by white society to deny blacks their due. Despite their seeming success as therapists, engineers and administrators, most spoke of stunted professional opportunities.
 A black man "has to be twice as smart to accomplish half as much" as a white rival, said Reginald Smith, a planning analyst for Connecticut. Not all whites would agree, but every member of this group did.
 Jesse Branche, an engineer for the town of Bloomfield, spoke of "charlatans" on the job, colleagues who use "cheap tricks" and "hidden agendas" to insure that blacks fail.
 "There is a discrimination belt that exists that is cold, deliberate, planned, perfect," he said.
 He and others saw similar ill intent in the local school system, which is 70 percent black even though whites are still a majority in the town. Whites, they said, deliver dual insults to the system, first by withdrawing their children, and second by seeking to find blemishes where none exist.
 Laurence Maybin, a psychologist who has raised three children in Bloomfield, angrily described a rite of passage he said has repeated itself: As high school approaches, his children's white friends seek private education.
 Mr. Maybin said he was left speechless when his daughter asked, with vanishing innocence, "Gee Dad, why are all the white kids leaving the school?"
 "It feeds into that sense of, 'We're less than, we're less than, we're always less than,' " he said.
 
Mixed Feelings

 
Teaneck Harmony, Or Hypocrisy
 Not every story told by either race focused on suspicion or defeat. Mr. McLaren, the black high school student flagged down by the police, spoke warmly of an interracial group of friends. So did Ms. Willick, the recent white high school graduate. Mr. Locke, who manages a Manhattan night club, and his brother Ed, who runs a Montauk, L.I., restaurant, both said they found racial tensions much greater in college than they did growing up in Teaneck.
 Bill Kuyper, who is white and plays French horn for the New York Philharmonic, spoke proudly of his children's ease with friendships between the races. Hearing his daughter on the phone joking with a black friend about the need "to get more pigment" into the school yearbook, he said he admired their mutual ease.
 "I had feelings of brotherhood, or goodness, in me, but I never quite knew how to do it," said Mr. Kuyper. "My children, they wouldn't have any problem at all."
 Like all members of the white discussion group, Mr. Kuyper was anxious for the communty's racial situation to be placed in a favorable light. "People should realize we're getting along pretty well here in Teaneck," he said.
 Yet several stayed late and complained privately about reverse discrimination.
 Some blacks said the interracial friendships that come easily as a child grow more difficult with time. Sheena Williams, whose mother is white and father is black, said she had few white friends now that she was in high school. And she was not sure why. Maybe it is interest in different boys that keeps them apart, she said. Or maybe it is different music. Or fashion. Or hair styles. Maybe her white friends began rejecting her, and maybe she began rejecting them. "I don't know," she said. "I just seem to have more -better relations with my black friends." Subtle Injuries
 Racial injury, in the description of Ms. Williams and others, moves in just such mysterious ways. "Subtle" is a word used by both blacks and whites to describe the forces that creep between them. The "media" were often blamed.
 Mr. McNeil said he thought white teen-agers in sweat pants were considered "jocks," while black teen-agers in sweat pants were called "thugs." Kenneth Banks, a black Teaneck man, asked why he heard the clicking of automatic door locks when he approached.
 However numerous its failures, does Teaneck offer more racial equality than most other American communties? Like most questions of race, it depends on whom you ask.
 All the Teaneck whites said it did. So, too, did many of the black Teaneck teen-agers, despite their complaints of frequent police harassment.
 Among the black Teaneck adults, however, opinion was sharply split. "It defintely deserves some credit," said Jeff Locke, who described it as the best place he's lived.
 But others nodded when Fred Greene, an affable former Teaneck police lieutenant, suddenly called the image of racial accomplishment "an exercise in hypocrisy" and "a living lie."
 Mr. Greene, who is black, said members of both races had participated in an illusion of harmony, "when the masses of people are living separate and apart."

Agins); Dr. Alphonso Mack, a dentist in Bloomfield, Conn., said he had dealt by phone with contractors who built his home and office so they would not know he was black. "You know the moment you go in there and they see that you're black, you're not going to get the same job done." (The New York Times/Steve Miller) (pg. B4)
