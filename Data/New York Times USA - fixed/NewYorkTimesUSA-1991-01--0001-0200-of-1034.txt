Richard G. Darman/Getting the Blame For the Budget Pain

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
When Richard G. Darman became budget director, his goal was to engineer what he called "the Grand Compromise," a sweeping deal in which Republicans and Democrats agreed to politically painful measures to reduce the budget deficit.
This year, Mr. Darman pulled off the deal, but he ended up getting little credit and taking most of the blame. 
 After tortuous negotiations lasting more than six months, Congress approved and President Bush signed the most significant deficit-reduction legislation in American history. Unless the law is changed, the cumulative deficit will be cut by nearly $500 billion over the next five years below what it would otherwise be.
In the process, however, President Bush reneged on his "no new taxes" pledge, broke his promise to insist on a capital-gains tax cut and allowed himself to be painted into a political corner by Democrats who portrayed him as the patron of fat cats.
Many Republicans faulted Mr. Darman for the resulting plunge in the President's popularity. Conservatives called for the budget director's resignation.
One weekend in midsummer, Mr. Darman slipped on wet steps at a McDonald's restaurant, cutting himself badly. But he may have been less bruised than he was by the conservatives' attacks. For example, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, called him a mere "technocrat" who did not grasp "the great romantic vision of being American." Still, there is no indication he has slipped from grace in President Bush's eyes.
Mr. Darman, who is 47 years old, has been in the Government most of his adult life. He clearly hoped to become Treasury Secretary some day, but that seems unlikely now. Few people would be surprised if he left the Government after the new budget is released in February.

L. William Seidman/Banking Regulator Gains New Respect

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
L. William Seidman says one of his New Year's resolutions will be to figure out when he leaves his post.
It is an unusual resolution, considering that President Bush in May had already named Mr. Seidman's successor as head of two agencies that regulate more than 12,000 banks and run the bailout of the savings and loan industry. While he has often said he would resign before his term expires late next year, Mr. Seidman has for months continued to dominate the regulatory scene. 
 Administering what by all accounts is the least popular program in Washington, the multibillion-dollar rescue of savings associations, Mr. Seidman has earned the respect of both parties in Congress through deft and frank appearances on Capitol Hill and on news programs.
Over the last four years, Mr. Seidman has gradually transformed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from a second-tier agency to the nation's dominant banking regulator.
His fierce streak of independence has often found him at odds with the Bush Administration, although lately he appears to be getting along much better than earlier this year, when he said the Treasury Department and the White House were trying to push him out. Today, Treasury officials talk about how Mr. Seidman and the Administration have been putting together proposals to shore up the ailing bank insurance fund and reorganize the banking system.
The new spirit of cooperation marks a turnabout from just a few months earlier, when the Federal Reserve's chief banking regulator, William Taylor, was named to succeed the 69-year-old Mr. Seidman.
Asked what his uncertainty about the timing of his departure has meant for his annointed successor, Mr. Seidman, with characteristically cagey good humor, said: "Bill's a good man. He's also a young man."

Alan Greenspan/Fed Chairman Feels Chill of Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
In his nearly three and a half years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan has gone through the repertory of experiences that can befall a central bank chief -- inflation, a stock market crash and now recession. Trying to shake it off is likely to occupy most of Mr. Greenspan's time in the final months of his term, which ends in August.
The 64-year-old chairman has even avoided using the term "recession" in public to refer to the economic downturn. But the stepped-up efforts of the Federal Reserve Board last month to reduce interest rates made clear that the Fed is trying to reverse the economic decline. 
 The recession represents a defeat for Mr. Greenspan, one that could cost him reappointment. Since early 1988, he had tried to steer the economy between inflation and recession through gradual changes in interest rates.
For months, Mr. Greenspan and the central bank's other policy makers had been reducing rates, but many economists now say that the Fed moved too slowly and too gradually to avoid the recession. Some even say that the Greenspan Fed courted recession, to achieve a drastic reduction in the inflation rate. Mr. Greenspan has suggested that his approach would have worked, if it were not for the Persian Gulf crisis.
But whatever the case, Mr. Greenspan now faces a recession complicated by a bank crisis. Burdened with unpaid loans and not enough capital, the banks are reluctant to make new loans. And now that the Fed is lowering rates to encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, the banks might not cooperate by lending them money.
Such foot-dragging could force Mr. Greenspan to take other, more drastic steps to bolster the banks and to revive the sinking economy.

James D. Robinson 3d/Ambitious Leader's Costly Reversal

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
For James D. Robinson 3d, 1990 was the year to bite the bullet and admit that some of his strategic plans of the last decade had failed.
Mr. Robinson, the chairman of the American Express Company, was forced to inject more capital into its brokerage subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., now called Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. 
 "The year started off with tremendous problems at Shearson," he said. "That led us to conclude that we had to do a total reversal and reacquire Shearson."
In doing so, Shearson became the first Wall Street firm to be bailed out by its corporate parent in 1990. It was followed by the First Boston Corporation, which received a capital injection from its parent, CS Holdings Inc. And Prudential Bache Securiites Inc. got new capital at the end of the year from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
For Mr. Robinson, the Shearson bailout was a bitter personal disappointment. He led American Express's purchase of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, which he hoped would help him turning his travel card company into a financial supermarket.
In 1987, American Express sold about 40 percent of the firm to the public, and Mr. Robinson frequently said his company wanted to decrease its holdings to less than 50 percent. In that way, Shearson would not have to be counted on the American Express balance sheet.
But the intensity of Wall Street's recession and the collapse of numerous business lines scotched that plan.
In January, after months of conflict between them, Mr. Robinson asked for the resignation of Peter A. Cohen, who was then the chairman of Shearson.
In March, American Express said it would buy all of the publicly held shares of Shearson. Since then, Shearson has made many changes in its top management.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Spur Many to Help the Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Ten months after losing his job as a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Nicholas P. Heymann sent $3,500 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and wrote that he considered himself fortunate.
"Like many others, my past year has been filled with upheaval, shock and whirlwind change," Mr. Heymann, who lives in Stamford, Conn., wrote. "Yet unlike many less fortunate, whenever I needed it most, the sun always filtered through the haze of disbelief and despair. While I now have less to give than before, I offer more, knowing I'm more fortunate than ever." 
 Mr. Heymann, 34 years old, said yesterday in a telephone interview that he "barely knew what had hit" when he lost his job in February. But the experience caused him to reorder his priorities. This year he and his family cut back on their holiday celebrations and gave to more than 25 charities.
Now a corporate vice president on Wall Street at County NatWest Securities, he said he was getting paid less than before but felt "very lucky and grateful" for all he had.
It was a difficult year for many, but donors to the Neediest Cases Fund often say that the hard times and widespread poverty have made them appreciate the basic things in life.
In hundreds of letters that have accompanied gifts to the fund, people write that they are grateful for a job, for having lived a long life, for births and marriages, and for being surrounded by friends and family. A donation to the fund, they say, is a way of sharing their good fortune.
The 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases began at the end of November and will run through February. All money raised in the drive will be distributed to seven charities to aid the sick and the poor. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead.
 
 Donation for Homeless
 Joan M. Schumacher of Manhattan sent $500 and asked that it be used to help the homeless in New York. "During this time of severe job shortage and very tight economy," she wrote, "I am so grateful to be employed."
Another donor, Nancy Brozain, a nursing supervisor at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, wrote that she was sending $200, "even though saddened by my father's death and my mother's illness."
In a telephone interview, Ms. Brozain said that her mother was battling cancer and that she worked every day with people who had the disease. Yet the tragedies that surround her have not stopped her from feeling fortunate.

Thomas G. Labrecque/Rebuilding Chase After an Upheaval

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When Thomas G. Labrecque was named chairman at the Chase Manhattan Corporation last year, he inherited more than just a new office. With the new title came a flood of problems that would make 1990 a dismal year for Chase and many other banking companies.
Grimly vowing that Chase would be a survivor, Mr. Labrecque attacked the problems of high expenses and heavy losses on commercial real estate loans. Eliminating 5,000 jobs and sharply increasing reserves to cover real estate loan losses resulted in a $603 million loss in the third quarter. But by the end of the year, Chase had returned to profitability, and Mr. Labrecque expects the measures will save $300 million this year. 
 After the cutbacks and write-offs, Mr. Labrecque is now faced with the more drawn-out task of expanding the company profitably. A reliance on its successful consumer banking business in the United States is clearly part of the strategy, but that does not guarantee Chase a place in the top tier of the world's largest banks.
"The financial-services industry is a lot bigger than banking," Mr. Labrecque said. Among the options he is exploring are various kinds of joint ventures with nonbanking companies that are strong in some of the same businesses as Chase is.
Another option for Chase and other big banks is to merge and improve profits by eliminating redundant computer systems, branches and executives. But analysts say mergers among banks the size of Chase may be unlikely unless their condition becomes so precarious that their top officers are willing to make some personal sacrifices.
"After spending 20 and 30 years working their way to the top, these guys are not about to step aside unless they are forced to," said Alex Sheshunoff, a bank consultant. "There are no mergers until there are agreements about who gets the top job."

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Fall by 0.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The prices farmers receive for raw products ended 1990 with a seven-tenths of 1 percent decline from November to December, the Agriculture Department said yesterday.
Farmers received lower prices for milk, hogs and lettuce, although higher prices for cattle, peanuts and eggs helped to ease the overall decline in prices. 
 The fruit and vegetable prices, however, were recorded before freezing cold hit California around Dec. 21, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said.
Record high monthly prices were reported for cattle, but hog prices were down again, the report said.
"Oats and wheat were each at their lowest level for the month of December since 1972," it said. "Corn increased slightly from November while the soybean price decreased slightly."
Most prices are mid-December averages, which will be revised next month.
No new figures were released to show how much farmers had to pay to meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly.
 
 Consumer Food Prices
 Department economists forecast that in 1991 consumer food prices will climb an average of 2 to 5 percent, compared with a 6 percent gain in 1990. Larger output of some major commodities is expected to help cool the price climb.
The net cash income of farmers in 1991 has been forecast by the Agriculture Department at $55 billion to $60 billion, which could be less than the record of $59 billion in 1990. Net cash income is simply the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses.
The Agriculture Department gave these prices in its report yesterday:
Cattle averaged $77.60 for 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $75.30 in November. A year earlier, cattle averaged $71 a hundredweight. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
Hogs averaged $47.60 a hundredweight, down from $50.20 in November. A year earlier, hogs averaged $48.20.
Corn, at $2.18 a bushel, was up a penny from November but was down 9 cents from a year earlier.
Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $2.38 a bushel, compared with $2.39 in November and $3.79 in December 1989.
Rice averaged $6.26 for 100 pounds, compared with $6.30 in November and $6.95 a year earlier.
Soybeans were $5.74 a bushel, compared with $5.78 in November and $5.64 in December 1989.

Dollar Ends 1990 Lower While Gold Is Up Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower on the final day of 1990, finishing a year of marked weakening against other currencies attributed in large part to the reunification of Germany and a slumping United States economy.
Gold was marginally higher yesterday, but ended the year down moderately. The precious metal closed up 20 cents, to $394.20 a troy ounce, from Friday's close on the New York Commodity Exchange. That compared with gold's last quote on the final day of 1989 at $402.50 an ounce. 
 The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $393.25 a troy ounce, up 25 cents from late Friday but down from 1989.
Silver rose 2 cents a troy ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange to $4.192. That was down from the metal's last late bid of 1989 of $5.208 a troy ounce.
 
Loosening of Communism Cited
 Currency analysts said the loosening of Communism in Eastern Europe also contributed to the dollar's fall by strengthening the German mark.
"Germany is the big story in 1990," said David Marshall, currency analyst at MMS International. "The dollar did worse than people expected due to the quickness with which the reunification of Germany went through and the strength of the unwinding of Eastern Europe."
In addition, he said, "no one expected the U.S. economy to be as soft as it now seems to be."
Yesterday in New York the dollar closed against the German mark at 1.4885, compared with 1.6950 marks at 1989's end. Late Friday the dollar was quoted at 1.4935 marks.
 
 Conflict in Middle East Cited
 Analysts said the dollar's year-to-date loss against currencies other than the mark was not as pronounced, in part because the Middle East conflict seemed to hurt some other denominations more than the dollar.
In New York, the dollar ended the year at 135.50 Japanese yen, down from 143.85 yen at the end of 1989. But yesterday the dollar ended stronger than Friday's closing 134.90 yen.
The British pound also strengthened over all against the dollar, closing the year at $1.9345 in New York compared with $1.6105 at 1989's close. On Friday, sterling was quoted at a closing $1.9282. In London, the pound rose to $1.9280, from $1.9220 late Friday. The pound traded in London at $1.6115 at the end of 1989.
The dollar's slight fall yesterday was attributed partly to a fresh peace initiative from the European Community. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jacques Poos, said he might meet with his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. Luxembourg will take over the European Community's rotating chairmanship today.
Heightened peace prospects in the Persian Gulf tend to diminish the United States currency's value because the investment is considered a safe haven in times of war.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates and with 1989 year-end rates in parentheses, included: 1.2668 Swiss francs, down from 1.2745 (1.5420); 5.0685 French francs, down from 5.0810 (5.7805); 1.1599 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1601 (1.1588), and 1,122.75 Italian lire, down from 1,126.50 (1,267.00).

An Opportunity Born Of Adversity

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz., Dec. 31

 BODY:
The Fiesta Bowl, which pits Alabama against Louisville on Tuesday, won't have any impact on the national championship, but it has surely brought focus on the state of Arizona's bruised national image.
The days leading up to the tepidly anticipated encounter between the 7-4 Crimson Tide and the 9-1-1 Cardinals have been filled with a battle for the "spin control" on the Election Day defeat of propositions that would have made Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday a paid holiday for state workers. 
 Fiesta Bowl officials, university administrators and many Arizona politicians have taken pains to pay tribute to the memory of Dr. King and distance themselves from the election results.
 
Questions of Propriety
 For some black leaders, the game has been an opportunity to show the need for a King holiday and to question the moral propriety of academic institutions choosing to take home millions in Fiesta Bowl revenue from the state that voted not to honor King.
The local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. announced it would stage a protest at Sun Devil Stadium immediately before the game. The chapter's president, the Rev. Oscar Tillman, said that because administrators of both schools refused to discuss their pending decision to send teams to Tempe with his chapter, "we want to put our stamp of disapproval on the proceedings."
"For Louisville and particularly Alabama, where Dr. King did so much, to completely ignore the oldest black organization in this city before making their decision is appalling," Tillman said today. "We are making a statement because after Louisville and Alabama leave, we in Arizona are still going to have a problem."
Tillman said the demonstration, which he said he will try to limit to fewer than 100 people, would take place for about 20 minutes before the game.
 
A Peaceful Statement
 "Our statement will be peaceful," Tillman said. "We will have a silent prayer, send our message and move on."
On the other side of the political line, officials have been straining to counter the financial and public-relation damage Arizona has undergone since the Nov. 6 vote.
"We are going to use this bowl game in a postive stance to talk about the causes of civil rights," said John Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's executive director.
Some of the damage control includes establishment by the Fiesta Bowl of $100,000 scholarships at both schools to honor King and assist minority-group students. Alabama plans to use at least $100,000 from its bowl receipts to improve academic programs relating to minority issues, while Donald C. Swain, the president of Louisville, is appointing a committee to recommend ways the university can use some of its Fiesta Bowl profits to honor the memory of King.
Bowl officials also expanded its halftime entertainment to include a tribute to King.
 
King Is Honored
 Meanwhile, local booster groups have taken pains to point out to visiting reporters that Phoenix, Tempe and more than 20 other cities in Arizona observe Dr. King's birthday as a paid holiday, and that the voters of Phoenix and its surroundings approved the proposition for the holiday. In addition, the city of Phoenix has provided a tape illustrating its affinity for the King holiday.
Such lengths may be necessary to repair some of the damage Arizona has suffered. Officials have projected millions in lost convention business. And the threat by the National Football League to pull the 1993 Super Bowl out of Phoenix could cost the state $200 million in economic benefits. The league's owners will vote on the matter in March, but approval appeared a virtual certainty.
 The Natioanl Collegiate Athletic Association has already turned down Arizona State's bid to host a portion of the 1994 men's national basketball tournament, and the National Basketball Association has said it will not not hold any All-Star Games or league meetings in the state as long as there is no King holiday.
Fiesta Bowl officials probably contributed to the problem when, six days after the vote, they attempted to move the game, which has been held in the Phoenix area for 20 years, to San Diego. But on Nov. 13, the N.C.A.A. ruled that it could not because the California city was already the site of the Holiday Bowl.
But the occasion of the game and the attention it has brought to the King issue is being perceived as valuable by those who want the holiday.
The Rev. Warren Stewart, who leads a statewide petition drive to get a nonpaid King holiday on the Arizona state ballot by 1992, used today's Fiesta Bowl parade to gain public support by asking citizens to sign the petition.
"This week will help us," Stewart said. "Out of adversity, Dr. King will be lifted up nationally, and that would have never happened."

Some Things Change in a Year; Some Never Do

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
A pause this New Year's Day to update a few of the 1990 Our Towns columns:
In September people on the New Jersey bank of the Hudson were upset to be kept waiting two hours in line for the right to pay $6 a head to take a 10-minute ferry ride to Ellis Island -- particularly when there is a construction bridge nearby, making it an easy walk. As a result, a Congressional hearing in October looked into the bidding that awarded the ferry contract to Circle Line. Rep. Frank J. Guarini has worked out an agreement to keep the bridge in place for now with hopes that it will eventually become a free walkway. He plans legislation to revamp National Park concession bidding. Ferry officials are not retreating; at the hearing, a spokesman said the ride may go to $8. 
 An April column described the plight of Robert Lake, a Rutgers professor nationally known for his research on racial segregation, who was entangled in an apparently frivolous court case. The professor conducted a survey on behalf of a black man refused an apartment at Woodbridge Terrace in Woodbridge, N.J. It indicated racial steering. The landlords sued Mr. Lake, charging defamation, an increasingly common tactic used against civil-rights advocates; the professor countersued. A month after the column, the landlords settled. Mr. Lake and two others split $250,000.
Eli Finn, the 100-year-old man who drives in the passing lane on his way to his American history course at Fairfield University, begins a new semester Jan. 16.
The Our Towns reporter happened to be on hand for an inspection of a Brentwood, L.I., adult home run by Omega Pope and considered by mental health officials to be among the worst in New York. Doors fell off in inspectors' hands; medicine lit tered the floors; resi dents sat doing noth ing. The home has a long history of bad re views; for two yearsMs. Pope's license has been provisional. This week, the state Department of Social Services decided to give her another year to correct problems.
 News accounts of fabricated census data from the Hack ensack, N.J., office led to recounting 18,300 housing units, at a cost of $400,000. The result: Two-thirds of the units were incorrectly counted. Investigations continue.
The first new supermarket in Newark's Central Ward since the riots of 1967, a Pathmark, is prospering, a spokesman says. Tom Bradley, a gay Bayport, L.I., teacher who feared the worst when people discovered he had AIDS, says he has experienced the best. In October 2,000 people turned out for Tom Bradley Day. He is strong enough to do his administrative job three days a week. However, he has not been able to shake an eye virus. "I could stand losing one eye, but both -- I'd be scared."
Oscar Marchant -- who has continued to teach at Essex County Jail Annex for 22 years though there are days he can't hold class because guards use his chairs for new prisoners -- got 10 new chairs as a donation after a column. A report about the The Rainbow Foundation, a small children's charity threatened by the recession, resulted in "tens of thousands of dollars of gifts," according to its director. The charity will continue.
Good news for Fideau, a miniature pig, who was branded an illegal pet in Rutherford, N.J. Pig and owner are moving from their town house to semi-rural Orange County. "It's lovely," said Nick DiGiaimo. "Fideau will have his own room." The pig still faces a court date this month.
Last spring, State Senator Michael J. Tully Jr. filed a bill to stop new group homes for the mentally ill on Long Island. The legislation was a response to constituents who didn't want a home in their suburb. (Senator Tully was up for re-election.) After much publicity, the proposal went nowhere. (Senator Tully was re-elected.) However, state cuts may achieve what he couldn't. The state planned to finance 600 beds this year, but reduced it to 300.
Andrew Cuomo's Westhelp town houses for 108 homeless families open this month in Greenburgh in Westchester County after years of fierce opposition. Karl Hammer, who runs Moody Hill Farms, considered one of the best composting operations in New York, is beginning his fourth year battling neighbors trying to close him.
In September, Community Advocates opened a six-unit building in Roslyn Heights, the first permanent housing for the homeless in Nassau County (population 1.3 million). The two-year fight featured some astounding flip-flops by local politicians. Since the opening, business people, the clergy and the Junior League have all made donations. Marge Rogatz, the project director, says, "I'm convinced this housing could exist all over the county if our political leaders took the position we have to find a place for all our people." She's not holding her breath.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Is Sworn In for 3d Term Without Festivities

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 31

 BODY:
In a brief ceremony without the festivities or speeches that characterized his prior inaugurations, Mario Matthew Cuomo was sworn in today to a third term as New York State's Governor.
Reciting an oath administered by the state's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, the 58-year-old Mr. Cuomo began a year in which he will confront the greatest fiscal challenge of his tenure, a budget gap that by some accounts has reached almost $4 billion. It is also a year in which he is expected to decide whether he will seek the Presidency, although Mr. Cuomo has insisted that any such considerations are premature while the state remains in financial turmoil. 
 The six-minute ceremony was held in the ornate main room of the New York State Court of Appeals, where Mr. Cuomo began his legal career more than 30 years ago as a law clerk. About 80 people -- mainly relatives and members of his executive staff -- looked on.
 
Others Take Their Oaths
 Just before the Governor was sworn in, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine took the oath for his second term of office. Attorney General Robert Abrams and Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who were both first elected in 1978, shunned swearing-in ceremonies for their fourth terms and instead said they planned to file written oaths of office with the Secretary of State in Albany.
The quiet mood here today contrasted sharply with Mr. Cuomo's 1987 inauguration, which attracted nearly 5,000 people and featured a 19-gun salute and symphony overtures. Mr. Cuomo announced earlier this year that he would forgo an elaborate ceremony this time, saving the state between $60,000 and $70,000 and acting in recognition, in the Governor's words, of the "inconvenience, sacrifice, even pain" forced by the state's fiscal straits.
"The months immediately ahead of us are going to be perhaps more difficult than any since the Great Depression," he said during brief remarks to reporters after he was sworn in. "But this state has overcome fires and floods and Depression and wars, always bringing us to a higher ground."
For New York governors, the formal swearing-in ceremonies have often been in private on New Year's Eve, although the festivities surrounding the inauguration, including a public re-creation of the oath of office, have generally been held on New Year's Day.
In holding the simple ceremony today, Governor Cuomo in effect merged the two occasions. He has no public appearances scheduled for Tuesday, his aides said today.
 
Gestures of Moderation
 In other gestures of moderation, Mr. Cuomo shunned his limousine today despite the Albany chill, and walked several hundred yards, accompanied by a handful of close aides, from his office in the Capitol to the Court of Appeals building.
Dressed in a black suit with a dark striped tie and placing his hand on a family Bible held by his wife, Matilda, Mr. Cuomo repeated after Judge Wachtler that he would support the Federal and New York State Constitutions. And, he said, he would "faithfully discharge the obligations of my office of Governor of the State of New York, according to the best of my ability, so help me God."
Mr. Cuomo, who has pledged to lay off up to 10,000 state workers and who dismissed holding a ceremony as unbecoming "at a time of national economic crisis," said today that he did not regret having to do without festivities.
"I've never been too good at pomp and circumstance," he said.
 
'Exactly Appropriate'
 Mr. Lundine, who was a five-term Congressman from the Jamestown area before winning the lieutenant governorship in 1986, was sworn in by Justice Joseph W. Bellacosa with his wife, Sara, standing next to him. Mr. Lundine said the low-key swearing-in was "exactly appropriate to the circumstances."
Relatives and some aides to the officials returned with them afterward to the Executive Mansion for a private reception.
Still, no Cuomo inauguration would be complete without questions about whether the Governor would make a bid for the Presidency, or without the Governor skirting the queries. Sure enough, Mr. Cuomo parried when asked today whether he agreed with a range of political pundits who say he must make a decision this year on running for President to have a credible chance of winning.
"If I were going to make plans, or plan to make plans, I would have to start with that question," Mr. Cuomo told reporters.
Asked what the answer to the question might be, he protested, "I haven't made plans to make plans." Mr. Cuomo then broke into a grin and said he answered that way "just to show you that nothing will be different in 1991."

A Little Nervous Music
The year in fashion should be taken with vodka, tomato juice and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. The industry's 12-month hangover began with cataclysmic retail bankruptcies and ended with holiday sales figures that showed once and for all that there is no Santa Claus.
Even Tiffany & Company, supposedly immune to recession, revised its profit expectations for the fourth quarter, citing poor domestic sales, and its stock dipped sharply last week. The resort season has been virtually ignored by the stores and mostly unadvertised amid the retail nervousness.
New perfumes, once sure profit makers, have been bombing with alarming regularity. One called California (finally, a fragrance named for a state!), which made its debut at Bloomingdale's in 1990, is already being sold at Duane Reade.
Walking down Seventh Avenue the week before Christmas, one could pick up handbills advertising a dozen showroom sales between Times Square and Macy's. The inside joke called "Saturday selling" has now become a seven-day event.
One retail analyst, Kurt Barnard, says the recession will not be nearly as deep and prolonged as that of 1982. In his Retail Marketing Report for December he points out that, unlike the situation in 1982, inventories now are low, and he says that energy prices, which cut into discretionary spending, will ebb in the spring, releasing pent-up demand.
In the meantime, fashion executives are tightening their belts, eliminating bonuses and laying off workers. Of course their chauffeurs will be the last ones to go.
 
 Enter Bodywear
 It was the year of the woman on Seventh Avenue. Donna Karan was named the designer of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She and a test-tube product called Lycra injected the only real vitamins into the fashion business.
But designers must face the bodywear look with trepidation. Besides leggings and a jacket, what else does anyone need? The look is easy and modern -- qualities designers have talked about for years -- but all one needs to buy are pieces. Leggings or a tube skirt cost $50. Add a jacket and a great haircut. Who needs to spend $600 on a gingham blouse?
Women have seemed less passionate about clothes. Many were no longer fain to wear their diamonds in public; the rich were hiding their furs.
Men, on the other hand, took fashion to an opposite extreme. The slang "to die for" and "fashion victim" gained frightening resonance as young men killed for "eight ball" leather jackets, "pump" sneakers and shearling coats.
 
The Ins and the Outs
 Nostalgia continued to influence the runways. Some fashion historians say that the end of a century summarizes and refines all its styles. So, in the 1980's, people dressed like the 50's. Now there is a rebirth of the 60's: vinyl skirts, bouffant hairdos and lots of eyeliner. The 1970's are certainly on their way, even if nobody wants to see leisure suits again.
So the trends of the 90's are old trends. Gingham and Doris Day. Audrey Hepburn and the Kelly bag. Superfly and hot pants. In the new Vogue, there are even Diane Von Furstenberg and Courreges. Who said they could come back?
The cycles in fashion get shorter and shorter. How many times have the 60's been revived since the 60's? They're never out long enough to be completely out. Soon all the decades will overlap dangerously. Soon everything in will simultaneously be out.
It will be the dawn of the millennium. New stores will open, everything will be fabulous and sell like crazy, and no one over size 14 will ever wear spandex again.

HEADLINE: Bank Failures Dip, for Now

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The number of bank and savings institution failures declined in 1990 for the first time in seven years, but the floundering economy may prevent any sustained improvement.
In 1990, 169 commercial and savings banks failed, including one bank that remained open only with an infusion of Government cash, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporatin said today. 
 In addition, 211 savings and loans went insolvent, the Resolution Trust Corporation said. That included 207 seized by the Government and put into conservatorship and four kept open with taxpayer money.
The failure total in 1990 -- 380 -- represents a 29 percent drop from 535 in 1989, a post-Depression high. It marks the first decline from the preceding year since 1983, when 84 of both types of institutions failed, compared with 105 the previous year.
Analysts, however, are drawing no encouragement from the improvement. The sharp deterioration in real estate values has yet to make its full impact on the failure rate, they said.
Although 1990's failures were spread among 38 states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, more than a third -- 140 -- were in Texas. Ten other states had 10 or more failures. They were California and Florida, 21 each; Illinois, 18; Louisiana, 17; New Jersey, 14; Oklahoma, 13; New York, 12; Massachusetts and Colorado, 11, and Mississippi, 10.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Oakman Boulevard meanders across Detroit's tumbledown northwest side like a dry riverbed, past boarded-up storefronts and empty lots. But east of Linwood Avenue, the bleak roadscape suddenly comes to life: lights burn inside a row of deserted factories, and the street is filled with cars and delivery trucks.
Here, amid classrooms and offices carved from the heart of an abandoned industrial neighborhood, the Rev. William Cunningham, a tough-talking Roman Catholic priest, has created one of the nation's most eclectic and ambitious urban enterprises. It is a vast, nonprofit civic organization that is part charity, part business and part job training program. 
 Founded 23 years ago after the bloody riots that swept the city, Father Cunningham's organization, called Focus: Hope, has grown from a grass-roots group preaching racial harmony into a citywide conglomerate. The organization now operates food banks that distribute groceries to 80,000 people a month, employs about 180 inner-city workers in its homegrown manufacturing enterprises, and provides math, computer and machinist's training each day to scores of willing but poorly educated Detroit residents.
In December, the organization began the first stage of its most ambitious undertaking yet:-- a Center for Advanced Technology that will use a $15 million grant from the Defense Department to run a national center exploring ways to improve the production and technical skills of inner-city workers.
The center represents Father Cunningham's secular theology of economic salvation through hard work and high technology. Inside a gutted Ford engine factory, he has enlisted a cadre of retired automotive engineers and professors from Michigan engineering colleges in the hope of turning his brightest young recruits into skilled industrial technicians, fluent in high math, the intricacies of computer-aided design and manufacturing and even the rudiments of Japanese and German.
Government and industry experts say that the Focus: Hope programs could be a national model for training young people to address a critical shortage of highly trained machinists.
"There is a critical shortage of people with these kinds of skills," said James Koontz, a machine tool manufacturer who is president of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a private coalition based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that supports research and training in advanced industrial technology. "I know I shudder every time one of our machinists retires, because all we have to choose from are a lot of young kids who, quite frankly, are not very good at reading and writing, let alone technical knowledge."
 
Power Through Job Training
 To help meet operating costs, Focus: Hope is negotiating contracts with local manufacturers to supply customized industrial parts. Last month, a group of students and faculty members turned out the first of several hundred pulley systems to be supplied to Detroit Diesel, an engine manufacturer, under a $2 million annual contract.
Father Cunningham, 60 years old, says his program teaches far more than job skills. "This is more than a jobs program, more than just helping blacks keep up," he said. "The issue here is to provide the tools and discipline and very best of training and equipment to bring minorities and poor whites into real positions of control, at the very center of the technological revolution."
Over the years, occasional critics have attacked the organization -- run by a white priest and a mostly white staff, and serving a mostly black community -- as drawing funds away from civic organizations run by blacks.
And many of Father Cunningham's longtime allies in the civil rights and anti-war community were sharply critical of him a year ago, when he agreed to accept Pentagon money to seed his Center for Advanced Technology. The Most Rev. Thomas Gumbleton, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit, said taking money from the Pentagon represented "a very subtle subversion of our moral values."
 
The Sin of Not Helping
 But in a city that has become a national metaphor for urban decay, Father Cunningham has a powerful truth on his side: His organization works. For example, relying on millions of dollars in machinery donated by the Federal Government and private industry, the Machinist's Training Institute has managed to find jobs for about 95 percent of the nearly 800 people it has graduated since 1981.
Father Cunningham dismisses critics who say he took "tainted money" when he agreed to work with the Defense Department. "It's tainted money, all right," Father Cunningham replies. "It 'taint enough."
The greater immorality, he argues, would be to deny training to people who are otherwise lost without it, in a city where the only real economic choice confronting many young teen-agers is working at a fast food restaurant or selling crack.
"Sadly, in this country, there has been a tendency to regard as unfit for work a large proportion of our society, at the same time the best jobs require more and more education and technical training," said Father Cunningham, who still conducts Mass each Sunday at the inner-city parish he has served since 1970. "If we do finally fall behind Germany or Japan because we just don't have the skilled work force to keep up, it may have less to do with our productivity than our racism."
 
A Confirmed Pragmatist
 Over the last decade, Father Cunningham and his followers have cajoled and, at times, bullied elected officials, government workers, industrial leaders, university presidents, downtown bankers, civic organizers and foundation treasurers to spend time and dollars helping him.
Neal Shine, the publisher of The Detroit Free Press and a longtime friend of Father Cunningham, says his decision to take money from the Pentagon is not surprising. "Bill will deal with whomever he has to deal with, to get done what he feels needs to be done," Mr. Shine said. "If the devil showed up one day with a grant, Cunningham would accept it, with no strings. He'd even introduce the devil at a press conference, although he'd probably tell him not to take his hat off."
Of the men and women who come to him, eager to find a better future, he asks only three things: show up every day, show up on time, and pay attention.
Irving Knott is one who did. He got his first job at General Motors in 1977, two years after high school, and worked there, on and off, for 10 years, installing door handles on Cadillacs until the plant was closed for good. When he was laid off for the last time, he had a wife and three children and was making $13 an hour.
 
After the Plant Closed
 "Before, you would wait around, because you knew sooner or later they would call you back to work," said Mr. Knott, who is now 33. "But this was different. The plant was closed. We weren't going back." The best jobs he could find paid $4, maybe $5 an hour.
Down at his union hall, he saw a notice about the training at Focus: Hope. Like most of the 180 students enrolled there now, he gets public support to pay his $5,900 tuition and can expect to earn $8 to $10 an hour, most likely at a small machine shop.
Along with the machinist's training institute, the program offers an academic program called Fast Track that uses computers and strict classroom discipline to help high school graduates who can neither read nor write at a high school level.
And for those least able to find work, Father Cunningham finds jobs in his own factories, four small companies run by a for-profit arm of Focus: Hope.
 
No Church Connection
 Although individual church officials have voiced strong support for Father Cunningham's activities, there is no connection, financial or otherwise, between his group and the Archdiocese of Detroit.
The organization's annual budget of about $50 million comes from foundation grants, state and Federal grants and money earned by the sale of industrial parts they make.
All together, the organization sprawls over three city blocks along Oakman Boulevard, its enterprises divided among 18 different buildings. The total payroll consists of nearly 480 workers. Except for about 20 retired engineers who volunteer their time in return for a small stipend, the rest receive full salaries and benefits.
Father Cunningham, a lifelong Detroit native, was a 36-year-old priest who rode a motorcycle and taught English literature at Sacred Heart Seminary in the summer of 1967 when rioting broke out on Detroit's west side. He recalls watching the black columns of smoke rising above the city and thinking there was no longer much point in reciting Chaucer for high school students.
 
Bridging Racial Gap
 So he organized some volunteers and clergymen into a biracial organization that they called Focus: Summer Hope. They organized rallies, gathered food an clothing for riot victims and portrayed themselves as a kind of bridge across the growing gulf separating blacks and whites in Detroit. Their logo shows a black hand and a white hand, reaching toward each other.
It was the collapse of the city's economy in the early 1980's that broadened Focus: Hope's agenda. Stung by foreign competition and the press of technological change, the city's great auto plants laid off workers and closed down lines. Auto suppliers and other manufacturing plants that for generations had provided opportunity for blue-collar laborers abandoned the city. Around them, whole neighborhoods disintegrated.
Meanwhile, the number of people coming through Focus: Hope's food centers soared. " The realization began to dawn on us all that feeding the hungry is more than just giving them a meal," said Eleanor Josaitis, who joined the organization as a volunteer in 1967 and is now Father Cunningham's top aide. "If we really believe in human dignity, it is providing them with something more -- the wherewithal to provide for themselves."
 
Focusing on the Basics
 In the new Detroit, the factory assembly lines needed a different kind of worker. Manual jobs existed, but they went to the oldest workers, the line veterans with the most seniority. To get into the plants as a young man or woman now, you needed to know something about math. You needed to be able to read manuals and interpret technical drawings.
Aware of this problem, the Cunningham organization began the Fast Track program last year, recruiting high school graduates who lacked the math or verbal abilities to enroll in the machinists' course.
Test scores show that Fast Track has been able to raise the math levels of its graduates by nearly two full grade levels and reading skills by about a year. But the washout rate can be high. In some classes, nearly a third of those entering have been dropped for persistent tardiness or absences. Father Cunningham says it is a necessary cost. "We tell them that it's just like the real world. You come in late on your job, you get fired," he said.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Car Makers Cut Back, Toyota Is Expanding Briskly

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOYOTA CITY, Japan

 BODY:
At a time when the American automobile industry is laying off thousands of workers, shuttering factories and bracing for a recession, Kunihiko Minami, the chief of operations at the Toyota Motor Corporation's sprawling Takaoka plant here, says he has his own problems: he cannot find enough auto workers.
Even as the General Motors Corpo ration plans to close up to nine plants in the United States that employ tens of thousands of workers, Toyota is expanding at a breakneck pace and looking desperately for people to hire. 
 Japan's largest car maker is an example, if an extreme one, of the pace at which many Japanese manufacturers are investing in new plants, new products and new technology, even in the face of a recession in the United States and slower growth at home.
Japan's biggest industrial companies decided years ago that an economic slowdown is the best time to build more efficient manufacturing plants. Usually, though sometimes after considerable bruising from price-cutting battles, they have emerged with larger market shares when economic fortunes have reversed.
"It has happened before, and I suspect we are seeing it again," said Masaru Yoshitomi, the director general of the research institute of Japan's Economic Planning Agency. "Pioneering companies try to make investments during a recession, usually to reduce their labor costs. And in most cases, it has worked."
Toyota said recently that it would build three factories, including one expected to produce 200,000 luxury cars a year. The factories will be in rural corners of Japan where the competition for workers is less intense.
Last month Toyota announced that it would also double production in Kentucky, its flagship overseas manufacturing site where it is already producing 200,000 cars a year. And all over this drab city, which in the 1980's became a symbol of Japan's competitive challenge to the United States, engineering centers, laboratories and training centers are under construction.
In 1989, Toyota was second to G.M. in production, building slightly less than four million vehicles. Through October, production was running 6.5 percent ahead of 1989.
Certainly Japan, too, is beginning to feel te effects of harder times -- battered financial markets, worry about land prices and a sudden credit crunch. But what seems most surprising is that the troubles are having relatively little effect on its best manufacturers, which are less vulnerable than many small companies here.
The strategy of increasing capacity and cutting prices to gain market share certainly worked in the mid-1980's, when Japan's biggest electronics giants built enormous plants to make the most common type of memory chips. Despite huge initial losses, they emerged with an 80 percent share of the market. The prospect that the strategy could work again, and deepen conflicts between Japan and the United States, is something Japanese Government officials are increasingly describing as one of their biggest fears in the new year.
"The tension you have seen up to now between the United States and Japan came when both economies were expanding," a senior official in Japan's Foreign Ministry said recently. The image of Japan gaining a larger share of key markets in the United States during a recession "is one of our nightmares," he added.
Toyota's expansion plans have hardly been welcomed by the Government. Fearing that the car company would use its new capacity to export cars -- and thus increase Japan's trade surplus -- the Ministry of International Trade and Industry earlier put pressure on Toyota to curb its plans. In a rare act of public defiance, the company refused.
And Toyota is showing no signs of backing away, even as economists and the Government have been warning industry that the home market, which has provided the fuel for huge capital investments over the last three years, will grow only 3.8 percent in the next fiscal year as measured in gross national product after adjusting for inflation. That figure would be greeted as boom times in the United States but would mark Japan's slowest growth in four years.
Moreover, the days of easy access to cheap capital for Japanese companies are clearly over. Interest rates here have surged this year, and Japan's banks, which once fell over one another to lend money for plant expansions and research and development, are turning away borrowers as their profits tumble.
While many predicted that such changes would finally derail Japan's rapid growth, it is becoming clear that the huge majority of capital spending by Japanese companies is financed internally from their retained profits. While most plans for investment in plants and equipment call for less than half of the 14 to 20 percent growth in recent years, a period of remarkable strength, they remain ambitious by any international comparison.
Japanese executives offer two other important reasons why they can expand more easily than foreign competitors. First, they say, there is less pressure from shareholders for high profits, because most of the stock of the companies is owned by other closely affiliated companies rather than by individuals and unrelated institutions looking for big dividends. In fact, profits are expected to decline about 15 percent this year.
The second is that Japan's largest companies can spread the expense of expanding capacity to their tight network of suppliers and affiliated companies, which cannot refuse their largest customer. For example, Toyota has pressed important affiliates like Nippondenso, its chief supplier of electrical components, to invest heavily in more efficient manufacturing technology that will enable them to cut their prices to Toyota.
"It's coercive, but it works," an executive of a leading Toyota supplier said somewhat ruefully.
 
$18 Billion in the Bank
 And the companies that spent the 1980's amassing huge hoards of cash -- not only Toyota, which has $18 billion in the bank, but also the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the biggest members of the Mitsubishi Group and many other giant companies -- can finance their own ambitious expansion plans on a scale that few of their American competitors could think about these days.
Publicly Toyota's leadership likes to describe its investments in new plants and equipment as almost an international obligation. "Should the auto industry suffer a downturn in Japan, it will create problems all over the world," Shoichiro Toyoda, the president of Toyota and a member of its founding family, said in a recent interview.
The Nissan Motor Company is also expanding but not at Toyota's pace. "That is why we call them 'Toyota Bank,' " said Yukihiko Eguchi, a Nissan spokesman. "It is a bit different for the rest of us." Nissan, in fact, is more bearish than Toyota, and more dependent on borrowed money. Even so, it is adding capacity at one of its biggest plants in Japan, doubling its production in Tennessee to 450,000 cars a year and finishing a factory in England.
 
Expansion in Electronics
 Many large Japanese electronics companies are also expanding. The companies are racing to increase production of the four-megabit DRAM, the latest generation of memory chip, capable of storing more than four million bits of information.
Despite growing evidence that the market might be flooded with the new chips, Hitachi Ltd. and the Toshiba Corporation are both planning to produce two million four-megabit chips a month by spring. Once again, their biggest fear is losing market share. And the race is already on to ship samples of the 16-megabit chip, lest any company get a reputation for being a technological laggard.
Not every industry is preparing for such expansion. Steelmakers, after years of unexpectedly strong growth, say that in 1991 steel production will decline slightly from this year's production of 110 million tons, which was the highest in 11 years. Shipbuilders are also looking for a slowdown.
 
Growth in Autos Expected
 For Toyota, domestic car sales have grown 10 percent this year -- a huge figure considering that Toyota accounts for nearly a third of Japan's car market. And while the American automobile market is expected to be stagnant next year, both Toyota and the Honda Motor Company, the most successful Japanese manufacturers in the United States, say they expect growth.
What that means, but what few executives here want to discuss, is a further erosion of market share for the American auto makers.
No matter what happens in the United States, Japanese auto makers say they have a new form of insurance: the huge investment they have made in Southeast Asia, an area where American auto makers have little presence. Countries like Thailand are among the fastest-growing car markets in the world, and they are overwhelmingly dominated by Japanese producers. Yoshiro Kimbara, one of Toyota's senior managing directors and a member of its board, said that investment would begin to pay off, compensating for declines in the American and European markets.
 
Biggest Challenge to Americans
 Much of the more than $4 billion that Toyota will spend in the fiscal year that ends next June will be directed at remaking its existing plants -- and that may pose the biggest competitive challenge to American competitors.
The Takaoka plant, for example, served as the model for the Toyota-G.M. joint venture in Fremont, Calif. But the plant today bears little resemblance to the one that was copied in the most famous experiment yet in joint American-Japanese manufacturing.
Toyota has continued to pour tens of millions of dollars into the plant, installing a huge row of robots that can weld the main parts of a car body with almost no human intervention and can automatically be adjusted to handle several different kinds of car bodies.
Toyota is slowly using the plant to introduce technologies it developed to build its newest luxury car, the year-old Lexus. For example, over the next few years, Toyota officials say, all their cars will use a special laser-welding technique that allows different thicknesses of steel to be combined in the car body.
 
Building Design Centers
 All this has hardly made Toyota, or other Japanese companies investing heavily here, invincible. More than a few of the company's newest car models have underwhelmed Japanese car buyers, and some of its designs still look clunky, conservative or both. The company is worried enough about that to invest heavily in building design centers, including one in downtown Tokyo aimed at making cars that appeal to urban Japanese. Design centers are also expanding in the United States and Europe.
But in the end, Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers seem confident that recession or not, they are wise to invest heavily now. "The results of what we are doing now won't appear for four years," Mr. Kimbara said. "And though it is not our ultimate goal to expand our market share, it is good for us if more people think Toyota cars are what they want. Remember, only a third of the world's population is using cars. We have a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Admits Errors but Predicts Gains;
Bush Tidings Circumspect

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
In a friendly but circumspect New Year's Day message to the Soviet Union, President Bush applauded Moscow's cooperation in the Persian Gulf and encouraged a country troubled by ethnictensions and economic hardship to continue its "arduous journey" toward reform.
Mr. Bush's videotaped message, prepared for broadcast in the Soviet Union on Tuesday, was in some ways the warmest of the greetings in the exchange between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union that began in 1986.
This year's greeting nevertheless struck a more cautious note than Mr. Bush's message of 1989. It dropped the references to his personal relationship with President Gorbachev that marked last year's remarks.
This year Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Gorbachev, but only to wish him a happy New Year. Instead, he made more general comments about Soviet-American ties.
"This year, our two countries, as well as those around the world, have much to be grateful for -- first and foremost the improved and strengthened relations between the United States and the Soviet Union," Mr. Bush said.
On the Persian Gulf crisis, he said, "I applaud, the world applauds, the decisive action of the Soviet Union in strongly opposing Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression in the gulf."
Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, who videotaped a message to the American people for broadcast here, Mr. Bush made no reference to the summit meeting that is to take place in Moscow from Feb. 11 to 13. Administration officials said the omission was not intended to signal a possibility that the meeting would be called off.
Cable News Network planned to show both messages at about 1 P.M. on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. Officials at the broadcast networks said portions of the tapes were likely to be used as news items on Tuesday's evening broadcasts.
The officials said the shift in emphasis between last year's message and the one Mr. Bush taped this year reflected new uncertainties about the Soviet leadership.
But they said Mr. Bush's comments were not intended to be specifically critical of Mr. Gorbachev, to whom American policy toward the Soviet Union is closely tied.
The officials said Mr. Bush's message had been taped before Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned. While Administration officials have expressed concern about how the resignation might affect Soviet foreign policy, Moscow has emphasized continuity in its ties with Washington.

HEADLINE: Transforming the Decade: 10 Critical Technologies;
Mighty Chips Reinventing Silicon Circuits

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Microelectronic circuits embedded on pieces of silicon are the building blocks of modern electrical devices, from computers and communication equipment to consumer electronics goods. They are also critical components of weaponry, automobile-engine control systems to improve fuel efficiency and factory automation systems.
The performance of these vital components will continue to improve over the next decade, rippling through the economy. The number of transistors that can be put on a chip will increase from about one million to close to 100 million. As that happens, more and more of the value of a computer will be contained in the chip. Complex chips, specialized for particular tasks, hold out the best hope of achieving long-sought goals like computers that can understand speech or interpret scenes. 
 The United States still leads in designs of clever circuitry but lags in the ability to manufacture chips. Sematech, the consortium financed by the Government and the semiconductor industry, is seeking to redress that balance. It is also trying to keep alive the endangered American manufacturers of chip-making equipment.
But Sematech alone, even if it is successful, will not be enough, experts say. A big problem for the United States is not technology but capital. Most American companies can no longer afford to build advanced manufacturing plants, which cost several hundred million dollars now and promise to keep getting more expensive.
 
Making Innovation Affordable
 Krishna C. Saraswat, a electrical engineering research professor at Stanford University, said one goal should be to use computer automation and other techniques to develop low-cost factories affordable by the small companies that often lead the industry in innovation. "If we can provide that opportunity, there will be many more companies willing to stay in business," he said.
Several particular technologies should get increasing emphasis in the 1990's. One will be increasing computer speed by connecting many chips together in modules. Another will be new technology for testing chips with millions of transistors.
Printing circuit patterns on silicon with beams of light is a technology that now appears likely to last through the decade. But new techniques, using X-rays or electron beams, might be needed after that. Efforts to explore all these techniques might be warranted until the course becomes clearer.

By the late 1970's electronic circuits had been drastically shrunk. For example, these four silicon chips, built in 1978 by I.B.M., could hold the equivalent of 15 pages of text. (I.B.M.)
 
By 1989 technology had advanced so far that a chip the size of a thumbnail, like the Intel 486 microprocessor below, could be installed in desktop computers, giving them the power of the million-dollar machines of the 1970's.(C & I Technologies)

Fiber Optics New Networks For the Nation

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The "gigabit network" would make it possible to transmit computer data and video images among the nation's supercomputer centers, research laboratories and universities, as well as to businesses and homes. This network of fiber-optic cables, which would completely replace existing copper lines, is viewed by many scientists and executives as both a vital research tool and an essential part of the country's "information infrastructure" for the next century.
Despite vocal support from both Democratic and Republican legislators and from the Bush Administration, Federal financing to develop a high-speed nationwide computer network failed in Congress this fall. But this setback is probably temporary. 
 A gigabit network would permit researchers to share vast amounts of scientific and technical data. Doctors in their offices could view medical imaging animations produced by advanced diagnostic equipment in hospitals. A huge array of information, entertainment and business services would be created.
For example, a high-speed digital network could make the materials stored in the nation's best libraries instantly available to readers in thousands of community libraries around the country.
Or a home television viewer could choose to view whatever movie he or she wanted by selecting from a library of thousands of possible choices. In businesses, holding conferences by video, now expensive and inconvenient, would become commonplace, making it possible to minimize business travel.
 
A National Data Highway
 "It will unleash a tremendous amount of creativity and innovation which will lead to capabilities we can't even imagine today," said Robert E. Kahn, a scientist at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a Reston, Va., research organization that is coordinating consortiums of corporations, research laboratories and universities developing extremely fast computer networks.
For example, one of the high-speed network projects now being coordinated by scientists at the California Institute of Technology would use the network to link different types of supercomputers separated by thousands of miles into a single machine many times more powerful.
Replacing the nation's copper telephone wiring with a network of fiber-optic cables would also have a dramatic impact on the nation's economy, say advocates like Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee. Just as the national highway system, constructed in the 1950's, brought about unexpected new economic activity all over the country, a national data highway could spawn dozens of research services and businesses. Both in Europe and Japan large efforts are under way to modernize older telecommunications networks to permit them to carry high-speed computer communications.
Researchers estimate that to install a similar network reaching into all of the homes and businesses that now have telephone service in the United States might ultimately cost $200 billion.

HEADLINE: Heavy Fighting Erupts in Somali Capital

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Fighting between Government and opposition forces intensified today in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, amid reports that the President, Mohammed Siad Barre, had taken refuge at the international airport.
The position of the President, an ally of the United States, appeared increasingly vulnerable, officials in Washington said. But they said that they had no confirmation that the President was at the airport preparing to flee the country, and that they had no clear idea who had the upper hand in the fighting. 
 The President has a bunker near the airport and has often used it as part of his routine of rarely staying in one place for any length of time, the officials said.
In the last few days, the fighting had moved to the area of the Presidential residence, known as Villa Somalia, and to the downtown area of the city that fronts onto the Indian Ocean, an official in Washington said. Mortars, machine guns and hand-held rocket launchers were being fired.
 
A Tribal Conflict
 "The fighting is between the Presidential guard and security forces and the people in the city, presumably United Somali Congress supporters," a Washington official said. The United Somali Congress is a rebel group that controls territory in the center of the country, closest to the capital.
The congress is made up largely of members of the Hawiye tribe of central Somalia, while Mr. Siad Barre is the leader of the dominant Marehan tribe. A State Department official said the attempt to unseat Mr. Siad Barre was a tribal affair without international implications. "Superpower competition is a thing of the past in the Horn of Africa," he said.
The official said that assertions by rebels that they had taken the presidential palace could not be confirmed because it was too dangerous for American officials to travel around the city.
"A lot of people are putting out claims to say they are controlling this or that," said the official. "Nobody really controls anything. It's a free for all. There is a lot of thuggery and robbery."
 
Troops 'Running Amok'
 He said Somali army officers had lost control of their troops, who are now "running amok."
President Siad Barre presides over a country of six million people on the eastern edge of the Horn of Africa. He became an ally of the United States in 1978 when Moscow and Washington switched clients in the Horn, then a theater of the cold war.
Ethiopia, at one time an American ally, became a client of the Soviet Union and Somalia, once pro-Soviet, became a large recipient of American military and economic aid. Since 1980, after Soviet advisers were expelled from Somalia, the United States has had military access to Berbera, a northern port on the Gulf of Aden.
 
Relations With U.S. Cool
 In the last 18 months, however, Washington has become disenchanted with the Somali leader, who came to power in a military coup in 1969. In July 1989, army officers led a massacre of civilians on a beach outside the capital, which raised many criticisms by human rights groups in Europe and the United States.
Since then, military and economic aid from Washington has been reduced to virtually nothing. The American Embassy, a compound of buildings and swimming pools completed 18 months ago, is now staffed by about 30 employees, down from 200 last year.
[ A State Department spokesman in Washington, Adam Shub, said there are about 80 Americans, including 37 embassy staff members, in Somalia, The Associated Press reported.]
Unable to hold back three rebel movements operating in the north, center and south of the country, the President had virtually ceded power in most of Somalia and had become known as the Mayor of Mogadishu. Because the fighting is seeen as mainly clan-based, attempts by President Siad Barre to ameliorate it by introducing reforms like a multiparty system have been scoffed at by the rebels.
The Siad Barre Government is also being challenged by the Somali National Movement, a force dominated by the northern Isaaq tribe. Africa Watch, a human rights group, has estimated that 50,000 people have died in the fighting between the Government and the United Somali Congress, mostly in army bombing and artillery attacks and shootings by execution squads.

HEADLINE: As Violent Year Ends, India Pleads for Peace

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 31

 BODY:
In the closing days of a year that will be remembered as the most violent in four decades of Indian history, artists and intellectuals are coming out into the streets and meeting halls of this capital city to plead for peace and an end to the politicization of religion.
At least 7,000 people have died in India this year in civil strife in the states of Punjab, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir, in the Muslim neighborhoods of Agra, Aligarh, Hyderabad and a dozen other cites, and on the streets of New Delhi and Chandigarh, wherestudents set fire to themselves to protest affirmative action programs that threatened the privileges of the few in a land where population is fast outstripping opportunity. 
 "The situation is infinitely worse than it has ever been before," said Prem Pandhi, director of the International Management Institute in New Delhi and a founder of Touch India, a group that held its first news conference here today. He and others criticized politicians for using disaffected religious groups, including the Hindu majority, as voting blocs.
"Politicans have not given us the most important thing: economic development," said Harish Mahajan, an educator and member of the new group. "So now it's a matter of all the hungry people of one community fighting the hungry people of another community."
On New Year's Day, more than a hundred musicians, dancers, actors and popular entertainers calling themselves Artists Against Communalism plan a 12-hour "performing sit-in" in New Delhi to promote understanding. Communalism is the Indian term for religious prejudice and violence perpetrated in the name of one faith or another.
A film maker, Chanda Prem, said today that she had been offered all the help she needs from Bombay movie stars in making cassettes and videotapes to distribute to villages carrying the message of tolerance. Ms. Prem recently produced a film about Ayodhya, where Hindus want to build a temple on the site of a mosque, in which she gave both Muslims and Hindus equal opportunity to state their cases.
In Calcutta over the weekend, scholars of the Indian History Congress called on the Government to neutralize the Ayodhya temple site by declaring the whole area a national monument.
Last week, a group of prominent Indians revived an organization called Citizens for Democracy and marched through central New Delhi to demonstrate their opposition to the increasing use of violence in politics.A leader of that march, Khushwant Singh, a Sikh historian and journalist, said in an interview with India's national news agency, the Press Trust of India, that "corruption, muscle power and money" were leading to intolerable strains on democracy.
The theme of lost values also ran through today's meeting of Touch, or The Organization for Universal Communal Harmony. The movement was founded in Chicago in October by a retired American librarian, Nazar Hayat Tiwana.
On Thursday, Touch India will assemble a panel of intellectuals from several Indian communities to discuss new ways to restore peace. "By 1997, the 50th anniversary of independence," we want to see a happier, more peaceful, less divided India," Mr. Tiwana said.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Presidency on the Brink Of a Make or Break Year

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
George Bush begins the new year with his Presidency poised between success and failure. The country begins it with bated breath.
Should the crisis in the Middle East turn into a blood bath, or become the kind of prolonged stalemate that Mr. Bush has promised to avoid, it could prove as damaging to him as Vietnam proved to Lyndon B. Johnson. If weeks or months of heavy American casualties would hurt, so would further disruption of oil supplies, which would force up gasoline prices and damage the already weak economy. 
 Like Lyndon Johnson, President Bush could find it devilishly hard to deliver either of the two things that matter most to the American electorate -- peace and prosperity. That's why the next few months, in the plain words of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, look like "make or break time for George Bush."
The prospect of another crippled President, one would think, would cast a pall over Washington, to say nothing of the prospect of war. But no real anxiety grips the capital. In fact, the most notable things about the city as the final hours of 1990 slipped by were empty sidewalks, silent telephones and offices vacated hours before quitting time.
Most policy makers have found little reason to cancel vacation plans, even though Jan. 15, the date after which the United Nations has authorized the use of force against Saddam Hussein's forces in Iraq, will arrive in a matter of only two weeks.
"If there is a sense of crisis in this city," said a State Department official who has spent the holidays here, "I haven't been able to find it. The prevailing mood seems to be, 'Something will turn up to get us out of this.' No one can say what the something will be, but that doesn't stop them from thinking it will come."
Mr. Bush himself would appear to share the city's hunch that Saddam Hussein will decide to withdraw from Kuwait at the 11th hour and make a big American offensive unnecessary. In a year-end interview, he told Time magazine, "My gut says he will get out of there."
But the President also conceded, "I do not have that much of a feel." And there are powerful Washington figures who fear that Mr. Bush may be heading for trouble. Mr. Dole, Republican, tough-minded and usually a hawk, is one of them; he said over the weekend that "the American people are not yet committed to war" and urged that another effort be made to arrange a meeting between Mr. Hussein and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Baghdad.
Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, a moderately hawkish Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, also warned that the American public was uneasy. They "want to make sure," he said, "that we've tried every alternative before going to war."
The lack of electricity in the air, the President's comments and Mr. Dole's and Mr. Aspin's remarks all suggest that at least one more round of political and diplomatic activity is likely before any final decision to fight.
It is hard to believe, for example, that a meeting with Mr. Hussein will be passed up simply because of a disagreement on dates, especially with the home front as nervous as it seems to be. It is hard to believe, likewise, that Mr. Bush will opt for force without at least trying to win Congressional authorization for such a move in a resolution similar, perhaps, to the one the United Nations Security Council approved late last month.
According to his aides, Mr. Baker will travel to Europe and to the Middle East in the next 10 days to consult with leaders of countries allied with the United States in the gulf. He could easily head for Baghdad on short notice. And the European Community is planning some sort of peace effort of its own, which would involve assurances to Baghdad about "what would happen if Iraq leaves Kuwait," as one minister put it.
The White House insists that there will be "no negotiations." So the Iraqis and the Europeans talk instead about "establishing a dialogue."
Whether it will work is far from clear, because no one -- not the other Muslim leaders, not the intelligence-agency psychiatrists and certainly not George Bush -- is sure what Saddam Hussein's state of mind is. But with two weeks to go, the situation does not yet look hopelessly stalemated, and most of official Washington, at the dawn of a new year, does not yet look upon war as inevitable.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Europeans Expect Session on Friday to Lead to Talks With Iraqis

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Foreign ministers of the European Community expect their special session in Luxembourg on Friday to lead to direct discussions with Iraq, European officials said today.
 The officials said that Jacques Poos, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, which takes over the rotating presidency of the community on Tuesday, would probably be asked to enter into immediate contact with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. 
Friday is the last possible day when something meaningful can happen," Mr. Poos said in apparent reference to the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
 But the officials said there was still no consensus among the 12 nations of the community countries over whether Mr. Poos will simply reiterate the demand for an end to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait or whether he will also promote some face-saving formula to ease a withdrawal.
 
Alarm Over War Threat
 Alarmed by the mounting threat of war, Germany and France called for Friday's special session after the United States and Iraq failed to agree on a date for their own direct talks. But Britain has cautioned against any independent move by the community that might weaken the anti-Iraq alliance.
 "The only initiative is to call a meeting on Friday," Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said today. "I think there's a chance, not a good chance, there's a chance for peace as long as the issues are clear: that Saddam Hussein knows that if he stays in Kuwait, he will be attacked and that if he withdraws completely and unconditionally, he will not be attacked."
 In a year-end television address, President Francois Mitterrand said France was ready to use force to apply United Nations resolutions demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. "Iraq must realize this," he said. "With Kuwait under occupation, nothing is possible. With Kuwait evacuated, everything is possible."
 "But I still believe in the chances of peace," the French leader went on, "and France will work for peace right up to the last moment, as long as we stand by our principles. That's what we did with the hostages. Today they are free. It could also be the same for Kuwait."
 
Middle East Agenda
 In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation today, Mr. Poos said he would be ready to discuss all pending Middle Eastern problems, including the Arab-Israeli conflict, with Mr. Aziz. But he rejected attempts by the Baghdad authorities to link settlement of the gulf crisis to resolution of the Palestinian question.
 He added that, if the opportunity arose, he would tell Mr. Aziz that Iraq would have to carry out all United Nations resolutions on the Kuwait question "without any restraint" if the way is to be opened for discussion of other Mideast problems.
 A senior official in Luxembourg's Foreign Ministry said there would be "no linkage" between the issues by the community, but he noted, "The situation is such that, even if there is no linkage for us, there is linkage for lots of Arab countries, including allies of the United States."
 Mr. Mitterrand, who has long promoted the idea of an international peace conference on the Mideast, said an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would create the conditions for broader discussions, "where no question would be avoided."
 
No Issues Excluded
 "Neither Israel's right to security nor Palestinians' right to a homeland," he said. "Neither the right of Lebanon to be whole again, nor the rights of everyone, of Iraq and Kuwait, to live in peace in a region that would have the wisdom, as we have had in Europe, to choose entente over constant confrontation."
 French officials emphasized today that, by calling for the meeting on Friday, the Europeans were not trying to undercut the United States. They noted that community foreign ministers agreed last month to meet again on Jan. 4 if no talks had been held between Washington and Baghdad by Jan. 3, the date proposed by President Bush.
 The officials recalled that the foreign ministers had also authorized a meeting with Mr. Aziz after he had met Mr. Bush. "The idea has been around for a while," a French official said, adding that France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, had raised the possibility of making a trip to Baghdad himself.
 Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who on Saturday formally proposed the community foreign ministers' meeting, also strongly favors a new diplomatic initiative, reportedly fearing that a gulf war would not only aggravate the economic troubles of Eastern Europe's new democracies but also complicate relations between Washington and Moscow.
 Political experts in Germany noted further that there is strong support for a European initiative on the gulf crisis inside Mr. Genscher's Free Democratic Party, which is currently negotiating formation of a new coalition government with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party.
 The senior Luxembourg official said the community much preferred that the United States and Iraq engage in direct discussion before Mr. Poos meets Mr. Aziz. "But there is now a greater sense of urgency because of the stalemate between the United States and Iraq," he said, adding that Washington was being kept closely informed of the community's moves.
 
Jordanian to Visit Europe
 AMMAN, Jordan, Dec. 31 (REUTERS) -- King Hussein of Jordan will travel to Europe this week for talks on the Persian Gulf crisis while the European Community decides whether to seek peace talks with Iraq, Jordanian officials said today.
 They said the King would leave Wednesday on a tour to include Paris and London as well as other Western capitals. Details of his schedule were still being worked out, they said.
 Officials said Hussein, one of the few Arab leaders still on speaking terms with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq after Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, is working with the Algerian President, Chadli Benjedid, to find an internationally backed peaceful solution to the crisis.
 Mr. Benjedid toured the region earlier this month for talks with Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Omanand Jordan but failed to arrange meetings with Saudi leaders on the crisis.

HEADLINE: Needed: Middle East Peace Talks

BYLINE: By Jimmy Carter; Jimmy Carter, the former President, is founder and chairman of the Carter Center.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
"Linked" or not, there is no way to separate the crisis in the Gulf from the Israeli-Palestinian question. Following a settlement with Iraq, either through peace or war, even greater pressure will emerge within the international community to convene a peace conference. United Nations rsolutions on the Middle East, from four decades ago to the present, have been given a new vitality and will not go away again.
Now is a propitious time for Israel to come forward with a genuine peace initiative, and President Bush and congressional leaders should do everything possible to encourage such a move. Present difficulties are formidable, but real progress is possible. 
 Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, Prime Minister Shamir of Israel rejected talks with a Palestinian delegation, the Israeli Government fell and intifada violence escalated. Since then, alignment of Syrian and other Arab forces with the U.S. against Iraq, economic calamity for Jordanians and Palestinians, the Temple Mount tragedy and massive immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel are all increasing friction in the occupied territories.
Historically in the Middle East, stalemates or localized tensions have tended to deteriorate into broader conflict. Having long been involved in the peace process, I realize how important it is that setbacks not deter exploration for new ideas and opportunities. I was distressed when Menachem Begin became Prime Minister in 1977, based upon his previous statements and his first speeches as Israel's leader. However, it was his willingness to negotiate with President Anwar Sadat at Camp David that made the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty possible.
In my meetings last year with Likud leaders in Israel, they re-emphasized their opposition to an international conference, claiming that the United Nations and the Soviet Union would always support Arab positions. This concern about Soviet attitudes has been mitigated by the remarkable emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and resulting diplomatic exchanges between the two nations.
Although the subtle differences are significant, Arab and Israeli leaders actually have a lot in common. While calling for mutual security, peace and economic interests in the region to be addressed, Israelis have insisted on bilateral negotiations with Arab neighbors instead of with a phalanx of adversaries. Among Palestinian leaders and those in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt, I have found uniform support for a peace conference, and willingness under its auspices for direct talks with Israel. President Hafez al Assad of Syria confirmed that, under such conditions, he is willing to negotiate directly with Israel to resolve the Golan Heights dispute.
Both Israeli and Arab leaders have now called for a regional conference to reduce arsenals of mass destruction. Another surprise development in the area has been encouraging. In Lebanon, militia groups have withdrawn from Beirut and are finally negotiating with each other. A viable central government is evolving with more representative participation.
A carefully crafted peace conference under the bi-lateral sponsorship of the United States and the Soviet Union -- if not the United Nations -- could overcome Israelis' objections about inherent bias against them. President Gorbachev has assured me that this would be acceptable, and that the Soviets would not try to impose solutions or veto agreements reached by the Middle East negotiators in their direct talks.
The principles of the Camp David Accords can provide a framework on which the opposing forces might focus their efforts. Laboriously negotiated and adopted by an overwhelming vote in the Israeli Knesset, its basic premises have subsequently been approved, with only slight variations, in various Arab statements and in President Reagan's speech of September 1982. This was quickly accepted by King Hussein of Jordan. P.L.O. Chairman Yasir Arafat and others, who originally rejected these agreements, now claim willingness to accept them as a general basis for peace initiatives.
There has to be good faith on both sides. Tragically, the P.L.O. charter remains intact in its call for the destruction of Israel. Likud leaders, while professing support for Camp David, reject some of its crucial tenets and those of U.N. Resolution 242, apparently not yet willing to negotiate with representative Palestinians or to relinquish control over any areas taken in the 1967 war.
Differences over specific Camp David tenets are already well defined. This is what peace talks are all about: to resolve such disputes and to modify adamant positions of adversaries. There is no doubt that the people of the region want peace. This brings us to the fundamental question: Will the Middle East leaders respond to the will of their people? An international conference may be the only chance.

HEADLINE: Somali Forces Clash With Rebels for 3d Day as Both Report Gains

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 1

 BODY:
Fierce fighting between rebel forces and the Government continued for a third day in the Somali capital today but there were conflicting reports about how much of the city and what strategic elements the two sides controlled.
The rebels, a clan-based group, said in a statement from Rome that their forces in Mogadishu controlled the palace of President Mohammed Siad Barre and had surrounded the leader at his airport bunker. 
 But the Somali Foreign Minister, Ahmed Mohammed Aden Qaybeh, said in an interview during a visit to Qatar that the Government continued to control most of the city. He said the President remained in his residence and that the rebels had been repulsed.
The state-run radio made regular broadcasts today, despite a claim by the rebels that they had taken both the television and radio stations.
 
Hundreds Killed, Diplomat Says
 An Italian diplomat in Mogadishu, quoted by the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome, said hundreds had died in the fighting, which involved mortar and hand-held rocket launchers. The diplomat said Mr. Siad Barre was directing his defense from the fortified bunker at the airport.
A human rights group, Africa Watch, reported that the Government's armed forces were singling out civilians of the Hawiye clan, whose members form the backbone of the rebels' United Somali Congress, dragging them from their homes and shooting them. The executive director of Africa Watch, Rakiya Omaar, said that in one such incident over the weekend, 61 civilians were shot.
She said callers to her office in London from Mogadishu on Monday had described the city as being in a state of anarchy and terror. Hospitals were overflowing with wounded and some of the casualties were being treated at hotels, she said.
A State Department spokesman, Adam Shub, said that American citizens in the capital were summoned to the fortified United States Embassy compound. He said 37 embassy employees were at the compound. Evacuation of all non-essential United States Government employees and their dependents was ordered on Dec. 12 after an escalation of random violence. The United Nations has also evacuated its employees.
 
Five Rebel Groups Involved
 The fighting is the latest development in the attentuation of power of President Siad Barre, who took control of the African continent's easternmost country 21 years ago. Once supported by the Soviet Union, he became an American ally in 1978 and has since received military and economic aid. Rebel insurgencies against him escalated two and a half years ago. Five rebel groups are said to be arrayed against him, all of them based on clan loyalties.
The United Somali Congress, which controls most of the center of the country, is composed of Hawiyes. The Somali National Congress, made up of Isaak clansmen, control the north of the country. President Siad Barre is from the Marehan clan and the vast majority of his Government has been selected from his clansmen, an exclusion that has motivated much of the rebel activity.
The Siad Barre Government has allowed the country, once relatively well off, to fall into economic ruin. People who have fled Mogadishu in recent weeks describe it as an armed camp, with weapons readily available for purchase at outdoor markets.
Several United States officials have said in the past several days they were surprised that it had taken so long for the warfare in the capital to break out. "The question is not why all this is happening, but why it hasn't happened sooner," said one official, a specialist in the Horn of Africa.
 
Critical Report From Attache
 The military attache at the United States Embassy from 1987 to mid-1989, Col. Alfred F. Girardi, wrote in a September 1989 letter later circulated to Washington congressional offices that the Siad Barre Government was "corrupt, incapable and uninterested in resolving the problems of the nation." He described the American-supplied Somali armed forces as having "performed poorly" and being "poorly led by inept officers."
After a massacre by Government troops in mid-1989, Washington cut virtually all aid to the country.
The Egyptian Government said today that it was trying to convene peace talks in Cairo that had been scheduled for early last month but were postponed because one of the rebel groups had declined to participate.

HEADLINE: TROUBLED TIMES ON WALL STREET;
In Foreign Exchange, Stay Tuned to the Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The foreign exchange story to watch in 1991 is the strength of the German mark and how its European colleagues cope with it.
The dollar, which fell 13 percent against the mark last year, will be a sideshow to this drama, following the lead of the German currency. The dollar is expected to slide further early this year as interest rates in the United States fall and the economy slumps further into recession. 
 But the dollar outlook for 1991 as a whole is unclear. Some analysts expect it to rally later in the year, but others forecast that the value of the dollar will be no higher and perhaps even lower at the end of this year than it was on the last day of 1990, when it closed at 1.4920 against the mark. Still, the dollar could get a boost from developments in Europe.
The German mark and the Bundesbank dominate the European Monetary System, which ties together the value of the region's 10 major currencies in fixed trading ranges. In the last half of the 1980's, when European economies in the system were growing, following Germany's lead was less painful politically and economically.
 
A Collision Course
 But now economic paths are diverging. The German economy is growing as others are slowing, or in Britain's case, falling into a recession. And now the German central bank's insistence on high interest rates at home to blunt the inflationary impact of paying for the unification of Germany is already on a collision course with the need to lower interest rates in France and Italy to avoid a recession, and in Britain to end one.
There are two possible outcomes. One is that leaders in the slower-growing countries decide to stomach the higher interest rates to prevent their currencies from dropping below the monetary system's trading range. But the higher interest rates would slow their economies further.
John Lipsky, director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers in London, said he thinks this is the likely outcome because leaders will not want to endanger the progress toward a single European central bank and a single currency later in the 1990's.
"There is so much political capital tied up in political and monetary union it is hard to imagine any of the authorities giving up on their goals," he said.
In the second possible outcome, Europe's leaders decide that the economic cost of maintaining high rates and the discipline of the monetary system is too high. To get lower interest rates at home, France and the other countries would accept a realignment of the monetary system under which their currencies would be devalued in relation to the mark.
 
Little Help for the Dollar
 This alternative would open the way for lowering interest rates, without threatening to breach the trading ranges of the monetary system.
"It's going to be quite difficult for the French and the others to accept the need for a revaluation against the mark," said George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London. "But despite the sour taste it leaves in the mouth, I think everyone will have to accept a revaluation of the mark."
This outcome would give the dollar a little help. While its relationship with the mark would not change much, the lowering of interest rates in other countries would help the dollar climb some against the French franc, the Italian lira, the British pound and other European currencies.
But Mr. Lipsky said that this alternative would also undermine the progress toward a single currency. "By admitting the possibility of the shift in currencies as a policy option it may indeed lower the sense of commitment to irrevocably locked exchange rates," he said.
In addition, he argued, the revaluation would slow the movement toward the lowering of inflation in countries like Britain and Italy to the levels in Germany. This so-called convergence is needed as part of the economic harmony that makes the functioning of an economically unified Europe much easier.
 
U.S. Deficit a Factor
 As for the dollar, most analysts think it will be headed even lower as the new year begins because American interest rates are lower than those in Germany and Japan, whose economies are growing and have lower inflation. Thus, investors find holding dollars to be less attractive than at any time since the end of the 1970's. The continuing deficit problems in Washington add to the risk of holding the dollar.
Interest rates in the United States, now in a recession, are expected to decline further. But interest rates in Germany are expected to remain high or even move up another notch. Japanese interest rates will remain high for some time, although they could begin to decline in the spring.
Against the mark, the dollar could fall from the current level of about 1.49 to below 1.40 in the first part of the year, setting record lows as it goes. The dollar will also be weak against the yen, but may not now fall to its post-World War II low of 120 because of the new expectation that interest rates in Japan will fall soon. The dollar ended 1990 against the yen at 135.40.
Some analysts expect interest rates to have peaked in Germany and Japan by the end of 1991, and to have stopped declining here. With a relatively short recession, S. G. Warburg and Goldman, Sachs & Company are forecasting a dollar rally to 1.60 to 1.70 marks, a gain of 7 percent to 14 percent.
But Michael R. Rosenberg, manager of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch, is much more pessimistic because he is not expecting a significant decline in German interest rates soon. So he forecasts the dollar at 1.45 against the mark at the end of next year, a 2.7 percent decline.

HEADLINE: Newsstands On 5th Ave.? Battle Opens

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Nine feet tall. Twelve feet wide. Six feet deep. Could it mean the end of Fifth Avenue as we know it?
Ralph Destino, the chairman of Cartier, believes that, yes, a newsstand in front of his elegantly appointed store at 52d Street would go a long wy toward undermining Fifth Avenue's international reputation as a deluxe thoroughfare. 
 But Mohammed Ibrahim Mohmand of Queens, who wants to build the stand, believes it would be a service to passers-by, who might be as much in need of a daily newspaper as a diamond necklace.
 
Half Dozen Applications Pending
 His is one of a half dozen applications before New York City authorities for newsstands along Fifth Avenue, from 34th to 59th Street, where now there are none. If there ever was an implicit city policy against newsstands in this area, it was lifted two years ago. Today, applicants hope to build stands in front of Tiffany & Company, the Empire State Building and the General Motors Building, among other places.
These plans are being fought by established business interests, represented by the Fifth Avenue Association, which is still smarting from a state court decision last year that protected disabled veterans from a city ban against sidewalk peddling.
"If we lose these battles back to back,"said Thomas Cusick, president of the association, "Fifth Avenue is going to suffer to such an extent that the city is going to experience a very negative economic impact."
Mr. Destino sees the avenue's very essence, as well as its economy, threatened.
"Fifth Avenue, for a hundred years, has been one of the premier shopping streets of the world," he said. "The phrase 'Fifth Avenue' is synonymous with quality, with style, with luxury. That's a real asset.
"You tamper with that asset when you begin to stain Fifth Avenue with vast amounts of hawking on the sidewalk, whether you're hawking food or neckties or counterfeit watches or even The New York Times."To other eyes, however, Fifth Avenue has no claim to an exemption.
"The only reason to deny newsstands there is a sense of snobbery -- a misplaced sense of snobbery -- on the part of Fifth Avenue stores," said Robert S. Bookman, counsel to the New York City Newsstand Operators Association.
"Newsstands are an attraction," he said. "They provide change for buses. They give directions. They often sell tourist-type maps. At night they're a beacon of safety. They pose no economic competition. I can't imagine a more appropriate place."
"Finally," Mr. Bookman said, "the First Amendment -- which is what news stands are primarily about -- is just as important on Fifth Avenue as it is on Broadway."
Mr. Destino bridles at such a notion. "To frame it as a First Amendment issue is to make a mockery of the First Amendment," he said. "The First Amendment protects our rights to write, to publish, to be heard. I don't know of any constitutional right that insures our freedom to buy a Coca-Cola and a lottery ticket on Fifth Avenue."
At the center of the debate is Mr. Mohmand, who arrived in this country from Afghanistan eight years ago and lives with 10 of his children in Flushing, Queens. (His oldest son, Fereed, was killed two years ago battling Russian troops.) Until his retirement, Mr. Mohmand had been a policeman in Kabul.
 
Pitched-Roof Stand Proposed
 He proposes to erect a pitch-roofed stand 15 feet in front of Cartier. There would be an eight-foot-high magazine rack and an array of shelves for newspapers and candy. The air-conditioned shed, clad in galvanized aluminum, would have a soda machine and a side window for the sale of lottery tickets.
Why Fifth Avenue and 52d Street? "Because I want to serve the people," Mr. Mohmand said. "Because there's no newsstand there, no store or supermarket."
There is another reason. "I am retired but still I want to help my children," he said. "If I have such a job that I can help my sons, they can study, they can be educated and have a job. Every parent wants the children to be educated."
And he cannot imagine the stand creating a problem. "It's not in front of the door of any store or any office," he said. "The walkway is so wide that it's possible to put a newsstand there."
A translator who asked that he not be further identified said on Mr. Mohmand's behalf: "He's running his business, and Cartier is running its business. Cartier doesn't sell newspapers, magazines and candies. I'm not sure why people are against it."
 
Landmarks Issue Raised
 But Mr. Destino made his reasons plain in a letter to city officials, in which he noted that City Planning Department guidelines specify that "a newsstand should not obstruct the view of landmarks."
Moreover, he said, such a shed "would constitute a public safety hazard for the vast number of pedestrians walking Fifth Avenue in the 50's every day of the year."
Mr. Mohmand's application has been cleared by the city's Transportation Department, which analyzes proposals for their impact on pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The matter is now before the Landmarks Preservation Commission because the Cartier Building, a renovated town house dating from 1905, is a designated landmark. Eventually the application will arrive at the Art Commission, which will pass on the stand's esthetic merits.
If the other city agencies agree, approval for the newsstand would be granted by the Consumer Affairs Department.
 
Several Applications Pending
 More applications are in the works. According to Consumer Affairs records, the Transportation Department has approved a newsstand in front of the Empire State Building, at 34th Street. That proposal is before the landmarks commission.
Still pending before transportation officials are requests to build in front of Tiffany's, at 57th Street, and the General Motors Building, at 59th Street, as well as on the southeast corners of 44th and 53d Streets.
Exactly why there are no newsstands on the midtown stretch of Fifth Avenue is open to different interpretations.
Mr. Cusick said it was "largely a function of prior administrations setting a policy not to see any on Fifth Avenue."
Mr. Bookman said the practice of routinely rejecting applications for Fifth Avenue stands began "many, many years back" and ended two years ago, when the policy was brought to the attention of Angelo J. Aponte, then the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs.
The Consumer Affairs Department maintains that any earlier rejections occurred because applicants were unable to meet the city's criteria. "Today, and for many years, it's definitely been the law and the practice of the agency to accept any applications," said a spokeswoman, Patricia Cohen.

Some Sectors Advance Despite a Deep Slump

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Companies whose stocks were unaffected by the Middle East and by the recession ended 1990 as the big winners on the American Stock Exchange. Health-care and drug companies, for instance claimed 4 of the top 10 spots.
"Health-care was a good place to be last year," said Ken Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, who ascribed the group's performance to the aging of the population and to consumers' insensitivity to the cost of their care. 
 Those success stories aside, companies on the American exchange generally had a poor year, as investors fled to markets with a higher concentration of blue-chip stocks.
"It was headed for one of the best years, and when Saddam Hussein came in, investors got nervous," said James R. Jones, chairman of the exchange. But the exchange's poor performance started long before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The Amex's market-value index hit its high for the year, 382.45, on Jan. 5, months before the other big markets peaked.
The market-value index finished the year at 308.11, down 18.49 percent, well beyond the Dow Jones industrial average's 4.4 percent decline, the Standard & Poor's 500's 6.6 percent decline, the 7.5 percent decline on the New York Stock Exchange composite index, and even more than the 17.8 percent decline recorded by the Nasdaq composite index, all of which peaked for the year on July 16.
Hardest hit were companies with exorbitant debt loads or companies involved in the crumbling real estate market. NVR, for instance, is a homebuilder that compounded its problems by having borrowed heavily in 1987 to acquire Ryan Homes.
Standouts in a disappointing year were OEA and Tech/Ops Sevcon. OEA makes the electrical devices used in 70 percent of all American-made airbags and stands to benefit from laws that will require airbags in all new cars by 1992. Tech/Ops Sevcon makes speed controls for battery-powered vehicles like forklifts. Their stocks gained 162.7 percent and 72.4 percent, respectively.
"Seventy percent of our business is overseas," said Paul B. Rosenberg, treasurer of Tech/Ops Sevcon. "So the slowdown in America affects us proportionately less."
Sure enough, a humble, recession-proof story, backed by solid earnings, seemed to be the way to investors' hearts. Viatech, a packaging company that placed 16th in the rankings, is one example. The company said it believes it is prospering from consumers' willingness to prepare more meals at home in hard times, a shift that bodes well for packaged food.
In a change from previous years when splashy takeovers caused the biggest run-ups in publicly traded stocks, only one company, GW Utilities showed up on the winner's list because of an outstanding tender offer. The company's majority owner, Olympia & York Developments, wants to take the Toronto-based conglomerate private, and has agreed to pay $40 (Canadian), or $34.50 (American), a share for the 11 percent it does not already own. The offer helps explain why the stock spiked to $31.50, from $20.625 last year.
In a reversal of fortune, Stevens Graphics, a maker of printing presses that was a favorite last year because it had landed some contracts in the Soviet Union, this year found itself 18th from the bottom. One reason: The company reported that it was having trouble collecting $29 million owed by a Soviet customer.

Experts Were Wrong: Small Stocks Lagged

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
It was supposed to be the year of the small stock, with spectacular predictions by analysts and market watchers that 1990 would provide a bull market in stocks with small market capitalizations.
But the experts were wrong. Rather than taking off, small stocks once again lagged the performance of the large-capitalization issues. Since the small-capitalization boom of 1982-1983, when the United States was coming out of a recession, small issues have generally underperformed the overall market. 
 "They systematically lagged in 1990," said Scott Black, president of Delphi Management, a Boston money management firm, which invests about $700 million. "But if you look at them over the last 10 years, as a homogeneous risk-asset class small caps have always lagged."
 
Off 17.8 Percent
 For 1990, the Nasdaq composite was down 17.8 percent, compared with a 4.3 percent fall in the Dow Jones industrial average or the 6.56 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.
Certain segments of the small stocks fared even worse: The Nasdaq bank stocks were down 34.81 percent in 1990. The few bright spots were in the technology stocks and the energy issues, which benefited from the surge in oil prices that began in the summer.
Since the October 1987 market crash, the broad market indexes have more than recouped their losses, but small stocks have lacked the momentum to rebound. The Nasdaq composite has lost 8 percent of its value since the 1987 collapse, while the S.& P. 500 has gained 16.81 percent. The Dow has advanced by 17.22 percent.
There are many reasons why small stocks disappointed investors for yet another year and probably as many opinions on whether the outcome will be different this year. But one undisputed reason was the run-up in oil prices caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
"Stocks were performing well in the first half of the year, and after Saddam Hussein invaded, the market shifted to energy and utilities and those two sectors were driving the S.& P.," said Claudia Mott, senior quantative analyst specializing in small-capitalization stocks at Prudential-Bache Securities. "Energy and utilities are underweighted on the Nasdaq.
And when the economy is going into a recession, she said, small stocks tend to do very poorly in the first half of the recession and better when the economy is rebounding.
"Smaller-cap companies are mostly domestic, and they have not benefited from the plunge in the dollar which has inflated foreign source earnings of those companies with foreign operations," said Joel Tillinghast, who runs the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund.
 
Commputer Stocks on Top
 Technology issues, particularly computer stocks, were the best performers in the over-the-counter market. Atop the list of winners was AST Research, an Irvine, Calif, manufacturer of high-performance desktop computers and a wide range of products for business and professional computer use. AST ended the year at $37.25, a 258.9 percent increase.
In May, the company announced that it had signed an agreement with I.B.M., giving each company a nonexclusive license from the other for patents relating to computers, peripherals, advanced computer technologies and other related products. AST has branch offices through Europe and Asia and sells directly to retailers in more than 89 countries. The company's international sales have grown steadily in recent years.
Among the other big computer winners were Dell Computer, which ended the year at $18.50 a share, a 236.4 percent increase. Dell designs and manufactures high-performance personal computers compatible with I.B.M. standards.
With the performance of Borland International, which designs software, the computer companies took the top three spots among Nasdaq gainers.
Among the big losers were banks and savings and loan associations that were victims of troubled real estate loans and speculative investments made in high-yield securities.
Topping the losers was Abraham Lincoln Federal Savings Bank, which is reporting losses as it takes special charges and increases its loan-loss reserves. The bank's stock ended the year at 13 cents, down 99 percent from the $12.75 at the start of 1990.

HEADLINE: TROUBLED TIMES ON WALL STREET;
Future Buzzwords Rise From Ashes of the 80's

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Forget "L.B.O.'s" and "M.&A.," those code words of the 80's takeover boom. These days, center stage belongs to those who talk of "inflection points," of "enhanced indexing," of "prepackaged bankruptcies" -- the investment buzzwords likely to dominate the intellectual landscape of Wall Street in the year ahead.
Demography, with its attention to turns, or inflection points, in population trends, is gaining wider attention in investment circles. The new census results should give investing based on demographics further impetus. 
 The asset-management business is bracing for an escalation of the duel between "active managers," who build their portfolios stock by stock, and "passive managers," called indexers, who simply try to match the overall market's performance. With active managers hoping that this bear market will help them regain lost ground, the indexers are fighting back with enhancement techniques.
On the trading front, Wall Street is moving from the "Age of Excess" to the "Age of Distress." Once a risky little niche, the distressed securities market is booming, and a new cottage industry of newsletters, lawyers, computer data bases and other special services is springing up to serve the institutional investors getting into the business.
Here are the people and the thinking behind these three trends:
 
Some Rethinking Of Population Trends
 Richard F. Hokenson is the economic demographer for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a title that is still a rarity on Wall Street. Since the 1987 crash, Mr. Hokenson said, Wall Street's interest in his craft has boomed.
"I've seen a tremendous increase in the level of sophistication among our client base from three or four years ago," he said. "That may be because there are more people on the Street thinking about these issues."
Those people include Edward Yardeni, the Prudential-Bache economist, and a handful of analysts and researchers at giants like Merrill Lynch, Citibank and Goldman, Sachs. In addition, various demographic consultants -- from the trendy to the academic -- are finding a larger audience in the investment community, said John L. Steffens, executive vice president for the private client unit at Merrill.
Mr. Hokenson says the 1990 census results will intensify Wall Street's preoccupation with demography by debunking many widely held assumptions about the economic behavior of the baby-boom generation, the outsized cohort of people born in the years after World War II.
"The prevailing forecast was that the baby-boom generation was characterized by 'delay,' that given sufficient passage of time they will behave 'normally,' " he said. But the new census data, he predicted, will show that for many baby-boomers, "later" really means "never" when it comes to economically important events like marrying, having children and buying homes. Those are decisions that can sharply change the investment outlook for a host of industries ranging from baby-food manufacturers to homebuilders. Moreover, a much smaller generation of workers will be coming of age in the 1990's, intensifying the pressure on business to substitute capital for scarce labor, and giving an edge to those that do so quickly and successfully.
All in all, Mr. Hokenson said, "it is an utterly different world" -- one that Wall Street, increasingly, will rely on demography to decipher.
 
A Paradoxical Feud That Can't Be Won
 Indexing, the technique of maintaining a portfolio that matches the behavior of broad market barometers like the Standard & Poor's 500, is not new. About $200 billion, or roughly 7 percent of a domestic capital market estimated at $3 trillion, is being indexed already, said Tom Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management in Pittsburgh. Since indexing is less expensive and more predictable than more active forms of pension-fund management, Mr. Allen said, "I think that could go to 20 to 25 percent in the years ahead."
Byron R. Wien, a portfolio strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, disagrees. The poor investment performance expected in this bear market "is key to the changes that are coming for Wall Street," Mr. Wien said. "And one of the shibboleths that will be shaken here will be indexing. Most people think we are going to return to the era of stock pickers -- and I do, too."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Allen is an indexer and Mr. Wien a stock picker. They might just as well be Hatfields and McCoys -- except that in this paradoxical feud, which is intensifying as this bear market deepens, the indexers cannot survive if they totally vanquish the stock pickers.
"If you think about it, only half of us can be passive, and the rest have to be seeking a way to do better," Mr. Allen said. "I mean, when I'm ready to buy a stock, if there isn't somebody out there with the opposite opinion, you don't have a market."
The herd behavior of index funds is already affecting the liquidity and breadth of the equity markets, funneling money toward major stocks in the indexed roster of shares and away from non-index stocks. And that trend will make it easier for stock pickers to find outstanding values in the market shallows where indexers do not fish, said Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley.
Recent mutations in asset management suggest that the indexers themselves realize that matching the market may have less appeal when the market is ambling slowly sideways. These days, they are offering clients the option of enhanced indexing, a strategy aimed at beating a market index by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.
How do they do that? Through trendy new techniques like "alpha captures," Mr. Allen explained. "You watch for situations where one stock diverges from its historical relationship with other stocks, and you act to capture the profit that arises when that anomaly ultimately corrects itself."
Sounds a little like stock picking, doesn't it? "Well, yes," he said. "We're being forced into being more active passive managers. Ultimately, there will be this entire gradient from passive to semipassive to semiactive to active -- a continuous line, where the fund sponsor decides where he wants to be. It's going to be an interesting decade."
 
Potential Growth From Adversity
 Like indexing, investing in distressed securities is not new to the 1990's. A handful of bankruptcy workout specialists like Martin J. Whitman of Whitman Heffernan Rhein & Company in New York have long made careers of bottom-fishing. But the news these days is that the technique is attracting so much attention from main-line Wall Street investors.
Institutional investors are flocking to new partnerships and "vulture funds" that try to take advantage of the fire-sale prices on the securities and other obligations of bankrupt or nearly bankrupt companies. These new funds, whose recent sponsors include leading brokerage firms like T. Rowe Price and Goldman, Sachs, attracted at least $1 billion in fresh capital to the distressed securities market last year, and Wall Street clearly expects the trend to continue.
"Any bankruptcy lawyer knows there are two great bankruptcy waves in this country," said Thomas M. Mayer, a New York lawyer. "The first was the Great Depression; we are living through the second."
Big investment houses are not alone in riding this trend into the new year. Law firms that once specialized in Wall Street deal making are elbowing their way into the once-cozy bankruptcy bar, representing a new breed of investor-creditor and devising innovations like prepackaged bankruptcies whose details are negotiated before the debtor company walks through the courtroom doors.
Broker-dealers that have long specialized in distressed securities -- R. D. Smith and Seidler-Amdec are among the best known -- are now facing new competition from mainstream Wall Street firms. Serving them are computerized data services, like the Bankruptcy Datasource in Boston, and new publications like Bankruptcy Values, an institutional investment letter published by John C. Boland & Company in Baltimore, Turnarounds & Workouts, an industry newsletter published by the Beard Group in Washington, and The Turnaround Letter, put out by New Generation Investments in Boston.
The industry even has its own investor relations firms and transfer agents, like Donlin, Recano & Company of New York, specializing in Chapter 11 cases.
But while all this may give the investors in distressed securities more information and better liquidity, veteran bottom-fishers warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the fundamental riskiness of sailing into a recession in the leakiest boats in the fleet.

HEADLINE: TROUBLED TIMES ON WALL STREET: AS THE BEAR WANDERS, AN INDUSTRY REMAKES ITSELF;
Impact of Easing of Credit May Be Most Vital '91 Issue

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As bear markets go, this one so far has been much more alarming to the brokers than to the investors. But if the current recession ends up lasting longer, and going deeper, than is currently expected, that relatively happy outcome could change.
To be sure, 1990 was no fun for anyone involved in the stock market, with the possible exception of the short-sellers, who seek to profit from lower prices. For the first time since 1981, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a loss for a year, falling 6.6 percent before dividends. 
 In 1991, the most important issue for investors may be just how much impact the Fed's easing of interest rates has on the economy.
 
Rebound or Lag
 If it helps to shorten the recession by getting businesses and consumers to step up spending, then the rebound that began last October may be not just a bear-market rally but the beginning of a bull market. But if the pressures of debt, and the banks' new-found fear of bad loans, keep a lid on economic activity, then this bear market could have a way to go.
The carnage last year was worse for the brokerage industry than for investors. On Wall Street, the leveraged escapades of the 1980's left one big firm bankrupt and several others dependent on rich parents for capital infusions. With trading volume down and institutional commissions measured in pennies a share, few equity desks on Wall Street are making money. There are rumors of many more pink slips in this new year.
 
Worst Showing Since 1974
 Wall Street's problems are more accurately reflected in the performance of the vast majority of stocks, whose owners can only look at the narrower gauge of the S.& P. performance with jealousy. The Nasdaq composite, which measures stocks traded over the counter, fell 17.8 percent in 1990, its worst showing since it plunged 35.1 percent in 1974.
The dismal performance seems not to have concerned a lot of investors much. It has become commonplace to note that many institutions are invested a lot more bullishly than their managers talk, and individual investors poured money into stock mutual funds for almost the entire year, although there were reports of a slowdown in the final weeks of December. In the aftermath of the 1987 crash, many investors concluded that the crash created great investment opportunities, and that bottom-fishing mentality has remained alive.
Only a year ago, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that the economy was slowing, but a recession would be avoided. Now the general expectation is that there is a recession that began sometime this summer or fall, but that it will be relatively mild.
 
'A Complacent View'
 "I think investors now are taking a complacent view," said Abby Joseph Cohen, who began 1990 as chief investment strategist at now-bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and ended it with the title of co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs. "They think the recession will be short and sweet, but we don't know how much damage it will do to corporate profits."
Historically, stocks have performed poorly early in a recession, but have tended to rise in the last half of the downturn, as the market anticipates the recovery. Optimists have hoped that the rebound that began after most stocks bottomed in October might be evidence that the economic downturn will be a mild one, but Mrs. Cohen is among the analysts who think that the huge debt burden confronting corporate America may serve to extend this downturn.
Those who are pessimistic recall the 1973-74 recession, where large stocks also outperformed the market as a whole in the early going. In 1974, the S.& P. 500 fell by 17.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite was off 31.1 percent. The next year, the S.& P. dropped 29.7 percent, while the Nasdaq index plunged 35 percent.
 
Depressed Industries Lifted
 In 1990, big was best in stocks, and small was worst. Financial stocks were out of favor, and makers of consumer staples -- toothpaste and soft drinks and the like -- were the Wall Street darlings for their profits that kept rising despite economic problems. But the late rally tended to lift such depressed industries as banks and home builders more than other shares, though not nearly enough to allow them to break even for the year.
Among the major gauges, the Dow Jones industrial average, composed of only 30 large stocks, was the best performer for 1990. In July, long after indexes of smaller stocks had peaked, the Dow average topped 3,000 in several sessions, but never was able to close that high, hitting 2,999.75 on two occassions. But it started down even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, stirring war fears and driving up oil prices.
For the year, the Dow fell just 4.3 percent before dividends, and less than one percentage point if those payouts are included. The Dow gets the most publicity, and its action may help to explain the relative lack of investor reaction.
 
Index Up 2.9 Percent
 Of the 20 largest companies in market capitalization at the end of 1989, 11 saw their share prices rise in 1990, and a capitalization-weighted index of the 20 was up 2.9 percent.
By contrast, the Russell 2,000 measures the performance of the companies that rank from 1,001 to 3,000 in market capitalization. That index fell 21.5 percent in 1990.
For fans of small stocks, the recent past has been a dreary history of underperformance, beginning in the summer of 1983, when seven years of outperformance by the small stocks came to an abrupt end. The Nasdaq industrial index is down six-tenths of a percent from where it stood on June 24, 1983. By contrast, the Dow industrials are up 112.1 percent over that period.
But in the last couple of months of 1990, the losers early in the year started to do better. Some of the hardest-hit areas of the market rallied, among them the banks and the homebuilders. And the Russell 2,000 gained 11.2 percent in the final two months, while the S.& P. 500 added just 8.6 percent.
The average New York City bank stock fell 39.5 percent in 1990, but it was up 21.1 percent over the final two months. Regional banks, which had not fallen as far, also did not bounce as high. The Nadsdaq bank index, down 34.8 percent for the year, gained 7.7 percent in the final two months.
 
Expectations Confounded
 As 1990 began, the general expectation was for lower interest rates, but rates confounded those expectations and rose early in the year. Rates came down in late 1990 as the Federal Reserve tried to contain recessionary pressures, but long-term rates nonetheless were up for the year. The rate on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 7.97 percent a year ago, now is 8.29 percent. But the rate on three-month Treasury bills dropped from 7.60 percent to 6.44 percent.
The rise in long-term interest rates may help to explain the relatively poor performance of utility stocks. The Dow utility average was down 10.8 percent for the year, despite the reputation of the stocks as the kind to own in downturns.
Charles Clough, the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, argues that utilities now represent the best values in the market, simply because their dividends appear to be safe at a time when the pressures of debt and recession are likely to make many other companies cut payouts. "Income may be the thing that is in short supply in the 1990's," he said, forecasting that interest rates will decline sharply.
As it is, 1990 was one of the worst years for dividend payouts in recent years, although final figures are not in. The fact that many large companies did acceptably well helped overall dividend payments to rise, but more companies cut their payouts than in any year since 1982.

Credit Analysts Expect A Drop in Interest Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With the economy in recession and the Federal Reserve Board moving to prevent the downturn from being deep and prolonged, most credit market analysts anticipate that interest rates will fall, perhaps by a percentage point or more, in the first half of the new year.
After that, they expect rates to stabilize or move higher. 
 At the moment, the economic numbers and the Fed's determination give credence to those forecasts. Signs of weakness abound. The manufacturing sector is slipping badly, and showing few signs of resurgence. The construction and housing industries are on their knees. Real estate values in many parts of the country are sliding.
Perhaps most worrisome, the banking sector is in serious trouble. The borrowing binge of the 1980's has exhausted the capacity for leveraged economic growth, analysts said.
Above all, "this is a recession which is financially related," said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, primary dealers of Government securities. "The implications of that are possibly more serious and less clear, because the last time we had a financially related recession was in the 1930's."
 
Reason to Worry
 Edward J. Hyman Jr. vice chairman at C J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell, was blunt in his assessment.
"The economic climate is going to be bad," he said, "and Fed policy is the only tool we have to offset the downturn. But one of the things that troubles me most is that everybody else expects interest rates to come down. It is unusual for rates to perform in line with a strong consensus."
Based on recent history, Mr. Hyman has reason to worry.
A year ago, when the economy was merely soft and the Fed already beginning to ease monetary policy, most analysts forecast that interest rates would decline in the first half of the year. The prediction went awry, however: a bitterly cold winter pushed up inflation, and interest rates along with it, in the first six months of 1990. It was not until July that rates began to settle back down again.
Indeed, despite manifest evidence that the economy contracted sharply during the fourth quarter, 30-year Treasury bond yields were slightly higher at the end of last year, 8.29 percent, than they were when 1989 drew to a close, 7.97 percent.
Available economic evidence and the demonstrable willingness of the Federal Reserve to push down short-term interest rates make it unlikely that 1991 will be a repetition of the year just ended, economists said.
Since July the Fed has lowered the overnight Federal funds rate by 1.25 percentage points, to 7 percent and has shown a willingness to push it lower still. Analysts said that further declines will be necessary.
 
Reaction to War
 "For securities like those of the United States Government, weakness in the economy will drag those rates down, about one percentage point across the board by spring," said Neil M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "That might be enough to stop the economy from falling any further."
Almost certainly, however, there will be bumps along the way.
Most immediately there is Saddam Hussein, and the attendant uncertainty about the consequences of a shooting war in the Persian Gulf.
The outbreak of war and a disruption in oil supplies from the region would undoubtedly push up interest rates and rekindle inflation fears, which over the last few months have been evaporating. The size of the market's reaction to open warfare would depend completely on the conflict's duration and the extent of the damage done to oilfields in the gulf states.
There is also the chance, however small, that the economy is not as weak as it currently appears. Fourth-quarter output contracted sharply, almost all private analysts say. But planned-for increases in auto production during the first quarter of 1991 could generate a recovery of sorts, and push up interest rates a bit.
"At some point in the first half of 1991, and perhaps sooner rather than later, we could see an uptick in the economy," Mr. Kelly of Lanston said.
 
'Trouble and Stagnation'
 "Those periods will be accompanied by a sharp upward correction in interest rates," he added. "I am a proponent of significant declines in interest rates over time. But it is not going to happen in a straight line."
Given the current state of the economy, modest upticks in activity should be regarded as an aberration, analysts said.
"At best, this will be a year of continued trouble and stagnation," said Gail Fosler, chief economist at The Conference Board.
Reflecting that view, the consensus forecast of 52 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in mid-December was that the economy would expand at a mere three-tenths of 1 percent rate from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. Almost half of those surveyed projected zero growth or an outright contraction.
The next 12 months will be a period when corporations, states and municipalities, all facing cash flow problems and huge amounts of outstanding obligations, try to start digging themselves out. But only the most creditworthy will be able to begin the task, analysts said, even if interest rates fall further.
"It used to be ratings were the only thing that mattered" in the corporate bond market, said Jessica Palmer, a managing director and head of the capital markets department at Salomon Brothers. "Now the market is thinking more about companies that will survive recession."
 
Concerns Among Investors
 Banking companies, whose bonds were hammered in 1990 as investors became increasingly aware of the extent of their problems, provide a case in point.
Last year banks issued just $4.5 billion in debt, said Robert A. Schwartz, a vice president and senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, about one-third the $13.7 billion in securities sold in 1989.
"There will continue to be a lot of quality concerns among investors," Mr. Schwartz said, "as a consequence, a lot of cyclically sensitive corporate borrowers won't find the market terribly receptive to new debt."
Still, Mr. Schwartz and Ms. Palmer agree that stable or lower interest rates will lead to a flood of new corporate debt issues during the early months of the new year.
Importantly, much of that new issuance could represent a refinancing of old securities, many carrying much higher interest rates. That development, if it happens, would help to reliquify corporate balance sheets.
 
Refinancing High-Cost Debt
 "Under $12 billion in corporate debt was called last year, down from $17.5 billion in 1989," Mr. Schwartz said. "I look for this to rise to about $25 billion this year. But if we don't get the rate drop and we have a shooting war, that will only serve to exacerbate the deterioration in corporate balance sheets."
Efforts to refinance high-cost debt will also be a feature of the tax-exempt municipal bond market this year.
"Perhaps as much as $25 billion to $30 billion worth of bonds originally issued in 1981 will be called this year," said George Friedlander, a managing director and fixed income strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
"And that number will increase as we move into the mid-1990's. Between now and 1995 $200 billion worth of bonds, or more than 20 percent of the entire municipal bond market, will be called."
As in the corporate bond market, Mr. Friedlander said a deep or prolonged recession would put further pressure on the credit quality of most states and municipalities, many of which already face severe financial problems. Debt issued by those who weather the problems best will carry much lower interest rates than those who experience real trouble.
"Quality spreads should widen," he said.
 
Defaults at a Record Clip
 Conditions in the market for high-yield "junk" bonds figure to improve in 1991, if only because it is difficult to imagine how they could get much worse.
With defaults running at a record clip, new issuance in the market dried up. A declining stock market and a weakening economy made a disastrous year even worse.
As a consequence, by the end of 1990 the difference between yields on 10-year Treasury notes and an index of 336 high-yield bonds compiled by the First Boston Corporation had widened to a record 11.05 percentage points, from 7.75 percentage points at the end of 1989. By the end of last year, the bonds in the First Boston index had an average yield of 18.97 percent, up from just over 15 percent at the end of 1989.
Even so, at negative 6 percent the return on high-yield bonds was no worse than on the Standard & Poor's 500 index, said Robert Long, director of high-yield research at the First Boston Corporation.
"This year is a recession year," Mr. Long said, "so high-yield bonds will probably not be leading the charge into the next bull market. But it is not an overstatement to say the high-yield market is oversold."

HEADLINE: Prime Is Cut By the Bank Of America

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Bank of America said late on Monday that it was cutting its prime rate to 9.5 percent, from 10 percent. It was the first of the nation's 10 largest banks to reduce its prime lending rate in the wake of several credit-easing measures by the Federal Reserve Board.
Bank of America, based in San Francisco, is the nation's third-largest banking company. 
 A handful of smaller lenders have reduced their prime rates in the last several weeks, the largest of which was the First National Bank of Chicago, No. 13 in the nation, which trimmed its rate on Dec. 20.
Banking analysts said yesterday that the big New York-based banks might not be quick to follow suit, as they try to profit from the difference between their borrowing costs and the interest borrowers pay them.
"The important banks are the New York banks," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, a New York consulting firm.
Many New York banks "are perceived to be more financially pressed than other large regional banks," he said. By delaying cutting the prime rate, banks are trying to bolster their balance sheets, which have been weakened by bad real estate loans as well as losses on loans to Third World countries.
At most of the nation's banks, the prime rate has held steady at 10 percent since Jan. 8, 1990, when it was lowered from 10.5 percent.
Although large corporations negotiate rates on their bank loans, the prime rate is a closely watched barometer of interest rates because rates charged to smaller businesses and many consumer loans are pegged to it. Small businesses generally pay interest rates a few percentage points above the prime. Many home equity loans and credit card loans carry interest rates that are adjusted according to changes in the prime.
 
Cut in Discount Rate
 A day before First Chicago reduced its lending rate, the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate, its loan fee to financial institutions, to 6.5 percent from 7 percent. It was the first cut in that key rate since August 1986. The Fed has also gradually been lowering the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another on overnight loans.
New York banks may be waiting to see how the Fed responds to the coming report on the nation's jobless rate. The Labor Department is scheduled to release December unemployment data on Friday.
Several analysts say they expect the Fed to trim the Federal funds rate if the unemployment report is particularly weak.
"If the Fed eases the Fed funds, then we will see some money-center banks cut prime," Mr. Chandler said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
TOP BUSH ADVISERS CALLED IN TO MEET ON IRAQ STRATEGY

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
President Bush met with senior advisers tonight to discuss the military and political strategies for the final push leading to the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, Administration officials said.
"We are going to start to talk about what we are going to do," a senior Administration official said before the meeting. "This is the first time the whole team will be back together since Dec. 18 to compare notes and review the whole range of strategic issues." 
 The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the meeting was not prompted by any particular development but that Mr. Bush wanted to review the situation and get updates from those who had recently visited the gulf region, including Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell. Vice President Dan Quayle is currently touring the gulf area.
 
Meetings Begin Early
 Also attending the dinner at the White House were Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu. The dinner meeting broke up after about an hour and a half and no statement was issued.
Mr. Bush had scheduled a meeting with the same advisers for Wednesday, and it came as something of a surprise when he returned to Washington this afternoon and summoned them. The talks came amid increasing speculation about efforts to resolve the crisis, although there is no firm indication that American-Iraqi negotiations are taking place. But a peace initiative may emerge from a European Community meeting scheduled for Friday.
The senior official said the discussions, which are expected to continue on Wednesday, would focus on whether it would be useful to dispatch Mr. Baker on another tour of the gulf and Europe in the next week or two. He would seek to coordinate military and diplomatic policies and insure that the international alliance is firm.
 
Occupation of Iraq on Agenda
 The discussions will also involve how to deal with Iraq after the crisis is resolved, including how best to check its nuclear-weapons potential, the official said. And he noted that there is also the possibility of an allied military occupation of the country.
Also on the agenda will be how the Administration can best consult with Congress, which begins its 102d session on Thursday.
Mr. Cheney, General Powell and Mr. Quayle were expected to sum up their recent trips to the Persian Gulf, giving their assessments of the readiness of the international force and the willingness of gulf allies to grant further financial aid to the coalition effort.
The senior official said there was no reason at the moment to expect that Mr. Baker would travel to Baghdad to meet with President Saddam Hussein if he tours the region. The official said the prospects for a Baker tour of the gulf were "good, but nothing firm has been decided." If it is decided to send Mr. Baker, an announcement will probably be made by Friday.
The official said the main objective of Mr. Baker's trip would be "to hold the coalition together, to seek a peaceful solution, and if Saddam Hussein fails to accept the message that he must unconditionally leave Kuwait, we want to consider the use of force."
If he should make the trip, Mr. Baker, as he has in the past, would request new financing, especially from Saudi Arabia and the exiled Government of Kuwait, to pay for the deployment of 400,000 American military personnel in the region and relieve the economic burdens of Egypt, Turkey and other developing nations that have contributed military units or suffered by honoring the international economic sanctions against Iraq.
 
Iraq in 'a Regional Structure'
 Mr. Baker would also take with him preliminary Administration thoughts on Iraq's position in the Middle East following either a diplomatic or forced resolution of the crisis.
"We have to consider how Iraq will fit into a regional structure," the official said. "And if they withdraw peacefully, how to put their military structure better in balance with the rest of the region." The Administration and its allies have expressed the concern that even if Iraq were to withdraw peacefully from Kuwait, it would remain a potentiallly dangerous political power with some of the most sophisticated weapons in the Middle East.
Administration officials have said they realize that an occupation of a defeated Iraq would not only be costly but also could leave American forces open to guerrilla attack.
A State Department official said the Administration hopes to avoid an occupation of Iraq, preferring to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait and possibly replace Mr. Hussein with a more moderate leader.
"The main problem is that many Arab countries have indicated already that if we should cross the border into Iraq, that it would be a whole new ball game," the official said. "There have been indications that if there were fighting inside Iraq, there could be a rising up of emotions and public demonstrations all over the Arab world."
 
Parrying Congressional Criticism
 Mr. Bush and his advisers will also plan how best to consult with Congress without restricting the Administration's authority and options. Mr. Bush is due to meet with Congressional leaders on Thursday, and he will urge them to refrain from criticism that Mr. Hussein might perceive as a wavering of American resolve.
The President is also expected to assure them that he is making every effort to seek a peaceful solution and that he has not lost all hope that Iraq might still withdraw from Kuwait.
A White House spokesman said he was not aware of any reconsideration of previously stated Administration policy not to request a resolution from Congress similar to the one adopted by the United Nations Security Council authorizing the use of force to remove Iraq from Kuwait. And Congressional officials have said that no such resolution was planned.
The leaders said earlier in the week that Americans would not support a war until they had been persuaded that all opportunities for a peaceful settlement had been exhausted. The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, made it clear that they would like to see further efforts to arrange a Baker-Hussein meeting beyond the Thursday date proposed by the White House.
 
A Prediction by Quayle
 JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 1 (AP) -- Vice President Dan Quayle told United States forces today that "1991 will be the year Saddam Hussein gets out of Kuwait."
He advised sailors on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and later pilots at a desert air base in southwestern Saudi Arabia not to listen to "the naysayers" and proclaimed that "the American people are behind you."
Mr. Quayle began the new year by having breakfast with sailors on the Kennedy and speaking to personnel on the flight deck.
He also met with a group of Kuwaiti pilots who now fly F-1 Mirage fighter-bombers. Mr. Quayle then traveled to Taif, Saudi Arabia, where he met the deposed Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
Mr. Quayle told the Emir that as the American military presence grows, more money will be needed from allies to help pay for it. The Emir did not object to Mr. Quayle's request for greater support, an American official said.

HEADLINE: TROUBLED TIMES ON WALL STREET: AS THE BEAR WANDERS, AN INDUSTRY REMAKES ITSELF;
Wall Street Paring Down To the Basics

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Wall Street's painful shift from the takeover era to the hangover era is not over, but the securities industry last year finally started making the tough choices to transform itself into a smaller and healthier industry.
The change under way goes well beyond laying off thousands of workers and cutting back salaries and bonuses for Wall Street's survivors. Instead, financial executives and analysts see a reordering of their industry, with the investment houses adopting new strategies and attitudes. 
 The Wall Street houses, the executives and analysts predict, should emerge from their difficult times as smaller and more specialized firms. Each will choose its strengths and then focus on those businesses -- retail brokerage, investment banking, foreign exchange or whatever. More and more firms are likely to cooperate by forming joint ventures to save costs, like merging the back-office clerical work. And the logic of joint operations is expected to go even further with stronger firms combining with weaker ones, thus reducing the number of brokerage houses.
 
Focus on Traditional Role
 Moreover, financial executives see the Wall Street attitude toward their basic role changing. In the heady 1980's, deal making was all -- set up a takeover, collect the multi-million-dollar fees and get on to the next deal. But with the takeover binge over, Wall Street firms are returning to their roots to focus on the traditional investment banker's role of serving as a trusted adviser to corporate clients.
"Wall Street is probably coming back to a basic reality from the insanity of the 80's," said Felix G. Rohatyn, an investment banker with Lazard Freres & Company. "It is supposed to provide a service and not just sell a product."
In 1991, the financial community enters its fourth year of recession, a collapse that began with the 1987 market crash. The troubles intensified last year, sometimes frighteningly so, as one firm after another collapsed or teetered on the brink of insolvency. Essentially, with several top firms requiring bailouts from their parents in 1990, the financial advisers for America went bankrupt.
Today, the American securities industry employs about 60,000 fewer people than it did before the crash, putting the total at about 200,000, close to the level of employment in 1984. But industry executives say the years of cutbacks are likely to continue in the early 1990's, with thousands more layoffs required for financial reasons, and improving technology making large numbers of jobs obsolete.
Although Wall Street firms have been trimming their operations for years, the fundamental change began in earnest last year, as Street executives shelved their egos and optimistic expectations. Over the last year, business principles preached by Wall Street firms to their clients in the 1980's were finally applied to themselves: Prune back excess capacity, limit perquisites and focus on core businesses.
"What's going on right now on Wall Street is a change that is very much structural and not cyclical at all," said Thomas Carroll, the director of the securities industry in New York for KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm. "The Wall Street that is rebuilt after this hurricane has gone through is going to be a much different kind of an animal than we have seen in the past."
 
Preparation for New Growth
 Most Wall Street executives insist that the new order will be more healthy for the securities industry and the nation's economy in the long run. "There is excess capacity and these adjustments must happen," said James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of the American Express Company, which owns the firm that is now named Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "But as they do, there will be a healthier, sounder money and capital market environment and the institutions will be better off for it."
Indeed, analysts say the painful retrenchment is preparing the industry to grow again when the American economy and its financial markets strengthen.
"These layoffs are certainly painful and disruptive to a lot of people's lives, but what is left after the pruning is still very substantial," said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School. "The firms are protecting the seed corn for the next upturn."
The globalization of the world's main financial markets and new competition from commercial banks are forcing change as well. The globalization trend, analysts say, is likely to result in more links between American and foreign firms, such as between Credit Suisse and CS First Boston. And several money center banks, like J. P. Morgan, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, are expressing eagerness to expand further into the securities business, and as the likelihood for global financial liberalization grows, the possibility of larger competition from such institutions is becoming more tangible.
 
One Shock After Another
 In 1990, the view that the securities industry is unavoidably destined for sweeping change became widely, if grudgingly, accepted on Wall Street. Few senior brokerage executives now speak about being saved by a market rebound, as they had in earlier years, and returning to the fast-money days of the 1980's.
"What everyone has caught onto this year is that the 1980's were the exception," one senior investment banker at a large firm said. "This is what the business can really be like, for an extended time."
The acceptance of the true depth of Wall Street's problems came after it received one sharp shock after another last year. At the beginning of the year, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the powerhouse of 1980's, disappeared from Wall Street's radar screen overnight, filing for protection from its creditors.
Other firms, including Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., now Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and the First Boston Corporation, faltered badly, requiring bailouts by their corporate parents. Prudential Bache Securities Inc. also needed an end-of-the-year capital infusion from its parent, the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
"Drexel was a watershed event, but it was not isolated," said Daniel P. Tully, the president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch & Company.
 
Trouble at the Bottom Line
 Merrill was among a number of firms, including Prudential Bache and Shearson, that were forced to take losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for restructurings of their businesses to overcome mistakes of the 1980's.
The troubles showed clearly on the bottom line. Through June, profits for all members of the New York Stock Exchange barely broke $200 million, which a few years ago would not have been considered a decent-sized bond issue. By the end of September, profits had fallen even further to just $22 million, less than some individual bonuses paid by Drexel in 1989.
The steady stream of bad news shook Wall Street executives out of their confidence that they could continue to pay high fixed costs for real estate and employees in the hopes that market conditions would improve. Still, the structural changes needed to allow most firms to operate profitably have apparently just begun.
Productivity levels per employee are about $10,000 lower than the peak levels for core securities revenue, and while transaction volume has declined significantly, back-office costs have not, according to Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., a management consultant.
But several firms have decided what they cannot afford to do. Prudential Bache abandoned much of its failed investment banking effort, as well as its risk arbitrage division. Shearson began to combine its huge back office operation with another firm to decrease costs. And firms that had charged into once juicy businesses such as high yield "junk bonds" beat a quick retreat.
 
New Focus on Nurturing
 "Wall Street is saner, and it is not as ego driven as it was," said George L. Ball, the chairman of Prudential Bache. "Firms such as ours are more concentrated on the things that they do to competitive advantage."
The turmoil on Wall Street has also brought a new focus on nurturing stable relationships with corporate clients -- a sharp break with the prevailing mentality of the 1980's when investment banks often seemed willing to side with anyone if the fee was large enough.
In a speech to securities industry professionals late last year, William H. Donaldson, the new chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, said that clients of the firms were expressing dissatisfaction with the service they received in recent years. "They want us to get back to basics." Mr. Donaldson said.
Indeed, Wall Street executives said that the industry in general failed to remember client needs in the 1980's. "There was not enough focus on clients at too many firms," Mr. Tully of Merrill said. "There were too many with transactional, short-term one-shot approaches. Some of that short-term thinking hopefully will be set aside and the world will come back to sanity and understand the underlying principles and credos of our business."

Why Only a Few Big Airlines Prosper in a Deregulated Sky

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Continental, Pan Am, T.W.A., Midway: The list of distressed airlines reduced to selling precious assets, courting merger partners or throwing themselves on the mercy of bankruptcy courts grows ever longer.
The run-up in oil prices just as the economy was slouching toward recession has certainly compounded the industry's problems. But many economists, including some who were early champions of deregulation, now believe that the resulting cash squeeze merely hastened the inevitable trend toward consolidation. 
 Like many industry experts, Michael Levine, the former president of New York Air, who is now dean of the Yale School of Management, says there may simply not be room for more than five or six huge national airlines. "We thought the industry would be full of hungry piranhas," he said. "It turns out this is shark and tuna country."
But what is bad news for weaker airlines is not necessarily bad for consumers. Competition, argues Daniel Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House, a consulting firm in Boston, depends on the number of carriers vying for passengers on each route. And in spite of industry consolidation, the percentage of travelers with a choice is greater than ever.
In 1978, Mr. Kasper notes, 17 percent of all passengers had a choice of three or more airlines on the route they were seeking to fly. In 1984, when new carriers were flying highest, 61 percent could choose among three or more. And in 1988, in spite of growing concentration, the figure had reached 65 percent. The increased choice available, however, comes with the drawback of far fewer direct flights to many destinations.
The key to preserving the increased flight frequency that business travelers value and the low fares that have made American vacationers so mobile, many experts say, is preserving route flexibility for the airlines that do survive. While each analyst has a different list of fixes, most agree on two. Airlines need assured access to the big city airports where landing rights and gates are scarcest. And they need the right to make alliances with financially strong foreign carriers eager to expand into the American market.
Permitting investment by foreign airlines could bring the bonus of greater competition on international routes. For as the price of foreign entry, Washington may well be able to open Europe, Canada and, eventually, Asia and Latin America, to United States carriers hungry to gain market share by slashing fares.
Today, the rules for flying on most international routes are set by bilateral government agreements. In most cases these limit the number of airlines and, typically, the number of weekly flights. Such agreements protect inefficient Latin American, Japanese, French, British and Italian airlines, and in the process generate windfall profits for more efficient United States carriers designated by Washington to serve the routes. Not surprisingly, such restrictions mean crowded aircraft and very high fares -- often twice the rates charged Americans on transcontinental routes of comparable length.
Twelve years after the regulators acted to open competition, the American airline industry has taken on the look of a battlefield near the end of a terrible war of attrition. The corpses of regional carriers -- Western, North Central, Empire, Ozark, Muse, Air California, Frontier, PSA, Piedmont, Air Florida, Presidential, Southern and Republic -- litter the ground. They are gone, swallowed by larger airlines that coveted their planes and airport gates. People Express, the upstart airline that broke all the rules, and Braniff, revived briefly by the Pritzker family of Chicago, have skidded into oblivion.
Eastern, after two decades of labor strife, has retreated to its last stronghold, in Atlanta, after selling its highly successful East Coast shuttle and its lucrative Latin American routes. Pan Am is also living off the proceeds of asset sales while it searches for a sugar daddy. And the survival of three smaller airlines, Midway, America West and Hawaiian, is far from assured.
Carl C. Icahn, the swashbuckling financier who gained control of T.W.A. in a leveraged buyout in 1985, has plenty of cash and an undisguised ambition to buy -- or be bought out. But T.W.A. is burdened by heavy debts, aging aircraft and a hub in St. Louis that originates relatively little traffic. Few analysts are betting on the airline's survival.
Three strong, profitable national airlines -- American, United and Delta -- are left, as well as three weaker ones -- Northwest, USAir and Continental. Edward Starkman, an analyst at Paine Webber, notes that a few regional carriers -- Southwest, Alaska, Midwest Express -- still make money, but only by avoiding confrontation with the majors.
The airline industry as a whole is dogged by excess capacity, the product of the long-held view that only those that expand the fastest will make it. Delta Air Lines, a conservative and generally successful airline, has seen traffic stagnate this year, even as available seats rose by 6 percent.
 
Theory
 
Big Expectations For Deregulation
All these shifts have proved a rude surprise to early proponents of deregulation, who believed that the national industry would thrive on the no-holds-barred competition that worked so well to reduce fares and improve service in unregulated Texas and California in the 1960's.
"We thought an airplane was nothing but a marginal cost with wings," said Alfred Kahn, the economist who, as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1970's, presided over a braintrust of deregulators whose familiarity with economic jargon exceeded their knowledge of the nuts-and-bolts of the airline business.
It was assumed that airlines would be quick to enter and leave routes as demand for service fluctuated. Established carriers could never gouge consumers because they would be challenged by new ones, which needed only a few million dollars and a few leased aircraft to go into business. Indeed, carriers of the pre-deregulation era would be especially vulnerable to competition because they were locked into expensive union contracts.
But economists underestimated the ingenuity of the big carriers -- most notably, American -- in guarding their traditional markets and swamping competitors in new ones. Computerized reservation systems, vital to every travel agent operating in a world of multiple fares and rapidly changing routes, allowed American and United, the owners of the biggest systems, to keep track of rivals and charge hefty fees to competitors. Frequent-flier programs, promising disproportionately large rewards to the most tireless business passengers, bought the loyalty of the travelers who were least sensitive to high fares.
Many economists also missed the implications of the rapid evolution of hub-and-spoke route systems. Once freed from regulation, virtually every carrier discovered it could keep more planes flying more hours each day and fill a higher percentage of the seats by basing all flights out of one or two airports.
That meant far fewer nonstop flights, perhaps the most common complaint about air travel in the deregulated era. It is no longer possible, for example, to fly to Toledo from New York without a stop in Pittsburgh, Cleveland or Dayton, Ohio. But the hubs also assured frequent service; today there are an incredible 14 daily connections from New York to this city of 350,000 people.
Toledo is no exception. A 1986 study by Steven Morrison of Northeastern University and Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution showed that much of the estimated $12 billion consumers saved from deregulation (in today's dollars) came from this vastly increased choice of flights.
The catch, Mr. Levine notes, is that hubs generated far greater economies for big carriers. More flights to more cities makes it possible for an airline to offer convenient connections for travelers. Once a carrier is committed to a hub, there is a compelling economic logic to adding flights through the hub. That is why almost every important airport is now dominated by a single airline.
A small carrier cannot easily go with the hub flow by scheduling parallel flights to a giant's; travelers seem to dislike changing airlines en route. Even commuter airlines with monopoly routes from hubs to small cities have discovered that it pays to borrow the corporate identity of a major carrier -- hence the rise of American Eagle, United Express, Delta Connection and Northwest Airlink and others which share the names of their large partners but are independently owned.
 
Competition
 
Smaller Airlines No Longer Needed
Despite their worries about high oil prices, most airline executives are wary of seeking help from Big Brother -- a release of oil from the Government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, for example, to depress the price of jet fuel. Robert Aronson, the head of the Air Transport Association, notes that the industry as a whole has not endorsed Government intervention beyond the level of jawboning.
Washington is implicitly subsidizing the weaker carriers by allowing them to sell valuable rights granted without charge by the Government. But Mr. Levine worries that while such asset sales give the weak a few more months' respite from the creditors, the long-term effect will be a less competitive market. For example, he sees little public merit in Midway's sale of gates at Philadelphia to USAir, which already dominates the only hub in eastern Pennsylvania.
One reason that experts are less than alarmed about the fate of smaller airlines is that they no longer see them as critical to competition. Mr. Morrison and Mr. Winston discern no trend in fares or profits that would suggest the big carriers have much power to charge monopoly prices.
Fares are indeed historically high on short flights, where regulation served as a rigid cap on airline pricing policies. But on average, they estimate, fares are 18 percent below the "standard industry fare level," the formula used by regulators to set tariffs before 1978.
What has saved consumers -- apart from the chronic overcapacity -- is the fact that fares are largely driven by competition on individual routes. Even carriers with hammerlocks on their own hubs must still compete with airlines that fly the same routes through other hubs. Des Moines, for example, has no nonstop service from Los Angeles. But travelers have a choice of America West, United and T.W.A., which among them offer flights through Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and St. Louis. If they need more choices, American offers connections through Chicago and Northwest through Minneapolis.
The only travelers who are apparently paying consistently higher fares are residents of cities that have become hubs for single carriers. In compensation, Mr. Winston says, they have a windfall in nonstop service, to distant small cities and even abroad. Travelers from Raleigh, N.C., where American Airlines has a hub, have a choice of three nonstop flights a day to Albany; three to Daytona Beach, Fla.; three to Harrisburg, Pa.; three to Providence, R.I., and one a day to Paris.
 
Problems
 
Some Restraint Is Called For
None of these trends imply, though, that competition could not be increased by a well-financed secondary carrier hungry to expand -- or seriously undermined by the failure of a major carrier. That is why most economists would like see the Government ease entry to new markets.
Mr. Levine of Yale would prohibit the airlines that own computer reservation systems from requiring travel agents to use just one system. If travel agents were free to shop around the computers, he argues, competition among the systems would curb the booking rates the systems could charge to have-not carriers. And it would inhibit subtler forms of discrimination that some airline experts say have made it difficult for have-nots to break into new markets.
Mr. Kahn worries that airport authorities are being pressed to protect their dominant carriers in return for guaranteed financing of airport improvements. At the very least he would increase antitrust surveillance over questionable financing arrangements, like the one between USAir and the Pittsburgh authority that requires the abandonment of the old terminal when a new one is completed.
A broader problem, most analysts argue, is access to crowded airports like Washington's National and Chicago's O'Hare, which are forced to ration landing rights. Many other airports -- including those in Atlanta and Philadelphia, for example -- have no spare gate capacity.
It is possible for a new airline to buy into a full airport. Since 1986 the Transportation Department has permitted carriers to buy and sell the right to, say, land at LaGuardia Airport in the same way that developers buy and sell land. This policy, in effect, assures that markets rather than bureaucrats determine who values access the most. Similarly, and less controversially, long-term leases on airport gates are freely traded.
But the expense and delay involved in adding routes to the nation's most crowded airports is still an anti-competitive barrier. The best way to reduce it, contends Mr. Winston of the Brookings Institution, would be to ration scarce landing rights with high peak-hour charges, and then use the revenue to expand airport and air traffic control capacity. The direct benefits in reduced travel time and lower aircraft operating costs, Mr. Winston estimates, would exceed $10 billion a year. The indirect benefits of increasing competition would be pure gravy.
Not surprisingly, though, the airlines that already control scarce landing rights have no interest in paying for them. Nor do private plane owners, who have lobbied fiercely against congestion-related fees.
 
Foreigners
 
Exchanging Cash For New Access
A very different and perhaps more politically acceptable means of beefing up competition would be to encourage foreign investment. A number of United States airlines are already partially financed by foreigners -- notably Continental (SAS), Northwest (KLM) and America West (Ansett of Australia). But Federal law prohibits both foreign control and ownership in excess of 25 percent. The biggest losers are USAir and Northwest, which are reportedly eager to make foreign alliances that would allow them to go head to head with American, United and Delta.
Mr. Levine favors outright repeal of the prohibition for the airlines of countries that accept wide-open competition on international routes.
Clark Onstad, a former regulator who later was a vice president of Continental, says he thinks such ambitious change will have to wait until 1992, when the European Community drops its internal trade barriers and is better prepared to cut grand deals on air transport. But according to Mr. Kasper there is more immediate pressure for simpler, case-by-case liberalization of foreign investment restrictions.
British regulators are reportedly reluctant to approve the requested transfer of landing rights at London's crowded Heathrow Airport from Pan Am and T.W.A. to American and United, two strong airlines that would give British Airways a far tougher run for its money on North Atlantic routes. The likely price for approval of those deals is a chance for British Airways to buy into a United States carrier that could feed it trans-Atlantic traffic -- a move that might be possible without legislation if the Bush Administration were inclined to fudge the issue of control.
Pressure is also building for a deal that transforms the United States and Canada into a single airline market. American carriers would probably settle for deregulating flights between the countries. But Air Canada is reportedly opposed because it could not establish an efficient hub on its side of the border. The price of open competition, much desired by some American carriers, may well be an agreement to allow Air Canada to merge with a United States airline.
Competition in the airline business is hardly dying. But its character is certainly changing rapidly. The unanswered question is whether Washington is up to the task of protecting consumers in the melee.

Perestroika For Renters

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WITH New York real estate in the dumps and unoccupied condos flooding the rental market, could the city's 43-year-old "emergency" rent controls be vulnerable?
Peter Salins, a professor of urban planning at Hunter College and co-author of a new analysis of rent regulation, is not particularly optimistic. He fears that middle- and upper-income renters in Manhattan, who benefit at the expense of almost everyone else in New York City, still call the shots in Albany. 
 But Mr. Salins, writing in NY, the conservative Manhattan Institute's journal of city affairs, offers plenty of evidence that rent control is no defense against gentrification. And he notes that the simplest of compromises, deregulation of vacant apartments, could leave both renters and landlords better off. The trickiest part to formulating a deal, he suggests, is persuading the tenant lobby to abandon the pretense that it is championing the interests of the poor.
To most economists rent control is the poisoned apple, a seductive idea that undermines the symbiosis between free people and free markets. Rent is the largest item in the budgets of most people. Thus in a city of renters, rent control is bound to be popular. No one, after all, wants to pay more than they must for housing. And hardly anyone thinks it is fair to ask people to move just because others are willing and able to pay more to live in their homes.
The catch, which New Yorkers have been slower to accept than Poles or Nicaraguans, is that prices determined by government rather than by supplyand demand are bound to distort economic incentives and erode productivity. And when the controls affect a big-ticket item like housing for a very long time, the damage is likely to be serious.
Landlords who cannot raise the rent skimp on quality: Only New Yorkers take for granted that professionals with graduate degrees on their resumes and Volvos in the corner garage still live in grime-coated buildings with exposed plumbing and 70-year-old boilers. According to the Census Bureau, the heating is broken in 26 percent of New York's rental apartments, compared with just 9 percent in Chicago.
But subtler misincentives, say Mr. Salins and his co-author, the economist Gerard Mildner, may generate greater distortions. Once ensconced in apartments with rents far below market rates, tenants become lifers in a prison for the privileged. Thousands of six- and seven-room apartments in space-short New York are occupied by retirees who cannot afford to make way for large families.
True believers shrug off such distortions: It's asmall price to pay to keep New York affordable for long-time residents with modest incomes. But according to a 1989 study by Henry Pollakowski at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, the average rent on controlled apartments is only $44, or 15 percent, below the average uncontrolled rent.
Only in Manhattan -- really only below 110th Street -- where controlled rents average about $400 below uncontrolled rents, does the system bite. Not surprisingly, almost all the windfall goes to the affluent. By the city's own accounting, the richest 10 percent of renters in 1987 paid 13 percent of their incomes to their landlords, while the poorest 10th paid 58 percent.
It is naive to assume that such truths could make New Yorkers free. Renters paying $181.16 a month for three bedrooms with riv vu are not about to give up their sinecures without a fight. And it is a truism of democratic societies that a thousand well-organized people with a clearly defined interest have the power to veto change that is mildly desired by millions. The real question is whether government is up to the task of arranging a way for landlords to buy out tenants.
Mr. Salins's preferred route is "vacancy decontrol" -- eliminating controls when tenants move voluntarily. That would create a market for the right to charge free-market rents; a landlord could, in effect, buy back an apartment from a tenant who had mobilized state power to confiscate a portion of the property.
The problem with vacancy decontrol, Mr. Salins says, is that it "would unmask the property rights issue." Those who settled for a handful of silver could no longer assert that they were fighting to save mixed-income neighborhoods from a blight of yuppies. And if the ideological justification for rent control were lost, the whole logic of allowing the luckiest renters to walk away with their windfalls might unravel.

HEADLINE: 45 CREDIT UNIONS AND BANKS SHUT BY RHODE ISLAND

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The new Governor of Rhode Island yesterday ordered the immediate closing of 45 state-chartered banks and credit unions until they have arranged Federal insurance for their deposits.
Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun took the step after a private insurance fund ran low on money to guarantee the institutions' deposits and asked to be taken over. 
 "I am declaring a bank emergency in Rhode Island," Mr. Sundlun said in a statement issued a few hours after taking office.
The 45 institutions, about three dozen of them credit unions, were closed by the Governor have a total of $1.7 billion in deposits, in 300,000 accounts. Depositors will not have access to their money until the banks and credit unions reopen.
All but two institutions have already applied for Federal insurance, the Governor said. He said the other two were essentially inactive.
 
Reopening Possible This Week
 Some closed institutions are expected to open later this week, with Federal deposit insurance, David E. Preston, Governor Sundlun's communications director, said. Others will probably not reopen as quickly, he said.
L. William Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C., said last night that his agency's examiners had been visiting the privately insured Rhode Island banks for several weeks. He said the agency would offer insurance only to those institutions that meet its standards for financial stability and would not impose any additional burdens on the agency or its members.
"Obviously given the problems here, there will be some institutions that will not qualify," Mr. Seidman said, adding that the state of Rhode Island would have to decide what to do with them.
In the worst possible case, some financial institutions could be liquidated and depositors might not recover all of their money. Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. would not step in to cover any losses that depositors may face.
Mr. Seidman said the demise of the Rhode Island fund was of particular concern because it involved a large number of accounts in a state with a population of one million. The failure, he said, "is one of the largest we've seen in several decades," and appears to involve more depositors than failures of private deposit insurers in Maryland and Ohio nearly six years ago.
Mr. Seidman also suggested that the Rhode Island fund's troubles showed that Federal deposit insurance was needed to protect small depositors who are not likely to keep track of the soundness of their banks.
Most states began requiring Federal insurance for state-chartered banks after the troubles with private insurance in Ohio and Maryland. But many credit unions are still privately insured, including the three dozen in Rhode Island that were shut yesterday. Another 130 credit unions in neighboring Massachusetts are insured by a private fund.
Mr. Preston noted that Rhode Island had a large budget deficit and had not yet decided whether it could afford to cover any losses that depositors might suffer if any of the 45 institutions were forced to close permanently for lack of insurance.
"We will do whatever we can do prudently to help the depositors," he said.
Rhode Island is also home to 38 financial institutions, including some large commercial banks. They are insured either by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration and are not affected by the Governor's order.
Rhode Island officials are also discussing the situation with the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston and the National Credit Union Administration.
 
A Troubled Industry
 The announcement in Rhode Island comes amid growing troubles for the nation's banking industry. Many institutions face potentially huge losses on real estate loans and are announcing reductions in dividends and staff layoffs.
But the problems in Rhode Island, while likely to contribute to the general public anxiety about the soundness of banks, do not directly reflect the same issues.
The state's troubles apparently began in early November, when the Heritage Loan and Investment Company, a two-branch bank in Providence, failed. Its deposits were insured by the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Fund, which also insures the deposits in the 45 state-chartered institutions that Governor Sundlun shut yesterday. The fund distributed much of its reserves to Heritage's depositors.
The bank's president, Joseph Mollicone Jr., has since been missing and has been accused of embezzlement in state and Federal arrest warrants.
The insurance fund's directors met on Monday, and yesterday they asked the state to name a conservator to direct its operations. Mr. Preston, the Governor's aide, said this effectively meant that the fund would go out of business.
 
Problems in Other States
 Rhode Island is not the first state to face a deposit insurance crisis because of problems at a private fund.
In 1985, the Governors of Ohio and Maryland closed privately insured savings and loan institutions under strikingly similar circumstances. As in Rhode Island, a single financial institution failed in each state amid accusations of misconduct by executives, and the resulting losses drained the reserves of the private insurers.
The Ohio and Maryland incidents involved many more financial institutions and more money than Rhode Island's current problems. Coming in 1985, at a time of strong economic growth and high public confidence in the banking industry, those problems raised questions about the adequacy of private insurance funds.
Despite the failure now of three private insurance funds in nearly six years, some economists contend that they are preferable to Federal insurance. Private funds are better able to charge premiums that reflect the riskiness of banks' investments, which helps to restrain bank managers from making unwise loans in an effort to expand rapidly, said Steven H. Hanke, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University.
 
Exact Assets Unclear
 The exact assets of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Fund are unclear. "They have in the high teens millions of dollars of assets," Mr. Preston said. "Now the question is how much of that is liquid and available."
Peter Novela, the insurance fund's president, did not return a telephone call yesterday to his home. A woman identifying herself as Mr. Novela's wife said he was sick in bed and could not come to the phone.
In a telephone interview yesterday with The Associated Press, Mr. Novela said the fund was worth $17 million to $18 million, having replenished its reserves by reassessing its membership after the collapse of Heritage. Mr. Novela told The Associated Press that he had missed Monday's board meeting because of illness and did not know why the board decided to seek conservatorship.
 
No Commercial Banks Affected
 No commercial banks are affected by Governor Sundlun's order because they are all Federally chartered and are not under state control, said Leonora S. Cross, a spokeswoman in Washington for the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal agency that regulates commercial banks.
Mr. Preston said the law required that banks and credit unions have deposit insurance and that the Governor was obliged to close the institutions when the fund filed for conservatorship.
Rhode Island's ability to respond to its sudden banking crisis is severely crimped by the state's budget troubles. It faces an estimated $162 million deficit on its $1.5 billion budget for the year ending on June 30 and must close the gap within six months because of an amendment to the state Constitution requiring a balanced budget.
 
New Governor Acts Quickly
 Closing the institutions was one of Mr. Sundlun's first acts in office. The former Governor, Edward D. DiPrete, a Republican whom Mr. Sundlun defeated in elections in November, did not return a telephone call to his answering service last night.
When Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio ordered the closing of 71 state-chartered savings and loans institutions on March 15, 1985, it took 11 days for all of them to reopen, and some institutions limited withdrawals to $750 at first. The state Legislature created a separate $92 million fund to protect deposits.
On May 15, 1985, Gov. Harry R. Hughes of Maryland ordered 102 privately insured savings and loan institutions to limit depositors' withdrawals to $1,000 a month. Assets of some institutions were sold to help pay for their transfer to Federal deposit insurance.
 
New England Deal
 PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 1 (REUTERS) -- Citizens Savings Bank and the Citizens Trust Company said on Monday that they had completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Bank of New England-Old Colony N.A., a unit of the Bank of New England Corporation. Citizens Savings Bank and Citizens Trust operate jointly as Citizens Bank and are owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group.

HEADLINE: Aid for Child Care Opens Worlds of Some Adults

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RUSSELLVILLE, Ark.

 BODY:
Four years ago, Ruby Hinman, a high school dropout and mother of three, rarely ventured beyond her front porch and the smoky blue pines that surround it. She was a hermit, she said, shy and insecure, and nervous at having to meet people.
Then came Susan Lynch and "Hippy," the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. Was Mrs. Hinman interested in a program that would prepare her 4-year-old daughter, Mandy, for kindergarten? 
 "I was reluctant at first," said Mrs. Hinman. "But Susan kept visiting and talking about 'Hippy' and finally I thought, 'I'll do this and I'll get it over with and I'll go back to the way I've been.' "
Nothing has been the same since.
Two of the Hinman children have completed the program and are straight-A students at the local elementary school. Mrs. Hinman got a job and her high school diploma, and now, with her husband's encouragement, she plans to enter Arkansas Technical College here this spring to study psychology.
 
Window Opens for States
 Like most states, Arkansas has a great need for two kinds of programs that aid working parents: child care education and day care programs. Arkansas has also been among the leaders in developing such programs, in part because of Gov. Bill Clinton's interest in the issue.
Now, Arkansas and the rest of the states will have an opportunity to expand child care assistance and to initiate innovative programs like Hippy, with money from the Child Care and Development Block Grant, passed by Congress last fall. The legislation -- the first comprehensive Federal program to help working families find affordable, quality day care -- gives the states $2.5 billion over the next three years to subsidize child care for working parents, regardless of income.
Nationwide about 750,000 children, and their parents, are expected to be helped by the grants. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 56.1 percent of women with children under age 6 were employed outside their homes in 1988, up from 30.3 percent in 1970.
The next few months are critical for states. They have to submit a plan to the Federal Government showing how they will use the funds, coordinate with existing programs, insure priority for low-income children and children with special needs, and pay or reimburse child care providers.
 
Channeling the Aid
 A crucial question is how the child care money will be delivered. States can either distribute money to day care centers or issue vouchers to families to help them pay directly for child care, including day care provided by religious organizations. The grants also require states to maintain state health and safety standards for all participating child care centers.
Partly because of the interest of Governor Clinton and his wife, Hilary, Arkansas already has the beginnings of a system that could be used to funnel Federal funds. A voucher system for day care is nearly two years old, and state officials anticipate it will be used to deliver the grant block money.
"Right now, we have many more parents apply for vouchers than we have money for," said Linda Reasoner, the assistant director of Child Care Developments Inc., the largest child care provider in the state.
Jo Ann Williams, the executive director of the company, said its various day care and parenting-education programs are financed through 15 sources, including fees paid by those who can afford them and government grants.
 
A Carload of Sleepy Children
 When the Federal block grant money begins to flow next September, Arkansas will receive $9.5 million. Seventy-five percent is earmarked for activities to increase the availability, affordability and quality of child care. But 25 percent can be used for improving quality of programs ranging from day care to early childhood education efforts like Hippy.
The country around Russellville, where Child Care Developments is centered, is full of the working poor. Most women work or want to work. Auto insurance, required by the state, is often dismissed as one expense too many. At the same time, people are so proud that social workers have difficulty persuading eligible families to apply for Medicaid for a sick child.
In the hills and hollows of Polk County, just on the edge of the Ozark Mountains, people work in factories, lumber mills or processing plants. Often husband and wife work in the same plant, the wife the early shift, the husband the late. It is not uncommon during shift changes to see a car with a back seat full of sleepy-eyed, pajama-clad children as one parent goes to work and the other takes over the child care.
Just how many working mothers there are who may need child care is hard to tell, said Mrs. Reasoner, because of the informal, and often inadequate, child care system of family and neighbors that many use.
 
Value of Crayons
 Though most of these parents want the best for their children, they are often not equipped to provide the best early childhood care.
"We have children out here who have never held a pencil or a crayon or scissors," said Mrs. Lynch of Hippy. "Their parents won't get them crayons because they say the child breaks them or he'll just tear it up. Through Hippy, I try to help parents relearn, or learn, the value of purchasing paper, books and crayons."
Developed by an Israeli education council at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Hippy program focuses on improving a child's total environment, child care advocates say.
The first Hippy program in the United States was established in 1984 in Tulsa, Okla. Now 11 states have programs, including New York with two programs, one in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and one in Yonkers. Arkansas started the program in 1986 and now has Hippy programs in 18 cities, more than any other state. Russellville's is the largest.
Mrs. Lynch says she knows how important it is for these parents to recognize the value of early childhood learning. "I grew up like these families," she said. "We lived on food stamps. I dropped out of school at 16 to have my first son. I know how important it is to help people help their children."
 
Lifting Parent With Child
 Ruby Hinman's voice gets an edge of excitement as she explains to a visitor her own liberation through the first lessons for young Mandy. The program includes twice-monthly meetings of parents who play the role of child and parent during sessions with an instructor. Mrs. Hinman recalled that she dreaded that first meeting, but once there, she enjoyed it, and soon found her confidence around other people growing.
"It made me brave enough to put in an application for a job at Tastee Freeze," she said.
Come spring, Mrs. Hinman, who works as a waitress, will be using another Child Care Developments program, day care for working student mothers.
"My husband, Keith, really encouraged me to go to college," she said. "I was surprised and I was scared. I asked him wasn't he afraid I'd change. He said I'd change anyway. And if I get through college and get a decent paying job, why, maybe he'd go back to school."

HEADLINE: The 90's Woman: How Fat Is Fat?

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
BITE by bite, American women dutifully serve the reigning image of body beautiful. Men have been almost blissfully immune from the vicissitudes of body style, but in the United States women have borne the burden with gusto.
In the late 19th century, when the fleshy physique dominated, the generous Gibson Girl contours were sought with a flurry of forks. "The lean are restless and irritable in mind, rarely contented, never quiet," admonished "How to Be Plump: Or Talks on Physiological Feeding," an 1878 handbook by Dr. T. C. Duncan. "They form the complaining element of society, and are unstable as a nation." When thin came in, women used their forks to push food primly from one side of the plate to the other. "It makes me feel powerful to be hungry," an emaciated Ivana Trump told reporters in 1986. 
 Today, forks across America are poised somewhere between plate and mouth. After a 20-year reign of an anorexic esthetic, arbiters of haute couture and doyennes of popular culture, along with health and fitness experts, have begun to reconsider the question "How fat is fat?"
For the moment, American women aren't sure whether to feast or fast.
"The Twiggy look is definitely over," said Dr. Katherine Halmi, director of the Eating Disorders Clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center's Westchester Division. The full female figure is blooming again. Hourglass forms are bursting from the pages of fashion magazines and proudly taking a place in the front row of low-impact aerobic classes. What was once "fat" can now be "fit," -- at least in mass market images of women.
It is not clear how much the ideal American female formwill grow -- or how healthy the rounding of America is. "People in our country are already heavier than people in any other country in the world," Dr. Halmi said. "To say that obesity is beautiful is to ignore the fact that morbid obesity is unhealthy."
For now individual women hesitate to beef up the hips, breasts and round limbs that have been verboten since the invasion of sticklike British models in the 1960's. "Women raised under the specter of Twiggy have a morbidly obese image burned in their unconscious like a horror movie," said Carol Bloom, a psychotherapist who is co-founder of the Women's Therapy Institute in Manhattan. "The fear fuels yo-yo dieting, bulimia and anorexia, disorders that are potentially much more threatening to health and well-being than a few extra pounds."
Dr. Jean Rubel of Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders, in Eugene, Ore., estimates that more than half the women ages 10 to 30 suffer an eating disorder. Beginning in the 1970's, the decade of svelte, that number skyrocketed, she said.
At the same time the country witnessed a renaissance of quick weight-loss diets and diet-related maladies that didn't even off until last year. No wonder health professionals demanda physiological appraisal of body fat that considers heredity, age and body composition in setting weight goals.
In 1983, the height and weight table tabulated by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company moved in that direction. Used by most American physicians to determine "normal" weight, the charts showed an increase of 5 to 10 pounds in most categories. "Since our benchmark study in 1959, it was the first significant increase in healthy Americans," said Stanley Kranzer, a demographer who compiled results of the 4 million Americans who were polled. In the 1990 Dietary Guidelines by the United States Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, suggested weight ranges were even more generous and distinctions between healthful weights for men and women of the same height were nearly eliminated.
Physicians who specialize in weight loss advocate another approach to determining how fat is fat. "Total weight is not as important as the proportion of lean body mass like muscle and organs to fat body mass," said Christine Wolaver, director of exercise physiology at the Doral Saturnia Health Spa in Miami. By using calipers to measure body fat, she helps individuals set weight goals. "I often advocate a weight far above the height and weight chart," she said. "Research shows that active people need weight to maintain their life styles. The anorexic look is unhealthy and unsustainable."
Fitness instructors at the Doral Saturnia today are 5 to 10 pounds heavier than they were three years ago. "We want to see muscle not bone," said Ms. Wolaver.
The more robust female image is consistent with fashion. After 25 years of aping Twiggy and Jean (the Shrimp) Shrimpton, runway models recently began to flaunt hips and breasts. Later-day Junos appear in movies, television and advertising.
The shift from the tubular-shaped woman who recalls an adolescent boy to a round figure reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe is the latest chapter in an age-old bifurcation of the female form. In "The Nude," the art historian Kenneth Clark wrote, "Prehistoric images of women are of two kinds, the bulging statuettes from paleolithic caves, which emphasize the female attributes till they are little more than symbols of fertility, and the marble dolls of the Cyclades, in which, already, the unruly human body has undergone a geometrical discipline."
Hence, a voluptuous Roseanne Barr, posed like Botticelli's Venus on the cover of the December Vanity Fair magazine, doesn't necessarily signal that chubbettes are chic. But it is emblematic of a shifting esthetic. In a society where women's appetites are typically set by an external standard of beauty rather than a physiologic craving, the change gives pause at the table. But the shift doesn't surprise theoreticians. "Throughout history, the ideal women's body size has gone up and down like an economic barometer of culture," said Ms. Bloom.
Linda Weintraub, director of the Edith C. Blum Art Institute at Bard College said that in any society, the ideal female form generally changes in reaction to economic conditions. "In a culture where food is scarce, the rounded female form is glorified as a symbol of security and affluence," she said. "In a culture where food is abundant, the lean body is glorified for its discipline."
Her colleague at Bard, Richard A. Gordon, a professor of psychology, furthers the argument. "In historical periods in which women have felt under pressure to prove their intellectual ability and competence, the slender body ideal has been dominant," he writes in "Anorexia and Bulimia, Anatomy of a Social Epidemic," (Basil Blackwell, 1990). Full figures, on the other hand, abound during home-centered eras.
Dr. Blackwell notes that the idealization of thinness didn't take a firm hold in the United States until the early 20th century, when women entered the workplace. That image was then unseated by the hourglass figures of Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield in the postwar period of domestic retrenchment. "Dieting and thinness attained the status of a mass cultural obsession," he said, in the last two decades as more women than ever before entered the American work force.
And the re-blooming of the female figure coincides with the largest baby boom since the Baby Boom.
Fertility and nurturance are not the overt message in Madonna's look. Implanted breasts seen on runway models seem more like toys than parts of the procreative female biology. But even caricatures can be bellwethers.
"They say 'health,' " said Fran Weiss, a psychotherapist who specializes in treating body image distortions at the Obesity Research Center at St. Lukes Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. "People are getting very leery of thin. Thin could be sick. It could be the sickness. A little more bulk means health."
So far, women on a mass binge have not stampeded Main Street U.S.A. Specialists in eating disorders say that it will take a generation to reverse the disorders that flourished during the recent Reign of Svelte. But the popularity of books like "Fat as a Feminist Issue" (Berkley, 1979) and "Making Peace With Food: A step-by-step guide to freedom from diet-weight conflict" (1990, Amity Publishing) signal a slight loosening of the dietary corset.
American women are once again being extolled to aim their forks at healthful portions of healthful food.
"To be healthy we want to know what to eat, so that we may observe the golden mean -- florid plumpness, which is the picture of health the world over," wrote Dr. Duncan in 1878.
At the Doral Saturnia Health Spa, Alix Landman, a dietitian told 23 female guests several weeks ago: "Look at food as fuel for building a healthy, strong body.Basically firm food like vegetables and grains will make firm tissue. Fatty food like butter, cheese and meat will make fatty tissue."
Plump may still be a four-letter word, but as long as fat is firm, fat is the golden mean today.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
IT'S the time of year when even normally prudent people lose all sense of caution and succumb to the urge to predict things. For futurologists, amateur and professional, who have had some measure of success in the past, it's a particularly dangerous time; they are expected to repeat their accomplishments yet again.
 For those who have never had any luck predicting anything, the task is much less burdensome. What the heck: they have nothing to lose. Accordingly, we hereby scramble far out on a limb to disclose some of the more important wine events that will almost certainly come to pass over the next 12 months. The dates, it must be said, are only approximate.
 
 JAN. 26: Four more bottles of wine bearing Thomas Jefferson's initials will mysteriously turn up at a wine auction in Zurich. No one will profess to know whence they came. Collectors will accept the three bottles of Chateau Lafite 1776 as authentic but will voice considerable reservation about a single bottle of nonvintage Ridge zinfandel. They will point out that Jefferson's diaries frequently alluded to his strong distaste for the variety.
 FEB. 3: The new owner of one of the 1776 Lafites will display it to some friends. When they question his probity, he will hit one of them with the bottle and smash it. An insurance company will refuse to pay off, noting that Jefferson bottles have been turning up every few weeks.
 MARCH 14: A band of masked men will board the controversial Napa Valley Wine Train just as it passes Mustard's Restaurant, north of Yountville, Calif. After frightening some elderly tourists from Iowa who think they are headed for Disneyland, the men will invade the galley and turn up the heat under the pintadeau desosse, simply ruining lunch for everyone.
 Witnesses will later testify that some of the masked men sounded like winery owners who are opposed to the operation of the train, but charges will be dismissed for lack of evidence.
 APRIL 7: In Paris, LVMH, the Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton conglomerate, will announce that it has acquired Chateaux Lafite-Rothschild and Mouton-Rothschild. The announcement will say that the two will be combined into a new entity known as Chateau LRMR. A spokesman will say that the new subsidiary will embark on an aggressive, vertically integrated acquisition program that will provide new outlets for its wine. Included will be fast-food chains, international vacation clubs and cruise lines, the spokesman will say.
 APRIL 8: In Tokyo, Mitsubishi will announce that it has acquired LVMH.
 MAY 15: Robert Mondavi will disclose that he has been doing a little home wine making since his retirement "to pass the time." First-year production, just for family and friends, will be about 80,000 cases, an aide will report.
 JUNE 12: A six-foot-tall, 300-gallon bottle of cabernet sauvignon will top the bidding at the annual Napa Valley auction. It will be knocked down for $300,000 because it's such good wine and because it comes wrapped in its own BMW mini-van. The story will get immense play on food pages and on televison and will convince approximately one million potential wine drinkers to stick to beer.
JULY 20: The Environmental Protection Agency will announce that it holds to its earlier conclusion that the amount of the fungicide procymidone in some imported wines is not harmful. But the agency will say that it has decided to continue its tests for a year or so. "We'll keep everybody posted," a spokesman will say.
 Meanwhile, to mollify a few strident critics, the agency will release some 1988 Beaujolais nouveau that had been withheld from the market for its tests. A prominent New York retailer will immediately take out full-page newspaper ads announcing a 1988-91 twin pack: "Two nouveaux practically for the price of one."
 AUG. 18: The Domaine de la Romanee-Conti will announce -- with deep regret -- that the 1990 Romanee-Conti will cost $5,000 a bottle. Mme. Bize-Leroy, an owner of the D.R.C., will acknowledge that the price does not exactly reflect production costs but will explain that the Domaine always tries to position itself slightly behind Chateau Petrus.
 AUG. 19: In Tokyo, Mitsubishi will disclose that it has acquired Chateau Petrus.
 SEPT. 15: Grape pickers in Bordeaux will tell reporters that because the summer was so hot and there was so little rain, the 1991 vintage should be quite good.
 OCT. 15: Orley Ashenfelter, the Princeton University soothsayer, will announce that, using his econometric model and the Cray supercomputer at the Institute for Advanced Study, as well as the information that the Bordeaux summer was hot and relatively rain free, he has concluded that the 1991 vintage should be quite good.
 NOV. 2: The Bush Administration will propose an additional $6-a-bottle tax on table wine. Overriding industry objections, the White House will point out that the tax will come to no more than a measly $1 a glass, using a four-ounce glass, of course.
NOV. 4: Questioned on the ABC program "Nightline," John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, will read from a Budget report showing that using a two-ounce glass will bring the tax down to a minuscule 50 cents a drink. Irritated by Ted Koppel's aggressive questioning, he will characterize six-ounce and larger glasses as "holdovers from the self-indulgent Reagan years."
 DEC. 5: The E. & J. Gallo Winery, the world's largest, will announce that it is moving from furnace-like Modesto, in the Central Valley of California, to leafy-green Sonoma County in an effort to enhance its image as a producer of fine wine. This plan could be changed next year if the Legislature in Sacramento approves a longstanding Gallo proposal to move Sonoma County to Modesto.
 DEC. 10: The Beaujolais impresario Georges Duboeuf, who in recent years has moved aggressively intothe bottling and shipping of Rhone Valley wines, will announce that he has acquired the Rhone Valley.
 DEC. 11: In Tokyo, Mitsubishi will announce it has acquired Georges Duboeuf.
 
TASTINGS
 
Bourgogne Passetoutgrains 1988, Domaine Jayer-Gilles; about $12.
 The rules say that all red Burgundy must be made from the pinot noir grape. All except one, the one called passetoutgrains. It can be made from up to two-thirds gamay grapes and one-third pinot noir.
 Things have come a long way since the 14th century when Philip the Bold banned gamay from Burgundy, calling it that "tres mauvais plant." Gamay, the staple of the Beaujolais, crept back into Burgundy over the centuries, particularly after a phylloxera epidemic in the 19th century.
 Twenty years ago, when good Burgundy sold for $4 a bottle, passetoutgrains was little more than a curiosity, especially in export markets. Now, given the extortionate prices of even the simplest Burgundies, passetoutgrains has begun to gain a little respect. Lighter than a full pinot noir Burgundy, to be sure, a good one still conveys the texture and bouquet of the Cote d'Or.
 Robert Jayer-Gilles heads yet another branch of the remarkable Jayer family of Burgundian wine makers and this is an attractive example of his work.

HEADLINE: Embassies Turning to Cultural Concerns

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
In the world of diplomacy, culture mostly ranks a distant third behind political and economic concerns. But some countries have begun to give new emphasis to promoting their cultural wares through their embassies in Washington.
"We deal as government to government, but the relationship on the bottom line is people to people," said Ambassador Gustavo Petricioli of Mexico as he discussed the Mexican Cultural Institute, which opened last summer. "As an economist I deal with the World Bank and other financial institutions, but this cultural center is really, really the face of Mexico." 
 Most embassies have a cultural counselor, and ambassadors entertain at a continual round of receptions and dinners for artistic compatriots passing through Washington in performance. But a growing number of countries are not waiting on institutions like the Kennedy Center and the National Gallery of Art to present their artists. They are establishing venues of their own.
Peru has exhibited archeological treasures, ceramics and textiles at its new Cultural Center in a wing of the Peruvian Ambassador's Tudor-style residence. The French have incorporated theater and gallery space in their embassy, known as the Maison Francaise. Brazil has its Brazilian-American Cultural Institute, which offers not only the study of the Portuguese language and Brazilian literature but concerts, movies and art exhibits as well.
 
Showing Canada Off
 Canada's new marble-and-chrome embassy on Pennsylvania Avenue has a high-ceilinged art gallery as well as a striking 175-seat theater that has presented a series of Canadian artists, film makers, musicians and writers since its opening more than a year ago. "The embassy and its cultural component were planned to make a statement," said Terry Colli, the director of public affairs. "We wanted to have a building that would show Canada off, and we have found our location across from the National Gallery and the Smithsonian a considerable challenge. We set out from the very beginning to put together shows which would make people aware of Canadian culture without the hard sell. It is really a learning and educational process and an opportunity to present the work of Canadian artists that people would not get to see unless they were visiting Canada."
As Manuel Cosio, the director of the Mexican Cultural institute, and Dr. Pablo F. Marentes, the cultural affairs attache at the embassy, guided a recent visitor through the new institute, known popularly as Mexico House, Dr. Marentes explained: "We are a country of enormous history and culture, but we are known in the United States primarily through our pre-Columbian objects or by old newsreels and movies about the Mexican Revolution."
That will change, he predicts, once programming gets into full swing with exhibitions ranging from traditional Mexican crafts to the avant-garde work of contemporary Mexican artists.
 
Former Mexican Embassy
 The four-story, 1912 mansion on 16th Street N.W., with its 20-foot ceilings, crystal chandeliers, marble fireplaces and grand staircase murals by a Mexican artist, Roberto Cueva del Rio, was bought by the Mexican Government 68 years ago and was the embassy until it was outgrown last year. The first floor has been turned into a series of galleries and was the setting for its opening exhibition of paintings and sculpture by Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, Frida Kahlo, David Alfaro Siquieros and others. That was followed by an exhibition of 19th-century Mexican engravings and lithographs. On Jan. 15, the paintings of Francisco Toledo, a noted contempory Mexican artist, will go on view.
Musical events at the institute have been held in a replica of the ornate music room at the palace at Fontainebleau near Paris, and over the coming year a series of lectures, conferences and exhibitions is scheduled. "We plan to have poets, scientists and intellectuals in residence," Dr. Marentes said. "Our library will have a computer link with major Mexican libraries and archives, and we want to organize thematic traveling shows that will be offered to regional and Midwest museums in the United States. We want to become a center for the distribution of goods and services."
At the Maison Francaise, a telephone service offers callers a rundown of the cultural calendar, which has included events like an evening of jazz and tap dance with "the world-famous French tap-master Chris Belliou" and readings of translations of French playwrights.
 
The Political Component
 That art can have political as well as cultural impact was dramatically demonstrated here with a recent exhibition of rare Cypriot art and artifacts. The tiny embassy of Cyprus has no exhibition space of its own, so a suite of rooms was rented at a local hotel for a display of ancient Cypriot art, originally from Famagusta, a community taken over by Turkish troops when they invaded in 1974.
"I speak as a citizen of Famagusta who has not been able to visit my hometown for 16 years," said the Cypriot Ambassador, Michael E. Sherifis, as he offered a toast to celebrate the exhibition of the 92 priceless artifacts that had never traveled to the United States before. "This is not only about art and history," the Ambassador said. "It is a cry of agony from Famagusta and from Cyprus as a whole."
The Canadian art exhibition, on view through March 16, is "The Canadian Landscape, 1915-39," which presents the work of seven of Canada's earliest environmental artists. The exhibitions change every four months and have drawn an average of 7,000 visitors each.
The embassy's gray, black and silver theater with its scarlet seats and modernistic curtain of aluminum strips has been the setting for chamber music, jazz and folklore programs as well as lectures and readings by Canadian artists, critics and literary figures. The concert series has been very successful, Mr. Colli said: "In fact, we are suffering from an excess of success and have had to turn some people away."
Asked why the two countries that share borders with the United States are leading the effort to communicate more about their cultural values, Ambassador Petricioli of Mexico said that proximity did not necessarily lead to understanding.
"Although we share 2,000 miles of border with 250 million legal crossings each year, we still deal in cliches about each other," he said. "Although we breathe the same air, drink the same water, have the same goals of democracy, progress and schools for our children, we are different in culture, history, institutions and language.
"But we believe we can complement each other, respect each other, learn from each other, get to know each other better."

President and Mrs. Bush and an Amiable David Frost

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"No price is too high to pay to stop Iraqi aggression," George Bush declares in "President and Mrs. Bush Talking With David Frost." The first half of tonight's hourlong program, at 8 on Channels 13 and 49 and at 10 on Channel 21, gives the President, who concedes that eloquence is not his strong point, an opportunity to make as coherent a case for his policy in the Persian Gulf as he has yet offered on television.
 Under the placable questioning of David Frost, Mr. Bush cites graphic examples of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait from a recent Amnesty International report as evidence of the "clear moral case" against Iraq; asserts that Saddam Hussein would have moved on Saudi oil fields if not stopped; says he is not convinced that sanctions alone will bring the Iraqi ruler "to his senses," and promises that if war is necessary, it will not be another Vietnam and that American ground troops will not remain in the region after Iraq departs or is driven out of Kuwait, although measures must be taken to control Iraq's military prowess. 
 The interview is the first of a new PBS series, "Talking With David Frost," that will be shown once a month through June; future interviewees will include Margaret Thatcher and Robin Williams.
In tonight's meeting, filmed last month, Mr. Frost and Mr. Bush, in matching armchairs, face each other in the Oval Office. They seem at ease together, pals who have got used to chatting under the camera's eye. A fire adds its warmth to the occasion, and a bowl of flowers is in evidence.
 The interviewer leads but never presses. For example, when Mr. Frost raises an uncomfortable point -- why "some in the West" were slow to recognize President Hussein's intentions -- he does not get personal about the Bush State Department. He broaches disputed matters, such as whether air power alone can compel Iraq to back down and whether the White House needs the authority of Congress to start a war, but does not get unpleasant about demanding hard answers. "I would leave it somewhat hypothetical," Mr. Bush says about seeking Congressional approval, and Mr. Frost leaves it.
He has a way of picking up the President's thoughts and returning them to him. "It's genocide in a way," Mr. Frost says of the reported ravaging of Kuwait, and the President does not demur. The closest Mr. Frost comes to an adversarial note is in a few questions about Washington's new amity with Damascus, when he asks whether the United States is now treating Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian President, as it recently treated Mr. Hussein, on the principle that the enemy of our enemy is our friend. Mr. Bush says he had "a good talk" with Mr. Assad in Geneva and emphasizes their "common ground."
After a brief intermission, during which Barbara Bush accepts Mr. Frost's invitation to deliver a commercial for her husband's concern about race relations and her own efforts on behalf of literacy and AIDS patients, the President is back, and the conversation turns to the Administration's record on such advertised priorities as education, crime and drugs. "It's going all right, it's going all right," says Mr. Bush; Mr. Frost goes onto the next question.
The President predicts that the recession, if one wishes to use so definite a term, will be mild and the country will come out of it "in not too many months." He reminds Mr. Frost of the 1981 economic downturn, from which the nation recovered "and everybody lived happily ever after."
 Mr. Frost daringly asks whether the President's hope for a kinder, gentler nation is not contradicted by his opposition to new taxes for social programs. The President reiterates his confidence that economic growth, not Federal spending, is the key, despite the demands of "the political left."
The hour ends with George and Barbara Bush together, agreeing on the importance of family and faith. They make a comfortable couple. "What does prayer give you both?" Mr. Frost asks, as though he were trying to be Bill Moyers. Mr. Bush says it gives strength, and reveals that Mrs. Bush prays while lying in bed and not on her knees. The camera moves away on a note of mild inspiration and deep contentment.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
To Fight in the Gulf?

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
In April 1954, President Eisenhower told the French he would launch air strikes against Vietnamese Communist troops surrounding French forces at Dien Bien Phu only if two key conditions were met: that U.S. intervention had to be part of a strong international coalition, and that Congress had to support the action.
 Ike may have made the conditions tough in the correct expectation that they would not be met. But he understood that a President does not jump into a black hole without extensive international backing and a unified nation.
 
 In other words, Ike was following an essential rule of politics and good sense when a decision concerns lives and enormous costs -- and saying it depends.
 It is not clear that President Bush understands this. He is content merely to recite the reasons for using force against a tyrant like Saddam Hussein: his record of brutal aggression, his use of chemical weapons and pursuit of nuclear weapons and his fist thrust against the oil thorax of the world's economy. And he is right on the fundamental issue: If war is not justifiable here, then where?
 But to grant that a war against Iraq would be just does not justify actually going to war. Even just wars must be measured by their costs and consequences. It depends.
 In the first instance, it depends on the alternatives. The only realistic one is economic sanctions. But its advocates cannot convincingly show that Iraq will crack before the alliance crumbles; and its opponents cannot make the opposite case persuasively. We're all guessing -- George Mitchell, George Bush, you, me.
 To me, the argument unfortunately turns on one critical factor: the 1992 Presidential election. Sanctions advocates concede that the squeeze will take at least one year to approach full effect.
 But waiting one year really means delaying two years, since Saddam Hussein will use the explosive mix of international crisis and Presidential politics to handcuff George Bush militarily the way Hanoi stymied Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and Ayatollah Khomeini neutered Jimmy Carter in 1980.
By 1992 Mr. Bush will no longer be able to credibly threaten employing force. And with the threat to Saddam Hussein's regime removed, some of our allies will have to snuggle up to their entrenched neighbor as before.
 Yet even with these defects, sanctions cannot be dismissed without looking at the costs and risks of war.
 To begin with, as Ike knew in 1954, war should depend on a far larger commitment by our allies of troops and money. The present distribution of risks and pain is outrageously unfair.
 Mr. Bush cannot allow the Saudis to make a windfall oil profit of about $4 billion monthly while we defend them, their unlikely denials of this notwithstanding. Nor should we have forgiven the $7 billion Egyptian debt in return for some 25,000 troops. Japan, Germany and France ought to be ashamed of their efforts; and they are not ashamed.
 What's more, the Saudis, French and Egyptians have to participate in all military operations, including especially the bombing of Iraq. A reckoning will come for scorching that country, and America and Britain cannot be left alone to absorb the hatred.
 Saying yes to war should also depend on Mr. Bush holding down casualties. The Pentagon insists on massive land, sea and air attacks. But it is far from clear why offensive action cannot be limited to air attacks, and ground action restricted to defense. Given the open desert terrain, air power should be able to sever resupply of Iraqi troops in Kuwait and starve them out. And to temper Arab hostility after the bloodshed, Washington must not target Iraqi civilians.
In addition, Mr. Bush, like Ike, should seek the blessing of Congress. More than one million armed personnel with the most modern weapons will be poised to do battle. This is not a police action like Panama or Grenada; it could become a mini-world war.
 At worst, Congress would say not now, continue sanctions. This would be very damaging, but not as bad as making war without Congress. My guess, however, is that if Congress were reassured about costs and consequences, it would give Mr. Bush as much authority to fight as the U.N. has.
 He would thus gain what he and his aides fear he lacks most -- credibility with Saddam Hussein. A declaration of war, or its equivalent, is the best way to shock Iraq into submission without fighting, and if shock should fail, to fight.

HEADLINE: Economists Say New Jersey Can Weather the Recession

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
As the metropolitan region slips into recession, New Jersey appears better positioned to weather an economic slowdown than other states in the Northeast, economists say.
But the end of years of euphoric growth in 1990, combined with sharp tax increases imposed by Gov. Jim Florio, have created a bitter political environment that restricts the options of Mr. Florio and other Democrats in leading the state through more difficult times. 
 In the next few weeks Mr. Florio and the Democratic leadership must confront a series of vexing problems: cutting state government departments and laying off thousands of workers, solving a major financing crisis for hospitals and revising a complex school-aid formula to win back the support of alienated middle-income homeowners.
 
Unemployment Up to 5.5%
 "We expect the economy to do reasonably well compared with other states," said Steven Hochman, the vice president and assistant director of state ratings at Moody's investors service. But he added, "One thing we are interested in is how this political process eventually works itself out."
Like the rest of the Northeast, New Jersey in 1990 saw job growth drop and real-estate prices plummet. And a state of suburban homeowners suddenly realized that owning a home no longer meant they were growing richer without saving.
The state's unemployment rate, which had dropped to less than 3.8 percent in 1988, rose to 5.5 percent by November. The growth of new jobs, which averaged nearly 100,000 a year in the mid-1980's, is now predicted by the State Labor Department to grow by about 20,000 a year in the 1990's.
According to an econometric model of the New Jersey economy developed by the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, the state will have a moderate recession in 1991, with an unemployment rate reaching 6.4 percent and recovery beginning in 1992. The model assumes no jarring, unpredictable events, like war in the Middle East, which could throw the nation into a severe recession.
But despite the dreary prospects for 1991, economists say the New Jersey economy is better structured to weather the recession than many states.
 
A Wide Range of Industries
 In the 1970's New Jersey suffered the decline of aging manufacturing industries and high unemployment. But over the last decade the state found prosperity in a wide range of industries, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, communications, health care and legal and other services.
The severe downturns in the financial, real-estate and construction industries, although damaging to New Jersey, are not expected to be as devastating as they have been to New York City and Massachusetts. Their economies were far more dependent on real-estate and financial services during the 1980's. And unemployment is not expected to reach levels in New Jersey that it did before the 1980's boom.
Although the New Jersey government still faces severe revenue shortfalls and cutbacks, fiscal experts say the tax increases pushed through the Legislature last year by Governor Florio generally make New Jersey's fiscal problems more manageable than those in New York and Connecticut.
In the longer term, economists say, the state has a highly educated work force, a generally well-maintained transportation system and a location well suited to benefit from increased trade with Europe, all of which should attract moderate growth in the next decade.
 
The Wager Had Failed
 "The state's economy has some underlying bedrock," said James W. Hughes, a professor of Urban Planning at Rutgers University. "The embellishments just won't be there."
Last spring, Governor Florio decided to confront a growing budget shortfall and problems with financing education with a $2.8 billion tax rise. It was a risky wager that the public would eventually laud him for being decisive. But by November it appeared that the wager had failed dramatically.
The Governor's decision to raise taxes just as the state was starting to tip into recession sent his poll ratings and public attitudes about the future into a tailspin. Several polls have shown that only about one in five voters approve of their Governor. In one poll, conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers in late September, 74 percent of New Jerseyans polled said the state "had pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track." The poll, of 800 residents, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
So closely is Mr. Florio associated with the onset of dire news that critics say he is at risk in 1991 of becoming "the Velcro Governor," to whom bad news sticks even if it is not of his making.
 
Predisposed Not to Believe
 This week, for instance, many taxpayers will suffer increases in both New Jersey and Federal income taxes, a distinction that may be lost on people who know only that they are taking less money home.
"The Governor and the Democratic leadership are going to spend this year trying to restore their credibility," said Senator William Gormley, Republican of Atlantic County. "Whatever he says at this point, people are predisposed not to believe."
A plan being hammered out by the Florio administration and representatives of John Lynch, the Democratic president of the Senate, would restructure Mr. Florio's school-aid program.
Although the details are still not settled, officials familiar with the discussions say they are focused on a new mechanism to shift hundreds of millions of dollars originally designated for poorer school districts to middle-income suburban municipalities. The plan under discussion would also include tighter caps on what school districts can spend and a freeze for two years on a controversial shift of pension costs from the state to local school districts. The overall effect, legislators say, would be to keep homeowners' property taxes from rising.
 
Reducing the Work Force
 The Florio administration is also planning hundreds of millions of dollars in public-works projects that should create tens of thousands of construction jobs at a time the construction industry is suffering heavily.
Since raising taxes has become a politically impossible alternative, the administration is now drawing up plans to contend with a more than $600 million shortfall by laying off state workers -- one official estimates 4,000 -- and by reducing the work force by several thousand more through early retirements and attrition. The cutbacks, which may include the merging of some departments, are expected to be announced in the next month.
Also in the next month, the Democrats are expected to demonstrate their new commitment to realpolitik by refusing to renew a fund that pays hospitals for caring for the uninsured, thereby letting hospitals approach the brink of crisis.
Originally, Governor Florio's health experts had proposed a new tax on employers as the best solution. But in the current environment, Democrats in the Assembly and the Governor's office agreed to let the fund lapse yesterday so that leaders in the health-care field would be forced to step forward with solutions. In the end, the hospital crisis will be solved, the Democrats say, but in 1991 it will not be them and them alone who take responsibility for the bad news.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Vice Chairman Named Midlantic Bank Chief

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
The Midlantic Corporation has named Desmond P. McDonald president and chief executive of its lead bank, the Midlantic National Bank.
Mr. McDonald, who is 63 years old, has replaced Robert Van Buren, the chairman and chief executive of the parent company, who has relinquished his titles at the bank to concentrate on the parent company. 
 Mr. McDonald continues to serve as vice chairman and a director of the parent company. In its announcement last week, the company described the shift as a long-planned change in senior management.
Mr. McDonald was born and educated in Carlow, Ireland. He came to the United States in 1953 and joined the National Newark and Essex Bank, a predecessor of Midlantic National. He is a graduate of the school of consumer banking at the University of Virginia. He and his wife, Margaret, live in Essex Fells, N.J.
Midlantic, a regional interstate bank holding company based in Edison, N.J., has assets of more than $24 billion. It has been hurt by the economic downturn in the Northeast and the problems in the real estate sector in particular. The company has recently taken a number of steps to reduce operating costs, including omitting its dividend payment, freezing hiring and curtailing most bonus payments.
The corporation operates 512 offices, mostly in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. Midlantic National has $9 billion in assets. The parent is the 31st-largest banking company in the country, and the second-largest in New Jersey, following the First Fidelity Bancorporation.
The company lost $159 million in its third quarter, which ended Sept. 30. It also posted a large loss in the second quarter of 1990 after adding significantly to its reserves to provide for declining real estate values in New Jersey.
The company sold its credit card portfolio and other assets to offset the additions to its loan-loss reserves. The Standard & Poor's Corporation said that although Midlantic was well capitalized, its exposure to risky real estate loans was substantial.
Mr. Van Buren has said that the company will have a profit in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
It Wasn't a Good Year for Dividends

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Big banks caught the most attention for slashing dividends last year, but they were not alone.
Figures released by Standard & Poor's yesterday showed that 143 companies decreased their dividends in 1990, while 266 omitted them entirely. Each figure was the highest since 1982, the final year of the last recession, and was up about 40 percent from 1989's level. 
 As is usually the case, many more companies raised dividends than cut them, but there too the trend also emphasized the worsening economic situation. The 1,263 dividend increases announced was the smallest total since 1971, and dropped 24 percent from 1989's level.
Negative dividend actions typically trail bad corporate results, as boards of directors hesitate to send out such graphically bad news until there seems to be no alternative, and the numbers tend to increase in the second year of a recession. If that pattern holds, the dividend picture for this year could be even bleaker.
The heaviest action on dividends usually takes place around year-end, as companies assess their annual results. But in December, only 88 dividend increases were announced, S.&P. said. That figure was down 36 percent from a year before, and was the lowest for any December since 1957. In keeping with the same trend, 32 companies announced dividend omissions in December, the most for any December since 1960.
"The numbers look terrible," said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.&P.'s Outlook newsletter, which compiles the figures. But he said he hoped the trend would reverse by mid-1991, when he expects the economy to turn up.
"They come back pretty strongly when it is clear the recession is over," he said. "The companies that were unduly tight-fisted will open up and be willing to increase dividends."
By one measure, dividend actions last year were the worst since S.&P. began compiling statistics on them in 1955. The number of good events -- increases, resumptions of dividend payments and declarations of extra dividends -- totaled 1,687, down 24 percent from 1989. The previous low for that figure was 1,837, in 1971.
The dividend actions recorded by S.&P. come from a universe of more than 7,000 public companies, some of them quite small. But while such large banks as Chase Manhattan and Citicorp have cut their payouts this year, most of the dividend damage occurred among smaller companies.
By one traditional way of looking at dividends, 1990 was not a bad year at all. Preliminary figures released yesterday showed that the dividends on the S.&P. 500 stock index for 1990 were $12.10, up 9.5 percent from 1989. That compared with a 13.6 percent increase in 1989 and was the smallest increase since 1987, but still a healthy one. The S.&P. 500 is dominated by large companies, many of which have done relatively well.
But Mr. Kaufman said that much of that increase could be attributed to dividend increases in mid-1989, for which 1990 was the first full year of payment. He forecasts that this year's increase will decline to about 5 percent.
The current payout rate on the S.&P. 500 -- the dividends that would be paid in a year if all companies in the index maintain their current dividend levels -- is $12.37, up 6.4 percent from a year ago.
It is unusual for the dividends on the S.&P. 500 to decline. That last happened in 1970 and 1971. Even in the recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82, the S.&P. 500 was able to post small dividend increases. In those recessions, however, inflation was relatively high and the payouts, though an increase in nominal dollars, did not keep pace with inflation. This year, however, inflation is relatively low, which may make it more difficult for companies to maintain payouts if the economy continues to weaken.
One reason that some analysts have hesitated to turn bullish is that the dividend return on stocks is still relatively low. Based on year-end prices and actual annual dividends for the S.&P. 500, the yield on that index was 3.66 percent, much better than the 3.13 percent recorded a year ago, but not high by historical standards. It is only a bit higher than the 3.57 percent at the end of 1987. By contrast, in previous recessions stock prices have bottomed with dividend yields at much higher levels. At the end of 1981, for example, the dividend yield stood at 5.49 percent, while it was 5.23 percent at the end of 1974.
If Mr. Kaufman's forecast of a 5 percent increase in S.&P. dividends this year is accurate, that would raise the payout to $12.71. For the dividend yield to reach the levels of previous recessions, stock prices would have to fall much further. For example, to obtain a 5.23 percent yield with dividends at $12.71, the S.&P. 500 would fall to about 243, or 26 percent below the current figure for the index of 326.45.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Are Down $1.95, to $26.49

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices fell nearly $2 yesterday, dipping below $27 a barrel, on speculation that Washington and Baghdad will reach a last-minute diplomatic solution to avoid a war in the Persian Gulf.
Traders said selling was spurred by the news that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d may soon visit the gulf and the refusal of the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, to rule out direct talks between United States officials and Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. 
 In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in February fell $1.95 to close at $26.49 a barrel.
Gasoline and heating oil prices also fell.
"In the back of people's minds is the view Saddam is going to do something in the 11th hour," said Tom Blakeslee, oil industry analyst with Pegasus Econometric.
Iraq faces a United Nations deadline of Jan. 15 to pull out of Kuwait or risk an armed invasion by the United States and its allies.
But traders warned of further volatility ahead in the energy markets.
"One day it feels like peace and one day it's war," one trader said. "There's no way to call this market. It just follows the headlines."
In other trading, heating oil for February delivery tumbled 5.90 cents, to 73.30 cents a gallon, and February gasoline fell 3.26 cents, to 68.10 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders said early selling was spurred by speculation that a peace initiative may emerge from a European Community meeting scheduled for tomorrow.
Price swings were exaggerated by thin volume, they said.
In trading overseas, North Sea Brent crude for February loading closed at $26.90 a barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange, down $1.37 from Monday's close.
But experts warned the market could turn back up quickly.
"The prevailing sentiment as we get closer to Jan. 15," said Alan Sinclair of Smith New Court, is that "the United Nations will lock horns with Iraq."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Fall on Reports Of Mideast Peace Initiatives

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Reports that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d could meet soon with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq caused gold prices to drop yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Talk that President Bush might be willing to negotiate helped push gold prices lower, said Frederick Demler, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in New York. The possibility of decreased tensions put pressure on crude oil prices, with the February crude oil contract falling $1.95 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which in turn depressed gold futures. 
 There was also some profit taking, as traders took advantage of a recent run-up in prices to bail out of the market, Mr. Demler said.
Further weakness in the economy also had an impact on the markets. Mr. Demler pointed to a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management that found the nation's economy had declined in December for the third consecutive month. The survey is considered a sensitive barometer of the economy's direction.
Gold settled $5.10 to $6.30 lower, with the active contract for delivery in February at $391.10 an ounce. The January contract fell $5.10, to $389.10. Silver was 7.8 cents to 8.9 cents lower, with January at $4.114 an ounce.
 
Grain and Soybeans Drop
 In other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures closed lower in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. "There was a negative attitude in the market because of the lack of demand for U.S. goods," said Dan Cekander, an analyst with Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago.
Soybean futures reached contract lows in the face of continued sluggish export demand. Also weighing on the market are perceptions that Brazilian and Argentine soybean crops are off to a good start because of favorable weather.
Wheat prices were relatively stable on word that China has entered the market for 600,000 metric tons. Corn futures were lower on slim export sales and expectations that farmers will increase the marketing of corn.
Heavy selling pushed sugar futures to life-of-contract lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. "The selloff was largely technical in nature, with nothing outside the ordinary" to account for this, said Harry Schwartz, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in New York.
Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Opens '91 With Drop; War Fears Limit the Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grim economic news sent the dollar stumbling yesterday, but traders said that concerns about war in the Persian Gulf helped to minimize the drop.
Currency trading in the year's first session was unexpectedly light, apparently because of a hesitation to take new positions in the days before the United Nation's Jan. 15 deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
 Markets were closed Tuesday in observance of New Year's Day.
"If it wasn't for the Middle East, the dollar would be much lower now," said Thomas J. Palladino, a currency trader in New York for Oesterreichische Landerbank of Austria. "Nobody's going to look to go short dollars with the deadline approaching."
The resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council last fall clears the way for a military attack if Iraq does not leave Kuwait by the middle of this month.
Because the dollar is considered a safe-harbor investment in times of war, the currency was partly insulated yesterday against several signs of a slumping United States economy. They included a lowering of the prime lending rate by leading American banks, a drop in nationwide construction spending and a decline in a survey of purchasing managers to the lowest level since the last recession. All pointed to lower interest rates in the United States, which makes the dollar less attractive relative to other currencies.
The dollar rallied briefly in the morning on reports that Eduard A. Shevardnadze said he had resigned as Soviet Foreign Minister because he feared bloody violence in his country. Traders interpreted the news as a sign of instability that could undermine neighboring economies.
Other than that, though, "today was strangely quiet," said Walter Simon, a vice president for Bank Julius Baer & Company "You are seeing a kind of December market where no one is putting aggressive moves before the deadline."
The dollar fell to a closing 134.30 Japanese yen in New York from Monday's closing 135.30 yen. In Europe, the dollar fell to 134.35 Japanese yen, from 135.40 yen at the close of trading Monday in Tokyo. The Tokyo markets remained closed yesterday.
In New York, the pound strengthened against the dollar. Sterling fetched $1.9445, compared with $1.9345 late Monday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9420, up from $1.9280 late Monday.
Other late American dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4872 German marks, down from 1.4885; 1.2613 Swiss francs, down from 1.2668; 5.0635 French francs, down from 5.0685; 1,112.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.75, and 1.1555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1599.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The Cypress Semiconductor Corporation said it had purchased an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant from the Control Data Corporation for $14.7 million.
T.J. Rodgers, chief executive of Cypress, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said his company was able to buy the "gold plated" factory at a bargain price and had hired 75 of the employees that work there. He said the factory, in Bloomington, Minn., cost $60 million to build and was used, among other things, to produce chips for the National Security Agency, the Government's code-breaking organization. Control Data had previously said it would leave the semiconductor business.

HEADLINE: White House Advisers Agree on Fed Nominee

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
President Bush's top economic advisers, resolving a months-long disagreement, have recommended that the President nominate Lawrence B. Lindsey, a conservative economist on the White House staff, to the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board, Administration officials said today.
The officials said Mr. Bush had also been advised to promote David W. Mullins, whom he placed on the board last year, to be vice chairman of the Fed. 
 The vacancies occurred when the vice chairman, Manuel H. Johnson, resigned in August. The changes do not suggest any change in Fed policy is in the offing.
At the White House today, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, did not deny the probable changes at the Federal Reserve but said, "We don't have a nominee to announce yet."
Because it controls the money supply and to some extent interest rates, the Federal Reserve has more influence over the economy than any other part of the Government. That is especially true now because the large budget deficit means that the President and Congress cannot afford to reduce taxes or increase Government spending, the fiscal weapons have sometimes been used to fight recessions.
 
A Harvard Professor
 Mr. Lindsey, who is 36 years old, was a professor of economics at Harvard before he joined the White House staff last year as a deputy assistant to the President for economic and domestic policy. He is most prominent in professional circles as an outspoken advocate of supply-side economics -- espousing the view that low taxes encourage people and businesses to work, save and invest and that they are the best medicine for the economy.
His book, "The Growth Experiment," which was published last year, lauds the tax cuts of the Reagan Administration and argues for a further cut in tax rates.
The Federal Reserve is not involved in tax policy, and Mr. Lindsey's views on monetary policy, the main purview of the Fed, are not well known. But other economists in the Administration who have talked with him say that he taught general economics courses at Harvard and that he is comfortable with monetary policy, even though it is not his main field of expertise.
The likelihood of Mr. Lindsey's nomination and Mr. Mullins's promotion was first reported this week by the syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak.
 
Executives Interviewed
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had originally hoped the President would put someone with experience in business on the Federal Reserve Board, Administration officials said, and several business executives were interviewed for the job. But the officials said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, preferred an economist, while John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, was most interested in picking a person with conservative credentials.
The selection of Mr. Lindsey, whose nomination would be subject to confirmation by Congress, would clearly satisfy Mr. Boskin, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Sununu. The promotion of Mr. Mullins, who was an Assistant Treasury Secretary and a Brady favorite before he was named to the Fed, was said to please Mr. Brady.
The Treasury Secretary harbored "some concern that the person should have some real world business experience," one of his aides said. But "there was no adversarial issue here," the aide continued, and Mr. Brady is happy with the outcome.
The promotion of Mr. Mullins does not suggest that he will become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; no vice chairman ever has. As a rule, the Fed chairman dominates the other six members of the Board.
Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman expires this summer. Presumably he wants to be reappointed for another four years, although he has been careful not to say so, and the White House has given no hint one way or another whether it would like him to stay on the job.
The prevailing view is that Mr. Greenspan's future depends in large part on the state of the economy this summer. If the recession turns out to be shallow, and a recovery has begun, a reappointment is likely. On the other hand if the economy is still mired in recession, Mr. Greenspan might be a scapegoat.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Decline by 19.1% in Midmonth

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Sales of cars and trucks made in the United States fell by 19.1 percent in mid-December, as demand for vehicles sank to the lowest level since 1982.
"It takes two to three months for a collapse in real income to hit home in the auto sector, and that is what we are seeing," Scott Merlis, an automotive analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said today. 
 Tom Webb, the chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, a industry group in McLean, Va., said the sales plunge was "worse than I expected." He linked the drop in vehicle sales to the nation's depressed real estate markets, which he said have eroded personal wealth and caused consumers to postpone purchases of new vehicles.
 
More Factory Closings Seen
 If the slump in car sales persists into the spring, as many analysts believe, the result will be a depressing effect on the economy, "because it means more pressure to lower inventories by keeping factories closed," Mr. Merlis said.
The major domestic automobile makers have resorted to widespread plant shutdowns to keep inventories from ballooning.
The 10 manufacturers that produce vehicles in the United States said today that they sold 206,983 vehicles from Dec. 11-20, compared with 255,757 in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Car sales fell by 17.7 percent, to 127,933 cars in mid-December. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.1 million, representing the lowest level of demand since 1982, compared with an annual rate of 6.5 million during the same period in 1989. The annual rate for the last 30 days was 5.6 million. Through the middle of last year, cars have sold at an average annual rate of about 6.9 million.
Sales of light trucks, which account for about a third of all vehicles sold, declined to 79,050 pickups, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, a drop of 21.2 percent.
 
A Broad Decline
 The mid-December downturn in sales was broad, affecting American as well as foreign-based auto makers with plants in the United States. Sales of small models were just as depressed as those of large ones.
The Big Three domestic auto makers reported a collective decline of 20.6 percent, with light trucks faring slightly worse than cars.
The Japanese car companies with American plants showed overall sales declines of 9.9 percent for cars, while those of light trucks rose by 51.9 percent, reflecting increased production.
The Toyota Motor Corporation, the only foreign auto maker to report sales of imported vehicles every 10 days, posted a decline of 8.5 percent in sales of its imported cars, and showed a drop of 2.7 percent in imported truck sales. Other foreign auto makers report such sales figures at the end of the month.
Sales of cars made at Toyota's two American factories, in Georgetown, Ky., and in the venture with the General Motors Corporation in Fremont, Calif., fell by 10.6 percent, to 6,270 cars.
 
G.M. Sales Fall 18%
 General Motors sold 59,978 cars made in the United States and Canada, down by 18 percent from a year earlier. Among its stronger sellers were Chevrolet's Geo Metro, G.M.'s most fuel-efficient car; its full-size Park Avenue, intermediate Regal and compact Skylark, all sold by Buick, and the Pontiac Grand Prix.
G.M. also posted weak sales of several models that have sold relatively well earlier in the year, including the Geo Prizm, Chevrolet Lumina and Cutlass Supreme.
The luxury tax that took effect on Tuesday, imposing a 10 percent surcharge on the portion of retail prices exceeding $30,000 for cars, apparently did little to enhance sales of G.M.'s Cadillac cars. The division reported an overall sales decline of 23.7 percent for its five models. The Ford Motor Company reported higher sales of its Lincoln Town Car in mid-December, but analysts suggested the gain reflected higher fleet sales rather than private retail customers.
Ford sold 32,364 cars in the 10-day period, a decline of 20.5 percent. The auto maker also posted sharp declines in sales of its Tempo and Festiva models, and sales of the Taurus and Mercury Sable also fell sharply.
Ford's light-truck sales fell by 21.4 percent, to 25,582.
 
Chrysler Off 19.2%
 The Chrysler Corporation's car sales declined by 19.2 percent, to 16,278. The sales of Chrysler mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks plunged by 36.9 percent, to 16,000.
Two weeks ago, the No. 3 domestic auto maker said it planned to offer rebates on its 1991 model mini-vans for the first time, a move that some analysts regarded as a concession that sales of Chrysler's most important single vehicle were slipping.
The Honda Motor Company sold 6,384 cars in mid-December, down by 43.2 percent. A Honda spokesman attributed the slump to "consumer uncertainties and concerns about the Middle East."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
For Muscovites And Gothamites, Shared Insights

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
It's a one-party town. Party bosses dictated the choice of the City Council leader. Just once in his five-year tenure was legislation passed that he had strongly opposed personally -- a human-rights bill -- and only after he deigned to allow a vote. The Council's elected president is largely a figurehead.
The Moscow City Council? No, Moscow on the Hudson. 
 New York City's emboldened legislature is only slowly emerging from its authoritarian tradition since last year, when a revised City Charter abolished the City Board of Estimate. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, all but abolished its underlying approach to government; changes wrought by the newly elected government of its capital city have been nothing short of revolutionary. Yet, all politics being local, Moscow hopes to learn from New York.
Last month, Ronnie M. Eldridge, a City Council member from Manhattan, was invited to confer there with her Soviet counterparts. Soviet local officials visited New York. And Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York was interviewed on the radio with Yuri Luzhkov, a Moscow Council official.
Both local legislatures are gaining power, although Moscow's seems infused with enough naivete or idealism so that some legislators would grant Muscovites the power to recall Council members (under the misguided presumption that it would never be invoked against the enlightened incumbents who proposed it).
Moscow's fledgling democrats constitute a majority, but only when they coalesce. Otherwise, they are consumed by bickering over procedure or previous political ties. Pavel Zhukov, a 32-year-old member of a Christian Democratic faction, complained the other day that many former Communists have re-emerged as Republicans -- "a strange name," Mr. Zhukov suggested, "because they are more socialist than Republican."
Insurgents in both councils, quickly grasping that talk is cheap, are struggling to transform speeches into concrete gestures that voters can appreciate, whether in responding to the shortage of cigarettes in Moscow or the abundance of cigarette smoke in New York.
 The political evolution in Moscow was likened to the early days of New York's Democratic reform movement by Ms. Eldridge, who offered an incisive impression of modern Soviet society: "It reminded me," she lamented, "of the Department of Motor Vehicles."
 New York's Council is growing, to 51 from 35 members. ("In three to five years, you're not going to know this place," its spokeswoman, Peg Breen, said yesterday, implying more quality than quantity.)
But Ms. Eldridge advised the unwieldy Moscow Council to contract, from its nearly 500 members. Also, to remember that seemingly arcane bills are better read than unread. And to differentiate between visionary proposals for parceling out road repairs to private contractors that have earned Moscow's Council a reputation for daring, and the illusion of power -- selectively erasing the Communist legacy by changing street names (new nomenclature, backed by community boards, accounted for more than 4 in 10 local laws approved by New York's Council last year) and venturing into foreign policy (a petition circulated in the Moscow Council proclaimed that Li Peng, the Chinese Prime Minister, was unwelcome).
"That democrats are in power does not at all mean that they wield any power," said Gavriil K. Popov, the Moscow Mayor.
With Mr. Popov ailing, Mr. Dinkins was joined by Mr. Luzhkov on last month's radio program, in which they expressed camaraderie, shared frustrations and lobbied for more help from their national governments. Mr. Dinkins expressed hope that the urban compact adopted by the gathering of United States mayors he convened last fall could be discussed with President Bush before he confers next month with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. "I hope we get to see our President before yours does," Mr. Dinkins said.
New York and Moscow share many urban problems, Mr. Luzhkov said, though officials in the Soviet capital are scrambling to supply food and housing to citizens whose basic needs may have seemed less pressing before their votes became more coveted.
That Councilman Zhukov and his 54-year-old Republican colleague, Dr. Igor Yeremeyev, stayed at the old New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, a headquarters for the Unification Church, may help explain Dr. Yeremeyev's observation that New York, in some respects, "seems very well organized." Ever diplomatic, they were noncommittal about just what they might learn from their counterparts at City Hall.
"We will be facing problems with the unemployed and the poor," said Mr. Zhukov, an intense former scientist. "The problems of New York are our future problems."

Money-Fund Yields Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
For the week ended yesterday, yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Market Fund Report were up for the first time in six weeks, as a result of year-end pressures on short-term interest rates.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's said the widespread cuts in the prime rate by banks yesterday showed that the Federal Reserve Bank's efforts to reduce short-term interest rates were finally taking hold. 
 In the next few weeks, as short-term interest rates fall, yields offered by money market funds, which generally fall more slowly than other money market investments, will look more attractive, analysts said.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said that until the bottom of this economic downturn was evident, the pressure would be on the Fed to continue easing credit. He also cautioned investors about how they interpret the drop in short-term rates in January. "Part will be real, and part a return to normalcy after seasonal year-end pressures tightened credit," he said.
In tax-exempt money funds, the average number of days that securities are held in portfolios fell by 2, to 53 days. Assets declined by $2 billion, to $83.5 billion.
The average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield was up sharply for the week, reflecting an abundant supply of municipal securities and little demand from investors. The average was 6.41 percent, up 59 basis points. For the 30-day compounded average yield, the increase was 24 basis points, to 5.81 percent.
The current seven-day tax-exempt yield is equivalent to 8.90 percent for investors in the 28 percent Federal tax bracket, and 9.56 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Michigan Daily Tax-Free Income fund produced the best return, at 7.84 percent. The fund is managed by Reich & Tang L.P., New York City.
Assets on taxable funds fell a sharp $9 billion, to $409 billion, with institutional funds down by $5.4 billion, to $90.8 billion, and consumer funds down by $4.3 billion, to $318.7 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield rose by 23 basis points, to 7.65 percent, while the 30-day rose by 4 basis points, to 7.51 percent.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the funds as reported by The Bank Rate Monitor's national index, are down by a basis point, to 5.90 percent, and six-month certificates of deposit fell by 5 basis points to 7.21 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
St. Martin's to Miss Big Convention

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
In a break with publishing tradition, St. Martin's Press said yesterday that it and its subsidiary Tor Books would not exhibit at the American Booksellers Association convention in New York in June because of the high cost of doing so.
In addition, a number of publishers whose books are distributed by St. Martin's said they agreed with the decision and also would not exhibit. They include J. P. Tarcher, Rodale Press and Pharos Books. 
 St. Martin's, which last year had two big best sellers -- "September," by Rosamunde Pilcher and "By Way of Deception," by Victor Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy -- will be the first large publishing house to pull out of the annual convention since Avon Books did so in 1982, before returning the next year.
 
Association Is Disappointed
 Bernard Rath, the executive director of the association, expressed disappointment at St. Martin's decision. "Certainly, every publisher has the right to determine how they wish to spend their marketing dollars, and I respect St. Martin's decision to experiment with spending theirs in other ways," he said. "In the past, when people have chosen to bypass the A.B.A. convention, they have generally found that the loss in exposure for their titles and authors was significant to return in future years."
The association recently predicted that attendance at the four-day convention, scheduled for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from June 1 to 4, could surpass the previous record of 25,589 participants in 1988, when it was held in Anaheim, Calif.
And association officials said the sale of exhibition booths is running ahead of last year at this time, with only about 100 of the 2,550 booths available still unsold. All 170 booths in the small-press section, for instance, have already been sold.
Thomas McCormack, the chairman of St. Martin's, which is based in New York, said he regretted having to make the decision. "But we've been thinking about it for a couple of years," he added. "We sent 55 people to the convention in Las Vegas last year, and it cost us $250,000, and we sent 65 people to the convention in Washington the year before. Even though it might cost less this year in our own backyard, you're still looking at a handsome six-figure cost because you have to fly in sales reps from around the country and put them up in hotels."
 
Looking for Cutbacks
 Publishers have long lamented the cost of attending the four-day convention each spring, at which books scheduled for publication in the fall are displayed for booksellers from around the nation. In recent years, publishing houses have tried to economize by cutting back on the number of people in attendance and taking fewer booths than usual.
Last year, St. Martin's, which is owned by Macmillan Publishers Ltd. of Britain, took about 30 booths at the convention.
But the same publishers who complain that not enough individual booksellers attend the convention have also concluded that exhibiting at the convention buys good will and thus is a necessary cost of doing business. Just about every head of a publishing house attends part of the convention.
When Avon withdrew, it did so at a time when it was embroiled in a lawsuit with the Northern California Booksellers Association. Avon's president then felt that the national association was partial to the California group. But Avon returned the next year and has exhibited each year since.
 
Reason for Withdrawal
 Mr. McCormack said his decision to withdraw was unrelated to St. Martin's assigned booth location -- locations are determined months ahead by lottery -- or by the recession.
"I can honestly tell you that 1990 was by far the most profitable and successful for the company during my 20 years here, and our 1991 projections are for another good year," he said. "We're just looking for cost-effective ways of using the money that now goes to airlines and hotels to sell more books."

HEADLINE: The White House Agrees: It's a Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The White House today acknowledged for the first time that the country is in a recession, a judgment reached weeks, if not months, ago by most private economists.
In a television interview this morning, Michael J. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, said, "It does appear that after the longest economic expansion in the peacetime history of the United States, the country probably has entered a recession." 
 In another interview later, Mr. Boskin left no doubt that he believed the country was in a recession and that he had intended to convey that message on the television broadcast.
Until now, the top figures in the Bush Administration had used words like "lull," "slowdown" and "downturn" to describe the state of the economy but had avoided the word "recession." They have repeatedly maintained that the problems would soon be over and that the economy would quickly rebound, a position Mr. Boskin held to today.
Mr. Boskin's comments came amid a spate of negative economic reports. The nation's manufacturing economy declined in December, to its lowest point since the recession of 1982, a survey of purchasing managers found. Construction spending fell six-tenths of a percent in November to its lowest level in two years, the Commerce Department reported. And sales of cars and trucks made in the United States fell 19.1 percent in mid-December, as demand for vehicles sank to the lowest level since 1982. [Page D8.]
With the flurry of negative reports and a 4.18-point drop in the Commodity Research Bureau index, the prices of Treasury securities rose sharply and interest rates fell. [Page D6.]
President Bush, in an interview with David Frost taped Dec. 16 for broadcast tonight on the Public Broadcasting Service, said some regions were clearly in a recession but that he was not prepared to declare one nationwide. The President also said, "I happen to believe, and I think that most economists believe, that the recession will be mild and that the whole country will come out of it in not too many months from now."
Mr. Bush's view that the recession will not be severe reflects the thinking of Mr. Boskin and others in the Administration but does not suggest significant policy changes.
The data on the severity of the recession are not yet conclusive. Some private economists agree with the Administration. But others cointend that even if oil prices fall soon, the strains in the banking system and the unusually high levels of debt held by companies and individuals presage a long and deep recession.
At the regular White House briefing for reporters today, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, conceded, "We're in a recessionary kind of period."
Mr. Fitzwater said officials were "reluctant to give some official kind of name for it when it hasn't met all the economists' prerogatives."
But an Administration economist said that Mr. Boskin had decided to speak out and that other top officials would soon follow suit because they did not want to look foolish by denying the obvious.
The popular definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of contraction in the economy as measured by the gross national product adjusted for inflation. In the most recent quarter for which complete data are available, July through September, the G.N.P., the total output of goods and sevices, grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported last month.
 
Preliminary Forecast
 A preliminary forecast by Administration economists in preparation for next fiscal year's budget, estimates that the economy shrank at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1990 and will drop an additional 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year.
Officials who provided those figures, which have not made public but were reported today in The Wall Street Journal, said the official forecast to be prepared late this month would not differ much, unless the Persian Gulf situation changed markedly.
The Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end, has not made a formal decision yet, but issued a statement last month that a recession probably began between June and September.
The Administration's preliminary economic forecast is in line with those of many private economists. After shrinking for two quarters, the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of a paltry three-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter of this year, at a 2 percent rate in the third quarter and a 2.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
 
Oil Prices Blamed
 In his interview this morning on the "Today Show" on NBC, Mr. Boskin put most of the blame for the recession on the uncertain military situation in the Persian Gulf and the rise in oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. He said the recession would be short and mild.
Interviewed later in his office, Mr. Boskin said he expected that the recession would be less serious than other recent ones because the Federal Reserve was pushing down interest rates and because business inventories were not so large.
Lower interest rates should encourage businesses to expand, and lean inventories should mean that businesses will produce more goods.

HEADLINE: U.S. Chips' Gain Is Japan's Loss

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 2

 BODY:
For the first time in more than a decade, American semiconductor companies gained market share in 1990 at the expense of their Japanese competitors, a market research company reported today.
The figures, based on sales in dollars, suggest that after years of decline, American computer chip manufacturers might finally have stopped the erosion in their competitiveness, which has become a national concern. However, experts cautioned that the figures could represent not the start of a long-term trend, but an aberration caused by a decline in prices for memory chips, which are made primarily by the Japanese. 
 "It's encouraging, but certainly not a permanent sign of a turnaround," said Andrew A. Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the trade group representing American semiconductor companies.
Others were more encouraged, saying that the American decline was at an end. "I believe we've hit the bottom, I really do," said T. J. Rodgers, chief executive of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a chip manufacturer in San Jose, Calif.
 
A Matter of Concern
 American companies garnered 36.5 percent of the worldwide semiconductor market in 1990, up from 34.9 percent in 1989, according to the figures released by Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose. That was the first time the American market share has increased since 1979.
Worldwide market share of Japanese companies fell to 49.5 percent, from 52.1 percent in 1989, the first drop since 1982. Over all, worldwide sales of semiconductors in 1990 rose 2 percent, to $58.4 billion, according to Dataquest, whose figures are widely relied upon by the industry and the Government.
In 1979, American companies had 57.9 percent of the world market for computer chips while Japanese companies had 25.8 percent.
The steady erosion of the American position since then has become a matter of concern because semiconductors are considered vital for the nation's economic health and military preparedness. The silicon chips etched with microscopic electronic circuits are the basic building blocks of all electronic machines, including computers, videocassette recorders, robots, missiles and radar systems.
 
'A Change in the Slope'
 The Government has taken a number of actions to help the American chip producers, including an investment in Sematech, a consortium in Austin, Tex., that is developing advanced techniques in chip manufacturing, and the negotiation of a trade agreement in 1986 that aimed to open Japanese markets to American semiconductors and stop the selling of Japanese chips at prices below cost in the United States.
Jerry Banks, director of the semiconductor group at Dataquest, said it was too soon to say the figures represent "a reversal of the tide." However, he said, "we may see a change in the slope," with American declines and Japanese gains in market share coming far more slowly than in the past.
Japanese companies lost market share in 1990 because of the same product that has been responsible for their gains over the last decade -- memory chips.
Japanese companies have come to dominate production of dynamic random access memories, the main type of chip used to store information in computers. But in 1990, prices for D-RAM's fell as Korean producers tried to break into the market while demand for such chips did not grow appreciably, Mr. Banks said.
As a result, overall revenues from D-RAM's fell 30 percent in 1990, hurting the Japanese companies. Mr. Banks said it appeared that pricing pressure on D-RAM's would continue, depriving Japanese companies of a major source of profit.
 
Two Companies Dominate
 By contrast, the American companies made their gains largely on the basis of increased sales of microprocessors, the chips that act as the "brains" of personal computers.
Two companies in particular, the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., and Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill., dominate the market for the microprocessors used in personal computers, and neither company is allowing other companies to manufacture their most advanced chips. That minimizes price competition and allows the companies to keep all the revenues from sales of their chips.
Intel rose to become the world's fifth-largest semiconductor company in 1990, up from eighth place in 1989, with its semiconductor revenues growing 29 percent, according to Dataquest. Motorola retained its ranking as the fourth-largest semiconductor company in the world, with its revenues rising 11 percent in 1990.
By contrast, the NEC Corporation, the Toshiba Corporation and Hitachi Ltd., all of Japan, retain their standings as the world's three largest chip producers. Each, however, suffered a decline of about 1 percent in semiconductor revenues.
Another factor that appears to be helping the American companies is that they are selling more chips in Japan, partly as a result of the 1986 semiconductor trade agreement between the United States and Japan.
The Semiconductor Industry Association has said that American market share in Japan climbed to about 13 percent of the Japanese market from about 8.5 percent before the trade agreement was negotiated. However, Dataquest figures show that the market share of American companies in Japan rose only to 10.4 percent in 1990 from just under 10 percent in 1989.
 
Impact of the Yen
 Some experts say the American semiconductor industry still faces grim prospects. Michael Borrus, deputy director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy at the University of California, said Japanese companies continued to heavily outspend American companies on new plants and equipment and on research and development, meaning they will advance at a faster rate than American companies.
However, others argue that the decline in market share of American companies has been exaggerated because the Dataquest figures do not take into account the strong rise in the yen against the dollar that occurred starting in 1985. Because Japanese companies get most of their revenues in yen, a rise in the yen translates into a gain in revenues as measured in dollars, even if a Japanese company sells the same number of chips.
Mr. Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor said that if currency exchange rates were held constant, the American market share loss and Japanese gain since 1981 would be about 7 percentage points instead of the 15 percentage points or so commonly reported.
"I think the actual fact is that we have been at par with the Japanese -- nobody gaining or losing ground -- since 1985," he said.
In all, six of the world's 10 largest semiconductor producers are Japanese, three -- including Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas -- are American and one is European, according to Dataquest. The International Business Machines Corporation, which is one of the largest semiconductor producers in the world, is not counted because it does not sell its chips.

HEADLINE: German Drug Makers Refuse To Lower Prices in the East

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Major drug companies in western Germany are refusing to ship their products to the eastern part of the country because of a clause in the German reunification treaty that says that as of the new year, their products must be sold there for 45 percent of the prices in the western part of the country.
In turn, pharmacists in some parts of eastern Germany closed their shops in a one-day protest against the measure, which called on the drug producers, alone among manufacturers, to effectively subsidize the cost of economic unity by charging less in the region that used to be East Germany. 
 In the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, pharmacies in major cities like Schwerin and Rostock remained closed in response to a call by local pharmacists' associations to protest the measure by western German companies like Hoechst and Bayer, which rank among the largest chemical and drug companies in the world.
Spokesmen for the companies said they would refuse to deliver products at reduced prices in the east.
The industry's action comes at an unsettling time for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has not yet concluded talks with his Free Democratic partners on forming a new Cabinet.
The new year is expected to test the patience of Germans in the east, who, like other people in Eastern European lands formerly ruled by the Communists, are seeing their hopes and expectations mired in unemployment and insecurity.
Drug prices are a particularly sensitive issue in Germany, since manufacture and distribution is a highly regulated industry and retail price levels tend to be far higher here than in the United States or other European countries. Indeed, some officials argue that the prices foreseen for eastern Germany, even with the 55 percent rebate, are still at a level above wholesale prices the industry charges some of its other European customers.

HEADLINE: MAYOR AND UNIONS AGREE ON 5% RAISE IN NEW YORK PACT;
Cost Is $233 Million

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration and two large municipal unions announced a tentative labor agreement yesterday that would provide 150,000 city workers with a wage and benefit increase of 5 percent over 15 months, less than city teachers are to receive but more than some fiscal experts say the city should pay.
The proposed contract appeared to reflect a decision by the administration or union leaders or both to trade a reduction in the city work force, expected to be outlined later this month by city officials, for higher wages for those who remain. That approach, along with the cost of the proposed new contract -- $233 million -- and its reliance on pension fund savings, came under immediate criticism from some financial experts and politicians. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who last week warned that the city's finances were running out of control, did not address the specifics of yesterday's agreement but took the opportunity to "reaffirm" his previous comments.
 
Concern Over Layoffs
 "It's just going to mean more layoffs," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent research organization financed by businesses.
Like the teachers' contract on which it is modeled and which generated a barrage of criticism, the new agreement depends in large part on savings from reduced city contributions to the workers' pension fund, a strategy that could one day add to the city's budget problems if the fund's earnings fail to match the new assumptions.
But at a City Hall news conference, Mayor David N. Dinkins defended the proposed contract, arguing that since it relied on money either already in the budget or on the pension fund savings, it did not increase the size of the spending gaps the city must close in the coming years, which estimates put in the billion-dollar range.
"They're satisfied with it and we're satisfied with it, and it serves our people well," said Mr. Dinkins, who was supported by municipal labor unions during the 1989 election campaign but who since taking office has angered those unions by asserting that layoffs would be necessary to balance the city's books.
The agreements with District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, along with the teachers' union, would bring to two-thirds the total of the city's work force under new contracts.
As terms of the deal circulated around the city yesterday, several of New York City's fiscal monitors, including Allen Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, and Elinor B. Bachrach, Deputy State Comptroller for New York City, joined Mr. Horton of the citizens budget group in questioning aspects of the proposed contract, including why the administration was using the pension savings for raises, rather than to keep more workers on the payroll and maintain services.
There were also worries about cutting pension contributions while the performance of financial markets in which pension funds invest is uncertain. And there were questions about how much money a similar maneuver would generate for use in settling contracts for uniformed city employees like firefighters and police officers, who traditionally receive slightly higher raises than other city workers.
At the news conference, Mr. Dinkins, perhaps anticipating more of the criticism that the teachers' contract has generated, asserted that he would freeze the wages of the unions' members for the rest of the 1992 fiscal year after the proposed agreement expired.
 
'All That Could Be Expected'
 But the union leaders, who joined the Mayor yesterday at City Hall, immediately rejected a freeze, saying it would be part of the bargaining next time.
"We extracted from these negotiations all that could be extracted," said Barry Feinstein, head of the teamsters union local. "There was nothing left to take from the table."
The proposed contract would cost the city $232.8 million in the 1991 and 1992 fiscal years. About half of that is already in the city budget, which provides for a 1.5 percent annual raise for city workers; the rest would result from raising earnings assumptions for the workers' pension fund investments to 9 percent from the current 8.25 percent. That would require the city to contribute less money to the fund.
Under the new contract, workers would get a 3.5 percent pay increase in the first year and an additional 1 percent increase at the start of the second. Also at that time, the city would contribute $100 per worker to the health and welfare fund and more vacation days for new workers. That would amount to increases of three-tenths of 1 percent and two-tenths of 1 percent respectively, according to Eric J. Schmertz, the city's Labor Relations Commissioner.
The teachers, in contrast, received a 5.5 percent raise in a one-year contract. Increased benefits brought the total to 5.8 percent.
When that agreement was reached in October, some feared it would set the pattern for the rest of the labor talks and add to the city's growing fiscal problems. Yesterday, city officials seemed to emphasize the differences between the teachers' contract and the new settlement, repeatedly stating that the most recent agreement would not cause added budgetary strain.
But the settlement also seemed structured to allow union leaders to emphasize how close they came to the teachers' raise. The leaders said yesterday that they expected union members to approve the settlement.
Legislative leaders, through spokesmen, did not indicate any reason why the pension adjustment would not be approved.
 
Similar Arrangement
 When he signed legislation approving a similar pension arrangement in the teachers' contract last week, Mr. Cuomo took the occasion to warn of grave fiscal pressures on the city, angering some municipal officials. In a statement yesterday, the Governor, who is embarking on major salary negotiations of his own with unions representing state workers, said:
"It is the Mayor's responsibility to decide what contracts to make and he has done that here. My interest is the larger financial plan that the Mayor says accommodates the contracts he has made."
The contracts cover a wide range of city workers, from accountants to zookeepers, at salaries running from $16,000 to about $60,000 a year. The teamsters contract would expire at the end of September 1991; the District Council 37 contract would expire at the end of that year.
"It would have been fiscally more reassuring if there had been a longer-term contract," said Nancy Barbe, an assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "Now we're faced with the prospect of going through this whole thing again in fiscal 1992."
The settlement comes as the city's economy continues to falter, job losses mount and tax revenues suffer. In two weeks, the Dinkins administration is to unveil a fiscal plan for the coming years that is expected to call for cuts in the municipal work force of perhaps 10,000 or more positions as the city struggles to close huge budget gaps.
So the new agreement, like the teachers' contract, would seem to guarantee that some union members would be getting raises while others would be losing jobs. But union leaders said yesterday they had no assurance that taking lower raises would have insured that more members keep their jobs.
Victor Gotbaum, a labor-management relations professor at the City University and former head of District Council 37, called the situation "a Hobson's choice" for union leaders.
 
'Already a Beating"
 "People are taking a cut in terms of real wages of 4 or 4.5 percent," he said. "How much of a beating can you expect your members to take?"
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said he supported the proposed contract. "A smaller, more efficient, reasonably paid work force is better than a larger, underpaid work force," he said.
But Mr. Horton said the city should have stuck the 1.5 percent raise it had included in its budget.
"We're not playing accounting games here," he said. "The city is short on money, that's the real issue. However they phrase it, the city needs the money. And they just decided to give it away."

HEADLINE: About 10% of Credit Unions Are Privately Insured

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The collapse of a private Rhode Island deposit insurance concern on Tuesday is a reminder that although Federal deposit insurance is taken as a given in banking in most parts of the country, it is not a given for credit unions. One out of every four Americans is a member of a credit union.
Indeed, about 10 percent of the credit unions -- more than 1,400 with $18.6 billion of deposits in more than half the states -- have chosen to create their own insurance programs. 
 The National Credit Union Administration in Washington operates a federally backed credit union insurance program, which consumers can readily identify by their display of a rectangular sign showing the N.C.U.A. initials, that covers the rest of the industry. The coverage is the same as that for banks and savings and loan associations, with accounts up to $100,000 protected. The credit union fund holds about $1.30 of reserves for every $100 of insured deposits, more than twice the level of reserves at the Federal insurance fund for banks.
 
Nine Private Insurers Left
 The credit unions without Federal insurance are in states whose laws have also sanctioned the use of private deposit insurers. The nine remaining credit union insurance funds say they are solvent. Still, the future of private insurers has been clouded by the Rhode Island experience.
Even though credit unions have avoided the losses that have plagued banks and saving and loan associations recently, the experience of the last 10 years shows that when trouble strikes, private deposit insurance funds have lacked the strength and credibility needed to survive.
"The private insurance funds are well intentioned, but they are fundamentally flawed by inadequate capital and the lack of a sound reinsurance policy," said Bert Ely, a banking consultant and an expert on deposit insurance in Arlington, Va. "Anytime one of their large insured institutions fails, they have shown a lack of staying power."
 
Difference From Failed Fund
 Mr. Ely, who is an advocate of private deposit insurance, said the remaining private insurers had not coordinated their businesses so that the losses of one could be absorbed by others. The remaining nine private insurers back only credit-union deposits, unlike the Rhode Island fund. It also insured deposits of loan and investment companies, which were allowed to make risky loans to businesses.
Since the first American credit unions began early this century, the cooperative spirit of savers, who would pool their deposits to make loans to each other, has been a successful formula. Even during the Depression, credit unions fared better than banks. During the 1980's, credit unions have been expanding rapidly, while avoiding the losses from bad real estate loans that have plagued banks and savings institutions.
"The attitude of the credit union movement has been to take care of itself," with the private insurers staying close enough to the industry to spot problems early, said Charles Filson, president of Callahan & Associates, a consulting firm for credit unions and representative for the nine corporations that insure credit union deposits.
But in Rhode Island the private insurer failed to spot problems that were severe enough that 11 of the 35 credit unions it insured have been found by Federal authorities to be insolvent or deeply troubled. One key problem was regulations allowing the privately insured credit unions to make up to half their loans for various kinds of businesses. Nationally, business loans account for less than 1 percent of all credit union loans.
 
Vulnerable to Losses
 Depositors in credit unions and the nine other deposit-taking organizations insured by the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation are vulnerable to losses. The state government, which had oversight responsibility for 35 credit unions and 11 other institutions, including banks insured by the insurance corporation, has not promised to cover any possible depositor losses.
Indeed, none of the states that allow local credit unions to operate without Federal deposit insurance have pledged state money to repay depositors should the insurance plan fail.
The failure in 1985 of private insurance companies backing deposits at state-chartered savings and loan associations in Ohio and Maryland alerted state officials to the danger of local insurance funds. Wisconsin, Connecticut, New Mexico, Utah and Virginia are among the states that have stopped allowing private deposit insurance in recent years.
"The private funds suffer from a perception problem," said Richard W. Ottow, credit union commissioner in Wisconsin, where a cooperative insurance program financed by credit unions was ended in 1985. "We knew our credit unions and fund were strong, but we kept getting members asking, 'Is our money federally insured?' To the members that was the bottom line."
The N.C.U.A. said yestereday that it expected that 22 of the Rhode Island credit unions would be allowed to join the other 13,103 credit unions in the Federal insurance program. Seven of the 22 were approved to reopen on Monday.
 
N.C.U.A.'s Assessment
 "The credit union industry as a whole is in very good shape," said Roger W. Jepsen, chairman of the N.C.U.A. But at 11 Rhode Island credit unions, which the N.C.U.A. is not expected to accept for Federal insurance, he added, losses were great enough that they were insolvent, or else "they had such severe problems that they were not insurable."
Mr. Jepsen said he expected the events in Rhode Island "to cause more state-chartered credit unions to apply for Federal insurance," even though it generally costs more than the private programs. The $2 billion insurance fund operated by the N.C.U.A. has never experienced a year of loss, unlike the Federal deposit insurance fund for banks, which has suffered four consecutive years of losses.
Mr. Jepsen said that the problem in Rhode Island was state laws that allowed credit unions to make riskier loans than are normal in the industry, including commercial real estate loans. In addition, in the past six weeks N.C.U.A. examiners have found "a lot of things going on there which we don't permit," Mr. Jepsen said, as well as high levels of delinquent loans and improper records.
In Massachusetts, which is suffering from the same economic recession as Rhode Island, the Massachusetts Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation has not been experienced any unusual losses, said Robert J. Maietta, chief executive. "We are doing quite well," he added.
The Massachusetts fund has $1.50 of reserves for every $100 of deposits, making it one of the strongest deposit insurance funds by that measure.
 
Insuring Credit Unions
 
The nine private groups that insure state-chartered credit unions. The Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation was closed Tuesday. Credit unions covered by these nine insurers are not backed by Federal insurance funds.
 
The California Credit Union Share Guaranty Association, based in Pomona, insures $412 million in 140,462 accounts.
 
The Credit Union Insurance Corporation is based in Baltimore. The group did not return calls seeking information about its accounts.
 
The Florida Credit Union Guaranty Corporation, based in Orlando, Fla., insures $1.6 billion in 559,086 accounts.
 
The Georgia Credit Union Deposit Insurance Corporation, based in Atlanta, insures $1.2 bilion.
 
The Massachusetts Credit Union Share Insurance Corporation, based in Boston, insures $3 billion at 140 credit unions in the state with 548,000 accounts.
 
The Mutual Guaranty Corporation, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., insures $2 billion at 324 credit unions in five states.
 
The National Deposit Insurance Corporation, based in Dublin, Ohio, insures $5.4 billion at 420 credit unions in 22 states.
 
The Texas Share Guaranty Credit Union, based in Austin, insures $2.4 billion at 286 credit unions.
 
The Washington Credit Union Share Guaranty Association, in Bellevue, insures $1.4 billion in 670,000 accounts at 100 credit unions.

HEADLINE: Where Is Congress on the Gulf?

 BODY:
Will Congress debate and vote on President Bush's war policy in the Persian Gulf? Will Mr. Bush ask it to? These questions belong at the top of the agenda when Congressional leaders meet with the President today.
Until now, the Congress has shirked its constitutional duty to debate a declaration of war. This week some members intend to introduce a resolution to allow six months more for economic sanctions on Iraq and diplomacy to work. But Congressional leaders want to dodge the issue by putting off a vote. 
 That's unconscionable. While hundreds of thousands of young Americans gird for battle in the deserts of Arabia, their elected representatives can't summon up the courage to confront their responsibilities at home.
The leaders' reason for their silence won't wash: that a debate could be divisive, easing the pressure on Saddam Hussein. Debate is not divisive unless the policy being debated is. Better to know that now, before Americans are called upon to die for it. That Mr. Bush's brinkmanship is debatable is no secret. Debate over the wisdom of war is raging everywhere in America except where it's supposed to -- in Congress.
 During Vietnam, when Presidents took it upon themselves to wage war, Congress thought it necessary to enact the War Powers Act -- really a "War Responsibility Act" -- forcing the President and Congress to face up to a war decision in full public view. But Mr. Bush shied away from invoking the act, asserting that U.S. troops are in no imminent danger of hostilities. Closing its eyes, Congress accepted his claim, then left town just as he put aside Desert Shield and picked up Desert Sword.
Now Congress is back, but its leaders still duck a debate. Take Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, for example. In one breath he cogently argues against a war anytime soon: "So long as there is a reasonable opportunity that the present strategy of the threat of the use of force, the economic sanctions and the diplomatic activity will . . . get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, then I think you ought to stick with it and not go to war."
In the next breath he opposes a vote now to stay Mr. Bush's hand: "I think the name of the game at the moment is to ratchet up the pressure on Saddam Hussein in every way that we can. You do not want to put a resolution or a declaration on the floor of the House or the Senate . . . because that will send a signal of divisiveness."
By this tortured logic, the need to maintain a credible threat of war would mean that the time will never come for Congress to vote.
The leadership's position would be more understandable if there had been a behind-the-scenes deal. The rumor around Washington was that in return for unfettered authority to threaten war, Mr. Bush had pledged not to wage war without Congressional approval. Last weekend the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Les Aspin, scotched that talk: "The Administration has not in any time, any forum, ever committed to that."
A deferred debate on a declaration of war invites divisiveness at the worst possible time -- after Mr. Bush takes the country to war. Mr. Bush's brinkmanship is running out of time to show results. If Congress prefers sanctions and diplomacy to an early war, why not vote to give them a reasonable chance to work?

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
State of the State of the Union

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It all started with Edmund Burke's 1769 essay on the "present state of the nation"; our Constitution-writers then required that the President report to the Congress information of the "state of the Union" along with "such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."
Now, every January, governors intone their "State of the State," mayors their "State of the City" and executives everywhere their states-of-the-whatevers. As a result, the state of the audience is bored to the point of stupefaction. 
 With characteristic bumption, White House chief of staff John Sununu stole a hallowed tradition from the Speaker of the House and announced that the President would be the Congress's guest on Jan. 27.
That's less then two weeks after the Jan. 15 U.N. Kuwait deadline. The National Security Council staff can't start on the foreign-affairs part yet because it doesn't know what Saddam (defiantly pronounced SAD'm by Mr. Bush, to annoy Sa-DOM) Hussein will do.
The Domestic Council's Roger Porter, however, knows that the President is getting knocked for do-nothingism at home, and is busily circulating a memo with a dozen potential "initiatives."
He enlivens one with a couple of facts: (1) about the same number of students, 45 million, attend primary and secondary schools as did 10 years ago, and (2) in constant dollars, adjusted for inflation, $79 billion more is being spent on education in 1990 than in 1980. Has this added state and local spending helped education all that much?
Then come choices for ideas, including: (a) vouchers, to let parents and students choose their schools, introducing competition; (b) alternative certification of teachers, and (c) site-based management. (My source would have explained those last two but heard Sununu footsteps.)
When the President makes his choices, the hard part comes for the State-of-the-Unionists: using the President's speech to energize and motivate school reform, not subsidize it. The Feds pay only 7 percent of the education bill, which is proper in a diverse nation; besides, the old revenue-sharing has now become deficit-sharing. The President must exhort, knowing he will be zapped by educators for not proposing more spending.
Other areas on the domestic list range from a few thoughts on oil conservation (to be called a "national energy strategy") to some necessary specifics on rebuilding the deposit insurance system for banks ("banking reform").
But what about the great debate that is supposed to be going on in the Bush Administration, pitting the neo-neocon "New Paradigm" empowerment-choice-enterprise crowd against the root-canal social Darmanism of the budget pragmatists? (I would explain those catchy terms, but I hear Sununu footsteps.)
The intellectual ferment is not all that profound. Budget boss Richard Darman mocked the packaging of ideas put forward last year by Jim Pinkerton, the gangling Bush wunderkind who takes government seriously, which happily propelled his "New Paradigm" out of obscurity -- at least to political-philosophy freaks.
But the Darman diatribe was smart-alecky, not substantial; he has since made his peace with the earnest Bushies who have a creditable approach to coping with social welfare in a time of austerity. "Empowerment" -- Jack Kemp's term for offering bootstraps in place of shoes -- has not been seriously challenged, even by Democrats. It ain't new, but it ain't bad, and has no competition.
From these ideas, the President's men will submit "decision memos." If Mr. Bush wants to pacify Congress, he will include the proposals in a speech that praises the Clean Air Act and hails the way the leadership took him to the cleaners on the budget.
If he decides to take the Congress on, Mr. Sununu will direct the speechwriters to adopt an abrasive tone, demanding a "recovery package" including a revenue-producing capital gains tax cut, and putting a thumb in every incumbent's eye with a call for a limitation on the years a representative can serve.
Today, the unabrasive writers will put those decisions into an upbeat speech draft, or updraft, destined to be rewritten to reflect the triumphant, apologetic or resolute Persian Gulf section of the address -- the heart of the matter.
And that's my State of the Speech report on the state of the decisions on the state of the draft of the State of the Union.

HEADLINE: Boat Luxury Tax Drives an Industry Aground

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have been in the boat business since 1972. The luxury tax that came into effect this year is in general unfair, but as it pertains to boats, grossly so. My industry was singled out and is being crushed by this tax. This will translate into lost jobs for about 600,000 people if something is not done quickly.
The luxury tax on new boats is a cruel hoax played on the public at the expense of those who work in the industry. The United States boat industry, and the 600,000 workers employed directly in manufacturing, were served as the sacrificial lamb to appease those who insisted on soaking the rich during Federal budget negotiations.
The Treasury Department has acknowledged that the 10 percent luxury tax on boats will not produce tax revenues to help solve the budget crisis. The luxury tax revenue will not even cover the income tax revenue lost to unemployed workers and bankrupt manufacturers.
The general thinking is that the rich can afford it, and an extra 10 percent tax isn't going to stop the fat cats from indulging in their toys. What most people don't realize is that those able to buy a new boat also have the ability to decide not to buy. And that is what they have done.
Since the luxury tax came into effect last Sept. 30 for newly ordered boats, nobody has bought a new boat on which the tax would apply! The National Marine Manufacturers' Association, the industry association that tracks such things, can't find a single sale in the whole country! Not one! However, the association has been able to document in excess of 100,000 layoffs (blue-collar workers -- not fat cats) and numerous boat manufacturers going out of business. All during which not a single dollar of luxury tax has been collected.
Let's leave for the moment that the boat luxury tax produces negative revenue and discuss the unfairness of such an excise tax. A great number of people who buy boats are not rich but simply buy a boat to live on, in lieu of a house. A significant number who buy a boat that costs more than $100,000 do live on board. Should they be penalized for such a life style?
Or, why is a new boat a luxury, but a used boat not? Why is a new boat in excess of $100,000 a luxury, but a $500,000 vacation home in Aspen, Colo., not? Plenty of $100,000-plus motor homes are bought every year. Why aren't they a luxury? Why isn't a $250,000 airplane or a $10,000 fur coat a luxury?
All excise taxes are regressive by nature. The politicians tell us that they are socking it to the rich, but all the while it is the average worker who is damaged the most. Don't be fooled by all the political posturing that took place last October. The real fat cats are in Washington, piloting a ship that is sinking as the result of their 20-year spending binge.
Repeal of the boat luxury tax in the budget package passed in October can save an industry and 600,000 jobs. Your senators and representatives can balance the budget by cutting their spending, not by increasing your taxes.

HEADLINE: BOAT LUXURY TAX DRIVES AN INDUSTRY AGROUND;
Small Business Owners

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Reports of declining retail activity seem to ignore the largest retail segment: small business owners. While many large retailers have been adversely affected by the recession, many more are able to survive the crisis. But this does not hold true for small business owners, many of whom do not have cash reserves and are unable to make cuts from their small resources.
Small business owners are the backbone of many neighborhoods in New York City, and they need to be preserved. Increases in commercial real estate assessments, escalating rents and crime are making them an endangered species.
Commercial strips throughout the city are seeing an increase in small business turnover and are concerned about eventual vacancies. The neighborhoods in the outer boroughs rely on commercial strips as a measure of a neighborhood's vitality. A faltering commercial strip is usually the first sign of an eroding neighborhood.
Commercial real estate assessments must be brought down to realistic levels, so that small business owners can survive this crisis. Many small business owners are commercial tenants and have long-term leases with property owners. Many of these leases stipulate that the commercial tenant pay the real estate tax, exclusive of the rent. As the leases come up for renewal, the commercial tenant will be unable to pay the steep real estate tax. This will create more vacancies, and a decrease in revenue for New York City.
The city administration must examine the long-term effects of the increase in commercial assessments and its potentially destabilizing effect on the economy and neighborhoods of our city.

HEADLINE: Time to Change U.S. Policy in Somalia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am concerned and dismayed by American foreign policy and aid to Somalia. In 1985, and in 1986-88, I was an administrator for refugee and training programs funded by the Agency for International Development in Somalia. American newspapers have given little coverage to widespread governmental atrocities and the lack of effectiveness of aid.
The virtual collapse of our development and relief programs was evident in the removal of personnel by the United Nations, the United States Embassy and other donor agencies because of widespread violence and civil strife in the capital, Mogadishu (news article, Dec. 12). Formerly, Somalia obtained major funding because of its poverty, refugee influxes, and "strategic" ports on the Indian Ocean. Unfortunately, most of this development aid, perceived as another form of military assistance by the Mohamed Siad Barre regime, has had little impact on the rural poor or governmental reform.
United States foreign policy has been ambiguous, officially emphasizing military support, economic development, refugee assistance and human rights. "Strategic interests" have predominated, however, and severely constrained development and humanitarian programs. In response to increased "genocidal" oppression and killing of Isaaks (the largest clan in Northern Somalia), civil war broke out between the Isaaks (Somali National Movement) and Government troops in May 1988.
The United States Embassy approved provision of military supplies to government forces, which subsequently prevailed. United Nations observers estimated that 60,000 people were killed in the conflict, many of them unarmed women and children.
President Siad Barre is reported to be holed up in a military bunker near the airport, while Mogadishu and the rest of the country are in chaos. I urge that our Government distance itself immediately from a policy generally perceived to be neither strategic nor in our long-term interests.
It is past time to cut off aid and other forms of support to the Siad Barre Government and work within the United Nations for a peaceful resolution.

HEADLINE: Canceled Condo Plan Had Flaws From Start

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It would be fair to say -- as you chronicle in your Dec. 18 report on Mayor David N. Dinkins's wise decision to cancel the Tibbets Gardens condominium housing project -- that politics, the recession and a drastic slump in the New York City real estate market all played a substantial part in that outcome. However, having thoroughly analyzed this program more than a year ago, I believed -- and hoped -- the venture's financial riskiness would cause the city to abandon this taxpayer albatross.
My office reported last January that the project's financial package involved risks that were much too high. Our analysis showed that not a single unit in Tibbets Gardens would be affordable to households with the minimum income levels proposed. Public subsidies would have averaged $91,000 a unit for apartments sold for $64,000 to $136,000. And because an original apartment buyer could resell to anyone after five years regardless of income, the public interest in providing large subsidies for affordable housing was not likely to be served very long.
Even in boom times, a financial albatross like this should never get off the ground.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Cut Prime By 1/2 Point

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The nation's largest banks, almost in lockstep, lowered their prime lending rate yesterday by half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent. It was their first drop in nearly a year and reflects efforts by the Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates lower.
Among the New York banks lowering the prime were Citibank, Morgan Guaranty, Chase Manhattan, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust. They were joined by a number of regional banks, including NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., and Mellon Bank, based in Pittsburgh. 
 The drop in the prime rate, a benchmark for the pricing of many consumer and small-business loans, comes more than a month after the Federal Reserve began to ease money market rates to stimulate the economy. This, in turn, helped reduce the banks' cost of funds -- money they borrow and re-lend to customers at a higher interest rates.
 
Cuts in Discount and Funds Rates
 Two significant determinants of most banks' cost of funds have fallen recently, making it only a matter of time before banks would cut their prime rates, analysts said. On Dec. 19, the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 6 1/2 percent from 7 percent. This is the rate the Fed charges member banks for loans. Another key rate, the Federal funds rate, the short-term rate on unsecured loans between banks, recently fell to 7 1/4 percent.
"Banks are responding to the decline in their cost of funds," said Ronald Mandle, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein & Company. Mr. Mandle added that banks had been slow to reduce prime rates so they could "rebuild profitability" by taking advantage of the wide spreads between their cost of funds and what they charge customers.
There had been some speculation that for this reason New York banks would be slow to move. But Christopher Mahoney, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service, said the wide spread between money market rates and the prime rate put political pressure on the banks to reduce the prime rate.
 
'Impossible to Sustain'
 "From an earnings perspective," Mr. Mahoney said, "banks would rather not reduce the prime. But when it's wide enoug, it becomes impossible to sustain a difference."
The cost of funds varies among banks, according to proprietary formulas at each bank. It is usually made up of the cost of borrowing money from depositors along with the cost of borrowing from the Fed, from other banks and from other sources.
The current drop in the prime was set off by Bank of America, which reduced its rate to 9 1/2 percent on Monday. The move by the Bank of America, the main subsidiary of the San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corporation, the nation's third-largest banking company, made it difficult for other banks to maintain a higher lending rate, Mr. Mahoney said. "With B. of A. moving, that made it impossible. So they all had to go."
The First National Bank of Chicago cut its prime rate to 9 1/2 percent on Dec. 20, about a week after two smaller banks, the First Fidelity Bancorporation of Lawrenceville, N.J., and the Norwest Bancorporation of Minneapolis, each cut their rates to 9 3/4 percent.
Carole Berger, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, said that the fall in the prime rate should have little impact on profitability at many banks. Whether it does depends on the size of a bank's consumer lending operations, she said. At most banks, large commercial loans are not priced off the prime rate, but rather off other indicators such as the Federal funds rate or the rate on short-term Treasury securities.
As a result, at a bank like Morgan, which has little consumer business, a drop in the prime is largely symbolic. It is, however, more significant at a bank like Citibank, which has a large consumer lending operation. A falling prime rate should help lower the cost of home-equity loans, auto loans and other consumer products.
"This is not a big deal for bank profitability at many banks because most of the variable-rate lending is pegged to something other than the prime rate," Ms. Berger said. "At some very large commercial banks, profits have already been squeezed."
The last time the prime rate was set at 9 1/2 percent was on July 14, 1988. At that time, it rose from 9 percent, and the prime continued to climb until it reached 11 1/2 percent in February 1988. The prime's lowest level since January 1985 was in August 1986, when it fell to 7 1/2 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat Broadly As Dow Falls by 23.02

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks sagged broadly yesterday on the first trading session of the new year, despite a jump in bond prices, a big decline in crude oil prices and widespread feeling that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates.
Oil prices slumped $1.95 a barrel, to $26.49, normally enough of a reason for stocks to pick up, but the Dow Jones industrial average slid 23.02 points, or almost 1 percent, to 2,610.64. 
 The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, fell slightly more. Trading volume rose to a listless 126.3 million shares, from 114.1 million on New Year's Eve.
Many Wall Street brokerage firms maintain that they are unable to make much money on stock commissions unless trading volume hits 150 million shares a day.
New economic numbers, which are expected to prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy and stimulate business, showed that the nation was rapidly sinking into troubling times:
*The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly index on the economy fell in December, for the third month, to 40.4 percent -- the lowest level since the bottom of the 1982 recession.
*Sales of American-made cars fell about 20 percent in mid-December from last year's levels.
*Commodities prices, as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau index, fell to their lowest point in 13 years.
Asked about the drop in commodities prices, Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor of the C.R.B. index, said, "It means that any attempts by business to raise prices for nonessential and high-priced items and make them stick are doomed to failure because the consumer is topped out."
In a decline of close to 2 percent, the C.R.B. fell 4.18 points yesterday to a new low of 218.46, indicating, as one trader remarked, that "inflationary pressures are slowly being whittled away."
Except for wheat prices in Kansas City, Chicago and Minneapolis and copper prices, 19 of the 21 commodities in the C.R.B. fell, from gold and silver to sugar, coffee. orange juice and heating oil.
 
Outlook On Unemployment
 Moreover, traders said, unemployment numbers coming out tomorrow are expected to show further economic deterioration.
Commenting on the outlook for further easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said, "The Fed has to put some money into the marketplace and to do this it is going to move to lower short-term interest rates very substantially from present levels."
Among the movers, Amgen, the drug producer, rose 1 1/2 on the Nasdaq to 63 3/4, after it said the Food and Drug Administration had expanded approval for a product to be used with AZT to treat AIDS patients.
Johnson & Johnson, the drug producer whose Ortho unit will sell the drug here as Procrit, fell 1 3/4 in heavy Big Board trading, to 70, although it traded during the day as high as 72 1/4. Analysts said the approval was expected.
Schering-Plough slid 1 1/8, to 43 1/4, with 1.3 million shares changing hands. The company was not listed among F.D.A. year-end approvals for pending drugs, analysts said.
Paramount Communications rose 1 1/2 in heavy trading to 42 3/8 even after it denied reports in Tokyo by Nikkei News that the company was trying to sell its motion picture business.

HEADLINE: New Senator From California Is Named

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 2

 BODY:
In a characteristically pragmatic move, Pete Wilson today chose a state Senator noted for his fund-raising abilities to succeed him in the United States Senate when he is sworn in as Governor of California next Monday.
Mr. Wilson's successor, John F. Seymour, a 53-year-old moderate Republican from Orange County who made his fortune as a real estate entrepreneur, was praised today by the Governor-elect for the "intelligence, energy and toughness of mind that made him a millionaire in business before he was 30 years old." 
 State law requires that the new Federal lawmaker face election for the balance of Mr. Wilson's term in 1992, the next general election, and, if elected, to then go through the whole expensive process again for a full term in 1994. The two campaigns, Mr. Wilson and others said, will cost $30 million to $40 million.
"Without a major war chest, you can't be in this game," Mr. Wilson said.
 
A Big Contributor
 Observers agree that Mr. Seymour knows about war chests: The California Political Almanac says he was one of 50 Californians to contribute $100,000 to George Bush's 1988 Presidential campaign.
Mr. Wilson, 57, a moderate Republican who was Mayor of San Diego when he won his Senate seat in 1982, had set out to find a successor who was his ideological twin, as well as well-heeled and well-connected. Since beating Dianne Feinstein in November to win the governorship of the nation's most populous state, Mr. Wilson did little to discourage speculation that he would choose a woman or a member of a minority group, or a lawmaker from the party's liberal wing. Although Mr. Seymour's current positions are nearly identical to Mr. Wilson's, his name was little mentioned by prognosticators.
Many of Mr. Seymour's positions have gradually shifted toward the center since 1982, when he left the Mayor's post in Anaheim to serve in the State Senate. Under the political-term limit approved by California voters in November (and supported by Mr. Seymour), he could have served in the State Senate until 1996.
In recent years, Mr. Seymour has voted to ban assault weapons, to outlaw discrimination against people with AIDS, and to increase spending for social programs including education and mental health benefits.
"He is what I call a compassionate conservative," said Mr. Wilson, who appeared with his successor at a news conference here.
In 1989, Mr. Seymour switched sides on two touchy issues of prime importance to Mr. Wilson -- abortion rights and offshore oil drilling. On both, Mr. Seymour parted company with many in his party to side with Mr. Wilson and the majority of Californians, who support a woman's right to choose abortion and who oppose drilling off the Pacific Coast.
 
Recalls 'Sad Lesson'
 Mr. Seymour opposed abortion until the summer of 1989. Then, after a Supreme Court decision that gave the states new power to restrict abortion, he said that he was personally opposed to abortion, but that he did not believe the state was entitled to interfere with a woman's decision. But both Mr. Wilson and Mr. Seymour say teen-agers seeking abortions should have parental consent.
Mr. Seymour favored oil drilling until the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska in 1989. After the accident, he said he had learned the "sad lesson" that economic considerations were "outweighed" by environmental concerns.
The Persian Gulf, rather than any of these issues, will be at center stage in Washington when Mr. Seymour takes office, which will happen officially at the moment Mr. Wilson resigns as Senator and takes the oath as Governor on Monday.
Today, Mr. Seymour was asked his position on the rumblings of war in the Middle East, and on the Jan. 15 deadline set by President Bush and endorsed by the United Nations for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Mr. Seymour said his "highest priority" was to "bring the troops home." He added that he "hoped and prayed" for a negotiated settlement in the volatile region but that "sanctions don't appear to be working," and that he stood "four-square behind President Bush."
 
Backing the President
 Furthermore, Mr. Seymour said, and Mr. Wilson concurred, that the President was under no requirement to seek Congressional approval before going to war. "I believe the President has the constitutional right and authority to do what he says he will do," Mr. Seymour said.
Mr. Wilson interjected that his successor would quickly discover that "there is all too much Congressional overreaching" in Washington, and that his colleagues were inclined "to usurp powers not conferred on them by the Constitution."
While Mr. Seymour said he would be "low man on the totem pole" in Washington, his role may actually be more important than that because of the status of Alan Cranston, the state's senior Senator. Mr. Cranston, embarrassed by the savings and loan scandal, and suffering from prostate cancer, has announced his retirement at the end of his current term.
Mr. Wilson said today that if Senator Cranston "lessens his pace" it "may very well reflect an added burden for Senator Seymour." Mr. Wilson noted that he had a similar boost in 1984, when Senator Cranston ran for President. "That brought me business I otherwise would not have had," Mr. Wilson said.
 
Lost Race in June
 While Mr. Wilson was sanguine about his successor's prospects as a Senate candidate, Mr. Seymour lost the last race that he ran -- in June, in the Republican primary here for lieutenant governor. The winner in that contest, who lost the general election to Leo McCarthy, was Marian C. Bergeson, also a state Senator. Senator Bergeson opposed abortion rights, but exit polls indicated that many voters, especially women, assumed that his position was the opposite when they voted in an election that received almost no media attention.
After interviewing a dozen prospects. Mr. Wilson telephoned Mr. Seymour last Thursday at a Sierra Nevada ski resort where he was vacationing with his family, to offer the job.,
"I thought what he wanted was my opinion on an appointment," said Mr. Seymour, an old friend of the Governor-elect.
"It was," Mr. Wilson retorted.
For several days, Mr. Seymour mulled over the offer with his wife and six children. Mr. Seymour said only 8-year-old Barrett, still bruised by his father's loss in the primary, objected.
"You know how bad you want to be a professional baseball player?" Mr. Seymour asked the boy, who tugged at his bow tie throughout today's news conference. "Well, that's how bad I want to be a United States Senator."
And Barrett's response?
"Go for it, Dad."

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Down 0.6%

BYLINE: By AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Construction spending fell by six-tenths of a percent in November to its lowest level in two years, the Commerce Department said today. The decline wiped out October's rise, the first in building activity in six months.
 Many economists foresee little improvement before the summer as the economy continues to weaken. 
You're looking at a decline in construction activity at least on a par with recessions of the past," said Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, "and it could be worse."
 
Slowest Since October '88
 The Commerce Department said spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $422.4 billion, down from $425.1 billion in October. It was the slowest rate since October 1988, when $421.6 billion was spent, and 2.5 percent below the November 1989 level.
 Even the October increase, the first since a gain of four-tenths of a percent last March, was less than first thought. The department revised the 1.3 percent gain reported last month to just three-tenths of 1 percent, based primarily on a 5.3 percent increase in Government spending.
 Government spending posted the only gain in November, up by 3.5 percent, to an annual rate of $115.9 billion. Spending by the Federal Government was led by a 6.6 percent rise in street and highway projects, to $35.5 billion. Spending on schools rose by 3.7 percent, to $22.4 billion.
 "The public sector continues to hold things up," said Daryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics, a forecasting firm in Newton, Mass. But, he added, budget restraints and colder weather are likely to stem that source of activity as well.
 Residential and nonresidential spending continued to decline.
 Residential activity plunged by 2.5 percent, to an annual rate of $173.8 billion, after a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent in October.
 Spending on single-family homes fell by 2.1 percent, to $100.7 billion, after a 1.9 percent decline the previous month. Apartment spending dropped by 4.3 percent, to $17.9 billion, erasing a 1.6 percent gain in October.
 While the housing industry has been weakening for months, many economists expect single-family activity to start improving by the middle of the year. The outlook is not so optimistic for the multifamily sector, however, because of overbuilding and tight lending practices.
 Nonresidential activity slipped by 2.2 percent, to an annual rate of $96.9 billion, on top of a 3.1 percent decline a month earlier. The industrial group showed the only strength, increasing by 2.6 percent, to $20.1 billion.
 The weakness in the building industry cost Americans 62,000 construction jobs last month, according to the Labor Department. Over the last six months, the industry has seen jobs tumble by about 250,000.

HEADLINE: New Approach in Massachusetts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
William F. Weld was sworn in today as the state's first Republican Governor in 16 years and gave an inaugural address advocating a conservative approach to healing Massachusetts's ailing financial condition.
In painting hands-off government as the answer to the state's problems, Mr. Weld said Massachusetts was saddled with bureaucracies that were 50 years out of date.
"Entrepreneurial government tends to steer rather than row," he said. "It does not embark on long-term programs without gauging long-term costs."
The new Governor pointedly steered clear of assigning blame to his predecessor, Michael S. Dukakis, but he outlined a dark picture of the state's current financial crisis.
"There is widespread talk of Massachusetts as a fiscal Beirut -- its economy adrift, its credit uncertain, its spirits lower than its bond ratings," he said.
Mr. Weld warned that there would be no quick fixes. "While I promise no miracles," he said, "I can undertake to avoid past mistakes. Things will get better."
Mr. Weld has estimated that he could face a budget deficit from $300 million to $750 million in the first six months that he is in office, which are the end of the 1991 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Outcry Over Jews' Move to Germany

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
The recent migration of thousands of Soviet Jews to Germany has set off an impassioned response among many Jews, especially those who survived the horrors of the Nazi era.
On the one hand are those who say that, even after 50 years, the memory of the atrocities against Jews is too raw to rebuild the once-flourishing German Jewish population. On the other hand are those who say that the emigres, whatever their decision, should have the freedom to settle where they want. 
 The most emotional reaction came in a letter last week from the president of the American Federation of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, who wrote that reports of a steady stream of Soviet Jews arriving in Berlin have caused "the most profound negative, painful and emotional reaction from us." The group, with 70,000 members, is the largest survivor organization in the world.
 
'Unparalleled Crimes'
 "We cannot, in good conscience, encourage Jewish emigration to a country which, within our lifetime, was responsible for unparalleled crimes against our people," said the letter, which was signed by the organization's president, Benjamin Meed, and sent to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress.
While the congress has yet to take position on the issue, its affiliates in the United States, Latin America and Israel have endorsed the survivors' statement, saying they acted out of a combination of emotional and political motives. First they cited the bitter memories of World War II and, second, the need to direct Jews to Israel, which in the last year has been the destination of the overwhelming number of Jews leaving the Soviet Union.
On the other side of the debate, however, are organizations who want Soviet Jews to have the freedom to emigrate where they please. Representatives of these groups spoke with caution, saying that they were sensitive to the feelings of the survivors and to Israel's desire to receive the emigres.
 
'Find a Safe Haven'
 David A. Harris, executive vice president of the American Jewish Committee, said, "From our viewpoint, the first and most important issue is the ability of Jews to leave and find a safe haven," he said. "Coupled with that is the recognition of the special importance that this emigration has for Jewish nation-building in Israel."
But, Mr. Harris added, "The American Jewish Committee has always supported the freedom for Soviet Jews to settle in the country of their choosing. While we hope that country would be Israel, it would be highly presumptuous of others to seek to make those choices for them."
While the committee has not lobbied the German Government for an increase in the number of Soviet Jews allowed to enter, Mr. Harris said, "We believe that the Germany of 1991 is not the Germany of 1945."
Martin A. Wenick, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, took a similar position, saying: "We prefer that emigrating Soviet Jews choose Israel as their destination. On the other hand, we recognize that people may go to destinations other than Israel. That's their prerogative and it's up to the receiving states to decide whether to accept them or not."
 
Avoidance of Things German
 None of those in the debate outside of Germany were willing to go as far as the leadership of the small German Jewish minority, which has encouraged the emigration, seeing it as an opportunity to reinvigorate a culture and a people ravaged by the Nazis. Despite millions of marks paid to Israel and survivors and statements of regret by Germans over the "final solution," many Jews outside Germany decline to visit the country; some even refrain from buying German-made products.
Before World War II, more than half a million Jews lived in Germany. Nearly all fled or were deported to their deaths between 1933 and 1945. In the decades that followed, the number of affiliated Jews grew gradually to more than 25,000 -- all but a few hundred of them in West Germany.
In the last year, about 5,000 more have arrived from the Soviet Union, with the number building in recent weeks as 50 to 100 have gotten off trains and buses from the Soviet Union each day.
In an interview, Mr. Meed of the survivors' group spoke with compassion for the new arrivals. "I understand what it means to run away from danger and look for a home," said the 70-year-old survivor of the Warsaw ghetto. "But where do you run? To Germany? How can you forget what the Germans did to us?"
 
'Based on Remembrance'
 "It's too soon," he added. "Judaism is based on remembrance. We make sure to remember from generation to generation, so how can we in our own generation forget?"
The arrival of Soviet Jews in Germany has prompted a debate within the country as well. Some Germans, arguing that the nation has a historical and moral responsiblity, want to open their doors to the Soviet Jews; others believe that they should be subject to strict immigration quotas, just like those who want to enter from other economically troubled Eastern European nations.
The letter by Mr. Meed of the Holocaust survivor organization was endorsed this week by the North American and Latin American branches of the World Jewish Congress. The Israeli office has taken a similar stand. Only the German Jewish office has taken a position encouraging the immigration.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Recession: Blaming Everyone But Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has now grudg ingly conceded that the economy is in recession. So who is responsible for the economic bad times? Herewith the Bush team's top 10 offenders:
10. European farmers. The talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade broke down last month because the European Community refused to scrap the enormous subsidies it provides for farmers. Farmers are so important politically, especially in France and Germany, that the politicians were not willing to risk angering them. Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representatives, says the failure to conclude a trade agreement could cost the world $4 trillion, and the United States alone about $1 trillion, in lost income over the next 10 years.
9. Environmentalists. The environmental movement insists on stifling important technological advances and retarding economic development. "Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th century to make the world safe for green vegetables," said Richard G. Darman, the budget director, in a speech last spring.
8. Consumers. Americans, says Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, consume too much and do not save enough, and that means too little money is available for investments that would allow the economy to grow. The family savings rate is about 5 percent, roughly a third of what it is in Japan and about half the rate in Canada, Germany and France. Twenty years ago, the American savings rate was more than 9 percent.
7. Government. "The President," says John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, "feels very strongly that the free market system operates best when it does not have its hands tied by Government, is not shackled by a system that erroneously thinks it can improve it by command and control."
6. Newt Gingrich. If Mr. Gingrich, the House Republican whip who is the most outspoken conservative in Congress, had not led the charge against the budget deal the President struck with Congressional leaders in September, the final budget package would probably not have included higher income tax rates and would have been much more to the Administration's liking. Higher tax rates, in the President's view, are a drag on the economy.
5. The Federal Reserve Board. From his first days in office, President Bush has pressed the Fed to lower interest rates to goose the economy. But the central bank, more concerned about inflation, moved cautiously. When the chairman, Alan Greenspan, began cutting rates in October, it was too little and too late in the Administration's opinion. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady says there is "ample room" now for much bigger cuts in the interest rate.
4. Bankers. Even with the action by the Fed last fall to bring down interest rates, the prime rate, the benchmark for many consumer and commercial loans, was not lowered by the major banks until this week. Business executives say they cannot get the loans they need for their companies to prosper. Mr. Bush has had bankers to the White House to jawbone them, but to no avail.
3. Bank regulators. Some members of the Bush Cabinet, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher in particular, say banks are not lending enough because the bank examiners have been too tough. The President has had the regulators to the White House, too, to give them a piece of his mind, but little has changed.
2. Saddam Hussein. Here is how Mr. Bush put it at a news conference last month: "The increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam's invasion is hurting our country, and our economy is at best in a serious slowdown. If uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse."
And now, the single most important cause of economic bad times, as recorded in countless statements by the President and his top advisers.
1. Democrats. If only the Democrats had agreed to a budget deal in the spring, if only they would allow a cut in the capital gains tax rate, if only they would keep income tax rates low, if only they would make deep cuts in domestic spending programs, if only they did not persist in controlling the Senate and the House of Representatives, if only Jimmy Carter had not been President. . . .

HEADLINE: Effort to Evacuate Foreigners From Somalia Stalls

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Efforts to evaculate the remaining foreigners from the Somali capital, Mogadishu, were stalled today after Western governments failed in their efforts to get a lull in the fighting, now in its fifth day.
The Italian Government sent C-130 transport planes to Nairobi today for use in evacuation of its 400 citizens, 77 Americans and citizens of several European nations. But the Somali Government warned Italy, the former colonial power of the southern half of the country, that such an evacuation would be considered an unriendly act. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was willing to accept an Italian proposal that the Red Cross operate the Italian flights, thus guaranteeing that they would be a humanitarian exercise. The Red Cross said that the rebel group, the United Somali Congress, had agreed to the proposal but that there was no response from the Government.
 
Fighting at the Airport
 The head of Africa operations for the Red Cross group, Pierre Gassman, said from Geneva that the organization's workers in the capital reported heavy fighting at the military side ofthe Mogadishu airport this morning. Since the military area is adjacent to the civilian airport, it is not clear whether it would be possible to fly in with a rescue operation, Mr. Gassman said. 
 The Government of President Mohammed Siad Barre, in power since a coup in 1969, has been challenged with increasing intensity by an array of guerrilla groups for the past two and a half years.
The United States supported the Somali President after 1977 when the Horn of Africa was considered of strategic importance in the cold war and the Soviet Union deserted Somalia,then its client, in favor of Ethiopia. But since mid-1989, as human rights violations became more flagrant, Washington has cut its economic and military aid to virtually nothing.
Diplomats in Nairobi who were in contact with their embassies in Mogadishu said today that the situation in the capital appeared to be degenerating, as one called it, into a "grisly" affair. A Somali man who walked to the Mogadishu airport from the rebel-held north of the city Wednesday said he counted 50 bodies along the way on the roadside.
A Kenyan diplomat who also flew out Wednesday said he saw indiscriminate shooting by Somali soldiers as he drove to the airport. He got a seat on the Somali Airlines plane to Nairobi by handing over the keys of his car to the airport clerk, he said. A Washington official involved in planning evacuations of the Americans left in Mogadishu said the main goal was to get everyone out. "It is illusory to think we can do anything about the situation" between the Government and the rebels, he said.
 
Clan-Based Group
 The United Somali Congress, the rebel group that started its assault on the city on Sunday, already controls the center of the country, which lies on the eastern edge of the Horn of Africa. Like all the rebel groups, the congress is based on clan membership, that of the Hawiye ethnic group, which is dominant in the area of the capital.
The United Somali Congress, which was founded in the late 1980's and whose military wing is said to be headed by a former senior army officer of the Government, gets much of its strength from the middle-class people in Mogadishu who resent the exclusionary, clan-based rule of President Siad Barre. The President belongs to the Marehan clan and he has favored its members in virtually all appointments.
Another rebel group, the Somali National Movement, is based on the Isaak clan of the northern region, which was a British colony until the country obtained independence in 1960. The National Movement has controlled the northern section, except the city of Hargeisa, since mid-1988.
These two rebel organizations, together with a third, the Somali Patriotic Movement, which controls the south, issued a statement in London pledging to unite to form a transitional government and re-establish democratic institutions.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Falls and Silver Rises On Peace Hopes in Mideast

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures fell and silver futures rose yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange in a mixed reaction to new hopes for peace in the Middle East.
Gold futures settled $2.30 to $2.60 lower, with the contract for January delivery off $2.60, to $386.50 an ounce, and the active February contract at $388.90. Silver was 10 cents to 10.6 cents higher, with January at $4.214 an ounce. 
 Market analysts said the split reflected the mix of economic repercussions that could result if the United States and Iraq reached a peaceful settlement of their standoff over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Analysts said peace prospects grew stronger yesterday after President Bush proposed direct talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Iraqi Foreign Minister before a Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
A peaceful settlement could bring a quick drop in oil prices, defusing a major inflation threat and cutting fuel costs for manufacturers and consumers.
Investors tend to buy gold as a hedge against inflation. Many sold the metal yesterday as the developments suggested that inflation pressures might ease, analysts said.
At the same time, silver, widely used in the photographic and electronics industries, grew more attractive.
"The idea that we could have peace in the Middle East sort of spurred the industrial sector of the precious metals complex," said Randolph Donney, research chief at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "Maybe the recession will be a lot shorter-lived than some people are predicting."
Prices of platinum, another precious metal with a large industrial component, also rallied. The contract for January delivery rose $2.20, to $411.40, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
James Steel, a metals analyst with Refco Inc., said the divergence of gold from silver and platinum also reflected attempts by some traders to press the metals back toward their historical price relationships. Both silver and platinum have become extremely cheap relative to gold since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August.
In other commodities, most orange juice futures plunged on the New York Cotton Exchange, extending Wednesday's losses in reaction to the lack of frost damage to the Florida orange crop over the holidays.
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.85 cents lower to 0.80 cent higher, with January at $1.0616 a pound.
Most livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed Despite Signs of Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance in narrow trading yesterday as traders, focusing on Persian Gulf tensions, held their ground against signs of economic weakness.
Continued worries about the Middle East helped support the dollar's value against a Government report of a jump in claims for state unemployment benefits for the week ended Dec. 22. 
 The report caused some analysts to revise their unemployment estimates upward. The Labor Department was scheduled to release the December employment data today.
"It would appear that the market is trying to probe a downside for the dollar but is a bit reluctant because of uncertainty in the Middle East," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer for Barclays Bank.
Mr. Hatcher, who did not revise his forecast, said he expected the unemployment rate to increase to 6.1 percent from 5.9 percent.
 
Impact of Talks Proposal
 Also undermining the dollar was President Bush's proposal for a meeting in Switzerland next week between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. Signs of peace in the gulf can prompt selling of the dollar, which is most attractive in times of turmoil.
Trading was light in advance of the Jan. 15 deadline that the United Nations has set for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible military action.
"Nobody's going to take any big positions until we know how that comes out," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The dollar closed at 133.00 Japanese yen in New York, down from 134.30 on Wednesday. In London, the dollar closed at 133.22 yen, down from 134.35 late Wednesday. The Tokyo markets remained closed yesterday.
In New York, the dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling closed at $1.9475, up from Wednesday's close of $1.9445. In London, the pound strengthened to $1.9465, from $1.9420 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday rates, included: 1.4925 German marks, up from 1.4872; 1.2645 Swiss francs, up from 1.2613.

U.S. Issues Rise on Jobless Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
After a big rise in initial unemployment claims was reported, prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday and interest rates fell further.
At 515,000, initial unemployment claims in the week before Christmas were at their highest level in almost eight years. 
 Analysts said the figures would not be reflected in today's report on December employment. The data for that report were collected in the week ended Dec. 12.
Still, the initial claims numbers heightened expectations that the employment report would be weak.
"The weekly claims numbers were almost of depression-like size," said John P. Costas, director of the taxable fixed-income group at the First Boston Corporation. "But after this number, it is hard to see how the employment data could be better for the market."
With large amounts of new issues to be auctioned next week and the Middle East situation far from resolved, other market participants agreed that the employment numbers would have to be especially dismal to push interest rates lower.
On Tuesday the Treasury will sell a total of $6.9 billion worth of bonds for the Resolution Funding Corporation with maturities of 30 years and longer. Those auctions will be followed on Wednesday by a sale of $8.5 billion worth of new seven-year Treasury notes.
 
What People Believe
 "People want to believe that the Middle East will be solved peacefully and they know the economy is weak," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Goverment Securities. "But with a whole slew of auctions and the Middle East out there I think there is more risk of a selloff than an extension of the rally."
In advance of the employment report, most analysts were forecasting that non-farm payroll employment declined by about 150,000 last month, and that the unemployment rate rose above 6 percent, compared with 5.9 percent in November.
Traders generally shrugged off a report showing that sales at chain stores were spotty in December, as well as remarks by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a speech delivered in Salt Lake City. Mr. Parry predicted that the downturn would be short-lived and that there was a good possibility that activity would begin to pick up by the middle of the year. He added that the prospects for lower inflation in 1991 were good.
The chain-store sales numbers, which reflected decent activity at discount stores but generally poor results at more expensive retailers, showed that "they had a hard time unloading stock and had to do it at lower prices," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "Consumers were somewhat miserly this Christmas."
 
Impact on Bonds
 The impact of the initial claims data was most directly seen in Treasury bond prices.
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 107 6/32, up 3/8 point, to yield 8.10 percent, compared with 8.13 percent late Wednesday.
Reaction in the secondary market for Treasury notes was more subdued.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 29/32, up 7/32, to yield 7.91 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were unchanged, at a price of 100 11/32, to yield 7.06 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates dipped a bit further.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.42 percent late yesterday, down 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.38 percent.
In other developments, the drop in interest rates since the start of the New Year encouraged a number of corporations to price issues in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Among the issuers was Marion Merrell Dow Inc., which offered $104.6 million of notes for an employee stock ownership plan.
The 9.11 percent notes, which mature Aug. 1, 2005, were priced at $100, or par, 1.18 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, New York State offered $40 million of general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by BT Securities won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2011.
The securities were initially priced to yield 6 percent on bonds due in 1992, 6.40 percent on securities maturing in 1996, 6.90 percent in 2001 and 7.25 percent on bonds that mature in 2011.
The issue is rated A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said prices of most issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in fairly active trading.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point.
Because of the New Year's Day holiday, the Federal Reserve Board will not release its weekly report on the nation's money supply until today.

HEADLINE: Construction Industry Urged to Police Itself

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Five years after it was ordered to investigate and analyze widespread corruption and Mafia influence in New York City's building trades, a state agency asserted yesterday that all the major components of the industry -- private developers and contractors, labor unions and the city's bureaucracy -- had to share the blame.
But in proposing its own blueprint for change, the agency, the Organized Crime Task Force, said it should be mainly up to these components to clean up the industry, largely through new self-policing steps. 
 In a particularly sharp critique of the city's role, the panel contended that often the only contractors who seek municipal work are those who are incompetent or tied to organized crime.
Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen and the spokesman for the General Contractors' Association, Francis X. McArdle, in separate interviews yesterday, characterized the findings of corruption and mob domination as exaggerated. Both also said that some of the report's major recommendations appeared to be impractical or unneeded. The construction industry is one of the city's most critical economic engines, generating more than $10 billion in private and public expenditures yearly and employing more than 100,000 full- and part-time employees.
In issuing the report, the panel's director, Ronald Goldstock, said that racketeering and corruption added "substantially" to the costs of construction of private residential and commercial buildings and public projects in the city but that there was no precise price tag.
 
Koch Endorsement
 Mr. Goldstock's office was directed to undertake the study by Governor Mario M. Cuomo in 1985 following reports of rampant corruption and other abuses in the industry. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch had strongly endorsed the inquiry and also urged the appointment of a special prosecutor to root out mobsters and corrupt practices.
State and city officials and private businessmen who participated in preparing the report said the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, faced with severe budget and street-crime problems, appeared to give a lower priority to revamping the construction industry than had Mr. Koch.
Mr. Goldstock, asked yesterday if the impetus for changing the industry had passed, replied: "This is a fragmented industry that has existed for years with a lot of vested interests. I don't expect these recommendations to be enacted immediately, but there will come a time when this blueprint will be seized upon and implemented."
Governor Cuomo, in a statement, called the report even-handed and said he would "urge the city and the state to act upon the recommendations."
In its 233-page report, the panel proposed these changes:
*The establishment by the city of an Office of Construction Corruption Prevention that would be staffed by the Department of Investigation and the Mayor's construction coordinator. Its main functions would be to develop programs for curbing corruption and expediting municipal construction projects.
*A requirement that the principal contractor on city projects of more than $5 million hire an independent company to investigate and audit its work to prevent payoffs to corrupt inspectors, union officials and Mafia figures. The report said the independent company would serve as a private "inspector general" to discourge illegal activities and to insure that contract regulations were met.
*Wider permission for contractors and developers to use independent architects and engineers to inspect projects for compliance with city regulations instead of relying on Buildings Department inspectors. Self-inspections would discourage payoffs to city inspectors, the report claimed. It said that private architects and engineers would be unlikely to accept bribes because they would lose their professional reputations and licenses to work.
*The creation by the state of an Office of Union Member Advocacy that would oversee union elections and hiring practices. The report said that the Federal National Labor Relations Board had been negligent in safeguarding the rights of union members in the construction industry and that many workers were "exploited" by corrupt union officials.
 
'Corporate Racketeering'
 Peter J. Brennan, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York, the spokesman for more than 50 construction trade unions in the city, did not return telephone calls yesterday to his office in Manhattan.
The report said that over the last 60 years Mafia groups have obtained control or influence over many construction unions and their welfare funds. "Honest reformers find it almost impossible" to remove corrupt union officials, the report said, asserting that only one private organization, the Association for Union Democracy in Brooklyn, aided construction union dissidents.
"Corporate racketeering," the report said, also contributed to higher costs when contractors seek an illicit competitive edge by either bribing union officials to avoid collective bargaining contracts," or by rigging bids.
The report assailed the city's contract-bidding and inspection procedures as "cumbersome" and "dilatory" saying they dicouraged honest contractors from bidding for city work.
Asked if the Dinkins administration considered the report a high priority, Mr. Mollen, who is the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, said, "We want to see improvements in the construction industry but one might question most of these recommendations as realistic or doable." He added that the admininstation would decide within six months on whether to carry out any of the proposals.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Again; Dow Drops 37.13

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
With the economy slumping and the deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait keeping investors on edge, the stock market headed sharply lower yesterday for the second consecutive day.
Drug stocks, usually unaffected by hard times, fell sharply after Merrill Lynch said investors were holding too many drug shares. 
 Blue-chip stocks, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, slid 37.13 points, or almost 1.5 percent, to 2,573.51. The Dow now stands a little more than 200 points away from its low point in more than a year and a half.
The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index, fell by almost the same amount, showing that the decline was being felt by many investors.
The smaller stocks, part of the American Stock Exchange market value index, gave way only slightly.
While still sluggish, trading activity rose to 141.5 million shares, from 126.3 million on Wednesday.
Most categories weakened, though some stocks posted gains, like Digital Equipment, which rose 1 3/8, to 56 1/4; and Compaq Computer, which climbed 1 3/8, to 57 5/8. Some of the weaker groups were drugs, chemicals, oil, gold and insurance.
Asked why insurance stocks were down, Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said, "Insurance is viewed as another problem industry, after S.& L.'s and banks, because of bad real estate loans and the poor quality of bonds."
General Re, the big reinsurer, sank 3 1/4, to 87 3/4; A.I.G., another favorite, fell 1 1/4, to 73 3/8, and Lincoln National slid 1 1/4, to 39 3/4. St. Paul fell 2 1/4, to 59 3/4; Chubb 1, to 52 1/2, and CNA 1 1/2, to 67 3/8.
Warner-Lambert, the drug company, fell 3, to 64 1/4, after Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, said that following last year's strong performance, investors held too many drug and medical stocks.
Abbott Labs slid 1 5/8, to 41 5/8; American Home Products 1 3/8, to 50 3/4; Bausch & Lomb 1 7/8, to 68 1/4; Bristol Myers 2 1/4, to 64 3/8; Lilly 1 1/4, to 71 1/2; Medtronic 2 3/8, to 81 3/4; Merck 2 7/8, to 86 5/8; Pfizer 2 3/8, to 77 3/4, and Syntex 2 3/8, to 55 7/8.
 
Traders Increasingly Nervous
 Other than a small rebound around 10 A.M., the Dow fell throughout most of the session, with traders turning increasingly nervous as the day progressed. Birinyi Associaties, which monitors program trading, said that five big selling waves sliced nearly 29 points off the Dow.
Today's employment figures are "expected to be pretty bad," Norwest's Dr. Sohn said. "It implies that the recession is deepening and may turn out to be worse than anticipated."
Moreover, he said, claims for unemployment in the week ended Dec. 22 rose 74,000, the highest since 1983, because of widespread layoffs in manufacturing and construction. And chain-store sales, as expected, were "pretty lackluster."
The combination, he said, was helping the bond market but hurting stocks. A poor economy, he explained, means lower interest rates, which helps bonds. Normally, that should also help stocks but because of the recession, he said, the market expects lower corporate profits, and that hurts stocks.
Among the 10 most active Big Board stocks, the Limited women's apparel chain rose 1/2, to 18 7/8. It topped the list, with 4.4 million shares changing hands, after reporting a 19 percent rise in sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 29.
Philip Morris, the second-best Dow stock last year after Procter & Gamble, slid 1 3/8, to 50 3/4, in what seemed like profit taking. Schering-Plough, which was not given any new drug approvals at year-end, fell 1 5/8, to 41 5/8, after losing 1 1/8 the day before.
Among the movers, Freeport-McMoran, the mining company, rose 2 1/2, to 18 3/8, after reporting a rise in gold, silver and copper reserves. Hilton Hotels rose 2 1/8, to 38 1/2, but the company said it knew of no reason. Digital Equipment rose 1 3/8, to 56 1/4, and Compaq Computer 1 3/8, to 57 5/8, in a mixed high-tech group.
U.S. Surgical, which fell 2 3/8 on Wednesday, fell another 4 yesterday, to 65, after trading as high as 68 3/4. The decline appeared to be profit taking.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
4 People Walking In the Darkness Toward Roselle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
Deborah Daniels is a homeless working person. When she woke at the Spinning Wheel Motel on Thursday morning, she did not know where she and her three children would sleep Thursday night.
Money had run out. For three years Ms. Daniels has worked as an aide on a school bus for the handicapped. She tends to the children as the bus makes its rounds through prosperous suburbs. She cleans their drool, makes sure they don't slip from wheelchairs, holds up their heads. She is paid $210 a week -- if there's school. She is not paid for school vacations like Christmas and receives no benefits. 
 Ms. Daniels's three children go to school five miles from the motel, in Roselle, their last permanent address. On mornings when there is money, the four ride a city bus to Roselle. "I'm up at 4:30 to iron their clothes," Ms. Daniels says. She shares a bed with her 14-year-old, Yolanda. Rashan, 12, and Willie, 9, share the other bed.
On mornings when money has run out, as it had yesterday, they leave the motel by 5 for the five-mile walk. "I'm fussing up and down the street to keep them walking," says the mother. "They say there's the bus. I say we don't have fare, a little more and we'll be in Roselle."
"We get sick and tired walking to Roselle in the rain and dark," Rashan said.
The great fear of poor mothers like Ms. Daniels is that they won't be able to hold their families together; that their children will be put in foster care. Nancy Goldhill, a legal services lawyer, sees it more as the economy worsens. Occasionally it surfaces -- like the mother arrested for locking her child in her car trunk while she worked -- but mostly people are too proud to tell anyone until things collapse. Ms. Daniels does not have a dollar.
 Like a lot of the homeless, she stayed with family until the pressure of living doubled up became too much. In September, she moved to a motel. She made too little to afford an apartment and too much to qualify for shelters here, which only take families on welfare. It has been suggested that Ms. Daniels go on welfare, but she refuses. On welfare, she would have medical coverage. When Rashan broke his finger last fall, Ms. Daniels paid out of pocket. After the cast was removed, Rashan was supposed to have a pin installed. "I haven't gone back," Ms. Daniels said. "We can't afford it." This is how the poor become misshapen.
She went to the State Division of Family and Youth Services and asked for a housing grant to keep her family together. "They said the way they could help -- I could put my kids in foster homes. I thought, maybe. The kids said, 'Mom you're not giving us up.' Rashan said he knew a boarded-up house; we could fix it up."
Ms. Goldhill believes the state would save money in the long run if it made housing grants to keep families together, instead of waiting until children need foster homes. A spokesman says youth services does not have the money.
Ms. Goldhill spent months searching for a housing program. "You see the incentive to quit work and go on welfare," Ms. Goldhill says. The Federal Government's Section 8 housing subsidy was created for people like them, but Reagan and Bush Administration cuts have nearly killed that program. Ms. Daniels has been on a Section 8 waiting list for two years. The Elizabeth homeless coalition gave money to keep them at the Spinning Wheel for two months, legal service workers held an office collection, a Catholic charity helped out. Yesterday, that money ran out.
Responding to a reporter's call, William Waldman, a deputy state commissioner of Human Services, had staff members help Ms. Daniels. At 4 P.M. yesterday they found funds for two more weeks at the Spinning Wheel. But Mr. Waldman warns that there's a gap that people like Ms. Daniels are falling into and it is growing. He notes that state voters defeated a bond to provide $100 million in affordable housing for the working poor and that Gov. Jim Florio has been hammered since raising taxes to improve schooling for the poor.
Ms. Daniels fears for her children. Willie thinks it's funny to shout that favorite Reagan phrase, "Say no to drugs!" at dealers who hang at the motel. Rashan was coming back from the store with ice for the cooler where they keep their food when his new $30 jacket was stolen. To shield them from motel life, the mother sends them off for a few hours every evening with the Rev. Daisy Lawson, a forklift driver who runs the Faith and Victory Church.
Ms. Daniels tries to keep their spirits up, but it's hard. Yesterday morning as they walked in the dark to Roselle, she told them, "It's good to walk; we'll lose weight." But Willie answered, "You're telling a story. I know we walk because we don't have money." The boy cried the whole way to Roselle.

HEADLINE: 102d Congress Opens, Troubled On Gulf but Without a Consensus

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The 102d Congress convened today, unenthusiastic about war in the Persian Gulf but institutionally uncertain about how and when to express those doubts.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said "there's no question that there will be a debate on the question of the use of force in the gulf." But, he added, "The question is the appropriate time for that debate." 
 In the Senate, though, Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said: "The best time to debate this issue is before this country commits itself to war and not after. Our constitutional obligations are here and now."
 
Asserting Their Rights
 Assembling from around the country in the clearest atmosphere of impending war since the 77th Congress convened 50 years ago today, the 535 lawmakers spoke more clearly of their prerogatives than of their intentions. And they seemed more agreed on the idea that Congress was constitutionally entitled to a voice than on what that voice should say.
The gulf cast a shadow over the festivities, parties and general good humor that go with the opening day of any Congress. A freshman Republican, Representative Rick Santorum of Pittsburgh, was sworn in with his young nieces, Elizabeth Kusturiss and Alyssa Thornburg, on his arms, and said, "I need more information to be convinced that we need to take offensive action at this time."
Mr. Foley and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader, returned to Capitol Hill from a White House breakfast with President Bush in agreement that no Congressional debate should be held pending a possible meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker and Iraq's Foreign Minister next week. But they insisted that a debate would be held sometime, and maintained that Mr. Bush had no legal authority to order an attack on Iraq without Congressional approval first. They noted that he had disagreed, again today, with that view of the Constitution.
 Meanwhile, their colleagues were drafting and discussing various proposals. One, introduced in the House with 38 co-sponsors by Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, sought to require Mr. Bush to give economic sanctions another year's trial before any attack on Iraq. Other plans included assertions of Congressional authority or of support for Mr. Bush.
But not every lawmaker was ready to wait. While the House convened smoothly at noon, quickly taking up a wrangle over an old issue, the budget, the Senate was immediately plunged into a sharp dispute over the timing of any gulf debate.
Mr. Mitchell got an angry response when he proposed that no resolutions be introduced before Jan. 23, unless he and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, set an earlier date. Almost the entire Senate sat and listened as Senator Harkin and Senator Brock Adams, Democrat of Washington, demanded that he promise to hold a debate before Jan. 15, the date after which the United Nations has authorized the use of force against Iraq if it does not withdraw from Kuwait.
Mr. Harkin and Mr. Adams were unimpressed with Mr. Mitchell's assurance that the Senate would get to debate the issue, and that by holding brief, pro forma sessions every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it would be ready to act on short notice.
Mr. Harkin called for a specific date on a resolution that he, Mr. Harkin, and Senator Quentin Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota, wanted to sponsor. That resolution would put Congress on record -- as Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Foley and many other lawmakers already are as individuals -- in saying that no military attack could be launched without advance Congressional approval.
"Give us the date for debate before Jan. 15," Mr. Adams demanded. He said that a debate any later would probably come after the fact, because Mr. Bush has maintained that he could attack at any time after the United Nations deadline. "Give me the date," the Senator said. "I'll be here."
 
'Not Normal Times,' Harkin Says
 Mr. Mitchell argued, "A Senate debate on this issue would be much more productive and better informed" after the Baker mission. He said his antagonists were "prematurely forcing a decision on this principle." But Mr. Harkin said: "These are not normal times. These are times when Americans are facing war."
The dispute, which remained unresolved when the Senate recessed tonight, provided a lively start for the session. Republicans, who lost one seat in November and entered this Congress on the short end of a 56-to-44 Democratic advantage, sat by and did not join in as the Democrats tangled.
In the House, where in November the Democrats stretched their dominance by eight seats to a 266-to-168 edge over Republicans (with one seat held by a Socialist elected as an independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont), there was no effort to block the introduction of resolutions. But Mr. Foley said it was unlikely that any would soon emerge from committees, which are not yet fully organized.
Among the early offerings was a measure by Representative Raymond J. McGrath, Republican of Long Island, demanding that Saudi Arabia use its large oil profits to pay the full cost of the American buildup in the gulf.
 
Economics and Ethics
 In addition to the gulf issue, the recession is expected to be another major concern of Congress. But it showed itself on this week's agenda only with a hearing scheduled Friday by the Joint Economic Committee on whether unemployment compensation will prove adequate during the recession.
Other concerns will include ethics investigations in the Senate, continuing problems with savings and loan associations, and developing trouble among banks. Democrats hope to push new measures to advance health care, to try again on the civil rights bill vetoed by Mr. Bush last year, and to work on campaign finance legislation.
On the gulf issue, Representative Robert H. Michel, the House Republican leader, urged fast action, with no amendments, on a resolution backing Mr. Bush. But Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committtee, said, "Most people would like the war to be a last resort after all reasonable efforts have failed." Mr. Foley said "sanctions should be given more time to have their effect on Iraq."
 
'Want It Both Ways'
 And Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said: "A lot of people here want it both ways. If it works, they want to be with the President. If not, they want to be against him."
In sum, the messsage of this Congress's opening day was far less certain than the one Speaker Sam Rayburn offered early in 1941, 11 months before Pearl Harbor, as World War II raged. 
"Great, and I may say terrible, things are happening in this world," he said. "In issues involving the safety and security and defense of America, I expect again to see us act with practical unanimity, regardless of party."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
The Rich Legacy Of an Economist

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
JOSEPH J. SPENGLER, the eminent economist at Duke University who died this week in Durham, N.C., saw modern economic science as stemming from two roots -- one administrative, the other ethical.
As an economic historian, his great contribution was to trace these two sources through ancient times, cultures and religions. And, as population expert and promoter of economic development worldwide, he demonstrated how vital these administrative and ethical roots of economics remain for the understanding and betterment of human existence. 
 His first book, "France Faces Depopulation," published in 1938, was a highly original investigation of the cultural and political forces that were causing the falling birth rate in France before World War II. Many French demographers, economists and politicians of the day thought they could cure depopulation, which was feared as a source of economic and political weakness, by a moderate degree of state intervention. They proposed financial incentives to increase the birth rate.
But Professor Spengler, who was the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of Economics and a former president of the American Economic Association, said the proposed remedy would be inadequate because it underestimated the social and cultural changes that were weakening the family "as a reproductive system." Whether birth rates could be lifted or lowered by governmental action, he said, would depend in the final analysis on whether cultural patterns were subject to modification by a modest state program.
He concluded that in the absence of a much more profound change in the income and social structure of France measures to spur population growth were bound to fail. Indeed, even so earth-shaking an event as World War II, which broke out soonafter his book was published, did not invalidate his deep analysis and foresightful conclusion.
A small-town boy -- he grew up in Piqua, Ohio, and worked on the local newspaper there before going to college -- Professor Spengler was, and remained, an ardent lover of baseball and freedom -- and a bitter enemy of umpires and of political or bureaucratic interference in his own life or anybody else's.
Yet he was a realist, and recognized the difficulty of resolving the clash between different views of what human beings are really like and what it takes to make them behave properly. The fundamental clash, as he saw it, was between the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and John Locke (1632-1704) -- the Hobbesian creed based on a perception of man as dominated by passions and in urgent need of being governed by the state ("Leviathan") versus the Lockean view based on a perception of man as rational, with little need of state control.
The overwhelming majority of Western economists take the Lockean view. Even the economists of the Soviet Union have shifted to that view, rejecting the state-dominated doctrine of Marx, Lenin and Hobbes.
But Professor Spengler, wanting to accept completely the conventional economic wisdom, still recognized that it might be based on too benign and wishful a view of people and the degree of freedom they could be entrusted with. He liked to quote Plato's thought in "The Republic": "The best is for everyone to be ruled by a wise and godlike power, if possible seated in his own heart; if not, let it act upon him from without."
In a nutshell, Plato's formula describes the battle being waged now within the Soviet Union, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev being urged by the hard-liners in the military, the K.G.B. and the civil bureaucracy to restore order to save the system, and former Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze declining the vice presidency and leaving the Government in an effort to bring the nation to its senses, and put it back on the path to economic reform, based on a market-oriented economy with power devolving to the republics -- and to individuals. It seems to be a war within the heart and mind of President Gorbachev himself.
Professor Spengler, even knowing the risks of turbulent freedom, would have stood with Mr. Shevardnadze and the physicist and humanist Andrei Sakharov before him. He would oppose Mr. Gorbachev as philosopher-king. He lacked Plato's faith in philosopher-kings, knowing that the philosopher-kings of our time have borne such names as Hitler, Stalin and Saddam Hussein.
But he was no ideologue of the market as the ideal allocator of goods or dispenser of justice. Though the market spurs and rewards efficiency and innovation, he held, it often neglects those esthetic, intellectual and moral qualities essential to the good society. And it may despoil the earth's irreplaceable resources.
Nor was Dr. Spengler a flag waver. He warned that the military security of neither the United States nor the Soviet Union "is firmly based, given the widespread poverty, rapid population growth and rising expectations in the underdeveloped countries." Both superpowers, he said, were wasting their capital, their knowledge, their energies and natural gifts for helping mankind. He was always closer to Jeremiah than to Hobbes or Locke.

HEADLINE: Dispute Prompts Rudin to Quit Budget Panel

 BODY:
Lewis Rudin, the developer active in civic affairs, resigned yesterday from the board of the Citizens Budget Commission in a disagreement over the watchdog group's criticism of New York City's tentative labor agreement.
The city and two large municipal workers unions announced on Wednesday a settlement that would provide a wage and benefit increase of 5 percent to 150,000 city workers. The president of the budget commission, Raymond D. Horton, said that it was too generous and that it would lead to more layoffs of city workers.
Mr. Rudin, the president of Rudin Management, a large real-estate company, said yesterday that the criticism was unwarranted. Mr. Rudin said he had resigned both because he disagreed with Mr. Horton and because the president had failed to consult with board members of the nonprofit commission.
"I am tired of naysayers," Mr. Rudin said in an interview. "I think that this city is being hurt by the constant rhetoric that is being spewed out in the media of negativism in this city."
Mr. Rudin, who serves as an informal economics adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins, said, "It's O.K. to be critical, but on balance once in the while give the guy a pat on the back."
Mr. Horton said he was sorry Mr. Rudin had resigned. Mr. Rudin had been on the 120-member board for many years, Mr. Horton said, but he had not been an active participant for at least 10 years.

CalFed Is Expecting Loss of $140 Million

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3

 BODY:
CalFed Inc., the parent of the nation's fourth-largest savings and loan institution, said today that it expected to report a loss of $140 million in the fourth quarter because of a weakening commercial real estate market.
In the fourth quarter of 1989, CalFed, which owns the California Federal Bank, earned $23.6 million, or 94 cents a share. 
 The anticipated quarterly loss is largely the result of CalFed's decision to add $200 million to California Federal's reserves for possible losses on loans. The company said the decision reflected the national downturn in commercial real estate.
"Commercial real estate markets have continued to deteriorate from overbuilding, a weaker economy and a scarcity of credit," said Jerry A. St. Dennis, CalFed's chairman and chief executive. "The prudent action is to increase further our reserves in the fourth quarter."
CalFed said that Federal regulators had recently completed an examination of California Federal's books and that it did not expect the Government to require additional reserves. But CalFed's decision to increase its reserves for the quarter suggests that other savings institutions and banks may have to take similar steps, resulting in another quarter of depressed earnings or losses throughout the industry.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, CalFed closed at $3.375, down 50 cents a share, or 12.9 percent, the day's second-worst percentage decline.
CalFed also said that it had injected an additional $77 million into California Federal as new capital. The additional capital enabled the savings and loan to meet stricter Federal guidelines for financial health that took effect on Dec. 31.
The $77 million came from the proceeds of the sale by CalFed last year of one of its insurance subsidiaries for $110 million. CalFed, which is based in Los Angeles, has been selling its insurance businesses to concentrate on the savings business. It expects to sell another insurance subsidiary in the first quarter for an immediate net gain of $65 million plus another $35 million in the next three years.
"One of the goals in our restructuring program has been to redirect capital from other lines of business in order to strengthen our core banking business," Mr. St. Dennis said. "This capital contribution will enable the bank to move more readily to achieve its potential."

HEADLINE: OFFICE IN MOSCOW OPENED BY ISRAELIS

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Israel raised its blue and white flag over a consulate in Moscow today in a major step toward the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the two nations.
The opening of the Israeli Consulate comes nearly 24 years after the Soviet Union abruptly broke ties with Israel over the 1967 Middle East War, and in the middle of the biggest flow of Jewish emigration from this country to Israel. 
 "This is the day which the Lord hath made," Aryeh Levin, the new Israeli Consul General, said in Hebrew at a simple ceremony, quoting from Psalm 118. "We will rejoice and be glad in it."
On the street in front of the consulate, several dozen would-be emigrants watched and smiled as the Israeli flag with the Star of David was raised in a gentle flurry of Moscow snow.
"This, thank God, will be my last Soviet winter," said Irina Krasnopolskaya, as a chorus from the Moscow Synagogue sang "Hatikvah," the Israeli national anthem, and several guests began to sing and dance spontaneously in the snow around the flag pole.
 
200,000 Left in 1990
 Mrs. Krasnopolskaya, an engineer from Odessa, her husband and two children are among 400,000 Soviet Jews that Mr. Levin estimated will emigrate to Israel this year. In 1990, he said, nearly 200,000 Jews from the Soviet Union moved to Israel, with 45,000 arriving there in December alone.
The easing of Jewish emigration, once a bitter point of dispute between Israel and the Soviet Union and between the United States and the Soviet Union, has been one of the most significant results of the warming of relations between Moscow and Jerusalem.
Mr. Levin officially presented his credentials on Dec. 25, the day a Soviet diplomat presented his credentials at the Consul General in Israel.
Mr. Levin said that his country would have preferred re-establishing full diplomatic ties, but that the Soviet Union was still "reticent on this subject."
 
Moscow Sets Conditions
 At various points, Moscow has demanded that as a condition to such a move, Israel must agree to take part in a Middle East peace conference and guarantee that Soviet emigres will not be settled in the occupied Arab territories.
Mr. Levin said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze indicated in a meeting last month that Moscow no longer insisted that Israel agree to take part in a peace conference, but that it wanted further assurances that Soviet emigres would not be settled in the territories.
Israeli officials have repeatedly assured Moscow that Soviet emigres were not being directed to the territories. Mr. Levin said today that most housing being built for the new arrivals was within the pre-1967 Israeli borders.
"I think their problem is that they made a decision many years ago," Mr. Levin said of the Soviet hesitation. "And it is very difficult for them to undo this decision, so they are undoing it bit by bit."
 
Direct Flights Planned
 Mr. Levin said that El Al, the Israeli airline, would begin direct charter flights between the two countries at the end of the month, but that at the insistence of the Soviet side, the flights for now would be only for business and tourist travel. Emigrants will continue to travel to Israel by going to transit points in Europe and then boarding Israeli-chartered and sponsored planes to Israel.
Since its embassy here was closed in 1967, Israeli interests have been represented in the Soviet Union by the Netherlands. Friday, in fact, will be the first day that Israeli diplomats will issue Israeli entry visas without the help of Dutch diplomats.
The consulate was closed today for most official business, and there was not the usual line of some 1,200 people who have been coming daily to wait for the final Israeli entry visa that will allow them to leave this country for Israel.
Instead, a few dozen people milled around outside, exchanging gossip about emigration and looking at the newly hoisted flag of the country they will soon call home.
 
Street Becomes a Market
 The street outside the consulate has become a veritable market of rumor and information. Entrepreneurs have set up tables from which they hawk their wares, including teach-yourself-Hebrew courses.
"It's 200 rubles here, but it will cost you $95 there," one seller said of a five-cassette course with a text.
Also being sold were lists of apartment prices in various regions of Israel (two rubles for the list, $135,000 for a three-room apartment in Tel Aviv), Hebrew-Russian dictionaries, a guide to personal computers, a book in Russian titled "Love and the Jewish Bride," and Cyrillic maps of Israel.
One man was selling visa applications to Australia and South Africa, available at the embassies free but for a four-hour wait in the cold, and for 35 rubles through him.
The salesman who seemed to be doing the briskest business was selling very large suitcases.
Jews preparing to leave the Soviet Union for Israel said a complex tangle of reasons pushed them to leave. They said they feared the possibility of civil war in a country of rising tensions. The deteriorating economy made them wonder about their future and the future of their children. If life gets any worse here, they said, Jews will become scapegoats.
 
'Not Very Well Treated Here'
 "Certainly Jews have a collective memory of what they went through over these past 70 years," Mr. Levin said. "This is the primary reason for their departure and for their going to Israel. They were not very well treated here, and that's putting it mildly, over the years."
Some people said that Jews had never stopped being scapegoats and victims here and that even their fear of war in the Middle East was not as great as their fear of what would happen to Jews here if society continued its current collapse.
"I'm not a religious person or even a cultural Jew," said Mrs. Krasnopolskaya. "But it's simply horrible to spend your whole life feeling like a second-class citizen. Here, being a Jew has meant only unpleasantness. In Israel, at least it will be a new beginning. It is honestly our only choice, the only choice we can make for our children."
Mrs. Krasnopolskaya said she had even enjoyed the long hours she spent waiting in the cold outside the Israeli Consulate.
"It's the only line in this country that's pleasant to stand in," she said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
PAN AM IS CURBING SERVICE IN MIDEAST

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Pan American World Airways announced yesterday that it was suspending flights to Tel Aviv and to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, because of surging insurance rates, a result of the crisis in the Middle East.
In addition, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines canceled its flights to Amman, Jordan, and other carriers are evaluating whether to continue serving Middle Eastern destinations. Travel agents said bookings to the area had dropped sharply and suggested that could be an important factor in the airlines' decisions. 
 "It was not economically feasible to continue operations," Pam Hanlon, Pan Am's director of corporate communications, said, because insurance rates to Tel Aviv have increased twentyfold, to $65,000 a flight, and to Riyadh tenfold, to $162,500 a flight. The airline was not responding to any terrorist threat in suspending its flights, nor had there been any Government attempt to influence the carrier as part of the campaign against Iraq, she added.
 
Caution in Case of War
 In Washington, a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity agreed that there had been no increase in terrorist threats or activity but suggested that the airlines and the insurance industry were applying the caution that might be expected when operating in a potential war zone. Much of the world's aircraft fleet is insured by underwriters on the Lloyd's market in London.
Another State Department official suggested the carriers were responding because "the date Jan. 15 has been in every newspaper in the world."
Odette Fodor-Gernaert, a spokesman for KLM, said the Dutch airline had canceled its three weekly flights to Amman this week because of the tensions in the area.
The surge in insurance rates and slide in bookings came at a particularly bad time for Pan Am, which was already pressed for cash. The carrier has been in negotiations with other lines to sell assets to build up reserves to get it through the lean winter months.
Pan Am said it had asked the State Department and the Department of Transportation to provide insurance. The Federal Government can provide coverage to a commercial airline if it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States, and it has done so in the past, but details of how any such plans would work in the current crisis were not available last night.
"We are eager to restore the service as soon as we have the insurance coverage that is necessary," Ms. Hanlon said.
Pan Am, which operated daily flights between its Paris hub and Tel Aviv, is the first major carrier to cancel service to Israel. Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, has threatened to attack Israel if the United States and other nations begin an offensive to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Pan Am operated flights twice a week from New York to Frankfurt to Riyadh. These two destinations are Pan Am's only scheduled flights to the Middle East.
Other carriers, including KLM, British Airways, Swissair and Air France have changed their flight schedules so that their planes and crews do not have to spend the night in Israel.
 
Daily Safety Reviews
 British Airways also reduced its flights from six to four a week in what it called a seasonal adjustment done every year during a period when bookings are low. A spokesman said, however, that the carrier was making daily reviews of whether it was safe to keep flying to Israel but at this point had no plans to curb service.
Some travel agents suggested that airlines might want to cancel flights because of a lack of business.
Estelle Lessack, the head of Travel Trends a travel agency in Fort Lee, N.J., said bookings to Israel had fallen substantially this year after the attacks by terrorists and the revolt by Palestinians in Israel.
"I've kept my brochures on Israel current," she said. "There hasn't been one brochure removed in a while."
"People don't want to go there," she added. "They think it's too dangerous."
The Israeli airline, El Al, has sought to attract customers by waiving cancellation penalties in the United States.
 
El Al Service
 Lori S. Samet, an El Al spokeswoman, said the carrier had not cut back service although its insurance had gone up substantially since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
She said El Al would accept all Pan Am tickets except those issued under the frequent flyer program or to groups that get special discounts.
The other main carrier to Israel, Trans World Airlines, which has six flights a week, has also seen its insurance soar but does not plan to cancel service, James Faulkner, the manager of public relations, said.
Other carriers serving the Middle East were assessing whether to keep flying there. Jean-Marc Felix, the director of public relations for Swissair, which has daily flights to Tel Aviv, said that its schedule could change depending on the situation.
 
Lower Rates Sought
 Danny Danzinger, Pan Am's manager in Israel, told Reuters that insurance premiums were negotiated once a week and that Pan Am would try to lower the rates. The suspension of service may have to be extended if the airline cannot get the rates down, he added.
A person who spoke only on condition of anonymity said that talks with the Government over insurance rates had been going on for months and that the agencies had not acted quickly, as they had in the past. But he said the airline expected the Government to assume insuring the flights in a matter of days.
Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said that the country regretted Pan Am's decision and that the carrier should reconsider.
"Life in Israel goes on normally," she added. "This is our answer to the threat of Saddam Hussein."
For Pan Am, however, life has been more precarious than normal, and it is seeking a way to raise large amounts of cash to allow it to keep operating until next spring. Negotiations are under way, but the outlook is uncertain.
 Pan Am has an agreement to sell its London routes with landing rights at Heathrow Airport to United Airlines, and a closing of the sale would bring in $290 million, enough to keep the airline flying.

HEADLINE: Sears Says It Will Cut 21,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Struggling to reverse what has become a very serious decline, Sears, Roebuck & Company said today that it would eliminate 21,000 jobs at its stores nationwide.
That represents slightly more than 10 percent of the jobs in Sears stores. The positions being eliminated will range from those for stockroom clerks to accounting personnel and loading-dock crews. but will not include sales personnel. The reductions will involve 3,500 full-time positions and 17,500 part-time slots. 
 At the same time it announced the job cuts, the nation's largest retailer said it would take more than a dozen other steps to cut costs at stores or to make them more attractive or convenient places to shop.
The new measures represent the latest attempt by Sears to regain customers lost to leaner, more innovative discount rivals like Wal-Mart and Target Stores. About two years ago, Sears began the process of competing more intensively by cutting prices and introducing well-known national brand names to its product lines. When that failed to produce results, Sears began to advertise heavily and even resorted early in December to what it called an "after-Christmas sale."
That, too, helped little, and Sears, like other major department stores, released a disappointing sales report for last month, during the peak holiday selling period. Again, shoppers appeared to prefer the discount stores. [Page D4.]
 
Analysts Are Divided
 Sears's announcement of layoffs and other changes is thus part of a continuing effort. But analysts, while supportive, were divided on the outcome.
"Now they have really begun to cut out fat," said George Rosenbaum, the president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago-based market research firm. "I applaud the move."
But Edward A. Weller, at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he was skeptical, if only because Sears had announced other expense-reduction programs that produced minimal savings. And he argued that despite the view that Sears's biggest problem was bloated overhead, the company had an even bigger problem: its sales, after adjusting for inflation, are declining.
"They still have not been able to inspire the customer to shop more at Sears," Mr. Weller said.
The retailer's announcement today did not make clear how many employees would be laid off since the 21,000 positions to be eliminated refer to jobs rather than employees.
But Sears said that of the 306,000 people who were working in its retail group as of Dec. 31, 206,000 were actually in stores. Thus, the ultimate percentage of store employees who lose their jobs could easily be 10 percent. To the extent that all 21,000 positions to be eliminated will be in non-selling areas the percentage of people in those areas who could lose their jobs could exceed 10 percent.
In any case, morale at Sears stores, which was already suffering, could sink further in coming days. While an unspecified number of employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be offered positions elsewhere in stores, the majority will be given severance pay and let go.
"It is, as you can see, quite comprehensive," said a senior Sears executive who asked to remain anonymous.
 
Test Phase at 10 Stores
 For more than a year, ever since it became apparent that the giant merchant was sinking into a deep slump, Sears has been faulted by retail rivals and Wall Street analysts for not taking the measures necessary to reverse its sagging fortunes. Among the most serious criticisms has been that Sears has been unwilling to bite the bullet on staffing; its overhead has remained twice that of rivals: roughly 30 percent of sales.
When Sears stores introduced national brands to complement its Kenmore, Craftsman and Diehard house brands, the critics generally applauded. But they also saw the effort as a "me-too" measure that put Sears on a more even plane with rivals but did nothing to give it an edge.
The layoff announcement appeared aimed at showing that Sears was finally serious about major job cuts.
The job reductions make up the centerpiece of what Sears is calling its Store-Simplification Program, aimed at making Sears stores more efficient, attractive and convenient. The program, the existence of which has been rumored for some time and which has been in a test phase at 10 Sears "learning-center" stores around the country, will now be rolled out to all 863 Sears stores.
Sears said the job reductions were but one of more than a dozen elements of the program it hoped to have in place nationwide by the end of June. The program also included these steps:
*Cash registers will be programmed to accept payments due on Sears credit cards and to report account information to card holders. This could result not only in savings to Sears since fewer staffers will be needed in the huge charge-card operation, but also increased convenience for shoppers.
*Automatic tellers will be installed in 150 stores so customers can receive cash advances against their Sears Discover credit cards.
*Sears is computerizing its system for printing and distributing promotional signs. Until now, it has printed signs at regional centers and had them trucked to individual stores. This has resulted in some stores' receiving signs late.
*Kiosks will be installed throughout the Sears retail network to allow shoppers to telephone for information from a Sears representative on everything from availability of replacement parts for cars and major appliances to delivery times for out-of-stock items.
*Personnel at store credit-card desks will be trained to handle refunds and returns, reducing the need for two separate staffs.
But the deepest reductions in staffing will take place in back rooms and on loading docks.
For example, even though operations at the headquarters here are modern, many Sears stores still keep books manually. Some stores have up to 35 logs that keep track of things like merchandise shipped and received. The program calls for computerization of these logs.
"We do expect significant savings, and we do expect this to improve profits," the Sears executive said.

HEADLINE: Vanished: A Man, $13 Million And Faith in a State's Banks

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 3

 BODY:
Month after month last year, the money poured out of a small neighborhood bank here in what its president depicted as a legitimate series of $13 million in loans.
The only trouble, investigators have found, is that the 128 people and businesses listed as loan recipients neither applied for nor received any of the money. Instead, the investigators say, it went to the bank president himself, Joseph Mollicone Jr., who has disappeared. 
 Law-enforcement agents say the story of the bank, the Heritage Loan and Investment Company, is the story of how one man, and a mere $13 million, set off Rhode Island's bank crisis, forcing into insolvency the private fund that insured one-third of the state's depositors and leading the Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, to declare a bank emergency on Tuesday, his first day in office. It is also an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of organized crime here, and the close connections that law-enforcement officials say exist in this state between organized crime, business and politics.
The 47-year-old Mr. Mollicone (pronounced MAHL-la-cone), who drove a black Porsche and lived in the wealthiest part of town, was last seen Nov. 8, when his son dropped him off at Logan Airport in Boston for a flight to Newark, just as state banking officials began to sift through the series of allegedly fraudulent loans. But investigators say there was no ticket in his name, and a worldwide manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol has turned up no clues to his whereabouts. Investigators say they assume he is still alive but add that they have no proof.
"The enormity of what happened is incredible," said James E. O'Neil, Rhode Island's Attorney General. Mr. O'Neil is supervising a state grand jury investigation into Mr. Mollicone and Heritage that he said today was "the biggest in state history."
"Part and parcel of our investigation is to determine what role organized crime played in the Heritage affair," Mr. O'Neil said. As part of the investigation, state police officers removed cartons of records today from the bank's main office, a small brick and glass building on Atwells Avenue in Providence's tightly knit Italian-American section.
Among those who were listed as recipients of the fraudulent loans, investigators say, were Mr. Mollicone's father-in-law, his godfather, his golfing partners and Vincent A. (Buddy) Cianci Jr., a convicted felon who was re-elected as this city's Mayor shortly afterward.
Investigators say that in addition to issuing the apparently fraudulent loans, Mr. Mollicone forced several depositors in Heritage to give him blank withdrawal slips, which he then used to make withdrawals they had not authorized. Law-enforcement officials say they are still unclear what Mr. Mollicone's main purpose was and what he did with the money they say he took from Heritage.
One official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said investigators were working on several theories: the possibility that Mr. Mollicone was using his bank to launder money for organized crime, that he was shielding the real identity of depositors by putting money in accounts without properly recording the customers' names and that he was personally siphoning off mortgage money repaid to the bank.
Whichever explanation of his actions proves correct, the consequences were dramatic and widespread, coming at a time of recession in Rhode Island and weakness in banking across the country.
 
Run on the Bank
 On Nov. 13, after Gov. Edward D. DiPrete ordered an investigation into reports of irregularities uncovered in audits, including evidence of the bogus $13 million in loans, nervous customers staged a run on Heritage, withdrawing more than $13 million of its $22 million in deposits. That forced the private Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, which insured 10 banks and 35 credit unions in the state, to deplete most of its $25 million in reserves.
State officials then ordered Heritage temporarily closed, but when it was reopened on Dec. 4, customers began withdrawing the remaining $8.5 million. The insurance fund then had to pump the rest of its reserves into Heritage, effectively forcing it into insolvency last Monday. It now has $2 million to $8 million, officials say.
So while despositors in Heritage got all their money back, customers at some other banks and credit unions have had their accounts frozen by the new Governor, Mr. Sundlun, and may have trouble recovering their money.
Lee Blais, a former director of criminal investigations for the Rhode Island Attorney General's office, said one factor in the troubles was Rhode Island's "old boy" network. In 1985, he said, he helped compile a report on weaknesses in the private bank insurance fund, which he delivered to Governor DiPrete. He said he also briefed the Governor on connections between Heritage and organized crime.
But Mr. Mollicone was a vice chairman of the fund, and investigators said he was so well connected socially and politically that nothing further was done.
 
'Real Problem of Cronyism'
 Mr. O'Neil, the current Attorney General, also raised questions about the operating methods of the fund, known as Risdic. He noted that there had been no audit of Heritage for three years, though an audit is required every 15 months under Risdic's procedures. And last July, when Risdic examiners finally did begin to look at the banks' books, they found a large number of "off-line" loans, or loans not recorded in the bank's computer and filed with proper documentation.
But the insurance fund did not notify the Atttorney General's office or the State Department of Business Regulation of these problems until Nov. 1. "There seems to be a real problem of cronyism," Mr. O'Neil said.
Mr. Mollicone further insulated himself from scrutiny by filling Heritage's board of directors with golfing partners, business associates and his father-in-law. Among the directors was John Muratore, a 68-year-old man who played golf with Mr. Mollicone on Saturdays. One day, Mr. Muratore recalled in an interview, Mr. Mollicone asked him and another golfing partner if they would like to be on the board.
"We said, 'O.K., that sounds good,' " Mr. Muratore said. In the past 10 years he attended only about two board meetings, he went on, adding, "We didn't do anything."
Banking was a family business for Mr. Mollicone. His father, Joseph Mollicone, ran County Loan and Finance Corporation, which he merged into Heritage and incorporated under his son's name in 1975.
The elder Mr. Mollicone was a close friend of Raymond L. S. Patriarca, the longtime head of organized crime in New England, said Mr. Blais, the former state investigator. From 1962 to 1965, when the F.B.I. monitored Mr. Patriarca's office with listening devices, the elder Mr. Mollicone's name was often used, with Mr. Patriarca directing him to make certain transactions.
Capt. Brian Andrews of the State Police said that after Mr. Mollicone's bank was twice broken into and vandalized last year, he told the State Police that he realized he had a problem with organized crime but that he could "take care of it myself" because he was friendly with Luigi Manocchio, one of the leading contenders to become the new head of organized crime in New England.
"That came as no surprise to us, because on many occasions we had observed Manocchio going into Heritage Loan," Captain Andrews said.
Captain Andrews said the vandalism might have been a "message" to Mr. Mollicone from someone in the Patriarca family, but it was unclear what had prompted the incidents.
 
A Leading Figure in Providence
 Mr. Mollicone was also a leading figure in Providence's business and political circles. According to The Providence Journal, he owned or had an interest in at least two dozen properties in the city. One was the old Providence Journal building, which he had rehabilitated in 1983 and persuaded Mayor Cianci to lease for office space for two city agencies at high rents. Mr. Cianci's action touched off charges of bid rigging and conflict of interest from members of the City Council. In the same year Mr. Mollicone bought Mr. Cianci's house on Blackstone Boulevard, in the city's most fashionable neighborhood.
Mr. Cianci did not return a reporter's telephone calls to his office today. He was re-elected in November even though he pleaded no contest in 1984 to charges of attacking a man he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife. He beat the man with a log and an ashtray while Mr. Cianci's police guard stood by.

HEADLINE: Cost of Labor Peace;
With New Wage Pact, Dinkins Risks More Criticism of Fiscal Management

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
In two weeks, Mayor David N. Dinkins is to unveil a financial plan that seems certain to summon painful memories of the bad old days of the 1970's. So what was he doing this week giving municipal workers a raise?
 First, the Mayor gained labor peace, which is better than the alternative. Because of the way the deal is structured, it would not add to the growing gap in the budget that his administration is now preparing. And, said Eric J. Schmertz, the city's Labor Relations Commissioner, Mr. Dinkins believes the increase in wages and benefits, which amounts to 5 percent over 15 months for 150,000 city workers, is fair and necessary. 
 "The Mayor is very concerned about the impact of substantial cost-of-living increases and he wants to do something about it," Mr. Schmertz said in an interview yesterday. "We're trying to keep a decent work force. We're trying to do something about morale. That's important at a time of economic adversity."
But in agreeing to a $233 million labor settlement with District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on top of a $236 million settlement with the teachers' union, Mr. Dinkins has clearly risked more criticism when his ability to manage the city's worsening fiscal condition is already under close scrutiny.
 
Worried About Expense
 If times were less perilous, the contracts might have been hailed as among the cheapest in years. Instead, fiscal monitors and other budget experts were worried about the expense, much as they were when the slightly more generous teachers' contract was reached in October.
With the city's economy sputtering, tax revenues sagging and budget gaps reopening only weeks after they were thought to have been closed, the new contracts all but guarantee that some municipal workers will be getting raises while others are losing their jobs and the city is closing firehouses, increasing school class sizes, rebuilding fewer roads and picking up less trash.
"We tried mightily," said Mr. Schmertz, when asked whether the city sought to persuade the unions to defer or even give up raises to keep more of their members on the payroll. But Barry Feinstein, head of the teamsters' union local, said the city was never willing to guarantee jobs would be saved.
Not that Mr. Feinstein believes that all the layoffs that have been threatened will materialize, since he said he disagreed with the administration's increasingly gloomy view of the city's economic prospects.
"We look at the same numbers they look at," he said. "We put a different view on them."
 
Pressure on Leaders
 Given the nature of the city's "me too" bargaining, though, the deal with the teamsters and District Council 37 was probably sealed when the teachers won a 5.8 percent increase in wages and benefits in a one-year contract. That pact boxed the city and the other unions in, giving workers a target and putting their leaders under pressure to attain it.
"We did that, I did that," Mr. Schmertz said of the teachers' contract. "I will defend that contract to my dying day, but as the first contract it created problems."
As in the teachers' pact, much of the cost in the latest agreement would be covered by a rise in the assumption of how much the workers' pension fund would earn, to 9 percent from the current 8.25 percent. This would allow the city to use money that it would have contributed to the fund for raises. It also would allow Mr. Dinkins to assert that the only city money required for the raises was already in the budget, so the increase would not widen the city's spending gap.
At a time when the financial markets in which much of the pension money is invested are shaky, however, the pension fund change, which requires the approval of the State Legislature and the Governor, is making fiscal monitors anxious. And if such money must be spent, some fiscal experts would prefer it be used to maintain services, not raise salaries.
 
No Sense of Crisis
 To Felix G. Rohatyn, the outgoing chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state panel that watches over the city's finances, the current labor talks point up differences in the way the city and the municipal unions now face fiscal strife.
A decade and half ago, when the city was nearly bankrupt, leaders of labor, management and the business community formed a coalition. Workers deferred a 6 percent raise they had already won in exchange for a city policy that made layoffs a last resort. The workers eventually got their money when the city re-entered the financial markets and could balance its budget even with the workers' raises, which happened in the early 1980's.
This time, which Mr. Rohatyn believes is even more threatening, it is nevertheless more like business as usual for the city and its unions.
"It really does seem that there is no sense of impending crisis here," he said, "because if there were, these negotiations would not have come to this conclusion."
 
A Different Approach
 But Stanley Hill, the head of District Council 37, remembered the 1970's differently. He said his members were hurt then, when tens of thousands of city employees lost jobs. This time, they took a different approach.
With this week's labor agreement, the city has brought about two-thirds of its work force under contract agreements. It must still bargain with the uniformed city workers, who traditionally receive the best deal. But Mr. Schmertz, the Labor Commissioner, is already talking about more bargaining with the unions to find ways to reduce the number of layoffs. And if the city's economy worsens enough, he said, contracts already settled could be reopened.
But that hardly seems likely to console Mr. Rohatyn.
"You don't have to be a pessimist," he said, "to be extremely worried about where this is all going."

HEADLINE: Discount Stores Lead in December Sales Gains

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
In the face of the slowing economy, many consumers did their Christmas shopping at discount stores last month. While a number of the nation's largest department stores reported poor December sales yesterday, discount store chains like Wal-Mart Target and Venture posted respectable sales gains in light of the poor economy.
Retail analysts said the poor showing by the department stores was a further sign that the economy -- already battered by rising unemployment, declining industrial output and a housing slump -- was in a recession. 
 "The consumer generally traded down this Christmas," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, a Minneapolis-based retailer that operates both department and discount stores, including Target Stores. "The Wal-Marts, the Targets, the K Marts did better than the high-end retailer."
 
Sears Sales Lackluster
 Among department stores, both Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penny Company posted lackluster sales figures.
Sears said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 21,000 jobs as part of a continuing program to reduce expenses. It also announced more than a dozen other steps to improve its competitiveness.
Daniel Barry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, said that half of the department stores he follows reported flat or declining sales for December when comparing sales at stores open for more than a year.
"The department stores did distinctly worse than the discounters," Mr. Barry said.
Analysts said white-collar workers, who typically shop at department stores, had been hit hard by the current economic slowdown. "This recession started as a yuppie recession," said Monroe Greenstein, an independent retail analyst.
Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson also said this Christmas season lacked a hot product in women's fashion or consumer electronics to draw shoppers into department stores.
For stores open more than a year in Dayton Hudson's department store division, which includes the company's two Midwest department store chains, Marshall Field's and Dayton's, sales were flat in December. Sales at the company's Target Stores open for more than a year rose 4 percent.
 
Wal-Mart Assessment
 At Wal-Mart, Paul R. Carter, the chief financial officer, said of the company's 6 percent gain in December for stores open more than a year, "In light of the current environment, it was a pretty good performance."
Analysts said Wal-Mart normally posts double-digit same-store sales gains.
Retailing executives and analysts use same-store results, or the results of stores open for more than a year, as the best measure of a company's performance.
Some large retailers, like R. H. Macy & Company and Montgomery Ward & Company, do not report sales figures on a monthly basis.
Venture Stores Inc., which operates 79 discount stores in eight states in the Midwest, reported same-store increases of 4.3 percent in December.
 
Gains for Specialty Retailers
 The specialty retailers the Gap Inc. and the Limited Inc. both continued to outperform the industry.
But at department stores, "the numbers are not good," Mr. Barry, the Kidder, Peabody analyst, said.
In addition to the sales decline at Sears, same-store sales fell at Carter Hawley Stores Inc., a large department store operator with extensive operations in the West, and at Dallas-based J. C. Penny Company.
Mr. Carter of Wal-Mart and Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson both said that consumers largely bought functional presents, like small appliances and household goods.
Also popular, Mr. Macke said, were footballs, fishing poles and dolls. "What we didn't sell was a lot of expensive electronic games," he said.
Despite Target's relatively strong showing, Mr. Macke said sales were below expectations companywide. "It's been a tough month and business was difficult to get," he said.
Mr. Macke said Dayton Hudson was not optimistic about the first half of the year. "Consumer confidence is as low as I have seen it in more than 20 years," he added.
 
Sales of Big Retailers
 
By The Associated Press
Here are the domestic sales for December and for the fiscal year to date reported yesterday by some of the nation's largest retailers.
The current year's sales are compared with those of the previous year.
Reporting periods vary slightly. Most retailers' fiscal years end in late January.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Lintas Hires Creative Head; Levine, Huntley Loses Chief

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
IN an unexpected move, Lintas New York said yesterday that it had reorganized its creative department and hired Tony DeGregorio, who produced numerous award-winning campaigns at Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, with the work for Subaru automobiles perhaps the best known.
Mr. DeGregorio's jump to Lintas was just one of two blows to Levine, Huntley. 
 In a telephone interview last night, Harold Levine, the agency's co-founder, confirmed speculation that Robert H. Schmidt, the chairman and chief executive, had resigned to become vice president for marketing at the Dreyfus Corporation, one of the agency's clients.
Mr. Levine, chairman of the agency's executive committee, will assume the chairmanship and said he would name a replacement within 60 days.
Levine, Huntley, with billings of more than $200 million, has been one of New York's fastest-growing agencies.
 Mr. DeGregorio, who had been Levine, Huntley's creative director for three years, will become an executive vice president at Lintas, the agency for Diet Coke and other giant accounts, and will oversee its creative department. He will also assume some responsibility for day-to-day operations, assisting Frank DeVito, the president, who has taken on the added task of overseeing the creative output of Lintas's offices in Canada and Latin America.
In addition to Mr. DeGregorio, Lintas hired Catherine St. Jean as director of creative services. She held a similar post at DDB Needham.
Some industry executives speculated that Lintas had hired Mr. DeGregorio in part to give new pizazz to the advertising for Diet Coke. Executives at the Coca-Cola Company have reportedly been pushing Lintas to create a new strategy for Diet Coke's celebrity-laden "Just for the taste of it" campaign, which has essentially not changed in eight years.
But Mr. DeVito said that was not the case. "Tony is one of the best creative minds in the business," Mr. DeVito said. "I hired him to bring fresh thinking to all of our work. He will undoubtedly change things, but his mandate isn't to stir things up."
Mr. DeVito did confirm that Coca-Cola executives had been putting pressure on Lintas to revamp Diet Coke's advertising. "The motto at Coke is 'The world belongs to the discontented,' " he said. "They've been pushing for us to move on to the next step, but we're reluctant to move away from a successful campaign."
For his part, Mr. DeGregorio said he had decided to join Lintas because he needed to challenge himself. "I'd done everything there is to do at Levine, Huntley," he said. "This is an opportunity to work on brands that are No. 1 in their categories."
At Levine, Huntley, Mr. DeGregorio said he had primarily worked with clients like Subaru that were not category leaders and were looking for aggressive advertising to increase market share. "When you're working for No. 3, you have to do a lot of underdog advertising," he said.
Mr. DeVito said he had taken on a larger role at the agency because Canada and, more important, Latin America were becoming substantially more critical for many of Lintas's multinational clients, like Lever Brothers, I.B.M., Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola.
"Many of our clients are telling us they want coherent and cohesive marketing messages around the world," Mr. DeVito said. "My involvement will make it easier to get consistent strategies country to country."
Many of the agency's clients are also paying greater attention to Latin America. Industry executives forecast that because of the region's growing political and economic stability, it will be the next area of big growth in advertising.
To help its clients with sticky strategic problems anywhere in the Americas, Lintas has also formed a special creative committee made up of the top creative directors from these regions. "This way if there is a problem in Brazil," Mr. DeVito said, "we can put together a task force to find the smartest idea."

HEADLINE: Sharp Rise In Claims By Jobless

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits soared 16.8 percent, to 515,000, the week before Christmas, the highest level in nearly eight years, the Labor Department reported today.
Normally, the weekly report on initial jobless-insurance claims receives little attention. But the figures tend to move sharply at economic turning points, and consequently analysts have begun to monitor them closely for clues as to the severity of the recession that even the Bush Administration now acknowledges exists. 
 Jobless claims are among the favorite lesser-known indicators of economists these days. Others in the group include automobile assembly schedules, orders for long-lasting capital goods and factory and service-sector employment.
Today's report, which covered the week ended Dec. 22, intensified fears about the economy because the increase was exceptionally large, and it followed two straight weekly declines. Friday's report on the overall labor market for December is expected to show the jobless rate rising above 6 percent -- perhaps as high as 6.2 -- from November's level of 5.9 percent.
Traders in the credit markets repsonded to today's report, bidding up prices of Treasury securities. At the same time interest rates fell. [Page D5.]
One economic report today brought a break in the economic clouds. Sales of new homes rose 2.8 percent, to an annual rate of 506,000, in November, the Government said. It was the first gain in five months. Analysts said it indicated the slumping housing market might be stabilizing. [Page D6.]
 
Volatile Figures
 Analysts cautioned that the figures on applications for state jobless benefits were volatile, particularly at the end of the year when many companies close plants and idle workers temporarily. Adjustments for this seasonality may not adequately address the volatility.
Another drawback is that someone who loses or quits a job may get another one almost immediately.
Therefore some analysts, including Robert H. Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank North America, prefer to look at the number of people actually collecting benefits.
Today's report showed 2,987,000 workers receiving payments in the week ended Dec. 15, compared with 3,006,000 in the week before. Initial claims precede benefits by one week.
For all its gyrations, initial claims are still seen as a valuable, forward-looking indicator, one with a signal so strong it can scarcely be ignored.
After chugging along at about 350,000 for much of early 1990, initial claims in early fall suddenly "went straight up like a rocket" to more than half a million, said Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
Economists are also paying close attention these days to the automobile industry, which still has a powerful effect on the economy, although not so big as it once had.
Sales slumped to a 5.1 million annual rate in mid-December, industry figures showed today, continuing a slump that forced producers to cut December output to a rate of 4.8 million. Scheduled output for the first quarter has been slashed over the last several weeks by 14 percent, to a 5.7 million rate, according to Ward's Automotive Reports.
Mr. Logan is among those who believe that it is business investment, not the statistically larger and steadier consumer sector, that will determine the length and severity of recession. He is closely watching the volume of orders received by factories for goods expected to last at least three years. The Commerce Department reported last week that they fell 10.5 percent in November.
 
Sifting Through Clues
 As for the job data, specialists on Friday will pay relatively little attention to the unemployment rate, believing that better economic clues are to be found in how many additional factory jobs were lost, how many aggregate hours were worked by production personnel and whether further gains in health jobs were enough to overcome losses elsewhere.
Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said he would be particularly eager to compare the two surveys the Labor Department uses to count jobs -- one of households, the other of business payrolls.
In general, economists believe the number of jobs reported by the payroll data is the better gauge, but Mr. Jordan has noticed that in previous recessions the household survey appeared to be more accurate.

HEADLINE: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
A Senator Arrives, Ruffling Feathers

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
On his first day in office, Paul Wellstone made it clear that he will not be a conventional go-along, get-along United States Senator.
Mr. Wellstone, the only candidate to beat an incumbent Senator in the November elections, was ruffling senatorial feathers even before he was sworn in today. 
 After arriving in the capital in the battered green school bus that was a trademark of his no-frills upset campaign, the Minnesota Democrat left it parked outside the Dirksen Senate Office Building, taking up four parking spaces reserved for members and employees.
What left some old Senate hands grumbling the loudest was Mr. Wellstone's decision to buck tradition at the swearing-in ceremony today. The 34 other Senators who were sworn in were each escorted to the well of the chamber by the other Senator from their state.
But instead of asking Minnesota's senior Senator, Dave Durenberger, a Republican, to accompany him, Mr. Wellstone called on Walter F. Mondale, a former Vice President and Democratic Senator from the state.
Mr. Wellstone said that he had nothing against Mr. Durenberger but that Mr. Mondale was a "statesman" whose "support was critical" in his victory over Senator Rudy Boschwitz.
Mr. Wellstone said the fact that Mr. Durenberger was denounced by the Senate last year for improper financial dealings had nothing to do with his decision.
He said Mr. Durenberger took the decision well and even joked about it.
"I called up Dave Durenberger," Mr. Wellstone said before he was sworn in, "and I said to him that I really wanted to have Walter Mondale escort me. He said, 'If you were a Republican, I'd be pretty worried -- I'd feel slighted.' "
Indeed, Mr. Durenberger insisted, "This is Paul Wellstone's day and he can handle his swearing in the way he wants to."
Whatever hard feelings Mr. Durenberger may have felt, he did not display them as he watched his new colleague being sworn in. With an outstretched arm, he welcomed Mr. Wellstone, a former political science professor, to the exclusive political club.
"Congratulations, Mr. Senator," he said with a smile.
 
Budget Fight Revisited
 Remember the budget battle that came to dominate, even overwhelm, the 101st Congress? It was back practically in full force today in the House of Representatives.
Immediately after representatives were sworn in, civility gave way to rancor when Democrats proposed a change in House rules to allow the Congressional Budget Office, not the Republican-controlled Office of Management and Budget, to make binding budget estimates, which are critical in drafting the budget.
Republicans, who would prefer the O.M.B. to have the authority, angrily objected, saying the Democrats were turning back on an agreement that was brokered in budget negotiations.
Buttons proclaiming "A Deal Is A Deal" sprouted on the lapels of some House Republicans.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, shouted over the presiding officer's gavel that the Democratic move was a "demonstration of oppression of the minority."
Even Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican and minority whip who was the chief flame thrower in last year's budget battle, got into the act.
"On the very first day we are in session," he declared, "the Democrats are breaking their agreement with the President."
But as is usually the case in the Democrat-controlled House, the Republican oratory, no matter how strong, mattered little.
The rules change was passed by a vote along party lines.
Saying he was "deeply disappointed and disturbed," President Bush vowed to veto any bill that contains the language in the rule that passed today. "Changing the House rules with a purely party line vote is neither fair nor right," Mr. Bush said in a statement, adding that the matter was "fundamental to public confidence in the budget agreement and in the Government itself."
 
Change of Face
 While they call it the "permanent" Congress, because most members are re-elected, there is something of a new face to the Congress that convened today.
As Representative Glenn M. Anderson, a California Democrat, wandered into the House chamber today, a doorkeeper had to stop himself from addressing him with the same greeting he has offered for years.
"Oh my God, I almost said, 'Hello Mr. Chairman,' " the embarrassed doorkeeper said.
Mr. Anderson, a veteran lawmaker, was ousted last month as chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee.
There are 44 new faces in the House. And, while Mr. Wellstone is the only Senator who has never held elective office, there are three other new Senators who moved up from the House.
Another figure who will be roaming the halls of Congress -- but was nowhere to be seen today -- is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of the District of Columbia's two newly elected "shadow" Senators. Mr. Jackson will not have voting privileges or a seat in the chamber and will use his unpaid post to lobby for statehood for the capital.
While the only ceremony for him was at the Convention Center here Wednesday night, Mr. Jackson insisted today that he did not want a ceremony at the Capitol. He dismissed rumors to the contrary as "completely unfounded."
 
Bills at the Start
 In seeking, rather unsuccesfully, to avoid a public floor debate over the Persian Gulf, Senate leaders did not follow their customary practice of allowing members to introduce new bills and resolutions on opening day.
But in the House, lawmakers rushed to introduce dozens of measures on dozens of topics.
Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, Republican of Nevada, introduced legislation that would prohibit states from taxing the pensions of retirees who had moved to the state after earning their pensions in another state.
Besides the gulf crisis and budget matters, priorities of the new Congress include developing an energy policy, revamping the campaign finance system, taking steps to fight a recession and repairing the nation's crumbling roads and bridges.
Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker, ushered in the new session with words that had probably been uttered by each of his predecessors: "I think we're going to have an extremely active and productive Congress."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Aides Say Budget Needs Millions More in Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Top Dinkins administration officials said yesterday that New York City's fiscal problems had worsened sharply in recent weeks and would require several hundred million dollars of additional budget cuts by June 30.
They said the city's current budget gap had grown to $500 million, double the $250 million gap disclosed only three weeks ago. 
 The disclosure came only a day after the city announced a tentative $233 million settlement that would give a wage and benefit increase of 5 percent to two of the city's large municipal unions.
At the same time yesterday, estimates of the city's budget gap -- the difference between expected revenue and projected spending -- for the next fiscal year, beginning on July 1, grew from $1.6 billion, to between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion, an increase of as much as $500 million.
 
'It Really Hurts'
 "It is not a mischaracterization to say that this is a fiscal crisis," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director. "We also feel that we are in a position to deal with it, based on our past experience in handling very sizable problems. But it really hurts."
The new figures for this fiscal year mean that service cuts and layoffs will be deeper than originally planned. Even before the latest announcement, budget officials were preparing severe service reductions, job cuts and layoffs to reduce city spending in the midst of a recession in which tax revenues have dropped far below expectations.
Estimates have ranged up to 20,000 jobs to be cut, many of them through layoffs over the next few years. Yesterday, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said he would seek worker furloughs that would shut schools for three days in the spring semester to avoid 4,000 layoffs. [Page B1.]
In a dramatic indication of the budget troubles, the city closed three fire companies yesterday, in the face of weeks of community protests, to save $3 million a year. At one firehouse, on Pitt Street in lower Manhattan, two protesters handcuffed themselves to a fire truck.
 
'Not the Place to Make Cuts'
 "The Fire Department is not the place to make cuts," said Claire Kaleem, pushing a baby stroller near the Pitt Street firehouse. "It is not a question of convenience but life and death."
The Fire Department has said it would have to cut 41 fire companies next year -- or one out of nine companies in the city -- to save $41 million next year. Firefighters have warned that these sharp cuts would signficantly add to response time to fires and cause additional deaths and injuries.
The firefighters at the closed companies will be transferred to firehouses throughout the city.
City officials said the firehouse closings were expected to have only a slight effect on response times to fires.
City officials said the contracts negotiated by Mayor David N. Dinkins over the weekend -- providing employees of two unions with 5 percent wage and benefit increases over the next 15 months -- did not worsen the budget deficit because half of the funds for the settlement come from a pension fund change that would reduce city pension contributions.
But some fiscal experts and public officials have questioned the propriety of substantial pay raises at a time when city officials have said they may have to cut thousands of jobs.
This concern was underscored yesterday as firefighters and neighborhood leaders asserted that closing fire companies could cost lives as fire trucks would take longer to get to fires in some neighborhoods. For each company closed, the city is expected to save about $1 million a year.
 
'People Are Disgusted'
 "It defies logic," said Dario Centorcelli, president of the Richmond Hill Block Association in Queens, who lives down the street from Engine Company 294, which was closed as the overnight shift ended at 9 A.M. yesterday. "Here they gave more than $200 million for wage increases when you are talking about $1 million a firehouse. People are disgusted, unbelieving and frightened."
Budget officials attributed the new budget gaps to reduced collections of city income taxes and the mortage recording and other real estate-based taxes, as well as figures showing that the recession had cut private-sector employment in the city beyond levels previously forecast.
"I really can't say that there is a tax that is doing anything to impress us now," Mr. Michael said.
While not characterizing service cuts and layoffs as a positive development, he said the fiscal situation would force the city to make the municipal government smaller and more efficient, steps that would eventually be needed for its long-term fiscal health.
 
'Reinforces Our Commitment'
 "It just reinforces our commitment to downsize government," he said, "and we are going to have very significant service reductions. We feel that is absolutely essential."
Mr. Michael noted that as of now, new gap projections continue to assume more than $329 million in additional state aid in the 1992 fiscal year. If, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo warned, the state is unable to provide the extra aid sought by the city, the gap could go far beyond the $2.1 billion figure.
The city is due to disclose plans to close the gap in the current budget, as well as to present the outlines of a balanced budget for the next fiscal year, on Jan. 16. On Wednesday, after announcing the labor settlement, Mr. Dinkins plunged into a series of budget meetings that are scheduled to continue every day for the next two weeks.
In December, when the administration acknowledged a $250 million gap, it warned that the city would have to cut an additional 7,000 to 10,000 jobs this fiscal year -- about half of them through layoffs. To save $500 million in the second half of the fiscal year, the city would have to make deep and painful cuts, in effect making $1 billion in service cuts on an annual basis.
Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, said the administration had asked city commissioners to prepare budget cuts totaling 17.5 percent for the next fiscal year, much of it through cuts in payroll. At the time, he said, he thought much of the cuts would be set aside for contingencies. "We will have to go very far into that list," he said.
Mayor Dinkins's statements during the last few days have grown increasingly gloomy as the likelihood of more layoffs and service cuts increased.
 
'Fiscal Storm Clouds'
 "The fiscal storm clouds above our region and nation will not pass soon," Mr. Dinkins said yesterday as he announced establishment of a business-labor task force to advise him on how to preserve city services and morale in the face of substantial budget cuts.
In a statement, Mr. Dinkins said the panel was modeled on a mayoral management advisory committee set up during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's to recommend productivity improvements. That panel was composed entirely of business leaders.
The fire companies closed yesterday -- Engine 17 in Manhattan, Engine 294 on Jamaica Avenue in Richmond Hill and one marine company -- have sparked protests by firefighter unions and community groups since they were first announced in November.
On Pitt Street, firefighters posted a "Gone Out of Business" sign on the door. On Jamaica Avenue, residents held a candlight vigil last night outside the firehouse. Community groups have gone to court in an effort to stop the closings of both firehouses.
The Fire Department has estimated that on average, response time to fires would go up by 13 seconds on the Lower East Side and 38 seconds in Queens, figures disputed by firefighter unions. To minimize both the political and practical effect of the cutbacks, the department has decided to cut companies from firehouses that currently house two companies.

HEADLINE: Auctions

BYLINE: By Rita Reif

 BODY:
Old Master paintings and English silver acquired under Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former President of the Philippines, and his wife, Imelda, for their palaces and guest residences and for the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, are to be auctioned on Thursday and Friday at Christie's in New York. Christie's estimates that the 97 Old Masters and 78 lots of 18th- and 19th-century English silver will bring $9 million to $14 million.
The Marcoses' property comes from two sources. The Philippine Government is selling 74 paintings and a hoard of Georgian silver; the United States Government is selling 24 Old Master works seized in July 1987 in France from Adnan M. Khashoggi, a wealthy Saudi businessman. Acquired from Mrs. Marcos in 1986, the Khashoggi paintings were discovered by the Federal Department of Justice during the investigation that led to the indictment of Mrs. Marcos and Mr. Khashoggi on charges of racketeering and fraud. When their four-month trial ended on July 2, the co-defendants were acquitted on all counts. 
 Mr. Khashoggi's art holdings are being auctioned by the Government to pay the court costs, which have not yet been revealed. After the trial, Mrs. Marcos and Mr. Khashoggi "renounced any interest they had in the paintings," said Charles G. LaBella, assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan. What remains of the proceeds are to go to the Philippines's Presidential Commission on Good Government for its land program or to help victims of earthquakes, typhoons and other disasters.
 
Some New Identifications
 Ian Kennedy, who heads Old Master sales for Christie's in New York, said the auction house's catalogue differs from the original one published by the Metropolitan Museum in Manila. "That wasn't a really serious catalogue," he said. "When we first looked at these pictures, we realized these pictures were not accurately identified."
Even so, Mr. Kennedy said, fewer than half of the attributions were changed, from one artist to another or from a named artist to his school, studio or circle. Seven paintings formerly identified as Canalettos are now described as Circle of Il Canaletto.
"Lot 2 in our catalogue, described as by the Studio of Giovanni Bellini, was called a Bellini in the Manila Museum catalogue," Mr. Kennedy said. "If it was by Bellini, it would be 10 times the estimate of $70,000 to $100,000."
Most of the paintings are of familiar religious themes, among them the sale's most important work, Francisco de Zurbaran's "David With the Head of Goliath," from the 1650's. The presale estimate is $500,000 to $700,000. Three works carry the next highest estimate in the sale, $300,000 to $400,000: Veronese's "Venice Adoring the Christ Child," a 16th-century work; Boucher's "Apotheosis of Aeneas" from 1747, and El Greco's "Coronation of the Virgin," a painted oval from the 16th century.
 
'One Mega-Lot After the Other'
 "This is the best silver sale we have ever had," said Christopher Hartop, a Christie's silver specialist, referring to the auction of silver from the Philippines to be held at 2 P.M. Thursday. "When you flip through the Marcos silver catalogue, you see one mega-lot after the other," he said. Indeed, there are stacks of plates, groups of tureens and candleholders, and pairs of wine coolers in a sale expected to bring $3 million to $4 million. The most valuable offering is a dinner service of more than 100 pieces by Paul Storr, dated 1806-07, that may sell for $600,000 to $1 million.
Eric Shrubsole, a Manhattan dealer, said predictions are difficult despite Christie's enthusiasm. "There are a lot of interesting things in the Marcos sale, but there are no Arabs waiting to buy them," he said.
Mr. Shrubsole said the services and groups of vessels will probably be broken up. "I don't think for a moment that these things are going to stay together," he said. "The more complete a dinner service is today, the more unsalable. The candlesticks by Paul de Lamerie are fabulous;, the plates are nice; the basket is not so wonderful."
Jacques Koopman, a London dealer, said by telephone: "The economy hasn't affected silver so far. Silver seems to be doing better and better. However, these silver works will sell at wholly unremarkable prices. I cannot see any great disasters or any great joys with this sale."
The sale catalogue does not say how the Marcoses used the silver. "The silver was found in two guest houses close to the palace," said Teresa Roxas, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Presidential Commission. She said it was her understanding that it would have been used there.
 
More Old Masters
 Christie's auction of Old Master paintings from other owners follows its morning sale at 2 P.M. next Friday. The 86 works offered are estimated to bring $7.9 million to $11.4 million. An 18th-century view of Venice -- Francesco Guardi's "Piazza San Marco Looking Toward San Geminiano" -- is the most important painting in the sale, a work that is expected to bring $700,000 to $900,000.
Sotheby's in New York is also holding an Old Master sale next week. "It is deliberately smaller -- one-third fewer paintings," said George Wachter, who heads Sotheby's Old Master sales. The most important work in Sotheby's auction, at 10:15 A.M. Thursday, is Lucas Cranach's "Bacchus at the Wine Tub," from 1530, a work expected to bring $1.3 million to $1.6 million. "It's in beautiful condition -- just very dirty," Mr. Wachter said.
Alan E. Salz, director of Didier Aaron, the New York gallery of the Paris-based auction house, said of the Old Master sales: "There is not a major picture or drawing in the group at either house. You are dealing basically with an unremarkable group of things, but they are certainly going to make good money."
Mr. Salz said the economy and the threat of war in the Middle East has produced smaller sales of Old Master paintings than those held by the same houses six months or a year ago.

HEADLINE: Movie Tickets Off 10%, but Not Gross

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Ten percent fewer Americans went to the movies in 1990 but higher ticket prices pushed the industry's box-office take to a near-record $5 billion.
The total amount spent by moviegoers flocking to such hits as "Home Alone" (20th Century Fox), "Pretty Woman" (Touchstone Pictures), "The Godfather Part III" ( Paramount ) and 1990's top moneymaker, "Ghost" (Paramount), was just shy of the 1989 record of $5.03 billion, the Motion Picture Association of America said in its annual report on Wednesday.
Although admissions were down 10 percent -- from 1.13 billion tickets sold in 1989 to about 1 billion in 1990 -- higher prices offset that decline, the association said.
People in the industry attributed the decline in attendance to several things. There was no runaway hit like 1989's "Batman," which made $252 million. Movie fans continued to rent and buy movies on videocassette, which does not contribute to a movie's box-office report. And some people think the recession may have cut lesiure spending.
"Ghost," a love story, made $206.1 million to become the year's most popular title and the 11th biggest of all time. "Pretty Woman," a contemporary Cinderella tale about a prostitute and a businessman, was second with a gate of $178.4 million, said the Exhibitor Relations Company, which compiles figures on movie spending.
With a sudden holiday surge, "Home Alone," a comedy featuring a child as a domestic terrorist, jumped to third place for the year with revenues of $152.1 million overall. "Home Alone" made $25.1 million over the five-day New Year's Day weekend to claim first place for the seventh straight weekend. The last film to be No. 1 for seven weeks was the original "Ghostbusters" in the summer of 1984.
The National Association of Theater Owners said ticket prices have been climbing over the last several years, increasing from an average $3.91 in 1987 to $4.11 in 1988 to $4.44 in 1989. The average price for 1990 was not available, but several theater owners said prices rose.
In a few markets, including Los Angeles and New York, movie tickets cost $7.50. The year's top-drawing actress was Julia Roberts, whose movies combined for $278.6 million in 1990, from "Pretty Woman," "Flatliners" ($61 million, Columbia Pictures) and the 1989 release "Steel Magnolias" ($39.2 million in 1990, Tri-Star Pictures). The top male draw was Patrick Swayze from "Ghost" with $206 million.

BYLINE: By RICHARD F. SHEPARD

 BODY:
TIRED of standing in line to see Mexican at the Met? Weary of looking high and low at the Museum of Modern Art? Wondering what's hanging on other walls while the Guggenheim reworks its bobsled ramp-run? Never mind, you ain't seen nothing yet, to coin a cliche (for other coins, try the American Numismatic Society in Harlem). The city that rarely owns up to a past as it ages gracelessly is home to more than a hundred museums and the multi-chambered megamuseum is but the tip of the burg.
Whatever is collectible, from the divine to the eccentric, is probably under glass somewhere within the New York City line. There's a Hall of Chinese History in Chinatown. At Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, there's the Harbor Defense Museum of New York City. The Garibaldi-Meucci Museum of the Order Sons of Italy in America in Rosebank, S.I., has an exhibition honoring the Italian liberator who was guest in this century-old landmark house when it was home to an Italian-American inventor, Antonio Meucci. 
 The Lower East Side Tenement Museum on Orchard Street takes a decidedly different tack from the course of Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum in Harlem. New York's museums cast their nets too wide to hold all their catch in these pages. The ones described here are emblematic of the diversity in store for the curious, who will be rewarded thematically, architecturally and informationally in their quest. There's a SoHo museum with two floors of antique fire engines. Another museum, in Brooklyn Heights, gives us Brooklyn family portraits of the sort not to be seen in a gangster film.
A visit to a historic Flushing house will make you an expert on Queens movie palaces of yesteryear.
In a Jewish enclave of Spanish-speaking north Manhattan, you can learn about a 500-year-old forced mass emigration from Spain.
The Lower East Side Ukrainians, although awash in East Village bohemians, make a proud show of their past and present a few floors up on Second Avenue in Manhattan.
But first, as the old recordings in the Museum of Broadcasting would say, a word about the 18 subway cars and the people who love to board them, even though they are not going anywhere except backward in time.
The New York Transit Museum is a one-of-a-kind, an underground museum that is, barring a last-minute reprieve, an endangered species. Its extinction, in the name of economy, has been voted by the powers that be. As of this moment, no actual date has been set for the end of the line and rail buffs can still make tracks to this unusual institution, a few flights down in the old and immaculately kept station of the IND line's quondam Hoyt-Schermerhorn (in local dialect, Hert-Schoimerhorn) shuttle in Brooklyn. On the station's two levels is an assortment of turnstiles (some proclaiming a 5-cent fare), a very graphic large-scale three-dimensional map of the system and 448 of its 458 stations, maps of other-city subway lines, subway car models, a demonstration model of the safety signal system, lanterns that used to indicate the destination of trains, and, of course, the 18 cars now berthed at the platforms. One may walk through and sit in the cars, which date from 1903, with open-sided platforms at each end, to 1963, an IND steel car.
The current show, through next October, is an exhibition of architectural drawings -- including under-river tunnels and over-valley viaducts -- of the early 1900's that were designed for the first section of the IRT line, the forerunner of all others.
Boerum and Schermerhorn Streets, in Downtown Brooklyn. Open Saturdays from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M., Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission: $1.15; under-17's, over-65's, 55 cents. Information: (718) 330-3063.
 
Forbes Galleries
 New Yorkers, it sometimes seems, do not get to the Forbes Magazine Galleries in Manhattan as often as out-of-towners beat a path to the door of this sleeper of a museum. Malcolm Forbes designed this enticingly escapist space in the ground floor of his magazine empire headquarters as a home for his fantastic collection of toy ships and soldiers, with very real famous manuscripts, a dozen Imperial Easter Eggs designed by Faberge, and an art exhibition thrown in for good measure. It is a splendidly ebullient display from the moment one enters the gallery in which the armada of more than 500 toy boats are deployed. Accompanying it is a triumph of museum show music down to the sound of ship whistles and appropriate nautical airs. The sound track and scenery change as one enters the next gallery, which is home to 12,000 toy soldiers, in ranks serried according to flag, historical era and war. In one setting is World War I; in the next, a battle among the ancient Greeks; in another, a German ambulance corps back in 1914 to 1918 tends the wounded. In addition, a small-scale Great Plains is the arena for the winning of the West.
The figures represent the dogfaces of all history, as well as the leaders, from Alexander the Great to George Washington. Great for the children, but there's even more here for the mature.
At 60 Fifth Avenue, at 12th Street, Manhattan. Open, free, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Information: (212) 206-5549.
 
Yeshiva Museum
 It's a split-level affair, one level on the ground floor, the other on the fourth. This is the Yeshiva University Museum in the building devoted to research and a library in the eclectic sprawl of academic buildings in Washington Heights. In the upstairs gallery, behind the designer wall of a Spanish setting, is "The Sephardic Journey: 1492-1992," a lavish exhibition that runs through Dec. 19, 1992, of a thousand items drawn from collections on several continents that tells the story of the Spanish Jews in their homeland and after their expulsion. In what the museum calls the first show ever to touch all areas of dispersion, there are models of synagogues in Toledo, Spain; Amsterdam; Curacao; Safad, Israel, and Newport, R.I., mementos from a Jewish family of the old Confederacy, the portrayal of a Moroccan wedding, and candelabras, costumes and religious articles from Turkey, which welcomed the largest part of the refugees.
At 2520 Amsterdam Avenue, at 185th Street, in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Open noon to 6 P.M. Sunday, Tuesdays through Thursdays from 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $3; 4-16's and over-65's, $1.50. Information: (212) 960-5390.
 
Fire Museum
 It may not be a four-star museum, but it's a four-alarm attraction that should bring buffs on the run to the New York City Fire Museum in SoHo. They will find two floors of the most extraordinary memorabilia, including almost a dozen pieces of ornate equipment, dating from a 1790 end-stroke hand pumper to a 1912 gas-driven tractor with a steamer on the back and such other vehicles as a fire chief's sled, an 1882 ladder truck and various hose carriers, many of them ornamented in an extraordinarily vivid style. Within these walls, one of them smothered in departmental insignia from around the world, are dozens of fire trumpets (including the one Tiger Company gave to Boss Tweed), old fire alarm boxes, a truly attractive 800-ounce punchbowl with glasses fashioned in firemen motifs, and a weather vane topped by a miniature horse-drawn pumper. And photographs, printed memorabilia and a fire-prevention video, with real firemen, not now on active duty, at hand to assure a knowledgeable and friendly visit.
At 278 Spring Street, Manhattan. Open, free, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Information: (212) 691-1303.
 
Brooklyn History
 Of all the New York boroughs, none are more mired in cliche than Brooklyn. The museum of the Brooklyn Historical Society takes dramatic note of each feature in its current exhibition, and it goes even further, demonstrating that the borough is more than a stereotype for character actors in war movies.
The first eyecatcher is a high-standing representation of the Coney Island roller-coaster, with photos and other memorabilia of Luna Park, Steeplechase and Nathan's, along with carousels and even a fun-house mirror in which you may distort yourself. There is a wall full of the Dodgers: the Brooklyn Dodgers and other borough ball teams. An "archway" of the Brooklyn Bridge is a small-scale tribute to the nation's most famous span. And those portraits: Brooklyn family people as they saw themselves and were pictured in ambrotypes, daguerreotypes, paintings and tintypes. Finally, there is a tribute to the infinite ethnic shadings of Brooklyn, from Europe, Africa, Asia, the Americas and, yes, from New England, where so many early settlers stemmed from.
 At 128 Pierrepont Street, in Brooklyn Heights. Open Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $2.50; under-12's, $1 (free on Tuesdays). Information: (718) 624-0890.
 
Ukrainian Museum
 The Ukrainian Museum, on the third and fourth floors of a neat building on Second Avenue, is in its 15th year, having begun in the years before the Ukrainian neighborhood around it surfaced with its current spate of restaurants and shops that are now attracting outsiders.
The museum emphasizes the traditions of the Ukrainian people and usually the exhibitions are eye-openers to crafts that have been submerged in modern mechanical society. The new show there, "New Acquisitions in Ukrainian Folk Art," displays everything from clothes (blouses, shirts, dresses, exquisitely made and highly chromatic) to vases and a 19th-century forester's ax and walking stick.
 At 203 Second Avenue, at 12th Street, Manhattan. Open 1 to 5 P.M. Wednesdays through Sundays. Admission is $1 (50 cents for students and the elderly; free for those under 12). Information: (212) 228-0110.
 
Queens Historical
 Downtown cineasts probably do not pause to consider that many of the golden-oldies were fashioned in Queens, when Astoria was a world center of movie making. Queens not only made movies, it also went to the movies, and there's an exhibition at the Queens Historical Society opening on Jan. 12 that memorializes particularly three of the grandest theaters in the city, the Loews Valencia, the Loews Triboro and RKO Keith's. In addition to photographs, "Movie Palaces of Queens" does its recollections with posters, old newspaper articles, actual pieces of the facade of Keith's and a continual run of silent films. This gallery is in the downstairs of a venerable landmark, Kingsland House, a 200-year-old residence in downtown Flushing, an area rich not only in pre-Revolution history (a landmark weeping beech tree hangs out in front of the building), but also tastily awash in the latest waves of new arrivals, in the form of Chinese and Korean restaurants and shops.
 At 143-35 37th Avenue, Flushing, Queens. Open from 2:30 to 4:30 P.M. Tuesdays, Saturdays, Sundays. Admission: $2; over-65's and students, $1. Information: (718) 939-0647.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Cerone and Yankees Likely To Part Ways for Third Time

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Rick Cerone's career with the Yankees appears to be over -- for the third time.
The Yankees, needing a spot for Scott Sanderson on their 40-man roster, yesterday designated Cerone for assignment. The move means they have 10 days in which to trade or release Cerone or persuade him to accept assignment to the minor leagues. Release is the most likely choice because Cerone said he would not go to the minors. 
 "I'm not in their plans so why should I waste their time and waste my time," Cerone said in a telephone interview.
Cerone, 36 years old, has one year remaining on a two-year, $1.4 million contract. If the Yankees release him, they would have to pay him his $700,000 salary.
The Yankees initially acquired Cerone from Toronto in the Chris Chambliss trade in November 1979. They traded him to Atlanta in December 1984; signed him as a free agent in February 1987; released him in April 1988, and signed him to the two-year contract a year ago after the Boston Red Sox released him.
"We were afraid to take a chance on losing a younger player," said Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager. "We felt we were well off with our catching and could afford to do something there."
Bob Geren, a right-handed hitter, and Matt Nokes, a left-hander, are expected to be platooned as the Yankees' catchers. Jim Leyritz, who can play just about everywhere, could be the No. 3 catcher.
Michael said he would try to trade Cerone, but it is unlikely that another club would pick up his salary if it could sign him for the $100,000 minimum after his release.
The Yankees could have released Dave LaPoint or Andy Hawkins, two pitchers they have little use for, but each has a higher guaranteed salary for 1991 -- Hawkins $1.4 million, LaPoint $900,000 -- and pitchers are valuable trade commodities.
When Cerone was unemployed before the 1987 season, he called George Steinbrenner seeking an invitation to the Yankees' spring camp. Steinbrenner signed him to a $250,000 contract for that season. A year ago, when the Red Sox had little use for Cerone, Tom Reich, his agent, got the Red Sox to release him and negotiated the two-year deal with the Yankees.
Before going on the disabled list last June 8, Cerone batted .368, with 28 hits in 76 times at bat. After knee surgery June 10, he didn't play much and his average dropped to .302.

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Light Mood as Golf Season Opens

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARLSBAD, Calif., Jan. 3

 BODY:
As it has for the last several years, the golf season opened today with the Tournament of Champions at one of the country's most sumptuous decompression chambers, the La Costa Resort Hotel and Spa.
With the competitive drive not yet in full gear, the tournament seems little more than a convivial gathering of the sport's princes of privilege, the players who by winning a PGA Tour event last year, are assured of exempt status and the other perquisites that come with being among the game's best. 
 A total of 31 winners from the PGA Tour, and 13 from the Senior Tour, are on hand. Conspicuously absent are Nick Faldo of England, the Masters champion and perhaps the best player in the world, and Jose Maria Olazabal, the World Series of Golf winner. Both players make their limited appearances in this country for the three major championships. In the Senior competition, Jack Nicklaus, a two-time winner in 1990, chose to skip La Costa as part of his announced schedule reduction in 1991.
In Thursday's opening round, Lanny Wadkins, a two-time winner of the Tournament of Champions, took a three-shot lead over Tom Kite and Chip Beck with a seven-under-par 65. Among the Seniors, who are playing the from tees that make the course 200 yards shorter than the layout played by the regular tour players, Frank Beard overcame a triple-bogey 6 on the third hole to shoot a 69 to lead Bruce Crampton by one shot.
"Normally in this position, I'd be thinking about winning," the 41-year-old Wadkins said. "But it's so early in the year, I don't have any idea what to expect tomorrow."
 
Recession May Test Tour
 But with no cut and a guarantee of at least $11,000 in prize money, the mood at La Costa is light. The coming golf year, however, is one full of issues that could become foreboding.
The major issue could be the effect of the recession on what has been a sustained period of growth for the tour. Last year, four major sponsors -- RJR Nabisco, Shearson Lehman, U.S.F.& G. and the Bank of Boston -- said they were leaving the tour, and if there are other departures, it could test the tour's contention that potential sponsors have been "standing in line" to hold tournaments.
"Maybe the line is not as long," Tim Finchem, the tour's deputy commissioner, said Wednesday. "I don't think we are going to have a problem taking care of that very small level of attrition that we have had recently."
Finchem added that if the current recession lasts more than two years, "We could see some problems."
 
Faldo and Trevino
 Last year sounded a crescendo of excellence, as Faldo and Lee Trevino had two of the best seasons by male players in many years.
Faldo's main challenge will be to stay hungry despite the more than $10 million he has earned in business opportunities as a result of his victories at the Masters and the British Open. "I'll come into this season fresh, ready to improve," Faldo said.
Trevino, who won more money on the Senior Tour than Greg Norman did in leading the regular tour, said Wednesday he would play a full schedule of 30 senior tournaments, hoping to increase the seven victories of his rookie year.
"There will be a tremendous amount of pressure trying to duplicate that performance," said Trevino, who shot a 71 today, "but I'm going to try to win more."
 
Waiting in the Wings
 If Faldo and Trevino don't reach previous heights, there are several candidates to take their place.
Norman, who shot a 70 today, was consistently good enough to win the money title despite playing in only 17 official events, the fewest ever by a leading money winner. But his year was marred by a missed cut at Augusta, a poor shot on the 70th hole that cost him a chance to win the United States Open, and a crushing third-round 76, while paired with Faldo, that took him out of contention at the British Open.
Also in the wings are Payne Stewart, who continued his improvement in 1990; Mark Calcavecchia, who won more than $800,000 last year despite not winning a tournament, and Curtis Strange, the two-time United States Open champion.
On the international front, the 24-year-old Olazabal looked poised to make a run at being among the world's leading players. He has been a consistently high finisher in golf's major championships, and his 12-shot victory at last year's World Series was perhaps the most impressive week of golf by any player all year.
 
Looking to Ryder Cup
 Olazabal and Europe's other leading players will be primed to defend the Ryder Cup at the brand new Ocean Course at Kiawah Island, S.C., in September against a United States team determined to reverse the perception that America has ceased to be the dominant force in golf.
Dave Stockton, the captain of the United States team, has arranged for his players to play the Ocean Course several times before September in order to get accustomed to playing conditions that approximate links-style golf more than what is typically found in America.
"If we want to win the cup, our players are going to have get some rounds in beforehand," Stockton said.

Persian Gulf
 
Congressional leaders met yesterday with President Bush to discuss the gulf situation. Supporters of the Administration favor a simple endorsement of Mr. Bush's threat of force, while oponents contend the President needs approval from Congress before taking military action. Congress is expected to remain in session through January so lawmakers can quickly be summoned.
 
Banks and Savings & Loans
 
Senate Ethics Committee hearings on the Keating Five resumed Wednesday. Trouble in the banking industry will probably lead to measures to revise the deposit insurance system and to strengthen bank supervision.
 
The Budget
 
Debate is expected to be short this year because of the deficit-reduction plan passed last October. Hearings will begin soon after the President presents the budget to Congress on Feb. 4.
 
Civil Rights
 
Democrats are pushing a bill intended to overcome recent Supremem Court rulings against affirmative action programs and rulings that make it difficult to win job-discrimination suits.
 
Health Care
 
Democrats may push for a family leave bill. Some lawmakers may advocate a program to provide health coverage for all Americans, expanding Medicare and protection for the uninsured.
 
Campaign Financing and Ethics
 
The Senate is expected to follow the lead of the House, which tightened rules on outside income in the last session. The Keating Five case may lead to an overhaul of campaign finance laws.
 
The Economy
 
Anti-recession measures may include expansion of unemployment insurance and job-training programs. Trade legislation to protect domestic industries will also be proposed.

HEADLINE: Another Misguided Labor Pact

 BODY:
New York City's latest labor settlement is another disturbing sign that the Dinkins administration does not fully grasp the severity of the city's fiscal predicament. Agreeing to give two major unions a 5 percent increase over 15 months -- 4.5 percent in wages, the rest in benefits -- means that City Hall has chosen to give higher salaries to union members at the expense of reducing services for all New Yorkers.
That continues the dangerous pattern set with the even more costly teachers' union contract, and reinforces the cynical fear that Mayor Dinkins is more concerned about rewarding his political supporters in the labor movement than he is in leading New York through this damaging recession. 
 Most troubling is the Mayor's accurate but misleading claim that the $233 million pact does not increase the ever-growing budget deficit. The city will nonetheless pay a high price for the new agreement. Money for the settlement could have been spent instead on shrinking city services. And the higher wages will lead to even more layoffs than already anticipated, a trade-off that, to their discredit, union leaders traditionally favor. The settlement also requires a risky change in the workers' pension plan that could force the city to ante up additional pension contributions in coming years.
The new pact gives District Council 37 and the teamsters a wage increase of 3.5 percent in the first year -- 1.5 percent from money already reserved in the city budget and 2 percent from the city contribution to the workers' pension fund. The pact also provides a 1 percent wage increase from city funds in the beginning of the second year.
City Hall says the settlement bought peace at a time when the city needs labor's cooperation. But at what cost? The agreement will, sooner or later, weaken New York's already shaky finances. For instance, almost half the pay raise will come from reducing the city's contribution to the pension fund. By assuming that the fund's investments will earn 9 percent instead of 8.25 percent, New York can contribute less to the fund and devote the saving to salary increases. But if that rosy projection proves wrong over the long term, the city will have to make up the difference.
Dipping into the pension fund now is unwise for another reason: it limits the city's options to find a prudent way to do so later, with union concurrence, and then use those savings to help close the budget gap. That would help all citizens instead of just those in certain municipal unions.
The settlement could well aggravate the city's deficit problems next year. Mr. Dinkins believes that by maintaining good faith with union leaders, he will get them to accept a wage freeze when the new contracts expire; if so, they will actually have agreed to only a 5 percent wage and benefits increase over two years. But labor leaders are already balking and, if anything, Mr. Dinkins has encouraged them to seek still more from the city next year because he has demonstrated a willingness to make concessions rather than a resolve to stand firm.
The Mayor's concessions could haunt him this year as well by setting a bad precedent for the city's continuing talks with scores of other unions seeking substantial raises. "It certainly is an influential guideline, an influential pattern," the city's labor negotiator, Eric Schmertz, said of the new settlement, in case there was any doubt.
The labor agreements threaten to erode New York's ability to meet fundamental needs at a time when everything from education to bridge repair is struggling to absorb cutbacks. Unless Mr. Dinkins acknowledges his mistakes and finds a way of recouping, he could find himself and his city running out of money, opportunity and options.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Rise in Dollar Aided By Data on Unemployment

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced sharply on world currency markets yesterday in buying prompted by a better-than-expected report on United States unemployment for December.
Gold prices rose overseas but fell in United States dealings that were interrupted by a severed telephone line. On New York's Commodity Exchange, which suspended trading for three hours, gold bullion for current delivery fell $1.60 a troy ounce to settle at $384.90. 
 Investors were encouraged by a Labor Department report showing non-farm payrolls declined by 76,000 in December, about half of the drop that was expected. That put the civilian unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, up two-tenths of a percentage point from the previous month.
"We had received such bad economic news over the past 10 days that most people were expecting a significantly worse number," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York.
Traders sold dollars in anticipation of a weak number, "and, frankly, there were just no more dollars to sell," he said. The dollar moved higher on technical buying.
The market shrugged off a Commerce Department report showing orders to United States factories plunged 5.9 percent in November, the steepest decline on record.
The unemployment report seemed to overshadow the latest developments in the Persian Gulf crisis. The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, agreed to meet next week in Switzerland with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for the first high-level talks between the two nations since the crisis erupted on Aug. 2.
"That would normally make the dollar go lower," but the market was focused on the economic data, said Michael Schaufler, a trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 2.08 yen, to a closing 133.32 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 135.10 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 134.85 yen, up from 133.00 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9340, from $1.9465 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9350 to buy one pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.9475.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5050 German marks, up from 1.4925; 1.2740 Swiss francs, up from 1.2645; 5.1070 French francs, up from 5.0720; 1,132.00 Italian lire, up from 1,123.00, and 1.1513 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1529.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $387.75 a troy ounce, from $386.75 bid for an ounce late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $387.50 from $385.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.22 to close at a bid $387.99.
Silver prices were mostly lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.155 a troy ounce, down from $4.214 on Thursday. In London the metal was quoted at a late bid price of $4.17 a troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday.

HEADLINE: Few Riches in Rags These Days

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The rag trade is looking a bit frayed. Already battered by competition from low-cost imports, hundreds more American clothing makers were driven out of business last year by the weak economy and poor retail sales.
Nationwide, the industry lost 50,000 jobs in the last 12 months, according to the American Apparel Manufacturers Association. As Wall Street took note of the industry's troubles, the stocks of many well-known companies, including the Hartmarx Corporation, Gitano Group Inc., Farah Inc., Russ Togs Inc. and V. F. Corp., fell sharply in 1990. 
 People who closely follow the making and selling of clothes say that 1991 will probably be no better. In fact, apparel executives predict that the problems that clothing stores are having selling their dresses and suits will increasingly hurt the apparel business. As more retailers go out of business, they will leave garment makers with stacks of uncollectible bills. As a result, experts predict that a fresh wave of consolidation will take place in an industry already shrunk because of imports.
"In the next several years, you will see the larger, well-financed apparel makers acquiring their weaker brethren," said Gerald G. Johnson, the chief financial officer of the V. F. Corporation, which makes Lee and Wrangler jeans.
New York City, the center of the nation's garment business, has suffered from the continued erosion of that once-thriving industry. Although apparel remains the single most important manufacturing industry in the city, the number of apparel jobs has declined steadily.
There are about 108,000 apparel-related jobs in New York City, nearly 6,000 fewer than last year, and 45,000 fewer than in 1980. Those figures include piece workers, as well as executives and secretaries, according to the New York State Department of Labor.
This is a critical time for garment makers, who are beginning to take orders for the important fall season. The big department stores, like the J. C. Penney Company, Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Company, are coming off a disappointing Christmas season. Despite the many pre-Christmas sales and merchants' efforts to keep inventories low, executives fear that cash-short retailers will curtail their orders in coming months.
Also, retailers with heavy debt loads make poor credit risks for apparel makers, who traditionally ship merchandise on credit. Many retailers are expected to fail within the next six months.
"This must be the worst period that I can remember for the apparel industry," said Stig Kry, the chairman of the retail and apparel business consulting firm Kurt Salmon Associates Inc. and a 30-year veteran of the industry. "It seems that there is more concern, more bad results and more bankruptcies than any other time I can remember."
 
'Quite a Shock'
 There are bright spots, most notably Liz Claiborne Inc., which has benefited from consumer's renewed interest in brand-name garments. Shoppers perceive Liz Claiborne clothes as offering quality at a good price, analysts said.
"There are pockets of poverty scattered among little islands of prosperity," said Mr. Johnson of V. F., which is based in Wyomissing, Pa. V. F. controls more than a quarter of the domestic jeans market. Profits fell sharply for the first nine months of the year, in part because of a sudden drop in jeans orders in the fall. "We had quite a shock in September," Mr. Johnson said.
Still, V. F., like other big clothing manufacturers, is expected to benefit from the current weakness of the industry by buying struggling companies. V. F. is attempting to buy Healthtex, a well-regarded maker of children's clothes that encountered problems after being involved in a leveraged buyout, then trying to expand too rapidly.
Mr. Kry, the consultant, said, "The big will grow bigger at the expense of everybody else."
The apparel industry is made up of thousands of small companies, often family owned. Mr. Kry said that there were only 65 publicly traded apparel companies, compared with more than 12,000 independent clothing makers.
 
'I Cried for Weeks'
 Much of the pain is in the smaller factories. "It seems like every week you hear of somebody closing their doors," said Shirley Fulmer, executive director of the Southeastern Apparel Manufacturers Association, a trade association based in South Carolina.
For 31 years, Vera Andrews worked for El Kay Industries, a South Carolina maker of children's clothes for stores like Wal-Mart, Sears and K Mart. El Kay filed for bankruptcy last year.
"I cried for weeks," Ms. Andrews said. She has formed her own company to make clothes on contract, and is soliciting orders from customers, hoping that Christmas sales depleted inventories. "Everything hinges on how well the stores did over the holiday season," she said. "We are a direct reflection of how well the retailer does."
In New York, union officials said many apparel makers had slowed down, rather than shut down. "Shops go to short weeks for a long time before they close," said Nick Unger, director of education and political action for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers' Union. He said that faced with weak orders, shops were either laying off some of their workers or cutting back to shortened work weeks.
 
'Shops Closing Quietly
 But Walter Mankoff, a researcher for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, said that shops were quietly closing. "As they lose business, they close," he said. "When you close a shop with 20 or 30 workers, nobody gets excited."
No one disputes that New York City will continue to play a major role as a design center, but Mr. Mankoff and others say it is important to keep the sewing jobs in the city as well. "It is still the most important manufacturing industry in the city," he said.
For years, the apparel industry has blamed low-priced imports, which now control 60 percent of the domestic market, for its problems.
But now, Mr. Unger of the Amalgamated Textiles Workers is not alone in putting more blame on the retailing industry, which has been substantially weakened by several financially driven takeovers and leveraged buyouts.
"This is a homemade recession," Mr. Unger said. "This is retail driven, not import driven." Indeed, the recession seems to be proving a truism of the clothing business that says that in bad times, children get new clothes, women get some clothes and men do without.
The slow sales are affecting even some well-regarded apparel makers. Richard Breier is president of Breier of Amsterdam, a maker of leather apparel, founded more than 100 years ago on the Lower East Side by his great-grandfather. Despite a customer list that includes Brooks Brothers, Nordstrom and Paul Stuart, the company was forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code last year. The company continues to operate and Mr. Breier said it had reorganized and would emerge from bankruptcy in the next month or two.
 
Pressure From Buyouts
 Mr. Breier said the company's problems, which included large losses on a bad shipment of leather, were internal. But, in general, he said, the retailers' problems were causing trouble for apparel makers.
"The leveraged buyouts have put incredible pressure on the retailers and in turn, on the manufacturers," he said. Of the heavy debt load carried by many stores, he said, "it is a burden to be shared."
Also, many stores have simply closed, forcing apparel makers to seek out new retail customers, who "might not buy what the old customer did, which leads to the inventory backing up," he said.
Jerry Buccino, a consultant in Chicago, said the problems at the retailing level would soon extract a further toll on apparel makers.
Mr. Buccino said in the last year that some troubled retailers have been deemed uncreditworthy by factors, the finance companies that are the traditional source of credit in the apparel business. Typically, when a retailer places an order with a manufacturer, the factor steps in and buys the retailer's bill from the manfacturer at a slight discount, and assumes the risk of collection.
If factors will not buy a retailer's receivables, manufacturers have the choice of not shipping the merchandise and losing the business, or shipping the merchandise and assuming the credit risk. "It is a tough decision," Mr. Buccino said.

Jordan Marsh Set To Shut 4 Stores

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Jordan Marsh said it planned to close four underperforming department stores as part of a plan to strengthen the company's overall performance in a weak Northeastern economy. Jordan Marsh is a subsidiary of the Allied Stores Corporation. Allied Stores, a unit of the Campeau Corporation, and a second Campeau subsidiary, Federated Department Stores Inc., are operating under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
The stores to be closed are in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Southbury and Derby, Conn., and Worcester, Mass. They will close on or before March 31. The closings will result in layoffs for 302 full-time employees and 189 part-time workers, Jordan Marsh said.

HEADLINE: JOBLESSNESS IN U.S. INCREASES TO 6.1%, HIGHEST SINCE 1987

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The nation's labor market deteriorated further in December, the Government reported today, but the figures were markedly less gloomy than many people had expected.
In the first comprehensive reading of the economy's December performance, the Government said the unemployment rate climbed two-tenths of a point, to 6.1 percent, its highest level since mid-1987, and the number of payroll jobs fell for the sixth straight month. 
 While the report showed clearly that the nation is gripped by recession, some analysts said they detected evidence that Bush Administration officials might be right in saying the worst is over. The White House is projecting that the gross national product in the fourth quarter of last year fell 3.4 percent but the decline will shrink to 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year.
 
'Troubling Information'
 Even so, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called the latest figures "difficult and troubling information," adding that the Administration remained "hopeful that the drop of interest rates and controls on Federal spending will allow this to be a short-lived recession, but no one can say for sure."
Some dubious private analysts, like Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers, said they found little comfort in the data. Mr. Richards said the slowing rate of job loss might reflect nothing more than anticipatory layoffs by companies that had shed workers earlier than usual in a recession.
But Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said, "The report showed we're still in recession, but it offered the first hints that the decline is slowing and that employment may be starting to stabilize."
The number of payroll jobs, for example, fell 76,000 last month, but that followed drops of 259,000 in November and 180,000 in October. It was only about half as large a drop as was generally anticipated, though it was widely spread across retail trade, manufacturing, construction and other areas.
For factory jobs the decline was 33,000, but this was the smallest loss since July and almost reassuring in light of a 204,000 plunge in November.
New York City went against the national trend, with a report today showing a drop of 1.1 points in the unemployment rate, to 6.3 percent. But figures inched up statewide and in New Jersey, where rates reached the highest level since 1986.
In the bond market, interest rates rose sharply as investors and traders figured that what appeared to be a slower rate of contraction might induce the Federal Reserve to defer additional steps in its easing of monetary policy.
Other bright spots cited by various analysts were a second straight 12-minute increase in the length of the average private-sector workweek and a second straight increase in payroll incomes -- average weekly wages multiplied by the number of people earning them.
 
 A Puzzling Statistic
 But the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood, said the lengthened workweek was puzzling in light of sizable job losses in recent months. She ventured that the longer hours might be the result of companies keeping production and inventories in check by juggling the size of their work forces and the number of hours people are on the job.
Dr. Norwood said the latest report was predominantly negative, calling its portrayal of current economic conditions dismal.
The unemployment rate is not rising as fast as in other recessions, particularly 1981-82, mainly because of demographic factors. The generation behind the boomers is very small and this suppresses labor force growth.
There is debate among economists about when the recession began. Most analysts place it sometime during the third or fourth quarter, but others note that manufacturing has been in decline for two years and construction for much of 1990. Some say the recession could easily be already half over, even as it is just now acknowledged to be here.
 
 Rise in an Index
 The longer workweek also contributed to the first increase in four months in the Leading Employment Index compiled by the Columbia Business School. This index, intended to predict job conditions, now stands at 205.6, up from 204.4 in November.
In addition, employment as measured by the survey of households rose 188,000 last month. This is an increase small enough to be characterized by the department as little changed, but it came after a 347,000 decline for November.
Service jobs, which had long offset declines in goods-producing jobs, fell by a total of 21,000 despite a 55,000 increase in the booming health-care sector. Retail trade, partly reflecting reduced holiday hiring, lost 50,000 jobs after seasonal adjustment, wholesale trade suffered its fourth straight monthly decline and business services fell for the third straight month.
Construction shed 30,000 more jobs last month, bringing the decline since May to 290,000 and raising the industry's unemployment rate to 14 percent from 13.3.
 
 Auto Industry Jobs
 Jobs in motor vehicles rose 20,000, but this reflected the reopening of plants closed temporarily rather than the hiring of new workers. The number of auto workers is still 55,000 below the level of mid-1990.
The quarterly tabulation of discouraged workers -- those who want a job but have given up looking -- rose 110,000, to 940,000, the highest since the first quarter of 1988. All the increase was accounted for by women, mostly black women.
In December, the number of people working part time but who wanted full-time jobs climbed by 150,000, to 5.6 million, up 560,000 since June.
Such figures prompted the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group, to revive complaints about official figures that it and others contend understate unemployment. It calculated the real rate, including the discouraged and the involuntary part-time workers, at 11.2 percent and urged the Administration to improve unemployment benefits and raise Government spending for public works projects.
 
 People Seeking New Jobs
 Unlike recent months, when layoffs rose sharply, the rise in overall unemployment in December was mainly among those re-entering the labor force -- laid-off or other workers seeking new jobs.
There was little variation in the rate of increase in unemployment among population groups last month, with the rate for adult men, adult women and teen-agers all up two-tenths of a point. The rate for blacks was unchanged at 12.2 percent, twice the overall national rate, while Hispanic unemployment rose seven-tenths of a point, to 9.3 percent.
Among the 11 biggest states, four posted declines in their unemployment rate, including Florida, whose rate fell to 5.5 percent, from 6.3. Of the seven states with rising rates, the biggest were four-tenths of a point increases for New Jersey, to 5.9 percent; Massachusetts, to 7.4 percent, and California, to 7.1 percent.
 
 Regional Differences
 Over the last year, according to other Department data, unemployment rose by about one point in the Northeast, South and West. The Midwest's rate was about unchanged for the year and for the fourth straight month in December was the lowest, at 5.6 percent, of any of the four regions.
Nationally the labor force grew by an unusually hefty 451,000 in December after two monthly declines. Since only 188,000 new jobs were generated, this meant that the ranks of the unemployed swelled by 263,000, to a total of 7.6 million.
In all, 119,191,000 Americans held jobs last month, 117,574,000 civilians and 1,617,000 members of the armed forces stationed in the United States. Including the armed forces, the unemployment rate also rose two-tenths of a percentage point, to 6 percent.
Today's report also showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours worked rebounded to 124.2 last month, from 123.4 in November and that the average workweek rose to 34.6 hours from 34.4, with factory hours rising to 40.8, from 40.5. Average hourly earnings rose by six-tenths of 1 percent, to $10.20.

HEADLINE: New York City Jobless Rate Dips

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City dipped 1.1 percentage points in December while figures inched up statewide and in New Jersey, where rates reached the highest level since 1986, labor figures showed yesterday.
The unemployment rate in New York City was 6.3 percent in December, down from 7.4 percent in November, the Regional Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Samuel Ehrenhalt, said. 
 Unemployment in New York State rose to 5.5 percent, from 5.4 percent, and in New Jersey to 5.9 percent, the highest rate in that state since early 1986, from 5.5 percent, he said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the December 1990 rate in New York City was lower than the previousDecember rate, which was 7 percent. There were 214,000 unemployed New York City residents in December, compared with 248,000 in November and 240,000 in December 1989. Extensive layoffs in New York City began after the stock market plunged in late 1987 and Wall Street and its service industries began to slow down. With tax revenues in the city dropping, Mayor David N. Dinkins has said that many city workers are facing layoffs.
In the state, the unemployment rate for all of 1990 was 5.2 percent, just slightly higher than 1989's rate of 5.1 percent.
The data in New York City are based on a sampling from 2,200 households; in New Jersey from 2,300 households, and in New York State from 5,200 households.

HEADLINE: Jobs Being Lost Fastest Among Some Top Paid

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOBURN, Mass., Jan. 4

 BODY:
Until two years ago Dan Clark, a computer systems analyst, could walk into virtually any of the booming high technology companies along Route 128 here and be offered a job.
"If I didn't take it, they would ask me why," Mr. Clark said today. But now he has been laid off from his job with Eastman Kodak, and he was attending a workshop for unemployed middle-class professionals in the Woburn office of the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training. 
 Since Massachusetts's economy began to slump in 1988, its unemployment rate has climbed sharply, from 3 percent -- the lowest of any of the major industrial states -- to 7.4 percent, according to figures made public today by the United States Labor Department.
And it is people like Mr. Clark, the well-eduated engineers, scientists, technicians and managers, who make up the most rapidly growing group of people losing their jobs in Massachusetts, state officials say.
 
 Specter of Welfare
 Mr. Clark, who is married with an 11-year-old daughter, said that his biggest concern, apart from paying his bills, is what will happen if he does not find a new job before his unemployment insurance runs out.
So far, he has used up eight weeks out of the 30 weeks for which the unemployed are eligible under the state's unemployment insurance system. After the 30 weeks, there is no extension of benefits, and Mr. Clark or any other unemployed person would have to apply for welfare.
The rapid rise in unemployment in Massachusetts has raised the possibility that the state will use up its unemployment insurance trust fund by April. If that happens, state officials said, it would turn to the Federal Government's reserve fund, as Connecticut has already done.
Jim Manning of the United States Labor Department's unemployment service, said eight states, including Massachussetts, only have enough cash left to pay for benefits through the spring. In addition, 20 states, including New York, have less than a year's reserves.
Mr. Clark, in a button-down shirt with a gold pen in his breast pocket, estimated that he had sent out 100 resumes and had managed to get nine job interviews. But so far he has not had a job offer, and Mr. Clark is beginning to think the unthinkable: he could end up applying for welfare.
"It is frightening," he said. "We are people who want to work and have all the education and the skills."
 
'A Different Response'
 Mary Muir, the director of the Woburn office, 15 miles north of Boston, said: "This is especially hard for professionals. This is the first time it has happened to them.
"Since first grade, these are the people who got the best grades, and they have always been successful. Now all of a sudden everything they do gets a different response, rejection, and they are not used to dealing with it."
Borrowing from the Federal Government's $3 billion reserve fund would cost Massachusetts extra money in interest payments, possibly reducing benefits to the unemployed.
In Massachusetts, the unemployment insurance system is financed by businesses, which pay the tax on the first $7,000 of an employee's wages.
The administration of Governor William F. Weld, who took office Thursday as the state's first Republican Governor in two decades, has said it plans to rethink the unemployment insurance system as one of its first priorities. But so far Mr. Weld has only said that he is opposed to raising the tax businesses pay to finance the system.
 
Jobless After 20 Years
 Carol Kurzman, a 52-year-old former administrative manager of a Boston law firm, has only nine weeks left on her unemployment insurance. Mrs. Kurzman, a graduate of Boston University who has worked for 20 years, has sent out 400 resumes, but so far the only offers she has received are sales jobs that pay on commission and provide no benefits like health insurance.
Continuing her health insurance is vital, she said, because her husband's company may go out of business soon. In fact, she has been using most of her unemployment money just to pay the $580 its costs monthly to continue the medical insurance policy that covers her family.
Dora McEachern, 40, who managed a recruiting firm until she was layed off last fall, still has 22 weeks of unemployment eligibility. But she and her husband are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up their middle-class life. She, too, is paying out most of her unemployment benefits to cover the cost of her health insurance policy. The family needs the policy because her husband lost his job as a land surveyor with the state last spring.
 
Home is Up for Sale
 He has since gotten a new job teaching at a junior college. But he had to take a 50 percent pay cut and gets no medical insurance.
The McEacherns put their ranch-style home in Arlington, a suburb of Boston, up for sale last spring. They initially listed it at $280,000, the price they paid four years ago at the height of Boston's real estate boom. But even though they have since lowered the price to $250,000, they have not had a single offer.
The McEacherns would like to move to Marylard or Virginia, but with no offers on their house and their savings being rapidly depleted, they are stuck.
The only consolation, Mrs. McEachern said, is the support she has received from friends. "It used to be that being unemployed was a disease, and people wouldn't talk to you," she said. "But now, because it has happened to so many people, your friends call you up and take you to lunch or help you rewrite your resume."

HEADLINE: Bank of New England Sees Loss, Pushing It to the Brink of Failure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation, the most troubled of the nation's large banking companies, moved to the brink of collapse yesterday when it announced that it expected a large fourth-quarter loss, leaving it with no funds to absorb future loan losses.
With the latest losses exceeding its remaining capital, the nation's 33d-largest banking company would be insolvent by accounting rules. Although it still has the approval of regulators to remain in business, the erosion of the company's financial strength over the last year has now reached a point where Federal regulators are being forced to decide the company's fate. 
 A senior banking regulator in Washington said yesterday that a decision about whether to close down the banking company, offer it some financial assistance or wait for further developments could come early next week. The regulator, who insisted on not being identified, said the staffs of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency were busy yesterday analyzing the latest figures and would soon make recommendations to senior officials.
Regardless of what happens to the company and its subsidiary banks, he largest of which are the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company in Hartford and the Bank of New England in Boston, depositors are insured for up to $100,000 as allowed by regulators. Depositors with even more than $100,000 in the holding company's banks might also be protected, depending on how regulators handle the company's problems.
A decision to close down the bank holding company would have to be made by the Comptroller of the Currency, Robert L. Clarke, and a decision to provide financial assistance would be up to the F.D.I.C., whose board members include the Comptroller. The F.D.I.C. has scheduled a board meeting for Tuesday that is expected to include the Bank of New England situation on its agenda.
 The banking company's chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence K. Fish, met with senior regulators in Washington on Thursday to tell them of the $450 million fourth-quarter loss that the company expects. The loss, like the nearly $1.44 billion of losses in the previous 12 months, was because of losses on its $6.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, more than a third of which are in default or have been foreclosed.
In the last year, the banking company has reduced its size by more than 25 percent, as it tried to raise cash and reduce expenses. It remains the third-largest banking company in New England, after the Bank of Boston and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I.
Joseph Blair, executive director of the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Authority, a state agency that provides financing for medium-size companies, said that "Bank of New England is just too deeply involved in the economic life of the region to be put out of business." He added, "Regulators will have to find a way to provide continuity for its depositors and borrowers."
Banking regulators were not compelled to act immediately in response to yesterday's announcement because banking law gives them discretion to allow troubled companies to remain in business while solutions are sought. And despite the negative capital position at the banking company, its subsidiary banks still have some funds remaining, meaning that the estimated value of their assets is greater than the amounts they owe depositors and other creditors.
 
No Insolvency Seen
 "Our banks are solvent, and we do not expect any of them to become insolvent," said James Dorsey, a spokesman for the company.
While Federal regulators consider whether, or how, to assist the company, Bank of New England officials are working on their own plan to increase the amount of capital it holds to absorb future losses. Late last month, a group of Bank of New England bondholders presented a plan for converting their bonds to stock, which would add $605 million to the company's capital and eliminate the need to make any additonal interest payments on the bonds.
Wilbur Ross, a managing partner at Rothschild Inc., who is representing bondholders, said in late December that bondholders were seeking assurance from regulators that the company would not be closed if they agreed to exchange their bonds for new stock.
But even if the deal with bondholders is arranged, the company will remain woefully weak. "The company will still lack the capital needed to be viable," said one large bondholder who asked not to be identified because negotiations were under way with Federal regulators.
The banking company has also taken steps so that it could collect insured deposits from outside its local markets, if its problems become severe enough that more of its large depositors pull their funds out of the subsidiary banks. The company has obtained approval from Federal regulators to use Wall Street to sell certificates of deposit to consumers around the country, but has not yet started the program.
 
Most Costly Option
 Closing the banking company and paying depositors is considered by many analysts to be the least likely course of action for the Federal regulators because it would probably be the most costly option. One former Federal Reserve official, who asked not to be identified, estimated that closing the banking company could cost the F.D.I.C. more than $2.5 billion, which would make it the most costly bank failure in American history. Another option would be for the Government to take over some of the company's bad loans and then try to find another company that would be willing to purchase Bank of New England.
The cost of any Federal solution for the banking company's financial troubles will be a politically sensitive issue because the Federal deposit insurance program has suffered sizable losses in recent years and the Treasury is seeking ways to bolster the insurance fund.
"The price tag for the F.D.I.C. is going to be huge no matter what it does," said Carol Berger, a banking analyst at C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell Inc., a New York securities firm. "With the New England economy still in a free fall, any potential buyers are going to require inducements."
 
Buyers May Be Scarce
 Even with Federal financial sweeteners, buyers for the banking company may be scarce. Losses on real estate loans have hurt other large New England banking companies to such an extent that they do not have the resources to acquire Bank of New England. Large New York banks are also hurting, and the handful of strong banks that could afford the merger have not yet stepped forward.
Michael Iovenko, a banking expert and partner in the law firm of Breed Abbott & Morgan in New York, said "the question of closing Bank of New England raises the issue of the 'too big to fail' doctrine." That doctrine refers to the practice of Federal regulators of arranging mergers of large banking companies, even if Federal assistance is needed, on the ground that a closing would be even more costly and would wreak havoc on the local economy or, in some cases, the financial system.

HEADLINE: Job Figures Lift Yields on U.S. Issues

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
An unexpectedly small rise in the unemployment rate in December caused prices of all Treasury securities to plunge and yields to soar yesterday.
Although the Government's employment report raised questions among some bond market participants about how they were calculated, dealers said most thought it prudent to either cash in recent profits in Treasury issues or to sell these securities short. 
 The market had expected another sharp drop in December non-farm jobs, perhaps as large as 150,000. But the Government reported before the opening of trading that 76,000 nonfarm jobs were lost last month. This sent the fixed-income market reeling.
 
Fear on Fed Reaction
 Not only does the bond market tend to thrive on negative economic news because it reduces potential inflation and yields on competitive investments, but investors and traders today also feared that the employment data would discourage the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates further.
"From the opening on, nothing seemed to relieve the gloom, although the market did recover somewhat on news of the various Mideast peace efforts," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, referring to the announcement that Iraq's Foreign Minister would meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Switzerland next week. "But the market ended as weak as it opened. It seem that everyone either decided to cash in profits, and many had nice profits to cash, or decided to go short until signs of a turnaround."
Also weighing on the market, Mr. Sullivan said, was the large amount of Treasury and agency offerings scheduled for sale in the next few weeks. At last count, he added, some $50 billion of new debt was being prepared for sale.
Of more immediate concern to the market was the heavy selling of outstanding Treasury securities. Late in the session, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue due August 2020, was offered at 106 2/32, down 1 5/32 on the day. This caused its yield to climb to 8.20 percent from 8.10 percent the day before. But the long bond's yield was still below the 8.29 percent of a week ago.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8.5 percent issue of November 2000, lost 20/32, at 103 9/32, and now yield 8.01 percent. Among shorter maturities in the secondary market, the new 7 5/8 percent notes of 1994 dropped 10/32, to 100 9/32, to yield 7.54 percent, and the new 7.25 percent notes of 1992 lost 6/32, at 100 5/32, for a yield of 7.16 percent.
 
Data Called Spurious
 As for the employment data that touched off the selling, one prominent economist described them as "spurious" because they did not include a sharp increase in those who could find only part-time work.
"What the numbers didn't show was the 150,000 jump in part-time workers last month," said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, the world's largest bank. If the increase in part-time workers was deduced from the total of full-time workers, "then the December job loss was about the same as the 259,000 non-farm jobs that vanished in November."
Given the short time span that governs operations in the Treasury securities market, especially on a Friday, Mr. Braverman continued, "many prudent market participants decided not to question the jobs data, but cash in profits or sell short, rather than wait for the Fed's next move to ease credit. Many had thought the Fed would ease today or early next week. While the Fed will have to ease, the timing is now in question."
 
Large Drop in Funds Rate
 The Fed did move to ease credit with the temporary addition of $2.5 billion of reserves to the banking system. The move contributed to a large drop in the key funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. The Federal funds rate opened at 7.25 percent, or a quarter-point above the Fed's current perceived target. The rate was at 7 3/16 percent when the Fed added the reserves at midday and it moved steadily lower to close at 5 percent.
While the 5 percent funds rate was considered an aberration, the fears that the Fed's next move to ease credit would be delayed weighed on the short end of the Treasury debt market, which would be the most immediately affected by such a move.
As a result, the discount rate on 90-day bills climbed 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.53 percent; six-month bills advanced 11 basis points, to 6.51 percent, and the one-year bills jumped 11 basis points, to 6.42 percent. The Treasury said it would auction $11.75 billion of new one-year bills next Thursday.
On Tuesday, the Resolution Funding Corporation will auction a total of $6.9 billion of long-term bonds, proceeds of which are intended to help bail out the ailing savings and loan institutions. On Wednesday, the Treasury plans to auction $8.5 billion of new seven-year notes.

HEADLINE: Record Drop in Orders to Factories

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Factory orders for manufactured goods in November took their steepest one-month plunge on record, the Commerce Department said today in yet another report reflecting a weakening industrial sector.
The department said orders for durable and nondurable goods fell 5.9 percent, to $235.4 billion, the worst decline since it began tracking orders in 1958. The past record was a 5.5 percent drop last January. 
 "It's just one more piece of evidence that the economy is in a recession," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting company.
"To the extent that orders are a precursor of what's to come, it suggests that we haven't hit the bottom yet," said Joel Prakken, an economist with Laurence A. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis forecasting firm.
The report, which followed a 2.5 percent increase in October, was consistent with other economic news of the day. The Labor Department said factory payrolls fell by 33,000 in December following a 200,000 decline in November. And in Detroit, the Big Three auto makers announced they were shutting down all or part of 29 assembly plants next week and temporarily laying off more than 62,000.
 
 Steep Fall in Durables
 The drop was concentrated in durables -- expensive products expected to last more than three years.
They fell a record 10.7 percent, to $115.6 billion -- even worse than the 10.5 percent decline reported last week. Durable goods orders had risen 3.6 percent in October.
Nondurable goods slipped eight-tenths of a percent, to $119.7 billion, the first drop since last May. Ms. Latta said the decline "could reflect that energy prices were beginning to give way a little bit."
Rising petroleum prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 drove up the value of many factory orders, particularly in the nondurable category. Energy prices have been moderating in recent months.
Mr. Prakken also predicted that increases in Federal excise taxes on items like cigarettes and alcohol that went into effect Jan. 1 would lead to cuts in spending for durable goods because people would continue to buy beer and cigarettes, diverting spending from the big items that can be postponed like cars and appliances.
The department also said orders for nonmilitary capital goods -- a barometer of business investment plans -- plunged 16.8 percent, to $34.7 billion. These orders had gained 8.7 percent in October.
 
 Military Order Plunge
 The often-volatile military category tumbled 23.4 percent, to $5.5 billion, after a 8.3 percent drop a month earlier. Excluding defense, orders fell 5.4 percent.
While the durable goods declines were widespread among the major industries, the largest decrease was in the transportation sector -- down 27.6 percent, to $27.3 billion.
Aircraft and parts led the decline, dropping 38.7 percent and more than offsetting October's 20.4 percent advance. The rest of the decline was in motor vehicles and parts.

HEADLINE: Unions' Pay Raises Won't Worsen Budget Gaps, Dinkins Says

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Defending a 5 percent raise in wages and benefits for city workers in the face of a daily drumbeat of bad news about budget cuts, Mayor David N. Dinkins insisted yesterday that the raise would not worsen growing budget gaps and complained that news reports had distorted its impact.
"The reports often come that we're going to close X number of firehouses, and we just increased wages, as though there were a connection," Mr. Dinkins said. "That is just not so, and it is important that people not be misled in that regard." 
 Mr. Dinkins's comments amounted to aneffort to put his perspective on a confluence of sometimes confusing pronouncements that have not only drawn criticism from fiscal monitors but stretched credibility with a public worried about impending layoffs and drastic cuts in city services.
In a narrow sense, the Mayor merely stated a truism. The settlement Wednesday with 150,000 members of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters amounted to no more than 1.5 percent from money already earmarked for wages in the city budget. The rest would come from increasing the assumption for the rate of interest the union pension funds could earn, thus allowing the city to reduce its annual contribution to the funds and use the difference for raises.
Budget gaps that have ballooned in the last month to $500 million for the current fiscal year and perhaps more than $2 billion for the next, and that are likely to force thousands of layoffs, are the result of unexpected shortfalls in tax revenue, Mr. Dinkins said in an interview on "Good Day, New York" on WNYW-TV. He added that the city was prepared to cope with the disparity between resources and needs that he agreed constitutes a crisis.
"He's more than technically correct," in insisting that he had held to the budgeted raise of 1.5 percent, said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances. "That was his policy decision and he has held to it. There is nothing that happened this week that the Mayor didn't make clear two months ago -- not that there can't be disagreement with that policy decision."
City officials yesterday took the first step toward the layoff of thousands of employees it had previously said would be needed over the coming months. Leland T. Jones, a mayoral spokesman, said the Office of Labor Relations had notified commissioners that there would be about 280 layoffs in five or six agencies. The notices indicated only the number of positions to be eliminated and the job categories of those affected. The commissioners will be responsible for identifying exactly who will be laid off, probably sometime next week, Mr. Jones said.
Since, as a political matter, using the pension money requires the assent of the unions, Mr. Dinkins contended the money would not be available for general budget-balancing purposes, as a number of fiscal monitors have argued it should be.
But some critics of the latest wage settlement countered that money is the most movable commodity in government, and that the city could have refused to settle, or sent the contracts to arbitration, unless the unions agreed to forgo using the pension money for raises. The critics conceded that doing so would be difficult for the city, which allowed the teachers' union to use pension funds as part of its 5.5 percent raise in October, and said that underscored the bad pattern the city set by settling with the teachers first.
 
'A Zero-Sum Game'
 "I think that argument is really trying to push water uphill," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses that has harshly criticized the city's labor policy, speaking of Mr. Dinkins's contention.
"I just think the most useful way, analytically, is to think of it as a zero-sum game," Mr. Horton said. "You just don't give a 5 percent contract to a group of recipients of public expenditures without imposing exactly offsetting costs somewhere else in the system. That may be layoffs, or raising taxes, but you've got to finance it in some fashion."
For his part, Mr. Dinkins appeared to argue that the settlement was part of a considered effort to secure the cooperation of labor in the darker days ahead.
"It is sensationalist, you know, to show a picture of a fire, and then show a shot of a fireman saying 'We're going to close this company,' and then the next shot is of someone commenting about wage increases, as though they were in fact connected," Mr. Dinkins said. "The fact of the matter is the 1.5 percent we had in the budget, we could not use for gap-closing purposes unless we said we'd give the labor unions zero."
"Well," Mr. Dinkins added, "we're going to have to lay off thousands of people in any event, even if we had no wage increase at all. Now where would you get the cooperation and the assistance from labor that is going to be absolutely essential to get through this period if we were to behave in that fashion?"
 
Advisory Panel Named
 Mr. Dinkins may have a harder time settling with uniformed unions, which traditionally receive the largest raises, and whose pension funds cannot generate the same sort of extra money to supplement the city's 1.5 percent raise. But Mr. Horton said that if the city is a tough bargainer, it could actually be in a good position to extract work-rule concessions from the uniformed unions in exchange for any raise above 1.5 percent.
As part of his efforts to streamline government, Mr. Dinkins this week named an advisory panel and business and labor leaders to advise him on management. Donald D. Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America, resigned his seat as one of three citizen members of the Financial Control Board, in order to join the Dinkins panel. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo must fill the vacancy, subject to approval by the State Senate.
Mr. Proctor of the Financial Control Board, called the debate over the raise, "a classic war of words that's going to be evolving."
"Anyone who wants to say firehouses are being closed because of labor settlements, that's disingenuous," he said of the $233 million contract. "The labor settlement is small potatoes compared to the money they need to save. They would be looking at things like firehouse closings in any event."
On the other hand, Mr. Proctor said, by using the budgeted money and the pension funds now, the settlement creates uncertainty about what will happen when the 15-month contract has expired, particularly if the local economy has not improved.
"While it doesn't widen the city's budget gap, it is continuing a process that makes budget management even more difficult," Mr. Proctor said. "It's meeting today's problem without taking into full account how it constrains you in the future."
Yesterday, teachers were said to be "ringing the phone off the hook" at their union's headquarters about news that Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez wants to propose a furlough that would close schools for three days, leaving employees unpaid for those days. The proposal, a way of avoiding 4,000 layoffs, will be spelled out to the United Federation of Teachers and other school unions on Monday.
Susan Amlung, a spokesman for the teachers' union, said its president, Sandra Feldman, had not yet taken a position on whether, in a crunch, she would prefer layoffs or a furlough or a third savings method -- deferral of a week's salary that would be paid upon retirement.
A furlough would cost an average teacher -- one earning $40,000 a year -- roughly $153 a day, she said. Many teachers, she said, complain that the furlough would essentially nullify the 5.5 percent wage increase the union won in October.
Any furlough proposal would have to be approved by the full membership.

HEADLINE: On 2d Try, Bush Is Likely to Pick Agriculture Chief to Head G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
After a search fraught with political embarrassment, Administration officials and party strategists said today that President Bush was expected to choose Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Yeutter, who served as United States Trade Representative in the Reagan Administration, is a 60-year-old Nebraskan with a Ph.D. in agricultural economics and a resume more noteworthy for policy making than politics. 
 Some Republicans described Mr. Yeutter (the name rhymes with "brighter") as a safe choice who would be palatable to all factions of the party, an important consideration given the turmoil that has wracked Republicans in recent weeks.
This afternoon, at an impromptu news conference before boarding a helicopter for his Camp David retreat, the President was asked whether he had selected Mr. Yeutter as the Republican chairman. Mr. Bush refused to confirm his decision but said, "He would be very good, wouldn't he?"
Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said: "I don't think people think of him in traditional R.N.C. terms, but I think he'll do an exceptional job. Anyone who can deal with American farmers certainly understands American politics."
Administration officials were not sure when the selection would be announced. But the Republican National Committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on Jan. 24-26, and Mr. Bush's choice will be presented then for the committee's approval, which is considered pro forma.
Mr. Yeutter was "saying nothing," a spokesman said, and an Administration official emphasized that the details of this selection were still being worked out. There was little immediate speculation on who might replace him as Secretary of Agriculture.
The search for a chairman to replace Lee Atwater, who is suffering from a brain tumor, has been difficult and has fueled the criticism of the White House's political operation, under the control of John H. Sununu, the chief of staff.
The President's first choice, William J. Bennett, was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture toward conservatives, who were outraged over Mr. Bush's reneging on his "no new taxes" pledge.
 
Bennett Changes His Mind
 But Mr. Bennett announced last month that he had changed his mind, saying he was afraid that concerns over potential conflicts of interest would prevent him from earning the outside income he needed.
Since then, Republican circles have buzzed with the names of people who were supposedly under consideration for the job, several of whom reportedly took themselves out of the running, including Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner and Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp.
One Republican consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: "The whole process has been terribly bungled. The chairmanship of the national committee is a terribly prestigious job. It should not have been floated. You should have decided who you wanted and then have the President pick up the phone and say, 'You're my guy.' "
Instead, the long search for a chairman seemed to underscore the problems in the party and in the White House, and seemed to suggest, to some, that the job was less than desirable. Moreover, some top Republicans noted that the chairmanship of the national committee would be quickly overshadowed once Mr. Bush's re-election committee was geared up.
 
Defining the Chairmanship
 The job of party chairman is, to a large extent, defined by the man or woman who holds it. But over the years it has come to revolve increasingly around fund raising, rallying the party faithful and carrying the party's message in the news media.
The Democrats took another opportunity today to snipe at the Republicans. "Keeping together the Republican Party is a tall order," said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman.
Republicans have long worried about filling the void left by the illness of Mr. Atwater, a master strategist who was one of the chief architects of Mr. Bush's 1988 Presidential campaign. There were two schools of thought within the party about how to replace him: one held that the job should go to another strategist; the other held that it should go to a high-profile spokesman, like Mr. Bennett.
Mr. Yeutter, said one Republican, "is to some degree neither fish nor fowl." That Republican, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, praised Mr. Yeutter as smart and respected, but said, "I think there's some question mark about the kind of role he carves out."
 
Some Political Experience
 Still, other Republicans in the Administration and outside it argued that Mr. Yeutter was an articulate and effective spokesman and was not devoid of political experience.
"He's never managed a campaign, but he's been in the kitchen cabinet on numerous occasions and he managed a portion of Nixon's campaign in 1972," one Administration official said.
Paul Weyrich, national chairman of the Free Congress Political Action Commmittee, a conservative group, indicated that Mr. Yeutter's selection would be generally acceptable.
"It doesn't cause the President any problems, which, if you're looking at it from their perspective at this point -- after all the problems they've had -- is probably as good as they're going to get," Mr. Weyrich said.
Mr. Yeutter was the United States Trade Representative from July 1985 until the end of the Reagan Administration in January 1989, and seemed preordained for his current post as Secretary of Agriculture.
He was born in Eustis, Neb., on Dec. 10, 1930, and received a bachelor's degree in animal husbandry from the University of Nebraska. He did graduate work in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin, and in the 1960's earned a law degree and a doctorate in agricultural economics from the University of Nebraska.
He came to Washington in the Nixon Administration and took a job in the Agriculture Department under Secretary Earl L. Butz. In the Ford Administration Mr. Yeutter shifted to the Trade Representative's office, where he served as deputy to Frederick B. Dent.
After leaving the Government at the end of the Ford Administration, Mr. Yeutter became president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
He and his wife, Jeanne, have four children. He retains ownership of a Nebraska farm and considers his permanent home to be in Lincoln, Neb., although he now resides in McLean, Va.

HEADLINE: Stocks Drop for 3d Consecutive Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices fell broadly yesterday for the third day in a row as growing concern over the economy outweighed sentiment that war was beginning to look less likely.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which sank close to 25 points by noon, rallied on news of the announcement by Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, that he would go to Switzerland to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Wednesday. 
 Within minutes the Dow recouped its loss and by 1 P.M. climbed 32 points from its low. It fell for the rest of the session, though, ending at 2,566.09, down 7.42 for the day and 63.12 for the week.
Trading activity, still sluggish, slumped to 140.8 million shares, from 141.5 million on Thursday. In a mixed picture, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell at about the same rate as the Dow, but on the New York Stock Exchange, 790 stocks rose and only 698 fell.
Traders said a cable break in New Jersey interrupting A.T.& T.'s long-distance service for New York had little effect on their ability to do business or get quotations.
 
 Effect of Phone Problem
 The New York and American stock exchanges said service was largely unaffected because other phone lines were available to all of the top investment firms. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the over-the-counter service, said that 450 of its 3,000 terminals were down most of the day but that 150 were restored for part of the day by backup equipment. It described activity as "about the same as the two previous days."
One trader remarked that because commodity dealings were seriously hurt for most of the day, one of the biggest headaches was the inability to get up-to-date prices for crude oil until the final 30 minutes of trading.
They maintained that with the situation in the Persian Gulf changing so rapidly, the price of crude oil is important to the entire situation and that traders are hampered in other markets by not knowing what the price of crude oil is at any given moment.
In a reflection of how seriously investors feel about the deteriorating economy, Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading for Shearson, Lehman Brothers, said: "There's a growing feeling peace will break out and the market should have responded better than it has. It's telling you that the economy could be losing momentum much faster than expected."
A weak economy, he argued, means weak profits, and "the market's very nervous about fourth-quarter earnings," which start coming out around the middle of January.
"When earnings come out and are less than expected," he said, "there's no mercy; the stocks get sold."
 
 Big Name Stocks
 In anticipation of some disappointments when earnings are announced, institutions have been unloading many of the big-name stocks all week.
Yesterday alone, Schlumberger, the oil-service company, fell 1 7/8, to 53 5/8; Disney, the entertainment giant, fell 3/8, to 100 1/8; Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, fell 7/8, to 83 3/4, and 3M, another big consumer producer, fell 1/4, to 83 1/4.
Royal Dutch/Shell, the oil company, slid 1, to 76 1/8; Johnson & Johnson, the drug company, fell 1/2, to 68 3/4; Abbott Laboratories, another big drug company, fell 7/8, to 40 3/4; Pfizer fell 3/4, to 77, and American Home Products fell 1 3/8, to 49 3/8.
Although traders attributed some of the drug selloff to caution in advance of earnings reports, contradictory recommendations from analysts also contributed to the decline. Merrill Lynch prompted a selloff Thursday after saying the group had had big gains and investors should now lighten up. Yesterday Cowan & Company joined Merrill Lynch but Dean Witter, concerned about the recession, urged investors to lean heavily on drug stocks, regarded as recession-proof.
Merck fell 1 3/8, to 85 1/4; Bristol-Myers Squibb 3/4, to 63 5/8; Bausch & Lomb 2 5/8, to 65 5/8; American Cyanamid 1 1/8, to 49 7/8; Warner Lambert 1 1/4, to 63, and Forest Labs 1 5/8, to 46 3/4.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, reported heavy buying and selling just before and after the noon announcement of the Baker meeting in Switzerland but said that the activity raised the Dow only six points.

HEADLINE: Forbes Will End Publication of Egg Magazine in March

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Egg, the magazine started by Malcolm Forbes just before his death last year, announced yesterday that it would cease publication with its March issue.
"It was a victim of the overall environment, and it was just not possible to see how the growth that we had to have was going to happen," said Timothy C. Forbes, president of Egg, a division of Forbes Inc.
The oversized magazine, which covered the downtown scene, was aimed at a young, urban, hip audience in New York and Los Angeles. Its first issue was published in March, just about the time that magazine advertising and newsstand sales began their precipitous decline. Among those cutting back were national advertisers like liquor and tobacco and local advertisers like restaurants and clubs, all of which were the backbone of Egg's advertising.
 
 Decline in Pages
 The March 1990 issue, for instance, had 150 pages; the March 1991 issue will have 82 pages, Mr. Forbes said. Last month Fame magazine closed for the same reasons. 
 Speculation in magazine circles that Egg would not survive centered not only on the harsh economic climate but also on the belief that the downtown nightlife scene, a phenomenon of the 1980's, was past. "I think Egg was a poorly positioned concept," said Martin Walker, president of Periodicals Studies Service, a magazine consultant. "It was a downtown magazine for uptown people."
But Suzan Nanfeldt, senior vice president at Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss, an advertising agency, said that the magazine had a good editorial mission and a strong sense of what it wanted to be. "It was trying to be an insider's guide to the downtown cultural life of New York," she said. "I would never say that downtown has died. I would say that it is probably changing directions, which it does every month anyway."
 
'Never Found Its Way'
 Claude Fromm, executive vice president of the TBWA advertising agency, said that advertisers now tended to place ads month by month instead of making longer-term commitments, making it especially difficult for new magazines to get off the ground. "Egg unfortunately never found its way," he added. "It never became hot."
Mr. Forbes declined to say how much had been invested in Egg. Forbes, a privately held company, does not release financial information.
Egg's circulation was 80,000, Mr. Forbes said, with the bulk in New York and Los Angeles. About 35,000 copies were sold on newsstands, 20,000 went to subscribers, and the remainder was unpaid circulation.
The magazine was the idea of Malcolm Forbes, but his son said yesterday that Mr. Forbes's death had not lessened the commitment to go ahead with the magazine. "I wouldn't say we suffered for lack of enthusiasm," he said. "The death of the magazine wasn't a function of cost, losses or desire. It was the function of a harsh economic environment."

HEADLINE: BELIEFS

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Three weeks ago, Bishop Edmond L. Browning met at the White House with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. The Bishop, who heads the Episcopal Church in the United States, was conveying to the President, an Episcopalian, the views of 18 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox leaders newly returned from talks with religious and government officials in the Middle East.
"War is not the answer," said a statement issued by the leaders on their return. "No cause will be served, no crisis resolved, no justice secured." 
 Mr. Bush replied by referring Bishop Browning to reports of Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait and asking him whether failing to respond firmly to such actions would be morally responsible.
And on the day after Christmas, Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York, invited three guests to his home for a luncheon discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis. They were not experts in desert combat or Arab politics, however. One was a Catholic moral theologian, another a writer for a political journal, the third a Jewish political philosopher. All had written extensively about the ethics of warfare.
Discussions like these are occurring around Washington. As Jan. 15 nears -- the date after which the United Nations has authorized the use of force against Iraq if it does not withdraw from Kuwait -- the moral debate about American policy in the Persian Gulf grows as intense as the military and political debate.
Not all religious leaders are critical of the American policy in the gulf. On Thursday, for example, officials of the American Jewish Committee accused the 18 church leaders of issuing a "one-sided statement" that "plays directly into the hands of Saddam Hussein." Earlier, a distinguished group of Czechoslovak Protestants, veterans of human rights struggles against Communist governments, complained that American Protestant representatives were underestimating "the criminal nature of the regime of Saddam Hussein" after earlier underestimating the criminal nature of Marxist regimes.
But one can find substantial areas of agreement among statements on the gulf that have been issued by religious bodies since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Almost all them condemn the invasion, endorse economic sanctions against Iraq, welcome Washington's organization of a multinational resistance, perceive hazards in maintaining a prolonged military presence in Saudi Arabia, urge the resolution of other conflicts in the Middle East and call for long-range efforts like reducing the West's dependence on gulf oil and promoting economic aid and political equality for Arab populations.
Religious groups have also been united in urging negotiations between Washington and Baghdad. They are not pushing for a swift resort to arms. They are skeptical of talk of "surgical strikes." They expect that an outbreak of fighting would claim victims in the tens of thousands, perhaps the hundreds of thousands. Almost all recognize the vast uncertainties that cloud any calculations of the outcome, not only on the battlefield but throughout the Middle East, once combat begins.
Yet such agreements do not preclude sharp differences. Groups like the National Council of Churches say the impasse could be resolved if Washington held out the prospect of negotiations on a wide range of issues embroiling the Middle East, from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the control of oil revenue.
Jewish groups, besides generally backing America's intervention, have bristled at anything suggesting a parallel between between Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
And although both the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Protestant and Orthodox groups represented by the National Council of Churches have issued warnings about American policy in the gulf, a mid-December editorial in the Protestant weekly Christian Century saw a contrast in their approaches.
The editorial commended the bishops for laying out a coherent framework for evaluating whether military action would be just. But the editorial complained that the National Council of Churches had offered a set of policy prescriptions that could have been learned "from any number of editorialists," without reference to underlying moral principles.
The criticism, noteworthy because The Christian Century shares the liberal, ecumenical outlook of the National Council, pointed to a basic problem: If the National Council of Churches has offered no general principles about the moral use of military force, the reason is that many of the church bodies it represents do not want to face squarely the question of whether war is ever permissible.
This avoidance takes a variety of forms. In November, leaders of the National Council of Churches declared that their membership had "a wide diversity of approaches" to "the question of the admissibility of war as a means of resolving disputes." But two weeks later, a group of essentially the same church leaders sent Mr. Bush a letter flatly declaring that "war as a means of settling international disputes is in conflict with the teachings of our faith."
When several leaders of non-pacifist churches were asked how they could have endorsed such a premise, they either seemed unaware of what they had signed or treated it as rhetorical license.
To some extent, this sweeping antiwar language of the National Council's leaders results from pressure to find a rhetorical common ground embracing its 32 denominations.
By contrast, the Catholic bishops acknowledge that in their teaching, war can be moral, if only under "certain restrictive conditions." In this teaching, war is waged as a last resort, for a just cause, by a legitimate authority, using means not aimed directly at civilians and with the prospect of achieving greater good than harm. In the current circumstance, the bishops say, the launching of a major offensive now would be hard to reconcile with this doctrine.
Groups like the Synagogue Council and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations point out that Jewish tradition endorses the right of armed self-defense, including pre-emptive military action. These groups have urged restraint, but have generally been more willing than the National Council and the bishops to follow the President's lead.
But it may not be fair to compare the stances of the various faiths without considering that they may arise from different notions of the function served by public statements by religious groups.
The Catholic and Jewish traditions instinctively treat such statements as part of an accumulating body of insights meant to guide the intellect over time. The Protestant tradition, which is enlisting a growing number of Catholic antiwar groups, appears to treat such statements more like sermons aimed at moving the will to action in the immediate future.
Does the nation primarily need basic intellectual tools for analyzing a complex moral problem, not only in the next 10 days but as it evolves over months to come? Or is the country so trapped in a momentum toward war that it needs above all a rhetoric of moral urgency to just say no? The attractiveness of one approach rather than another may depend not only on the strength of the arguments but equally on how Americans size up their circumstances.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Europe Offers Plan to Encourage Iraq's Withdrawal From Kuwait

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Jan. 4

 BODY:
In a move to encourage Iraq to pull its troops out of Kuwait, the 12-nation European Community promised Baghdad today that it would work to resolve all problems of the Middle East if the gulf crisis could be settled peacefully.
At an emergency meeting here, foreign ministers of the community nations said "Iraq should receive the assurance not to be subject to a military intervention" once it had carried out United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding its withdrawal from Kuwait. 
 Welcoming the announcement today that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, would meet in Geneva on Wednesday, the community further invited Mr. Aziz to visit Luxembourg on Thursday for talks with three European foreign ministers.

 The European Community meeting was interrupted by the news that Iraq had accepted the American offer of talks, a move that President Bush, speaking in Washington, described as a "useful step." But Mr. Bush insisted that the meeting would be used solely to inform the Iraqis that they have to get out of Kuwait or face war. Questioned on the European plan, the President said he had not had a chance to study it and would not comment until he did, but he declined to rule out the terms of the plan. [Page 4.]
Jacques Poos, the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, which holds the rotating presidency of the community, said he hoped to meet with Mr. Baker before meeting with Mr. Aziz so the two could coordinate their meetings with the Iraqi.
"We feel it is important that Iraq get the same message twice," he said.
He and other foreign ministers said the central issue was still the need for Iraq to withdraw, or commit itself to withdrawing, from Kuwait by the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15. They also stressed repeatedly that they remained in full agreement with the United States on the crisis.
But while insisting in their statement that there could be no linkage between settlement of the crisis and other problems, it was apparent today that several governments, France and Germany among them, were eager to find some face-saving formula to encourage Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
France and Germany called the meeting today in the hope of keeping alive diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis after Washington and Baghdad appeared unable to agree on a date for direct talks. They also favored separate community talks with Baghdad if the United States-Iraqi talks fell through.
But Britain and the Netherlands feared that an independent community initiative could be misread by Baghdad as evidence of a weakening in the broad anti-Iraqi coalition and seemed determined to block any meeting with Mr. Aziz unless he held talks with Mr. Baker first.
European officials said that a potentially embarrassing rift in the community was avoided halfway through the closed-door session today when word came that Mr. Aziz had agreed to travel to Geneva next week for talks with Mr. Baker.
"There was an audible sigh of relief," an official said.
Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting because it reaffirmed the community's unity.
"We are anxious for peace, anxious to go on searching for a peaceful solution," he said. "But this can only come through a reversal of the aggression."
He said that if Mr. Aziz accepted the invitation to talks with the community he would be given a double message.
"If Iraq does not comply with U.N. resolutions, it will be forced out of Kuwait," he said. "If it fully and unconditionally withdraws, it will not be attacked."
Asked whether Iraq was still required to leave by Jan. 15, Mr. Hurd said that "obviously an element of practical common sense is involved, with the decision of member states depending on the situation prevailing at the time."
Significantly, in a meeting with reporters, Mr. Hurd seemed to echo Washington's more cautious line by not emphasizing the community's offer to help establish "security, stability and development" in the Middle East if Iraq leaves Kuwait.
But other foreign ministers emphasized that intention, including Mr. Poos, who said he was ready to discuss the "after-crisis scenario" with Mr. Aziz. "The community demonstrated that it is not scared of a dialogue with the person responsible for the crisis," he said.
If the Iraqi Foreign Minister comes to Luxembourg on Thursday, he will meet with Mr. Poos, as the current President of the Council of Ministers, as well as Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, who last held the post, and the Netherlands' Foreign Minister, Hans van den Broek, who takes over the position on July 1.
At the start of today's session, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France proposed a seven-point plan that served as the basis for today's final statement, including the pledge that Iraq would not be attacked if it withdrew, the community's commitment to tackle other Middle East issues and an invitation to Mr. Aziz.
The plan, immediately endorsed by Germany and Italy, also welcomed President Bush's new effort Thursday to organize a meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz and stressed that there was "neither contradiction nor interference" between the American and European initiatives.
In a news conference in Paris today, President Francois Mitterrand nonetheless seemed to distance himself from the Bush Administration's recent warnings of an imminent war by suggesting a new meeting of the United Nations Security Council before any military offensive was started against Iraq. He said he would hold talks with Mr. Baker in Paris on Tuesday before the Secretary of State traveled to Geneva for his meeting with Mr. Aziz.
Mr. Mitterrand also reiterated his call for international conferences to deal with critical Middle East problems and said France would not go beyond the objectives defined by the United Nations.
"I do not favor preventive war," he said when asked about the need to destroy Iraq's war capacity. "France does not consider itself the world's policeman."
Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who in recent days has strongly urged new diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis, told his community colleagues that "war is not inevitable" and warned of the dire consequences a war would have for the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Fell 5.1% in 1990

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 4

 BODY:
United States vehicle sales closed the year on a downbeat amid widespread expectations that the automotive industry's slump will probably continue well into 1991. Total sales in 1990 were the lowest since 1983.
Retail sales of American-made cars and trucks fell 1.4 percent in the Dec. 21-30 period, capping a year in which sales were off 5.1 percent from 1989. The overall drop in the final 10 days was caused by a 15.5 percent decline in light-truck sales; car sales for the period were up 8.1 percent, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.3 million, compared with 7.5 million last year.
 
 Monthly Sales Also Down
 Car and truck sales were off 2.1 percent for all of December, to 962,767, from 983,330 last year. Car sales were up 1.8 percent, to 657,164, but light-truck sales dropped 9.5 percent, to 305,603. The monthly figures include all retail sales, of both American-made and imported vehicles. 
 Sales of light trucks have been particularly weak in recent months. Light trucks are less fuel-efficient than cars, and many commercial buyers have scaled back truck purchases because of the weak economy.
For the year, sales of imported and domestic vehicles reached 13,790,280 -- 9,338,911 cars and 4,451,369 trucks -- compared with a 1989 total of 14,489,530 -- 9,831,122 cars and 4,658,408 trucks.
Beyond the decline of the last year, the question on the minds of many auto executives and analysts was how much longer the slump would continue. With consumer confidence low, personal debt high and fear of war pervasive, many think only a resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis will bring a rebound for the industry.
 
 January 'Debacle' Expected
 "January will be a debacle," predicted Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "I think within a couple of months of the situation in the Middle East's being resolved, we will begin to report year-over-year increases."
Robert L. Rewey, vice president for sales for the Ford Motor Company's North American operations, said: "Industry sales in 1990 were disappointing, with a weak economy and concerns about international uncertainties pulling auto sales down, especially in the final months of the year. Based on present economic forecasts, we expect industry sales weakness to continue in early 1991, with improvement as the year progresses."
Ford's car and truck sales in 1990 were 3.63 million, a drop of 7.8 percent from 1989.
But analysts said there was substantial pent-up demand for vehicles based on the age of the existing fleet. David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc., noted that sales had begun to pick up in the summer after a nine-month slump.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, posted a gain of eight-tenths of a percent in vehicle sales in late December. G.M.'s United States sales dropped 3.3 percent in 1990, to 4.97 million cars and trucks. But G.M. was able to increase its market share slightly from 1989, the only Big Three auto maker to do so.
George C. Eads, the company's vice president of product planning and economics, said G.M. "is well equipped to meet increasingly aggressive challengers in the U.S. automotive marketplace."
The Chrysler Corporation's car and truck sales fell 4.1 percent in late December, compared with a year earlier. Car sales were up 17.1 percent, but truck sales were down 18.2 percent, reflecting the recent trends.
 
 Honda Nudges Chrysler
 For the year, Chrysler's vehicle sales dropped 15.5 percent, to 1.69 million from 2 million in 1989. Chrysler barely nosed out the Honda Motor Company as the nation's No. 3 car maker, with 860,834 sales to Honda's 854,879. Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was its mini-van, sold under the Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth nameplates.
The proportion of cars sold that were built in the United States increased in 1990, but more of those vehicles were built by foreign companies at "transplant" factories in the United States. Domestic cars accounted for 73.6 percent of cars sold, compared with 71.9 percent in 1989. But cars built at transplant factories accounted for 11.4 percent of sales, compared with 7.9 percent in 1989.
The Big Three's share of the total American vehicle market declined to 69.9 percent in 1990, from 71.1 percent in 1989. The share of Japanese auto makers, including those with American operations, increased to 23.5 percent from 21.6 percent. Other imports declined to 6.6 percent of the market from 7.3 percent last year.
While most car companies posted sales declines for the year, the top two Japanese auto makers -- the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company -- were able to increase American sales as they relied more on vehicles built in the United States, which cost them less to build than those imported from Japan, primarily because of the yen's strength relative to the dollar. But the Nissan Motor Company posted a substantial decline for the year.
"Despite the apparent downward turn of the economy last year, sales of Toyota vehicles have never been better," said Pat Moran, president of Toyota's distribution company for the Southeastern United States. Mr. Moran said he expected "sustained growth" in 1991.
Particularly hard hit in 1990 were several European auto makers, including Volvo, Saab and BMW. Sales of Audis dropped to 21,106 for the year from 21,283 in 1989, and "quite frankly we don't see 1991 being any better," said Richard L. Mugg, the American executive in charge of Audi. Mr. Mugg said Audi's December results reflected some sales that were "unquestionably pulled ahead from January to beat the impending luxury tax" on vehicles costing more than $30,000.
 
PLANT CLOSINGS CONTINUE

DETROIT, Jan. 4 (AP) -- The Big Three auto makers will continue reduced car and truck production next week by shutting down all or part of 29 assembly plants and putting more than 62,000 auto workers on temporary layoff.
The shutdowns stretch out closings that began at some plants the week before Christmas.
The Ford Motor Company plans the most extensive shutdowns and layoffs next week, with all but five assembly plants closed because of low orders, the company said today. Ford will lay off about 20,360 North American workers next week.
The General Motors Corporation will close 13 plants, resulting in 33,280 layoffs, and the Chrysler Corporation will shut three assembly plants, laying off about 8,400 workers.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Senate Prepares for a Gulf Debate Soon After Baker Meets With Aziz

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The Senate today put itself in position to debate legislation concerning war in the Persian Gulf as early as Thursday, the day after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is scheduled to meet with Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister.
But Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, indicated that it was more likely that the issue would come up on Monday Jan. 14, the day before the United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait expires and the authorization for military force takes effect. 
 Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, urged a serious debate. He said that while he disagreed with Democrats who challenged the President, he sympathized with their frustration over Congressional inaction.
"For months we have been standing on the sidelines, making all kinds of speeches but not casting a single vote," he said. "Congress has been AWOL."
 
A Lack of Consensus
 But Mr. Dole said he hoped that when the Senate debated, it would unite behind President Bush and the threat of force.
"What a message that would be to Saddam Hussein," he said, arguing that unity in Congress might finally persuade Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait if Mr. Baker's efforts and all else had failed.
He conceded that he did not know how Congress would vote, and whether a majority would back Mr. Bush. But however it acted, he said, Congress had a duty to vote.
There does not appear to be a consensus in either House. Congress, and especially its Democratic leaders, seem committed to voting on how the nation should proceed in the gulf, though it is clear that many individual members are reluctant to take a stand.
 
Time Left, But Not Much
 Absent any direct, insistent appeal from Mr. Bush, there seems to be little Congressional inclination to urge or even acknowledge a course toward war and much sentiment in favor of keeping economic sanctions in place longer. But many on Capitol Hill say they do not expect him to make such a request in earnest for fear that defeat, or a even narrow victory, would undermine his efforts.
Congressional leaders seem to feel that they have time left, that Mr. Bush will not seek to pre-empt their debate by attacking on Jan. 16. But they appear to feel they do not have much time.
Leaders in the House, which was not in session today, did not offer comparable scheduling plans. But the House is expected to be in full session beginning Jan. 14, and for the rest of that week, so that it, too, could debate the situation in the gulf.
The House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to meet informally next week to discuss the gulf crisis and possible resolutions concerning it. The committee also scheduled a closed-door meeting for Wednesday with ambassadors from the countries allied against Iraq.
 
Daily Cost of a War
 In the only gulf-related event on the House side of the Capitol today, its Budget Committee heard the head of he General Accounting Office say it would cost the United States nearly $1 billion a day once fighting started. The official, Charles A. Bowsher, said that even without war, the gulf operation would cost about $30 billion in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.
Today's Senate session began with a series of Democratic speeches contending that the Constitution required President Bush to obtain Congressional approval before any attack on Iraq and urging more time for economic sanctions to work.
"Congress alone has the power to declare war," said Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
"Sanctions are running Iraq's economy into the ground," said Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
 
Request for a Resolution
 Republicans counterattcked. Senator Steven D. Symms of Idaho complained about "handwringers," and said Mr. Bush had displayed "great restraint."
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York said "the issue is not the Constitution." Instead, he said, "the issue is bottom-line American interest." He said the Senate should vote today to support Mr. Bush.
In contrast to Thursday's sharp half-hour exchange before nearly all members of the Senate, today's speeches were given in a generally deserted Senate chamber and punctuated by repeated quorum calls awaiting the arrival of the next speechmaker.
One Republican, Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, sided with the Democrats on the constitutional issue and with his fellow Republican senators on policy. He said "the President should formally request the Congress to pass a resolution" giving him the authority to use force.

HEADLINE: Tangled Phones and Flights As Cable and Tempers Snap

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
An Illinois woman had breakfast for lunch en route to New York yesterday because a telephone cable broke in New Jersey.
Lorraine Linstead's flight was on time and on the runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago yesterday morning when it abruptly returned to the terminal. The broken cable had scrambled air traffic control in the Northeast, and by the time Mrs. Linstead's flight took off, it was 11:30 A.M. in Chicago. 
 But the meal aboard the American Airlines jetliner was still what was promised on the ticket. "Here was lunch time now and they served us breakfast, these omlettes that were not very good and a fruit salad that wasn't fit for a bird," said Mrs. Linstead, a resident of Rockford, Ill.
Mrs. Linstead wasn't the only American struggling to cope with delays and petty inconveniences caused by the severing of an American Telephone and Telegraph Company cable in Newark yesterday.
There were the business travelers and vacationers, exasperated because the local banks' automatic teller machines would not accept their out-of-town cards. Travel agents, already suffering as the economy slipped into a recession, were unable to reach reservation numbers.
Stuart Cooper, who owns Fair View Travel in Baldwin, L.I., said his long-distance service was provided by Allnet, a small long-distance carrier based in Michigan, and was working. But one of his two toll-free 800 numbers was on an A.T.&T. line, and by early afternoon it had not rung once.
Air traffic controllers were, if anything, more inconvenienced than the airline passengers. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said its immediate problem was getting through to members working at two Federal Aviation Administration centers on Long Island that handle most of the flights in the Northeast. "Our representative managed to get through for a few minutes before he lost contact and he said it was just absolutely bedlam there," said Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the union. "I think one of the greatest fears of the air traffic control system is the man with a backhoe who severs a line" he said.
The actual repair of the severed cable caused little disruption on Raymond Boulevard in Newark.
The manhole where the break occurred is 20 feet deep; water from the Passaic River sluices in whenever the tide rises. By the time crews realized they had broken the cable, the manhole was half full.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BAGHDAD ACCEPTS U.S. OFFER TO MEET BAKER IN GENEVA

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Iraq accepted the Bush Administration's offer tonight for a high-level meeting on Wednesday in Geneva, at which Iraq's Foreign Minister said he would press for "justice and fairness" for the Palestinian cause.
In a statement read over state-run television and released by the official Iraqi press agency, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was quoted as saying he had accepted the offer to meet Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d despite the "arrogant statements" and "bad intentions" that accompanied the invitation. [Text of the Iraqi press agency report, page 5.] 
 After the Iraqi statement was issued, President Bush revealed in a news conference in Washington that he had ruled out the idea of sending Mr. Baker to Baghdad for direct talks with President Saddam Hussein. Mr. Bush had originally proposed that the two meet before Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face eviction by force.
 
No Mention of Irrevocability
 The statement tonight by Mr. Aziz, one of the highest-ranking leaders of Iraq, made no reference to Kuwait or to Iraq's often- repeated assertion that it has irrevocably incorporated the emirate as its 19th province.
Iraq's decision to accept the meeting between Mr. Aziz and Mr. Baker on Wednesday clears the way for the highest-level diplomatic exchange between Iraq and the United States since the Persian Gulf crisis began on Aug. 2 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
"I was prepared to go to Washington and to receive Minister Baker in Baghdad if the American Administration acted in a courteous manner and respected the internationally recognized rules with regard to fixing dates for heads of states' meetings with other nations' envoys," Mr. Aziz was quoted as saying.
 
U.S. Envoy Receives Word
 Shortly before the broadcast, a senior Iraqi Foreign Ministry official told the top United States diplomat in Baghdad, Deputy Chief of Mission Joseph C. Wilson 4th, that Mr. Aziz had accepted the proposal that Mr. Wilson had relayed on Thursday to Mr. Aziz's Under Secretary, Nizar Hamdoon.
Speaking to reporters outside the American Embassy tonight, Mr. Wilson said, "We really want to go the extra mile to make sure everybody in this conflict understands what we are talking about, which is basically compliance with the United Nations resolutions."
Mr. Wilson indicated that the prospect of talks was a welcome development, notwithstanding Mr. Aziz's polemics.
"I think as long as we are talking, as Winston Churchill said, 'Jaw, jaw, jaw, talk, talk, talk is better than war, war, war,' " he said. "So we'll see."
Mr. Aziz's statement was read after a meeting today of senior members of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, which Mr. Hussein heads. Mr. Aziz said that at the talks, "Iraq will also stress adherence to its rights and its readiness to strongly defend them."
 
The Palestinian Question
 "I will also seek to know whether the other side is ready to work for realization of peace and security in the whole region on the basis of fairness and justice," he said. "In the forefront of the causes which need fairness and justice is the Palestinian question and the right of the Palestinian people in establishing its free state on the land of Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital."
In a final comment directed at European Community foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg, Mr. Aziz said, "Iraq welcomes anyone who wishes to visit Iraq to hold a serious dialogue to realize peace in the whole region."
Bush Administration officials have been adamant that they intend to conclude their diplomacy with Iraq without concessions, negotiations on other regional issues or face-saving gestures.
Yet several European leaders have been seeking a formula under which Iraq's unconditional withdrawal would be followed by a stronger commitment to move the Arab-Israeli peace process forward on the Palestinian question.
 
Original Offer Unreported
 The Administration's offer Thursday for the talks in Geneva went unreported in Iraq's official press today, but the acceptance was featured prominently in broadcasts tonight.
"This is very good news," said Samir al-Jamil, 33 years old, an unemployed accountant who last month was called back to military service after he served nine years in the war against Iran. "It could mean peace."
Iraq's Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of Britain, Japan and Malaysia today and told them that the Government would not be able to guarantee the security of foreign missions in the event of war, according to diplomats.
 
Dispersing Ministries
 The Foreign Ministry's chief of protocol, Fuad al-Rawi, told the envoys that the Iraqi leadership had decided to disperse important ministries to the countryside and that the Foreign Ministry would relocate to Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad.
Mr. Rawi told the diplomats that the Foreign Ministry was awaiting an order to move its functions to Ramadi and that ministry officials already had tested communications there to insure that it would be able to keep in contact with all Iraq's embassies abroad.
 
Envoys Fear Detention
 According to diplomats, Mr. Rawi said they should ask their governments whether they would be willing to move to Ramadi or take some other steps to insure the protection of diplomats if war breaks out.
The diplomats expressed strong concern that such an arrangement might lead to their detention, but Mr. Rawi strongly denied any such intent, according to diplomats. The Iraqi repeated that the move was not compulsory and that foreign missions could remain in Baghdad, but he said the Government could not guarantee their safety there.
Mr. Rawi said the Iraqi Government was preparing for peace and war simultaneously, the diplomats said. He said that there was no guarantee at this juncture of peaceful solution to the crisis and that therefore "we have to prepare for the worst."
The Iraqi official also advised the envoys to evacuate all women and children from their embassies and said the ministry found it understandable and natural that a number of embassies were reducing their diplomatic staffs.

HEADLINE: Israel's 2 Main Museums Cut Back

BYLINE: By RICK BLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 4

 BODY:
With most tourists staying away from Israel because of the Persian Gulf crisis, the country's two major museums have had to lay off employees and cut back operations.
"There are almost no tourists coming to Israel," said Nissim Tal, the deputy director of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. On Thursday, Pan American World Airways announced it was suspending flights to Israel, and travel agents said bookings to Israel and other Middle Eastern points had dropped sharply as a result of the crisis. 
 Mr. Tal said the number of tourists visiting the museum was only a fifth of the usual number. As a result, the museum has dismissed 15 percent of its employees, including a few tenured staff members, to help reduce its $4.2 million budget. "We hope the situation will stabilize shortly," Mr. Tal said.
Similarly, the Israel Museum, the country's largest and most prestigious cultural landmark, has laid off 27 of its 190 employees in the last month and will have to let more people go if the crisis continues to keep tourists away.
 
4-Day Weeks, No Overtime
 As part of its austerity plan, the Israel Museum asked its staff to work a four-day week in November and December. In addition, the museum stopped paying for overtime.
The Israel Museum received half of its current $10 million operating budget from foreign donations and $2 million in Government subsidies. Entrance fees and related revenues were to provide the rest.
The museum plans a budget cut of 20 percent to help cover the current $3 million deficit, two-thirds of which is attributed to the decline in visitors.
Not only tourists are staying away from cultural institutions in Jerusalem. Israelis also are not visiting the Israel Museum and other sites as often as they used to.
 
The Issue of Closing
 "We've decided not to close the museum even one day," said Dr. Martin Weyl, the museum's director. "In such a period, art becomes very important. It's a symbol of a civilized, healthy life."
In fact, the Israel Museum has closed because of war only once in its 25-year history: on the first day of the 1967 war, when bombing by Jordanian Air Force damaged some of the archeological galleries.
The recent austerity measures, though, have left the staff wondering about the ability of the museum to borrow works for future exhibitions and even to stay open.
Most cultural institutions in Israel are finding it more difficult to raise money abroad these days, both because of the recession in the United States and because they have to compete with Jewish organizations raising money to help absorb the 200,000 Jews who arrived from the Soviet Union last year. The immigrants continue to arrive at a rate of about 1,000 a day.
"Most of the donated money is now going to immigration," Mr. Tal said. "So we are being hit twice."
 
Contributions Fall
 At the Israel Museum, for example, the number of American patrons who donate $2,500 to $10,000 a year has begun to fall, Dr. Weyl said.
Both the Israel Museum and the Diaspora Museum depend largely on foreign donations and admission fees, while most other Israeli museums are largely government subsidized. The Government, which is also looking for additional money for the immigrants, seems unlikely to increase its spending on museums.
Government officials did promise to give the Israel Museum an additional $1 million to help cover its operating deficit, but no money has been received.
"It's hard to live day to day, wondering if you'll run out of money or not," Dr. Weyl said. "It's a daily struggle to keep the museum going."
At the same time, the new immigrants are raising spirits at the museum, Dr. Weyl said. The Soviet Jews, many of whom do not have much awareness of their Jewish heritage, come to the museum by the busload. They are admitted free.

HEADLINE: The Safety Net for Securities Holders

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
How safe is your money?
This week's failure of the private Rhode Island deposit insurance fund for credit unions and the recent highly publicized difficulties of savings and loan associations and banks have left many people concerned about the safety of their deposits in financial institutions. And for many, this worry has carried over to the money and securities in their asset-management and other accounts at brokerage firms. 
 For depositors in a bank, savings and loan association or credit union, experts say that the best way to have peace of mind is to make sure that your cash is protected by one of the Government agencies that insures accounts: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. That protection, of course, is limited to a maximum of $100,000 per person at each institution, although the amount can be raised by adding such accounts as individual retirement accounts or trust accounts.
But it's not as simple with brokerage accounts. Although there is a Government-backed fund providing limited protection -- the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, widely known as S.I.P.C. and pronounced "SIP-ick" -- it has a different status than the two agencies for depositors. Furthermore, the value of customer portfolios can change drastically before customers obtain control of their assets after a brokerage is liquidated.
"We become involved only when there is a danger to customers," said Theodore H. Focht, the president of the securities protection corporation. "There has to be a determination that a firm has failed or is in danger of failing to meet its obligations to customers."
How does S.I.P.C. work?
Most "broker-dealers" are members of the Washington-based protection corporation, which is financed by assessments from them. When a member brokerage firm is at the failure stage, the fund applies to a Federal court for the appointment of a trustee to liquidate the firm.
Once that has been done, each customer account is covered by S.I.P.C. for up to $500,000, including up to $100,000 for the cash in the account, while the trustee goes through the legal process of transferring the accounts to another broker. In its 20 years of existence, S.I.P.C. has provided $221 million to 260,000 customers of 220 liquidated firms.
But unlike the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, the securities fund is not an agency of the United States Government. In a subtle distinction, it is considered a Government-backed fund that has a statutory right to borrow from the Treasury. Yet S.I.P.C. is not supported by the "full faith and credit" of the Government, an important consideration during this period of heavy losses by the F.D.I.C.
In addition, the worth of a brokerage account may go up or down while it is tied up in court proceedings. So another difference between the securities fund and what Mr. Focht calls its "sister programs" is that even if your account comes under the coverage limitations, there is still the danger that the value of the portfolio could decline by the time it is again available for trading.
"When you have dollars on deposit at a bank, they don't change in value, except for inflation," he said. "Obviously, we are not protecting the underlying investment of what you bought. You'll get back your dollars and you'll get back your stock."
But what can be a cause of concern to some investors is that accounts of customers at liquidated firms might be tied up for a long time, sometimes many months. If such a situation occurs in a period of declining securities prices, some consumers may be forced to watch their assets erode without being able to take action.
Sophisticated customers who have another account elsewhere can sell-short the same stocks being held in their blocked accounts, thus preventing future losses. Selling short involves borrowing stock, usually from the broker, in the hope that the value will decline so it will be returned at a lower price.
Along with S.I.P.C.'s protection for as much as $500,000, many brokerage firms also provide private insurance for customer accounts. This insurance, typically underwritten by a major insurance company, adds from $500,000 to $9.5 million to the basic coverage. Thus, total insurance, both Government-related and private, can amount to as much as $10 million.
There are, likewise, both private and Government insurance programs for credit unions. Even after the collapse of the Rhode Island fund, nine private, or cooperative, guaranty funds remain, protecting about 1,500 credit unions that are not covered by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. These funds operate in 21 states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts.
The funds are nonprofit organizations owned by their member credit unions and have their own trade association, the National Association of Share Insurance Corporations. Its managers note that depositors in privately insured credit unions occassionally receive higher interest rates than those in Government-insured credit unions and, at least in some cases, higher insurance coverage.
Nevertheless, as many depositors in Rhode Island credit unions have just discovered -- and as many savings and loan depositors in Ohio and Maryland discovered when similar private funds also were exhausted in the mid-1980's -- insurance is only as good as the entity, Government or private, behind it.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Going Easy on Energy

BYLINE: BY Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The likelihood of war and the fact of recession, both heavily tainted with Mideast oil, demonstrate the need for President Bush to lead the country toward energy independence.
Right? Not as the White House sees it. 
 John Sununu & Co. have struck again, defanging a strong energy conservation program proposed at cabinet level, after 18 months of study. When this offensive document reached the Bush White House -- abandon hope, all ye who enter here in search of the vision thing -- it was stripped of any idea that might have offended anybody this side of the Sierra Club.
Gone are higher mileage requirements for gas-guzzling autos. Gone, too, are Federal regulations to impose energy conservation, any suggestion of government intervention in the sacrosanct private sector, all impolitic urgings toward consumer sacrifice. Gone, for sure, are any energy-related tax increases.
Gone but not forgotten, at least not by the "knowledgeable" and possibly outraged officials who told James Risen of The Los Angeles Times the grim story. They said that Mr. Sununu, the White House chief of everything; Richard Darman, the Ayatollah of the Budget Office, and Michael Boskin, Supreme Commander of the Council of Economic Advisers, had gutted what Mr. Risen termed "the most ambitious" of the proposed energy conservation provisions.
Why -- especially when Secretary of State James Baker's most recent threat of "devastation" to Iraq leaves little doubt that the Bush Administration is prepared to go to war, not least to maintain American access to Middle East oil?
Why, more especially, when in the United States the economy has drifted downward into recession, a process accelerated and made worse by the third oil price "shock" in 20 years?
Why, when even before these immediate reasons for seeking greater energy independence, powerful calls existed for strong measures to insure energy conservation?
Though the number of automobiles operating in the world is inevitably increasing, for instance, greater fuel efficiency could save 2.9 million barrels of oil per day by the year 2000. That's about what the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates will be needed by then to double agricultural production in the developing countries.
That can't be achieved, nor will the trade deficit be much improved, unless the U.S., with its staggering auto population and oil consumption, learns to conserve energy. Instead of mandating or encouraging conservation, however, the Bush energy program apparently will propose incentives for new oil production in the United States and elsewhere, outside the Mideast.
One reason for this myopic approach to energy policy is that Messrs. Sununu, Darman and Boskin have demonstrated before their bureaucratic mastery of the feckless lower levels of this Administration. Another is that the Energy Department's draft is described as more of a laundry list of options than a specified program for which its authors would be prepared to fight to the death. This made the draft easier to dismember.
More important, the top-level decisions diluting the proposals exemplify the Administration's free-market philosophy and nicely fit Mr. Bush's pro-business views, shaped by his experience in the oil industry. Such considerations prevail in this White House, even when a tough energy program is a national necessity and would tend to validate an ill-understood war.
It's hard to remember now, after 10 years of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, that back in the dim mists of the 70's President Carter produced an energy program the size of the Sears, Roebuck catalogue. It featured all sorts of inducements to conservation and incentives to alternative and renewable energy sources, many of which became law -- just in time, for the most part, to be killed off by Mr. Reagan.
Now George Bush, given another opportunity to use Middle East events to lead Americans toward energy independence, as Mr. Carter tried to use the two previous oil shocks, chooses instead to lead the world into a war the overall outcome of which -- including its effect on oil supplies but not the certainty of many American casualties -- no one can predict.
Another unnamed official, illogically terming the White House energy approach "pragmatic," told James Risen that "for the long term, free-market measures work best." The long term? With a war scheduled in two weeks for which little enthusiasm is visible anywhere, with a recession here and now and getting worse, what would be wrong with thinking about the short term? If not now, when?

HEADLINE: Albany's Budget Timing Is Way Off

BYLINE: By Mel Miller; Mel Miller, a Democrat, is Speaker of the New York State Assembly.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
In 1987, the New York State budget was adopted 10 days late. One month later, we enjoyed a $900 million surplus. The 1988 budget was late again, but a month later the state faced a $900 million shortfall that grew to a $1.9 billion deficit. In 1989, the budget was 18 days late. By fall, another deficit was developing that ultimately reached $2 billion.
Last year, the budget was a record 48 days tardy. Had emergency action not been taken last month, we would have been short $1 billion by the end of the 1990-91 fiscal year that ends this March 31. I join those who detect a pattern here. 
 It isn't because state officials can't add. What happens is this: We pass a budget based on an estimate of tax receipts for the current and coming fiscal years. The fiscal year ends and later we get the actual revenue from April 15 income tax collections.
There are times when the obvious is the answer. We should change the state fiscal year to begin later than it does now. By moving it back, budget makers would have more accurate knowledge about the actual and projected fiscal condition of the state.
New York has one the shortest budget review periods of any state. Under our April 1 fiscal year, forecasting economic activity to project expected revenues is like trying to hit a moving target.
Economic conditions haven't improved our marksmanship. Since the 1987 stock market crash, the Northeast has been mired in recession. Last month, the Legislature had to make painful decisions: We cut $1 billion on top of the $1 billion we slashed from the Governor Cuomo's original proposal. The weakening economy and the short time budget makers have to forecast its performance makes another fiscal surprise this year more likely than not.
The reasons for changing the fiscal year are compelling; the benefits are many. Right now, the Governor must forecast revenues before critical tax receipt information is available. This leads to revenue arguments or waiting until the middle of March for more exact data. Recent budgets have been blindsided by mid-March forecasts. That guarantees tardiness in passing a budget.
A July 1 fiscal year would give budget builders time and better knowledge. Simply knowing what personal income taxes total after the April 15 filing deadline will be a major plus.
Changing the fiscal year has been studied thoroughly; in fact, it has been adjusted twice in this century. Whether we now shift the end of this fiscal year from March 31 to June 30, or stretch out the next fiscal year to June 30, 1992, the result can be the same: a budget adopted on time with sufficient revenues to pay expenses.

HEADLINE: The Labor Pacts: Go Back to the Table

 BODY:
If these were normal times, New York City's first three labor settlements would be acceptable. But the times are not normal. The city is struggling through an economic and fiscal emergency unlike anything it has experienced in over a decade. In the last year 50,000 jobs disappeared. Property values have declined by a third in some neighborhoods. The city's own budget deficit continues to grow and because the economy is so weak, the needs of New Yorkers, especially the poor, are growing too.
Yet the Dinkins administration has negotiated labor settlements that will guarantee poorer services and thousands of layoffs. There is little choice. Other than imposing dramatic tax increases, cutting services and jobs is the only way to pay for the increases. In effect, Mayor David Dinkins chose to benefit labor at the expense of all other New Yorkers, a misguided decision that demands only one response: a reversal. 
 To his credit, Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez is now trying to prevent widespread teacher layoffs by chipping away at the expensive 5.5 percent increase the city negotiated with the teachers' union. The contract, combined with cuts in state and city funding, could require 4,000 layoffs, disrupting classrooms. Instead Mr. Fernandez proposes that all school employees take a three-day unpaid furlough, for a saving of about $50 million and at a cost to each teacher of about $460. In effect that would reduce the 5.5 percent increase to roughly 4.3. Shortening the school year is not the ideal solution, but a furlough would be less disruptive than layoffs, and would save the jobs of younger teachers, many of them minority members. The unions would be doing the city and their own rank and file a favor to accept the Chancellor's proposal.
Now it is City Hall's responsibility to admit error and pull back from its latest settlements, which give District Council 37 and the teamsters 5 percent wage and benefit increases over 15 months. The reason is not purely fiscal. The city will pay for the settlements with money already in the budget, and funds from a risky reduction in the city's contribution to the workers' pension fund. Technically, the agreements do not have an impact on the budget. But they will have an impact on life in New York.
The city's current budget deficit doubled in the last three weeks to $500 million and could go as high as $2.1 billion in the next fiscal year. Budget officials only just announced those gloomy facts, but they come as no surprise. It's clear that Mr. Dinkins and his negotiators knew about the growing deficit and approved the settlements anyway.
That is indeed troubling. The new raises mean about $15 or $20 a week to the average worker, but will mean cuts in services and dismissals to the rest of the city. That defies common sense.
Mr. Dinkins could follow Mr. Fernandez's lead and seek a similar way out of the agreements with District Council 37 and the teamsters. Another option would be to defer the agreements until the city is in better shape, or go back to the bargaining table. At least a move in that direction would send a prudent signal to those municipal unions still negotiating with the city, and show that the Mayor and his advisers realize that now is not the time to conduct business as usual with city employees.

CHILDHOOD'S FUTURE
By Richard Louv.
420 pp. Boston:
A Marc Jaffe Book/Houghton Mifflin. $21.95. 
 Childhood isn't what it used to be. In the introduction to "Childhood's Future" Richard Louv quotes the child psychiatrist James Comer's memories of growing up in a working-class neighborhood of East Chicago, Ind., where "between home and school, at least five close friends of my parents reported everything I did that was unacceptable." Yesterday's extended families and involved neighbors have been replaced by today's television, impersonal malls and hostile streets. These are the settings of Mr. Louv's passionate call for rebuilding community and family life.
The author, a columnist for The San Diego Union, spent three years traversing the country to interview more than 3,000 parents, children, volunteers, teachers and other professionals. He found heartening community efforts, including Dr. Comer's successful collaboration with New Haven schools and parents to help schools there provide the "warmth and adult contact that many kids don't get at home," the continuing relationships that Dr. Comer considers the basic element most missing in education today.
But in the main, Mr. Louv's conversations reflect parents' isolation from their children and from one another, and a pervasive anxiety about an unraveling of childhood and family life that no one ever intended. His interview subjects grieve over the disappearance of family rituals, even of dinners together, and recount how children come from school to empty houses, how they care for themselves and spend ever more of their time on their own, having achieved what Mr. Louv sees as "a freedom closer to abandonment."
We meet a youngster who believes her parents preferred life at work to life at home with their nine children, who were left to "do whatever we want." The child cooked her own food and learned to "handle everything myself." She says: "I never really knew my parents too well, or my grandparents or any of my relatives. . . . It's kind of like a separate world of mine." Mr. Louv concludes that "the isolation from adults that many children feel is acute, painful, and ultimately numbing."
He finds that the institutions that might compensate for what overwhelmed parents are unable to do are themselves undermined by stingy public policies. A librarian tells of rules and cutbacks that prevent her from waiting outside the closed library with the children whom no one has picked up by closing time. Teachers complain that funding reductions make it harder to educate children who are hungry and neglected and come to school in midwinter without coats or socks. Good day care workers are almost impossible to find and retain at wage rates below those of janitors and trash collectors.
Mr. Louv maintains that the fragmentation of American families is not "simply a question of personal morality or individual fidelity" but is powerfully linked to changes in the economy. He argues that the United States is the only advanced Western nation where family life is a regarded as a private matter, where workplaces operate oblivious to family pressures and where a lingering frontier mentality creates ambivalence about support from corporations or government -- even help that would enable a parent to stay home with a newborn.
Convinced that this is not the way things have to be, Mr. Louv offers a vision of families more connected to one another and to their environment, in cities and towns with schools and libraries and community centers that all provide child care, family supports and a sense of belonging to old and young alike. He believes we can create conditions making it easier to combine work and family life, and providing more time and support for parenting. He sees corporations encouraging part-time employment and offering parental leave and time off so that both men and women could monitor and participate in their children's day care and schools.
Mr. Louv's interviews show a widespread eagerness to make our institutions more responsive to children and families, and an emerging consensus among people of widely divergent ideologies that the family is central, and that if children are to grow into self-sufficient adults, the family needs to be buttressed by social institutions, public and private.
But wishing won't make it so. While acknowledging that the personal must ultimately become political, Mr. Louv fails to deal with the tough questions of how the urgently needed changes might be made to happen. I would have hoped for more help from this talented journalist as to how to bring about the policies, programs and investments needed to turn his appealing vision into reality. Nevertheless, his book is useful because it reminds us that childhood's present does not have to be childhood's future, and because it describes accurately the widespread yearning for a world in which being a parent and being a child regain a cherished place in the lives of both families and communities.

UNDER RUNNING LAUGHTER
Notes From a Renegade Classroom.
By Quincy Howe Jr.
156 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $19.95. 
 When the Khmer Rouge tried to create a generation of young people in Cambodia devoid of conscience, morality and other such vestiges of bourgeois imperialism, they dubbed those new beings the "Year Zero Children." The phrase stayed in my mind while I read "Under Running Laughter," for Quincy Howe Jr. delivers a portrait of youthful souls here at home shattered as completely as any in the Cambodian holocaust.
These "Year Zero Children" form the population of the Leake & Watts Children's Home, a publicly funded residence and special-education school in Yonkers. There are only 90 of them, ranging in age from 10 to 20, but their small number seem to embody almost every form of assault on human dignity, going back through several generations. The demise of the industrial economy in the area plunged their grandparents into poverty. That poverty helped to push their parents into crime and drugs. And those parents visited emotional and physical abuse on the future residents of Leake & Watts. Most have been sent to the facility, either by social service agencies or by criminal courts, because they had been deemed too troubled to be placed in foster homes.
Such a scenario, bleak as it is, does not begin to capture the tragedies that Mr. Howe, as a teacher in Leake & Watts's high school, must face and somehow address. Mr. Howe, who taught Latin and Greek at the college level, now has pupils who pose for casual photographs holding numbered cards beneath their chins in the manner of criminals submitting for police mug shots. Many of those same children suck their thumbs during the movies Mr. Howe periodically shows. Life has taught them to accept murderous violence as a given and to distrust and even destroy the connections with caring adults they so desperately require.
Within the classroom, three-quarters of the high school pupils work at sixth grade level or below. Few can concentrate on a given project for more than 10 or 15 minutes. Their behavior swings wildly between impenetrable withdrawal and manic rage. Mr. Howe's writing assignments routinely elicit accounts such as this one:
"I was small and really didn't know how to fight. So one day people that I knew made up a crew name the Forty Thieves. I was given the name Crime. I used to snatch chains, steal pocketbooks, grocery money, and stick people. These things were the move.
"So one day last year I moved to Bed Stuy (do or die) and I met this kid name Pistol Pop. We would go around sticking up crack spots until one day on the 24th of December my home boy was killed. He was tortured. . . . They knocked out all his teeth. . . . He was raped [with a baseball bat] and then . . . they shot him. . . .
"Now I swear to the dead Father Allah, if I find who did it, I am going to put two bullets in his head. But anyway I cooled down. Now I'm just chillin."
Against such immense social failure, Mr. Howe strives to build and sustain in his classroom "a reasonably good simulation of life itself" -- "reading the newspaper, making photographs, learning about Martin Luther King, Jr., operating the sewing machine, and watching movies." His goal is "to teach them how to esteem themselves and others, how to accept adults as a benign influence in their lives, and how to prepare for a future whose shape is now ominous and confusing for them." The rare success, in Mr. Howe's telling, is the student not only capable of graduating from high school but also, more important, capable of finding a niche in either the armed forces or the semiskilled labor force. The rest, the majority, cannot conceive of any existence other than working for a drug lord or inhabiting a crowded prison cell.
To Mr. Howe's credit, he resists the popular tendency to blame the victims. Nor does he romanticize himself and his colleagues for their efforts. He deconstructs a system of public-agency regulations that forces social workers to spend half their time filling out forms and ultimately drives many talented and caring ones out of the profession. He also argues forcefully and eloquently for a special-education system that would acknowledge the obvious -- that remaking mutilated lives will require the investment of both time and money -- rather than expecting miracles from the usual two-year placement at Leake & Watts.
Yet Mr. Howe is perhaps too reserved. He never explains with sufficient depth or feeling how a university classicist could or would find his way to Leake & Watts, and only in the last two pages does he acknowledge his "almost addictive fascination with the children" and the redemptive moments that have led him to remain there for four years -- even as several of his colleagues have been hospitalized for exhaustion. When it comes to depicting his students, Mr. Howe's reserve becomes an unfortunate kind of detachment; he relies too often on such clinical jargon as "oppositional behavior" and "conduct-disorder" rather than describing real children in detail. Forgoing conventional narrative in favor of a more policy-minded approach, Mr. Howe never allows a reader to know the boys and girls as he has known them, as individuals who grow and falter and struggle. They function more as anecdotal case histories than as the flesh and blood humans whose plight clearly has moved Mr. Howe in ways even he cannot quite express.

HEADLINE: Growing Old Fast in Guatemala

 BODY:
THE MOST POIGNANT evidence of Central America's lost decade of poverty and brutal oppression can be found not only in the economic statistics but in the streets of Guatemala.
Growing numbers of abandoned or orphaned children beg, scavenge and steal to stay alive. In the slums of Guatemala City, a spot on a dirty concrete floor in a primitive shelter costs 12 to 18 cents a night. It is a luxury.
For the great majority of Guatemalans, there are no jobs, no dependable income. Some families abandon their offspring because they cannot feed them. According to an estimate by New York-based Covenant House, which runs a shelter in Guatemala City, the population of homeless children in the capital is 10,000 -- double what it was a few years ago. Some children are forced into prostitution, which is concentrated in a park next to police headquarters. Others depend on the city dump for their food and clothing.
 Many Guatemalan street children dull their pain and their appetites by sniffing glue (center top and bottom right). Inhaled in a bag a spoonful at a time, a 50-cent container can last a group a whole day. Over time, the fumes destroy brain cells and in some cases cause death. But glue temporarily stills the shivers at night and soothes hunger pains during the day. It also gives some children the courage to steal from stores and cars (bottom center).
Crime is rising, and the authorities have responded harshly. Human rights groups have accused the police of killing about 40 children. Photographs of some of the bodies show evidence of torture: ears and tongues cut off and eyes burned out. Many other children have simply disappeared. Sometimes the police pour glue on the heads of the children, who have to shave their hair to get it out. Sometimes the glue runs into their eyes (above), often causing permanent injury.
In late November, two Covenant House volunteers happened upon policemen kicking a 15-year-old boy in the stomach. The officers took off their badges to avoid identification and stopped beating the teen-ager when they saw the photographer (far left, bottom).
The authorities say they are looking into the charges of abuse and have encouraged the police to take the homeless children to the Covenant House shelter (top left).
But Bruce Harris, executive regional director of the shelter, doubts that the police will change. "There is no justice in Guatemala," he says. "These kids are abandoned by their families, by the state and by society."

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS VIEW;
Merengue's Dance-Till-You-Drop Beat

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE; Daisann McLane writes about Caribbean music for The Village Voice, Details and other publications

 BODY:
The power -- and air-conditioning -- goes out for at least four hours every day in sunbaked Santo Domingo, filling one's head with visions of the beach. But the beach is a 20-minute drive away, and in the Dominican Republic, the wait for a full tank of gas can take hours. Even a shower is impossible; without electricity, there's no water pressure. On these sweaty, miserable afternoons, it seems there's only one thing that hasn't quit in this capital city: merengue. It jumps from battery-powered blasters downtown on Calle El Conde, palpitates from the speakers of customized vans along the Malecon boulevard. The national rhythm of the Dominican Republic never stops.
Santo Domingo at first seems an unlikely home for the most vibrant and commercially successful musical scene in the Caribbean. Economic and political chaos and a deteriorating infrastructure turn the most basic business activities -- recording an album, mounting a concert, distributing records -- into tests of ingenuity and faith. It is not uncommon for the power to fail in the middle of a recording session, ruining a day's work. Yet even top Dominican performers -- like the singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra, who could easily afford to work elsewhere -- stay home. Like Kingston, Jamaica, Nashville or Memphis in their heydays, Santo Domingo has it all: the best songwriters, musicians, producers and arrangers. A sound. 
 Santo Domingo's merengue -- that hyperdrive, horn-propelled rhythm with a percussive heart murmur -- competes with reggae and rap for dominance on the streets of Manhattan. Dominicans are one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in New York City, with estimates as high as 500,000 people. "The money from Dominicans in New York is the pulmon, the lungs, of the economy back home," says Jose Tejeda, a New York-based merengue concert promoter. It is the record-buying fever of these homesick emigres that provides the cash that pumps the hit factories of Santo Domingo.
There's no official merengue Top 10 list, but a stroll along Broadway in the largely Dominican Washington Heights section of Manhattan will tell you instantly which bands rule: La Coco Band and Jossie Esteban y La Patrulla 15. These groups -- both hard-working, big (11 or more members) dance bands -- are the mainstay of New York's thriving Dominican nightlife (Santo Domingo may be a recording center but there's little live music). Jumpy and relentless, the bands fuse Saturday-night dance-till-you-drop energy with intricate, multilayered horn arrangements and naughty, double-entendre lyrics.
Musicians would probably prefer La Patrulla 15, whose latest albums are "En Accion" and "Hot" (Top Ten Hits 1947 and 1965 respectively; LP and cassette). Modern merengue is an arranger's playground, and Patrulla's Ringo Martinez is a whiz at whipping trumpets, trombones and alto and tenor saxophones into swirling horn confections that raise sugar levels and pulse rates. But for rock-the-house intensity, dancers at Washington Heights clubs like Fuego Fuego and Studio 84 favor La Coco Band. In a genre where you can be neither too fast nor too sexually suggestive, the Cocos set new standards on their latest album, "Pochi y su Coco Band" (Kubaney KD 20028; all three formats); on stage they sing about girlfriends while waving three-foot bones.
 Power merengue bands like these have popularized Dominican music far beyond its original audience, spreading into other Latin communities (merengue has hit the charts everywhere from Puerto Rico to Colombia) and even, occasionally, into American discos. The big-band party sound still dominates in merengue, but the recent crop of releases from Santo Domingo indicates there are musical trends emerging.
Merengue tipico, a rough-hewn acoustic music from the rural Cibao region that is the precursor of modern high-tech merengue, sells briskly in Manhattan and Santo Domingo. A tipico ensemble bears some resemblance to a Cajun zydeco outfit; it is fronted by a singer-accordion player, with the main percussion instrument a cheese-grater-like cylinder called a guira. But the wild, atonal solo duels of squeeze box and saxophone on Fefita La Grande's "Cintura Mia" (Juan and Nelson Records; LP and cassette) have as much to do with Don Cherry as with Clifton Chenier; tipico is an avant-garde improvisational fest in Caribbean disguise.
The latest news in Dominican music, though, is bachata, a Dominican country-folk music similar in rhythm to the Cuban son and in emotion to the Mexican ranchera (or for that matter, to Hank Williams). This old-fashioned song form has been revived by young, hip Dominican songwriters like Juan Luis Guerra. On his long-awaited new album, "Bachata Rosa" (Karen K136; all three formats), Mr. Guerra uses the bachata as underpinning for his smart, imagistic love songs in much the same way that Paul Simon recycled the English ballad for his early folk-rock hits.
The modern bachatas of the gifted and prolific songwriter Luis (Terror) Diaz are not as pop conscious or airy as Mr. Guerra's, but they have a rich, earthy romanticism and dazzling melodies -- one "ay yi yi" from Mr. Diaz is worth a thousand layers of horns. Mr. Diaz's own work is hard to find -- he's studio shy, and his only record is years out of print. But his friend Sonia Silvestre, a warm, powerful alto singer, recently released an entire album of Diaz songs, "Yo Quiero Andar" (OI Records; LP only), and several Diaz compositions are featured on a fine new debut album, "Iris y Franklyn" (Karen KCD 130; all three formats), by the Dominican duo of the title.
Mr. Diaz also writes most of the material for Sergio Vargas, the boyish singer who, along with Mr. Guerra, is the Dominican Republic's most popular performer. Mr. Vargas's last two albums, both entitled "Sergio Vargas" (CBS Discos; all three formats), are available in Latin-record stores and world-beat bins at large chains, as are most major merengue releases.
Mr. Vargas lacks Mr. Guerra's poetic dimension and writing talent, but he compensates with a deliciously teasing tenor and natural stage presence; handsome and magnetic, Mr. Vargas is merengue's first pop star. Last November, in a concert at Lehman College in the Bronx, he held a mostly Dominican audience rapt (and made young girls scream) with a two-hour multimedia collage of songs, skits and dances that chronicled his rise from sugar-cane cutter to musical hero.
Mr. Vargas's attempts to take Dominican music beyond the dance club are exciting Dominicans everywhere. Back in Santo Domingo, this ambitious show sold out for two weeks, at a time when the power crisis was at its worst, labor strikes rampant and gasoline nearly impossible to find.
"You can turn out the lights, stop the water, take away the cars and buses," Mr. Vargas explains. "But nothing can keep a Dominican away from his music."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Giving New Meaning to the Phrase Team Player

BYLINE: By CORY DEAN

 BODY:
The lights dim, the ABC Sports theme fills the air and the referee bounds into the arena in a black-and-white-striped jersey, a whistle hanging from her neck. The judges prepare their score cards, the two four-member teams take their places, the referee flips a coin, and the match is on.
But the athletes are actors, the arena is a tiny stage in the basement club of a Manhattan restaurant, and the game is Speaking in One Voice. 
 A team member steps forward to explain the rules: "All four of us, who don't know the story we are about to tell you, will tell it at the same time." Someone in the audience supplies "a dangerous location" -- 42d Street -- and the actors are off, speaking in unison, sometimes in bursts of words, sometimes haltingly: "As I was . . . walking . . . on 42d Street . . . I met a man. . . . He . . . asked me for . . . all . . . my . . . clothes. . . . He . . . put . . . them on . . . and . . . gave me . . . his clothes. . . . I said . . . what are you doing and . . . he said . . . cross . . . dressing!"
The crowd around the darkened club's tiny tables cheers, and the three judges hold up their score cards: on a scale of 0 to 5, the team has scored 5-5-4.
This is theater sports -- improvisation performed as a competitive sport in which actors vie for high marks in skill, story and show ("Was it entertaining?"). It began in western Canada with fans who took to it with the fervor they normally reserve for ice hockey; now it has spread around the world.
The actors who appeared at the West Bank Cafe recently were from TheaterSports/NY, the troupe that brought the improvisational form to the city. After years in the minors -- small downtown Manhattan clubs and midnight shows -- they open Friday night at 8 at the John Houseman Theater on West 42d Street. It may not be the big leagues, but it's close enough.
The group fields a roster of about 30 team members who range in age from early 20's to 40's and has a repertoire of more than 100 improvisational games they make up or borrow from other teams. Though the format varies depending on whether the match is between two teams or a four-team round robin, the basics remain the same. The referee functions as emcee and when a skit goes bad, any of the three judges recruited for the evening can honk a horn, ending it.
The goal is not only an evening's entertainment. Players use theater sports to hone their acting skills and, more important, to confront something that sports accepts but show business usually does not: failure.
Although theater sports first found success in Canada, it "came out of professional wrestling back in the 50's in England," said Keith Johnstone, who got the idea while working as a play-reader and teacher at the Royal Court Theater in London. The wrestling "was clearly improvised theater," he said. "All the pain was played in front. If you were going to twist someone's neck, you made sure they were facing out front. It was the only form of working-class theater I'd ever seen, the genuine product."
Theater sports never really caught on in England, primarily, Mr. Johnstone believes, because until about 20 years ago all theatrical texts had to be approved in advance by the Lord Chancellor, making improv practically impossible. But in 1971 Mr. Johnstone settled in Alberta, Canada, where he teaches at the University of Calgary, and, after organizing a theater, he tried again.
"It was a wild success as soon as we started," he said in a telephone interview from Alberta. "The Canadians are crazy about sport. They reacted like it was ice hockey."
From Calgary, theater sports spread to Vancouver and then down the west coast of the United States and across the Pacific to Australia and New Zealand, where it has enjoyed wide popularity, especially among audiences in their 20's and 30's.
"Wherever you go," Mr. Johnstone said, "it's the young audiences who won't go to a normal theater who go to this."
According to George Babiak, one of the New Yorkers who competed in a 1989 tourney in Auckland in which his team, from TheaterSports/NY, finished third in a field of nine, "Before theater sports arrived, I don't think many young audiences had much experience with improv."
The Auckland competition was held at the Commonwealth Games; the team also competed at a tournament held at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and in matches in Edmonton, Toronto and Brisbane against teams from England, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Norway, Sweden and Czechoslovakia. TheaterSports/NY will be the host for the next big international tournament, at Pace University in New York in June.
But despite the sport's popularity, Michael Durkin, who manages the company's finances, says members do not make enough money to live on. He likens performances to "an Off Broadway show with a cast of 30. That's just economically not possible at this moment."
Many of the games are staples of improv and, like actors in other improv companies, team members use their workouts to polish skills for more traditional stage work.
For example, the game Sit, Stand and Kneel requires three players to monitor one another as one sits, one stands and the third kneels. When a player changes position, the others must move to compensate. "It really makes you watch the other players," said Hugh Sinclair, a team member.
But the element of competition adds something missing from conventional improv. In the first place, Mr. Johnstone said, "audiences respond amazingly to it."
"The audience reacts a lot more," agreed Laura Livingston, an actress who is also the company's artistic director. When a skit goes well, she said, "it's like you just scored the winning basket in a close game."
More important, the element of sport helps actors overcome the fear of failure that all of them face but many cannot acknowledge.
"There's something special about failure in sport," Mr. Johnstone said. "If you're in show business, you paper over it and smile. In sport, every note of failure is part of it. Otherwise you'd make the net lower or push the goals closer together."
 A low score can come as a relief to actors and audience. "Sometimes improv doesn't go too well," Mr. Babiak said. "Theater sports admits that."
Mr. Babiak invented one of the team's most popular games, Research and Development, in which the audience is asked to suggest the name of a game and then the actors devise the rules and play it.
In a 5-5-5 win against failure, one audience-inspired game, Nerdbusters, requires a member of the audience to recount an embarrassing moment from life; the players re-enact it, but transform it from disaster to triumph.

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS VIEW;
Sorting Out The Caruso Alternatives

BYLINE: By DAVID HAMILTON; David Hamilton, a music critic, produces recordings of historic material for the Metropolitan Opera.

 BODY:
Old recordings may never die, but they do go out of print. Even election to the Grammy Hall of Fame doesn't assure currency: recent honorees still absent from the catalogue include Bidu Sayao's classic recording of Villa-Lobos's "Bachiana Brasileira No. 5," Lehman Engel's "Porgy and Bess" and Dimitri Mitropoulos's "Wozzeck." And while the CD medium is reviving a remarkable range of material, the end products often suggest that sound recordings are not yet treated in accordance with their role in music and society.
A telling illustration is the legacy of Enrico Caruso, which never achieved an integral edition on LP. Few performers deserve such recognition more than Caruso, a singer not only splendidly endowed but also admirably conscientious, whose records made him the universal model for later generations of tenors, while his reputation played a major role in establishing the phonograph socially and economically. Although he remained an Italian citizen, his career centered in the United States, where he became a genuine folk hero to his immigrant compatriots and to everyone else as well. 
 Thus it doesn't seem utopian to expect his recordings to be carefully translated into the newest technology and packaged in a manner befitting their place in history. Other cultural legacies have long been handed down and restored with scrupulous care. For more than a century, international consortiums of scholars, supported by governments and foundations, have prepared authoritative printed editions of the music of the great masters. These days, classics of American literature receive comparable treatment, in collected editions emanating from university presses, underwritten by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Despite controversy over details, the desirability of doing such projects thoroughly and professionally is taken for granted. Though the resulting weighty tomes are destined principally for libraries, they also spawn popular editions for general readers, performers and listeners (in the foregoing literary example, the handsomely printed volumes of the Library of America). Regrettably, none of the three Caruso editions produced on CD in the last year matched comparable projects in other fields in vision, scholarship and technical quality.
The first, Bayer's "Caruso/Complete/ Compact" package, failed to live up to its billing, and appears to have been motivated only by opportunism. Two installments of "The Caruso Edition" followed, from England's Pearl label, using tapes prepared by the American engineer Ward Marston (Pearl EVC I and II; three disks each; two more volumes to come). BMG Classics last spring announced "The Complete Caruso" (RCA Gold Seal 60495-2-RG; 12 disks), and managed to get it into the stores in time for Christmas.
 Which to go with? Indeed, except for sound archives and compulsives, who needs all of Caruso's recordings anyway? Myself, I may never play again many of the salon, sacred and popular songs he recorded in increasing proportion over the years -- though some are treasurable for their verve ("Luna d'estate,"), vocal polish ("Vaghissima sembianza") and sheer splendor (Adam's "Cantique de Noel"). From Franchetti's "Germania" in 1902 to Caruso's last new role, in Halevy's "Juive" in 1920, the operatic records are sui generis; no opera lover should be without at least a sampling. If nobody else's selection will satisfy you, it may be simpler to have it all. (A good starting point for beginners is EMI's single CD of early Caruso, CDH7 61046-2.)
These three sets sound strikingly different, and the layman may wonder why. Well, for one thing, recordings aren't like books or printed music. While a new printing of "Huckleberry Finn" in a modern typeface may lack the aura of the first edition, it still transmits the voice of Mark Twain: if Twain's letters, words and punctuation are correctly transcribed, his meaning is preserved. But sound is not made of such discrete elements; it is a wave, a continuum, analog rather than digital in nature, until recently actually preserved in analog form: undulations of record grooves, patterns of magnetic particles on tape.
Transferring that wave from one storage medium to another is a process full of variables and options -- and in a profound sense unverifiable. Printed editions can be proofread to insure equivalence to the original, but the "original" of a sound recording -- the actual performance -- is unavailable for comparison; it long ago vanished into thin air. Few now survive who heard Caruso in the flesh, and seven decades of listening to the records have doubtless colored their recollections.
 So standards of judgment are ultimately subjective. Nobody objects to minimizing the nonmusical noises that afflicted older recordings -- but beyond a certain point this may entail altering or suppressing some musical content as well. How much "enhancement" of the musical sound by adding resonance, altering frequency balance, and the like, is justified? To what extent do the engineers modify the sound to match models inside their own ears? (And to what extent do listeners make similar comparisons?)
There are no simple answers, but the three Caruso projects demonstrate how the working methodology behind a project makes a difference. Each started from a different kind of source. In the fall 1990 issue of the Journal of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, Gary A. Galo convincingly demonstrates that the Bayer is merely a clumsy digital massage job on the egregiously flawed 1973 Murray Hill LP reissue; as the computer folks say, "Garbage in, garbage out." For Pearl's project (now half complete), Mr. Marston has used the quietest, least worn copies available in numerous private American collections.
Caruso recorded principally for Victor, to which BMG is corporate heir. Then isn't its package, billed as "including the original Victor Talking Machine Co. Master Recordings," made directly from the original materials? Not so, though BMG doesn't go out of its way to clarify the point. In fact, all but 51 of the 238 tracks here were prepared from tapes made with Thomas G. Stockham's Soundstream digital restoration process and issued on RCA LP's between 1978 and 1985. And since we were never told what Mr. Stockham started with, the suspicion remains that these CD's may incorporate the products of still earlier technology -- and in any case don't represent what today's engineering might do with the original masters.
Soundstream sought to compensate for the old recording horns' erratic frequency response, yet won little acceptance, partly because it added an intrusive roaring noise in the lower-middle range. Spot-checking indicates that the Soundstream Carusos have been modified for the CD edition, reducing the roaring -- and also the stronger bass line of the LP edition, which was a plus. (Considering the fanfare that introduced these transfers on LP, how ironic that Soundstream receives just one tiny mention in the new package.)
 The rest of RCA's tracks (pre-1906 recordings, plus a few others overlooked in the Soundstream series) were freshly taped by William R. Moran, using materials in the RCA archives. These sound more like the Pearl transfers; the methodology was basically similar, using traditional analog equipment. Comparison is vivid when RCA juxtaposes two takes of Tosti's song "L'alba separa" recorded the same day, one restored by Mr. Moran, one by Mr. Stockham. The latter is louder, the orchestra fuller, the voice apparently more forward -- but there's still that confounded roaring, and rather a lot of nonmusical noise. (Surprisingly, RCA has no decisive advantage over Pearl in the condition of its originals; for example, in RCA's set several of the 1905 recordings sport substantial ticks absent in the competition.)
Another problem: before 1925, recording speeds were not standardized, so original Carusos don't all play at 78.26 rpm. Fortunately, unlike Bayer (and many earlier reissues), Pearl and RCA are careful about pitch, though not always in agreement. Pearl's Mr. Marston convincingly argues that Caruso transposed down a few more selections than commonly accepted, while RCA follows the consensus. (This matters on CD, since variable speed is much rarer on CD players than on LP turntables.)
There are other considerations. RCA's booklet indexes the recordings six ways to Sunday, and includes excerpts from Michael Scott's recent Caruso book, placing Caruso and his singing in its historical context with contemporary reviews and comments. Pearl provides gracious, less informative notes by John Steane (who has missed the latest research: Caruso was the 3d of 7 children, not the 18th of 21), and its documentation, well intentioned, is poorly edited and proofread.
Neither RCA nor Pearl gives the words Caruso sang, not even for unfamiliar songs few listeners will have access to. Nor does either observe an ethical obligation: unissued recordings, not approved by the artist, often have ample historical interest, especially in the context of a complete edition, but should be clearly marked as such. A not minor consideration: the RCA set is mid-priced, Pearl's high-priced.
All told, none of these is what we need and Caruso deserves. By mixing two types of restoration, the RCA package puts its user at a disadvantage in comparing the younger and older Caruso; it looks as if corners were cut to get this set out quickly. Pearl is moving more slowly and carefully on the sonic side. Yet a single edition, using that kind of care plus all available sources (from both private collections and RCA's archives), considering newer digital restoration techniques, and preparing full documentation and editorial apparatus, would have been to everyone's advantage. Full justice remains to be done to Caruso.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Choreography in the Pursuit of Happiness

BYLINE: By Jack Anderson

 BODY:
Brian Jucha turned on a radio during "Life's Hell!!! Savettka Sings the Blues." What he heard was the speech of 1962 during which President John F. Kennedy announced the Cuban missile crisis. That news made the young man Mr. Jucha portrayed look uneasy. He had yet another reason to seem unsettled. Although Mr. Jucha ended his solo wearing a man's T-shirt and jeans, he began it in a long gown and a woman's silver-blond wig. As he danced, he recited a monologue about a man's fascination with women's clothes and his determination to go his own way.
To remind his audience of the world's complexities, Mr. Jucha blended personal and political crises in this solo, which was part of "Fresh Tracks," a series of works by young choreographers offered last month at the Bessie Schonberg Theater. The solo was one of several dances recently performed in New York City about people puzzled by conflicts in their minds and in the world around them. None of the pieces offered ready-made solutions to social problems. Nevertheless, all raised important issues and proved sadly relevant at a time when society has such trouble dealing with concerns like homelessness, drug addiction and economic uncertainty in our own country or political instability and the threat of war abroad. 
 Two particularly impressive depictions of people in quandaries were Susan Marshall's "Contenders," which Ms. Marshall's company danced last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and Ann Carlson's "Flag," which was part of Codanceco's autumn program at the Bessie Schonberg.
Uncertainty was the point of "Contenders." At the outset, however, there appeared to be no ambiguities in this dance. Tom Kamm's set resembled a stadium. Lynne Steincamp's costume designs were inspired by gym suits. The recorded score by Pauline Oliveros combined the noise of roaring crowds with the perky but banal tunes often played at skating rinks.
The physically demanding choreography turned the dancers into runners in a race. They gathered at a starting line, struggled forward, fell back and gained enough second wind to plunge ahead again. Ah, yes, it was easy to say, Ms. Marshall is metaphorically envisioning life as a race.
But soon something else became clear. No one -- neither the audience nor the dancers themselves -- could ever be certain just what the rules of the game were. What made "Contenders" disquieting was the way the rules kept changing without notice and for no discernible reason. Every time the dancers had to reassemble at the starting line, they gathered in different places. Just as they never quite knew the proper way to start their contendings, so the point of their strivings was equally ambiguous. No finish line was ever in sight.
Because there were moments when it was impossible to tell whether the dancers were cooperating or competing when they clustered together, "Contenders" could be interpreted as a depiction of a troubled society. But, like Mr. Jucha, Ms. Marshall combined social comment with psychological insight. Sequences of lifts made one wonder if the people involved wished to help or hinder one another. And when dancers paired off, their duets became erotic contests rather than displays of affection.
High-minded gym teachers often tell students, "It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game." But the dancers in "Contenders" were obviously playing to win. What made their behavior especially dismaying was not the violence of their struggles, but the fact that no one could determine the point of their efforts. It was impossible to tell if they were winning or losing, or even if they were playing well or badly.
"Contenders" ended with its runners jogging in slow motion into eternity. By choreographically creating a long-distance race with no apparent goal, Ms. Marshall suggested that society may be exhausting its energies for no ethical purpose.
In her work "Flag," Ms. Carlson also set men and women dashing about, even panting as they ran. At other times, they prowled, plodded, staggered and stumbled. These were worried, uncertain individuals, and it was easy to see that they were not fretting over trivialities. All their pacings and hurtlings took place on a floor cloth adorned with stars and stripes to resemble an enormous American flag.
 Ms. Carlson had more than sensationalism in mind here. Although the members of her cast were trampling on the flag, they were not desecrating it. This was not an example of flag-burning without fire. The flag in the dance became a symbol of a disunited United States, and the turbulent choreographic events that occurred on it evoked national unrest.
When dancers collapsed, one could not be sure if they were simply exhausted or physically or emotionally wounded. Sometimes, when they fell, they tried to give one another artificial respiration. And when they bent to kiss the flag, one knew that Ms. Carlson was regarding the nation's problems with compassion as well as horror. Therefore, it was totally appropriate that her dance concluded with a taped recitation of the passage from the Declaration of Independence in praise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Mr. Jucha and Ms. Marshall would surely join Ms. Carlson in echoing those noble sentiments. Even though they can offer no sure-fire formulas for the pursuit of national happiness, these choreographers' troubled dances prod the conscience.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Taking a Home on the Road With an RV Rental

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
TRAVEL by recreational vehicle, despite the increased cost of gasoline, has become an important way of vacationing. But you don't have to buy one. In addition to the estimated 8.5 million RV's registered to private owners in the United States, there is a sizable pool of RV's -- campers, trailers and motor homes -- for rent in the United States and Canada, as well as in Europe, New Zealand and Australia. Germans and Britons are big customers for rental RV's in the United States.
The snowbird season is the next-to-biggest time of the year for recreational vehicle travelers. Retired people living in the northern tier of the United States and in Canada unplug their coffee pots, put them in their camper trailers or motor homes and start driving to warmer weather. 
 The head of an assistance service that copes with medical emergencies of people on the road says he virtually tracks the weather by the area codes of calls for help. He said he gets a vision of motor homes down on their haunches like rabbits ready to streak for Orlando or Arizona at the drop of a snowflake. By now, he says, snowbirds are resting in the sun on the east and west coasts of Florida, Southern California, South Texas and around Phoenix and Tucson.
In the main, snowbirds own their vehicles because they want to use them year round. Younger families with tighter budgets and people thinking about buying an RV will probably want to consider rental. Rentals are continuing to rise, as they have since 1980, sometimes by as much as 50 percent in a year.
Although rentals are not cheap and the vehicles use a lot of fuel, daily costs for a trip may be lower than renting a car and staying in hotels. The saving, clearly, comes from doing a lot of your own work: cooking, bed-making, driving, cleaning, using the coin laundry.
Prices vary by area, length of rental, size of vehicle, length of trip and distance traveled. Demand also affects price. Here are some rates from the 1990 edition of "Who's Who In RV Rentals," published by the Recreational Vehicle Rental Association. In Orlando, Cruise America offers 19- to 24-foot motor homes for three to five for $385 to $980 a week. Also in Orlando, Go Vacations offers 18- to 27-foot motor homes to sleep four to six for $161 to $826 a week. In Atlanta, Holiday RV Superstores quotes a 22- to 26-foot motor home for four to six at $548 a week.
In busy seasons most outlets have minimum rental periods, as few as two days and as many as seven. Rentals do not include bed linens, pillows and blankets, pots, pans and plates, which are available for an extra cost, either by the person, perhaps $30 each for the whole rental, or for $50 to $100 for everything. Most rentals allow 100 free miles a day, with a per-mile charge after than, and a basic collision damage waiver.
Rental involves a security deposit, possibly $500 for the vehicle, a cleaning deposit of $50 and sometimes an added deposit of $50 for sanitizing.
Maintaining an RV
Bob Strawn, the executive vice president of the Recreational Vehicle Rental Association in Fairfax, Va., is blunt in sorting out the duties in an RV rental. Mr. Strawn, who for 19 years was an RV dealer in Denver, said that the dealer must say to the renter: "Now you are going to spend the next two or three hours listening to me about how this works. If you do, you will have a wonderful trip and come back again. If you do not, you may have an unpleasant and expensive experience."
Then the dealer should start by showing the customer how to put in oil, how to read the gauges and how to start the generator. Customers, he said, should be sure they understand the vital parts of a big machine that includes plumbing, water supply, propane gas, two electrical systems and a sewage pumping system, just to name a few.
All of this rules out arriving at the airport at 4 P.M. and taking off that night, as one might with an auto rental. Mr. Strawn said that sometimes Europeans acted confident about understanding the instructions and wanted to hurry away but discovered later, "usually at 3 A.M.," that their knowledge was flawed.
Mr. Strawn's organization includes 912 of the 3,800 RV dealers in the United States, but he says it is a purely voluntary group and membership is no guarantee to a consumer. The small type on the individual contract will specify what the insurance covers and stipulate what the traveler should do in the event of problems. He said most rental vans were less than three years old and would be sold at 50,000 miles. Failure to add oil or to understand how many hot showers are possible in a day, he said, tends to be the cause of difficulty rather than bad maintenance.
A dealer rents an RV 14 to 16 weeks a year, he said, with some very energetic dealers getting 22 to 26 weeks. He said that winterized vans, "mobile ski chalets," had longer seasons, and that sometimes dealers and hospitals enabled families to rent and live in a motor home near a relative who was getting treatment.
The Recreational Vehicle Rental Association publishes a good brochure, "Rental Ventures, How to Arrange to Tour North America by Rental Motor Home." It comes with the directory of 100-odd dealers that rent in 37 states and four Canadian provinces, and costs $5. The new edition of the directory will be published in February.

A 1988 University of Michigan survey of 2,085 households is the source for the figure of 8.5 million recreational vehicles registered in the United States. The survey also found that one out of 10 vehicle-owning families had at least one recreational vehicle, and that 2 out of 10 were interested in renting an RV for a coming vacation. In Canada, estimates by Transport Canada and the RV association there put privately owned RV's at 500,000 to 750,000.
In the United States, according to the Michigan survey, 44 percent of the owners are 55 years of age or older; 39 percent are 35 to 54 years old. The remainder are owned by people 18 to 34.
The price of an RV varies widely: a camping trailer that unfolds into a tent may cost $2,000; a travel trailer may be $12,600. The industry association says that a luxury motor home costs an average of $59,000, with smaller models beginning at $26,000. A standard motor home of 20 to 22 feet, sometimes also called a mini-motor home, sleeps up to five people, as does an intermediate model of 23 to 24 feet. A large model, 24 to 26 feet, sleeps six and a deluxe model of 29 to 31 feet sleeps up to seven.
The big motor homes used to give only 4 to 5 miles to the gallon, but David J. Humphreys, president of the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, a manufacturer group,said in an interview that improvements in weight and aerodynamics had brought this up to 10 to 12 miles to the gallon. Mr. Humphreys said that he expected 1990 sales, affected by waning consumer confidence in the economy, to be 7 percent below the 1989 sales figure of 395,700 units.
Motor Homes Abroad
A new agency in the United States has linked up with a British company and is offering RV rentals in England, usually for those who travel in caravans. The company, Britannia RV Rentals, lists rates of $760 a week in January for vehicle with two double beds to $1,890 for a week in August for a vehicle with three double beds. It also has the smaller van conversions. The price includes pickup from Heathrow Airport in London, the 15 percent value added tax and a basic collision damage waiver. Mandatory European Touring Insurance for trips outside England, $109 for two weeks, is also not included. The British company is U.K. Motorhomes Ltd.
Britannia RV Rentals, Box 1333, Jonesboro, Ga., 30237; (800) 872-1140.
There is also a clearinghouse for families with RV's who want to swap with European families who have RV's. Like programs for home exchanges, this has become much more informal because the operator discovered he was losing money on the plan; he now only circulates the information and leaves the arrangements to the parties. Bill Topping, who organized International Camper Exchange, will send an application form to anyone who sends a stamped self-addressed business envelope. When the form is returned, along with two or three envelopes each bearing 45 cents in postage, he copies it and distributes it to contacts in the countries that interest the applicant.

HEADLINE: Talking: Repair Loans;
Handyman Special Financing

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
PEOPLE of low or moderate income are often in a double bind when they try to buy a house. The sort of property within their grasp is frequently riddled with drawbacks such as bad plumbing or wiring or a dilapidated, leaky roof -- a handyman special that needs an immediate strong infusion of cash.
 Yet having used up all available savings for the down payment and closing, cash is the last thing they have to spare. Nor is an equity loan likely to help even if the repairs can be put off a year or two. Most homes today, especially in the Northeast, are not increasing in value fast enough to make an equity loan feasible. Besides, many lenders are phasing out equity loan programs as the market and economy weaken. Equity financing is often more costly, too. 
 Several programs are gearing up to deal with this situation. Their aim is to provide purchase financing and fix-up money in one loan package.
 Under such a program a rundown house selling say, for $80,000, is appraised during the purchase process at $100,000, its estimated value after the proposed renovations. The buyer is then provided with 90 or even 95 percent of the $100,000 as a mortgage amount. Part is used to buy the house and the rest is kept in escrow, to be released gradually by the lender to pay for materials and labor as the renovations move forward.
 This gives the buyer readily available cash while letting the lender hold onto the money until he is certain the work is being done. "But it's for basics," said Jane King, a vice president at Statewide Funding Corporation of Clifton Park, N.Y. "It's not for hot tubs."
 This type of loan should be available in three ways during 1991. Proabably the best opportunity will come from a new mortgage called the Community Home Improvement Loan being sponsored by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the quasi-public corporation that buys mortgages issued by primary lenders and thereby sets the tone for their lending practices.
 The second, a similar but little-used Federal Housing Administration program called 203 (k), has been around a while but was strangling in red tape. Officials at the agency insist it will become far easier to use.
 The third alternative is a similar concept offered independently by a handful of lenders who have regularly provided all-in-one loans in the past. They will continue to offer the opportunity on a case-by-case basis, but the borrower will need to ask for the privilege as a special concession.
 About a dozen lenders nationwide are participating in the Fannie Mae progam, which is starting this month . Marty Levine, senior vice president at Fannie Mae in Washington, said that every effort is being made to begin with at least one lender. In New York, for example, it is being offered initially through the Chase Community Development Corporation of Brooklyn (718-624-4700), a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank.
 Since others are expected to join in almost immediately, Fannie Mae has also set up a national hot line that interested borrowers can use to find out which lender to contact in their area (call 202-752-6527).
 This program is limited to households with incomes no more than 15 percent above the median income for the area. Nationwide this works out to around $42,000 to $62,000. But unlike many special low-cost mortgages offered through state-sponsored programs, it is not limited to first-time buyers. It is not available to investors.
People who already own a house can use the program to refinance a current mortgage to a level that might not otherwise be available. Origination costs and interest rates should be about the same as for a conventional loan. Renovation plans must be approved in advance by the lender.
 The down payment is 5 percent of the improved value. Mortgage size is limited to $191,250 and the amount set aside for renovations cannot exceed 30 percent of the total value of the property after the repairs.
WORKING with the 203 (k) program has traditionally been a nightmare of delays and documentation, butofficials in Washington insist that it was revamped in September 1989 to make it more user-friendly and that the local officials who process the applications are now better trained to speed matters along. Figures show that 619 borrowers benefited from such loans in 1990, up from 543 in 1989.
 There are no income limits for 203 (k) applicants and investors are welcome. However, the purchase price is limited -- around $125,000 for a one-family house to $197,950 for a four-family in high-cost areas like the Northeast or West Coast, and slightly less elsewhere. The down payment, based on the improved value, is 5 percent for owner-occupiers and 15 percent for investors.
 Borrowers must have their plans and specifications preapproved by local F.H.A. officials, which can create a delay of two months or more. An independent inspector must also approve the improvements each step of the way. Origination fees and interest charges may also be slightly higher than for conventional mortgages to cover the added processing costs. Renovation work must reach a minimum of $5,000, but there is no limit proportionate to purchase price.
 Mark Herbert, a financial adviser planning to buy a rundown three-bedroomm split-level in New Carrolton, Md., last June for $119,999, for example, figured he could incorporate financing for up to $6,000 for improvements by using 203 (k). He gave F.H.A. officials a detailed estimate. The loan approval took six weeks.
"Later they released the renovation money directly to me when I showed them I was doing most of the work myself," he said. He got his loan through Statewide Funding (1-800-726-5626) a national lender.
 Anyone needing all-in-one financing should also explore the independently run programs offered by local lenders.
At Mechanics and Farmers Savings Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., for example, a 10 percent down payment is required. There are no income or purchase price limits, but the program is for owner-occupiers only and plans and specifications must be approved in advance. Origination fees are the same as for coventional financing but there is a $100 charge for each field inspection of the renovation work; about three are normally required before completion.

HEADLINE: A Dragging Pace for New-Condo Sales

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY developers, hurt by tight mortgage-lending requirements and shrinking demand from foreign buyers, are struggling to sell hundreds of new condominiums in a market already reeling from a long real estate slump.
The apartments, in more than 60 Manhattan buildings, include some of nation's most expensive residential real estate. They are the last to be absorbed from a development wave -- prompted by tax abatements and the city's heady economic boom -- that began in earnest during the mid-1980's. 
 By 1987, the developers had broken ground for one of Manhattan's biggest bursts of expensive, privately financed residential construction in decades, and they have completed more than 30,000 new condominiums over the last four years.
Experts say demand for the apartments was surprisingly strong in 1988 and 1989, despite the city's deepening economic downturn. Research by Yale Robbins, a New York City real estate analyst, found that 90 percent of the new condominiums have been sold.
That has left about 3,000 apartments unsold, with prices in the least expensive buildings starting at about $350 a square foot and developers in some cases asking more than $1,000 -- or over $1 million for a small two-bedroom.
Real estate transfers recorded by the city suggest that sales in the new buildings have been painfully slow since last July.
At best, the developers say sales are steady, but less than robust. At worst, their unsold apartments have been languishing on the market for more than a year. Some people who have signed contracts are looking for a way out of their deals.
For residential developers in New York City, the 1990's are so far proving to be the decade of the hard sell.
"We just missed the market," said Olga Feliciano, sales manager for the Leighton House, a new 163-unit condominium at 88th Street and First Avenue, which opened its sales office in March. Only 35 of the apartments have been sold, so the building's developer, General Atlantic Realty, has rented out 110 of the condominiums..
General Atlantic is far from the only developer to offer new condominiums as rentals, and some real estate executives say the tactic is likely to become more widespread if sales do not increase soon.
"The rental option is a way of turning total disasters into the walking wounded on their way to recovery," said Andrew Graham, vice president of Gilbert Charles Beylen, a Manhattan brokerage and management company. He added that many of the developers, having paid huge sums to acquire their development sites during the height of the city's real estate boom, now have little leverage to lower prices on the apartments they sell.
"For many of them, the situation is barely palatable," he added. "They can't lower prices much or they get wiped out. But they tell their bankers they will rent their apartments out, get sufficient cash flow, and maybe realize 120 percent of their investment sometime later."
Perhaps hardest hit by the slump is Donald Trump, whose Trump Palace condominium, with 163 apartments at 69th Street and Third Avenue, is nearing completion. Mr. Trump began selling the apartments in mid-1989, promoting them heavily to investors in Toyko, Hong Kong and other Asian financial centers, and asking over $1,000 a square foot for some of the apartments in the building.
Initial results were promising. He obtained sales contracts for 78 apartments, most by the end of 1989. But now, with Mr. Trump's financial problems making news around the world, no more sales contracts have been signed, the 78 buyers have asked New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams to negate their contracts and Mr. Abrams's staff has blocked any further sales in Trump Palace until the developer demonstrates that he can meet his financial obligations to the building.
Elsewhere in Manhattan, even where sales are progressing more smoothly, developers say they are handicapped in ways that few had anticipated.
"The local banks are impossible to deal with," said Abbot Stillman, the developer of 3 Lincoln Center, a condominium built over the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center. Like other developers and sales agents, he said mortgage lending policies have been tightened to a point where some banks refuse to finance any sales in buildings in which less than 25 percent -- or even 51 percent -- of the apartments have already been sold.
Other lenders, which have traditionally financed 80 percent of an apartment's purchase price, are limiting themselves to 50 percent or 70 percent.
"It's as though the banks are on strike," Mr. Stillman said.
SIX blocks north of Mr. Stillman's project, the Zeckendorf Company, one of New York City's most prolific residential developers, has begun moving buyers into the Alexandria, a 201-unit condominium at 72d Street and Broadway.
"We have been knocking off two or three sales contracts a week," said William Lie Zeckendorf, who is in charge of the project. Nonetheless, he added, the foreign investors who had been spurring the feverish demand for Manhattan condominiums in the late 1980's are now far less plentiful.
"Interest among foreign buyers is clearly not what it was," he said.
Mr. Robbins, in his analysis of the new Manhattan condominiums, reviewed sales in 61 buildings that were completed since mid-1988, or were due to be completed over the next three months, and where apartments remain unsold.
The buildings in the study contain 6,379 condominiums, about half of them sold.
Mr. Robbins counted official transfers of property since July, as recorded by New York City, thus including only transactions in which sales had closed. The study found that the market was almost moribund during the second half of 1990, with no sales in 34 of the buildings.
Even where sales had occurred, it found apartments moving at a paltry rate. In some of the buildings, only one apartment had been sold, in several others, less than five.
"The rate of sales clearly dropped way down this year," Mr. Robbins said. But he added that his research did not reflect the number of condominiums that, like those at the Leighton House, had been rented out temporarily. Such rentals "are likely to be a significant factor now in light of weak demand from buyers," he said.
Although no one denies that the market weakened in 1990, developers say sales, as measured by the number of contracts signed instead of closings, are far stronger than Mr. Robbins's study suggests. Sales contracts usually require a buyer to pay a nonrefundable down payment of at least 10 percent of the purchase price.
In new construction, there is often a lag between the signing of sales contracts and closings because condominium developers are required by New York State to wait until they have contracts for at least 15 percent of their apartments before there can be any closings. They sometimes stagger other closings to allow an orderly flow of legal work and the movement of buyers into their buildings.
"We are generally pleased with sales," said Mr. Zeckendorf. Sales at the Alexandria began in May and the closings on the first condominiums in the building took place in December. He said 60 percent of the apartments in the building are under contract with buyers. Apartments in the Alexandria are priced at an average of $450 a square foot, $450,000 for a 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom unit.
THE Zeckendorf Company, in a partnership with Larry Silverstein, another New York developer, is also completing work on a more expensive condominium, Park Avenue Court, with 222 apartments at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Sales in the building, where apartment prices average $580 a square foot, began in September 1989 and so far there have been no closings.
Nonetheless, Mr. Zeckendorf said, contracts have been signed on 110 of the apartments, or almost 50 percent of the building. Despite more rigid lending requirements by some banks, he said, sales are now getting a boost from a decline in interest rates, which have fallen from over 10.5 percent in early 1990 to under 9.75 percent for New York City condominium buyers.
"We are getting good traffic in both buildings and sales are remarkably steady," he said, adding that "we are giving no thought whatsoever" to renting out apartments temporarily instead of selling them.
Such thoughts have occurred to Mr. Stillman, the builder of 3 Lincoln Center, where condominiums are priced at a lofty average of $685 a square foot. Since sales began in December 1989, he said, contracts have been signed for 85 of the building's 347 units. None have closed, although he said he expects several closings between this month and March.
"We are not going into a rental program in a big way," he said, but added that some apartments in the building may be rented unless the volume of sales increases soon. "Early in the life of a building it is better for everyone to have the apartments occupied," he said.
For many developers, a critical element in the economic equation is the huge prices they paid for land in the 1980's. Even at the heady prices they are asking for condominiums, some have little room to negotiate without losing money.
Although the developers refuse to divulge their land prices, real estate experts said the prices for the most desirable Manhattan sites rose during the 1980's from under $50 to over $100 per developable square foot. A developable square foot refers to the amount of floor area in a new building that will be allowed by the city, given the amount of land it is built on, zoning rules and limitations on height, bulk and setbacks.
Added to the cost of land are the costs of labor and material for construction, which experts say often amount to $100 to $120 a square foot. Architects, lawyers, advertising bills and other marketing costs, plus the interest costs incurred during construction, may add an additional $40 or $50 a square foot.
And since not all of a finished building can be sold -- hallways, lobbies, storage areas and elevators often take up at least 20 percent of a condominium's interior -- the final arithmetic means that the developers are unlikely to lower their prices, at least not much.
"Where a developer paid land prices that were premised on getting $400 or $500 a square foot for his condominiums, his options are now limited," said Mr. Graham. "Cutting prices by 20 percent might wipe him out."
AS a result, with buyers trying to negotiate rock-bottom prices, some developers say they are receiving offers they must quickly dismiss.
"People are looking for drastic price reductions, and those offers are being rejected without hesitation," said Jay Neveloff, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, who said the Trump Palace condominium has been attracting more than 20 "bargain hunters" a week despite the Attorney General's order postponing any closings in the building.
But he added that Mr. Trump has no plans to rent out apartments in the building, even as a temporary solution.
"Donald Trump and his marketing people firmly believe these condominiums are marketable," he said.
Others, however, said they have found sufficient demand for high-priced rental apartments to postpone further efforts to sell.
At the Leighton House, General Atlantic realty said it had rented its apartments at monthly rates ranging from $1,175 for small studios to $7,000 for a large four-bedroom. It has also also offered renters the option to buy at a price negotiated before they sign their leases, and will apply all of their first year's rent to their down payments.
"For the moment, there is a tremendous hesitancy to buy," said Mr. Arens of General Atlantic. "But we expect that hesitancy to disappear in a year or two, and we are finding people very eager to rent."

HEADLINE: Reaction Is Split on a New Hudson Rail Crossing

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE new railroad link across the Hudson River proposed by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad would significantly expand its transportation network, and perhaps alter the way Westchester residents live and work and perceive suburban life.
The railroad's $2 billion vision of its future calls for a new bridge or tunnel to connect rail lines east and west of the Hudson, either between Hastings-on-Hudson and Palisades, N.J., between Tarrytown and Nyack or between Beacon and Newburgh. The $1.25 million feasibility and cost-benefit study was completed last month by the Manhattan-based engineering consulting firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas. 
 The new crossing could provide Orange and Rockland commuters with direct access to Grand Central Terminal, create the first east-west suburban rail connection between New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut, and possibly link Stewart Airport in Newburgh with the New York City area.
The Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the commuter railroad's governing board, is expected to vote next month and to approve a $5 million appropriation to continue a four-year study of the proposal, including a further refinement of alternatives, an analysis of costs and an assessment of the environmental effects.
Government and business leaders have hailed the proposal as a needed vision for an increasingly congested transportation system and as a boost for the local economy. But others question whether an extension of commuter rail service is the right mass-transportation solution for the New York City area and if it is, whether money can be found to finance a $2 billion proposition in an era of shrinking resources.
"Anything that gets cars off the road we would seriously look at," said Westchester's Commissioner of Transportation, Eric Langeloh. But he added, "There is a rather monumental price tag, and no one is even close to knowing what the real costs would be."
 
'Thinking Regionally'
 He said he expected the municipal planning organizations that include Westchester representatives to support continued study of the M.T.A. plan. But until the concept becomes more specific, he said, the county would continue to take a "wait and see" attitude.
Jeffrey Zupan is a senior fellow specializing in transportation for the Regional Plan Association, an independent group monitoring development in the region. "The good news is that Metro-North is thinking regionally and broadly," Mr. Zupan said. "The real issue is whether this plan, or any of several others now being considered by different transportation groups, have staying power. Will this project give you the best for your $2 billion?"
Other transportation plans being considered for the region, Mr. Zupan said, include an extension of New York City subway service to New Jersey and the upgrading of New Jersey Transit rail service to carry more passengers on the western side of the Hudson. At the county level, state officials are considering the addition of one or more high-speed or "high-occupancy vehicle" lanes to Interstate 287 to relieve congestion.
Metro North's proposal, its supporters said, would decrease automobile congestion and pollution while adding as many as 10 million rail riders, provide needed economic help to White Plains and Stamford and bring jobs and affordable housing closer together.
 The Tarrytown connection is believed to be the one most favored by the Metro-North Committee of the Metropolitan Transportation Committee, which is evaluating the ongoing conceptual plan. It would permit the railroad to use existing rights of way along I-287 to extend the railroad east and give it three alternatives for interconnecting: with either the Hudson, Harlem or the New Haven Lines.
 
Reaching Stewart Airport
 If the proposed east-west railroad extended to the Harlem Line, for example, White Plains commuters could reach Stewart Airport in an hour. If the line reached to the New Haven Line, Connecticut commuters would have direct access to New Jersey as well as to Stewart Airport.
The proposal would enable commuters from Orange County, the fastest growing county in the state, to reach jobs in Manhattan, Westchester and Connecticut more quickly and reduce highway congestion. Only a fifth of Orange County's commuters use trains to reach their Manhattan jobs. Those who do take trains usually drive over the Tappan Zee Bridge to reach the Hudson Line because Metro-North's rail lines in Orange and Rockland terminate in Hoboken, where Manhattan-bound passengers must tranfer to PATH trains.
Commuting from the Orange-Rockland County region will increase by 55 percent over the next 20 years, the Metro-North study shows, as more families seek out the affordable housing available there. Despite the current economic downturn, Metro-North officials say, it is important for the region to begin considering a realistic mass-transportation option for the next century, one in which single-occupant automobile travel will be increasingly unacceptable.
 
What the Critics Say
 Critics of the plan say that any gains would be only temporary, that expanding the rail system is a prelude to more residential and commerical development, which most suburban dwellers do not want, and that it would lead to more roads and other improvements, changing the face of the county forever.
At least one regional environmental group is already preparing to fight the M.T.A. plan. "We have regrouped and will fight to the death any new Hudson River crossing, rail or roadway, at the Palisades, in the Tappan Zee area or in the Hudson Highlands," George Case, a member of the board of the Citizens Committee for the Hudson Valley, said in an appearance before the board of the M.T.A. last month.
The 25-year-old organization successfully defeated a plan by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to build a Hudson River expressway down the east side of the Hudson through Westchester.
Village officials in Hastings-on-Hudson and in Tarrytown have voted unanimously to oppose the development of a rail bridge or tunnel in their communities, an experience Tarrytown residents say is all too familiar. The building of the Tappan Zee Bridge there 35 years ago split the village in two, and residents say that on days when traffic to the bridge backs up, as it does frequently, it can take over an hour to drive from one end of town to the other.
 
'Can You Imagine?'
 "If there were a railroad station in Tarrytown, and you knew you could go there and go north, south, east or west, can you imagine what an attraction that would be?" asked Jerome W. Blood, Tarrytown's deputy mayor and the leader of an effort to have the east bank of the river around his village declared a scenic district by the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Four communities, including Irvington, Greenburgh, North Tarrytown and Mount Pleasant have joined Tarrytown in the effort to protect what they consider the special scenic, historic, environmental and recreational features of the area. Should the conservation department agree, the designation -- the third granted in the state -- would guarantee that strict environmental studies would be performed before allowing construction of bridges or tunnels.
A similar scenic designation was recently won by a group of communities facing Tarrytown on the other side of the river, and Mr. Blood said, "We want to mirror what they have done on the other side, before everything is destroyed."
Another bridge, Mr. Blood said, could easily become a combined rail and vehicular structure, one that would encourage more economic development in mid-Westchester. "People move to the suburbs because they want to live in small towns," he said. "There is a limit to the amount of development people want."

Must-See Ceramics

BYLINE: By BETTY FREUDENHEIM

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
THE Newark Museum, like other museums around the world, possesses hundreds of treasures that are rarely seen by the public. Of course, one may suspect that fine paintings, sculpture and craft items are hidden away in the vast storage vaults. But the creme de la creme is right out in the open, under the spotlights.
Visitors just hurry by with barely a sideward glance, in a frantic dash to see blockbuster, highly publicized shows before they close. Some day, they no doubt have promised themselves, they will take a few minutes to stop and examine the museum's own collections. 
 On the ground floor of the museum, a superb group of items from the 80's in the Contemporary Ceramics Gallery fits nicely into this must-see category. And, to fill the bill, it is displayed on the route to the entrance of the museum's renowned Victorian-era Ballantine House.
 To find these ceramics, turn right at the grandiose "Grecian Urn," created by the Trenton Potteries in 1904. The urn, almost five feet tall, with its swirls and curlicues of gold against a royal blue and porcelain white background, is one of four made for the New Jersey pavilion at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.
Undoubtedly great technological expertise was required for the creation of the urn, but who worries about such mundane concerns when confronted by this extravaganza? Its surfeit of neo-Rococo ornamentation is the antithesis of the urn's delicately rendered portraits of shepherdesses and goddesses lolling about in pastoral scenes. Louis XIV would have coveted this vessel.
 The gallery featuring ceramics of the 80's is also replete with contrasts. The collection was selected by Ulysses G. Dietz, whose 10 years as curator of decorative arts at the Newark Museum encompasses the decade. His is a refined taste that has never been enticed by the razzmatazz that typifies so much of the craft work of this era.
 "Everything from ceramic history came together in the 80's," he said. "The work ranges from beautifully crafted, functional ceramics, with a Japanese Zen-like quality, to wildly eccentric, nontraditional pieces."
He made his selections from the work of artists who are in their 30's to others in their 80's -- and one who is still very active in her 90's.
 As an introduction to the collection, Mr. Dietz featured a plate from the 70's by Albert Green, whom he called the "dean of New Jersey potters." Mr. Green's subtle color harmonies and the Japanese brushwork of his glazes set a high standard for the 80's and future decades.
 Nearby, Toshiko Takaezu's immense bulb-shaped pot closes at the top with a pin-sized hole, so that viewers can only guess what secrets are hidden inside. Her work has both power and poetry, no matter what the scale. Its muted glazes are applied in the intentionally accidental manner that her forebears in Japan worked so hard to achieve.
 In "Spirit Corn Vessel," Nancy Adams re-created ears of corn in clay with such precise realism that hybrid-grain farmers would recoil at the irregular rows and missing kernels. Yet we sense that the six corn ears, which support the handle of the bowl, are treated with reverence. The title reminds us that corn is one of three deities, along with beans and squash, that are worshiped by many Indian tribes at planting and harvest times. The fragility of the drooping leaves negates any functional application of this pot.
 Mr. Dietz selected Michael Duvall's "Mission Box" for its resemblance to the post-modernist architecture of Michael Graves, who designed the renovation of the Newark Museum. The box profile is rigidly geometric, and the surfaces are glazed in pastel hues of green, blue, yellow and rose. While the contours suggest an old mission church, with a flattened dome and unadorned cross, there is no door and the base is footed.
By definition, the piece is indeed a vessel because the crucifix can be removed, like the stopper of a perfume bottle. (A triangular alternative stopper was provided for non-Christians.)
"These nonfunctional pieces fit into a tradition of ornamental vessals that dates back to 18th-century Sevres," Mr. Dietz said.
 Ralph Bacerra's "Platter" infuses the optical illusions of W. C. Escher with luxuriant colors and assorted checkerboard patterns. Occasionally, the eye of one bird is shared by another one, flying in the opposite direction. Wings interlock. Here is an orderly tumult that can mesmerize the viewer.
 An iridescent "Chalice" has three handles on each side that give it an awesome ritualistic aspect. The creator, 97-year-old Beatrice Wood, made her first pot in 1933 when she could not find a teapot to match her six antique luster plates.
Garth Clark, a Manhattan gallery owner, said Ms. Wood continued to produce as much work as any other artist he shows. No blue jeans in her studio; Ms. Wood likes to wear a sari and two armloads of jangling bracelets when she sits down to throw on the potter's wheel.
 The "Endurance Bowl" by Anne Kraus evokes a dour mood. This ceramist first studied painting and took up ceramics only as recreation. Painted scenes on her pots relate legends of painful encounters or brooding scenes of loneliness. Three on the border of this bowl are labeled "Critics," "Impass" and "Failure." The last depicts rocks falling on the hero's head.
 To set off the decade of the 90's, Mr. Dietz acquired a Phillip Maberry "Presentation Cup" for the collection. Its gold handles seem to flutter outward, like ribbons catching the breezes. With its painted portraits, which decorate the central portion, viewers are reminded of the Trenton urn at the start of the ceramics collection. "They are both bombastic artistic statements," Mr. Dietz said.
 And what is his prediction for American ceramics of the 90's? If economic constraints continue, there will be "more affordable, high-quality but utilitarian work," he said. "We don't collect casseroles, but there is a level of functional work that is technically and esthetically beautiful -- even if it is not in museums."
The Newark Museum, at 49 Washington Street, is open Wednesday through Sunday from noon to 5 P.M. Admission is free.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY Q & A: JOHN C. KELLY;
Weighing Effect of the New Tax Laws

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

DATELINE: ROSELAND

 BODY:
JOHN C. KELLY has developed an intimate understanding of a subject that most people would just as soon ignore: income taxes.
 Upon graduation from Seton Hall University in 1963, Mr. Kelly went to work for Arthur Andersen & Company, one of the nation's largest accounting firms. In 1974, after having served for two years as a lieutenant in the United States Army and earning a master's degree in business administration and finance from Seton Hall, Mr. Kelly was made a partner in the prestigious firm. 
 Four years ago, he was appointed managing partner of the firm's New Jersey offices in Roseland and Princeton, and last year he was elected president of the New Jersey Society of Certified Public Accountants, an organization with more than 12,000 members.
Mr. Kelly, who was born in Newark, lives with his wife, Mary, in Convent Station. They have two daughters.
 Q. In general terms, what impact will the new tax laws have on New Jersey residents?
A. It's fair to say that lower-income New Jersey taxpayers will not be impacted significantly. In fact, in some cases, lower-income taxpayers will pay less in income taxes than they did last year.
Q. How are you defining lower-income taxpayers?
A. A person earning $25,000 a year, for example. That person's combined state and Federal taxes will probably go down by $100 in 1991.
Q. And taxpayers at the other end of the spectrum?
A. Let's take a wage earner who has $200,000 in taxable income. That individual will be paying $3,600 more in taxes, plus an additional $1,050 in increased Social Security taxes. The changes in both the state and Federal tax laws were really geared toward extracting higher taxes from higher- wage earners.
Q. And what about the vast majority of taxpayers who fall somewhere in between?
A. In general, a person who's earning $70,000 or less, owning or renting his home or apartment, will probably be paying less in state taxes after taking into consideration the homestead rebate and more in Federal taxes.
Again, an example might best illustrate the situation. A married couple with two children, filing jointly and earning $50,000, will pay about $200 less in combined Federal and state taxes. The same couple, however, with $75,000 in income for 1990 will probably pay $500 more in combined taxes before the homestead rebate.
Q. What about the tax forms themselves? Are there any major changes?
A. Yes. The most significant change is that the New Jersey tax form may have to be used by individuals who may never have had to use it before. In the past, if you owned a home, you would get your application for the homestead property tax rebate mailed to you in October or November.
Well, that form is gone and has now been replaced by a combined form included on the New Jersey tax return. So homeowners who want to claim their homestead rebate will have to fill out the form even if they wouldn't otherwise have to file a state tax return.
Q. What about tenants?
A. Tenants will also have to complete the homestead rebate form because the $65 tenant credit that they were entitled to in past years now comes under the homestead rebate program.
Q. How does that work?
A. Essentially, the law assumes that a certain percentage of your rent goes to paying property taxes. So the person who rents his home or apartment is entitled to a homestead rebate. That could amount to as much as $500 depending upon the person's rent and income level.
But remember, the $65 tenant credit has been eliminated, so on April 15 the average taxpayer is probably going to pay additional tax or get back less of a refund. That will be made up, however, in October when the person receives the homestead rebate.
Q. So will homeowners be paying more on April 15 as well?
A. Most likely. In 1989 a homeowner could effectively take a deduction for property taxes paid. That has been eliminated and replaced by the new homestead rebate. In many cases, those earning less than $70,000 a year and paying property taxes could get a significant increase in their homestead rebate, some as high as $500.
Q. Can you deduct your homestead rebate from any New Jersey taxes you owe?
A. No. It's important for taxpayers to know that if they have a tax liability on April 15, they cannot offset the homestead rebate against it. Those who are entitled to homestead rebates will receive them by mail by about Oct. 31.
Q. What about the form itself? The old homestead rebate form only required the property owner's signature.
A. The form itself is not complicated, but it contains no preprinted information. The old form, which would arrive with information about the property already on it, only had to be signed. The new one must be completed.
And while the instructions for the old form took up about half a page, the new instructions are about four pages long. The reason is because taxpayers will actually be calculating the rebate themselves. The new form is going to take a little more time, there's no question about it.
Q. Does that mean that it will cost more to have your tax return prepared if you don't do it yourself?
A. It could, yes. The tax preparer is going to have to spend more time completing the form.
Q. Are there any other changes in the state tax forms that might be of interest to taxpayers?
A. Yes. For the first time there are pie charts included in the booklet that describe the source of state revenues and what those revenues are being used for. And in addition, the Division of Taxation has included two forms that a large number of taxpayers have requested in the past. One is used to report excess unemployment and disability contributions, and the other is to be used to file for an extension of time to file the return.
Q. How might a person pay excess unemployment and disability contributions?
A. If you have more than one employer during the course of a year, it is possible to pay more than is required. If you have, you can fill out the form and get a refund.
Q. And does filing the automatic extension mean that you can postpone paying your state tax?
A. No. The form only extends the time to file the official return. Any taxes that are due must be filed with the request for extension; otherwise the extension will be denied.
Q. What about New Jersey residents working in New York? Will the new tax laws affect them in any way?
A. In the majority of cases, New Jersey residents working in New York will not pay any additional New Jersey tax in 1991. The reason is because the typically higher New York tax rates will result in a larger credit against New Jersey taxes on the 1991 return.
Q. And what about Federal taxes? Are there any major changes in store?
A. The biggest changes for 1991 are obviously the rates; the rates are going up. For lower-income taxpayers there shouldn't be much of a difference, but high-income earners will see an increase in rates.
For example, the tax rate on all income above $82,150 on a joint return will be 31 percent in 1991. Under prior law, income above the $82,150 would have been taxed at 33 percent up to about $220,000, but then at 28 percent thereafter. And there are some other nuances that increase the tax rate even further.
Q. Such as?
A. Well, the new law reduces allowable itemized deductions when adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000. It's based on a fairly straightforward formula, but some deductions are not included and others can be reduced by no more than 80 percent. In effect, it results in an increase in the marginal tax rate by about one percentage point on the income above $100,000.
Q. Any other major changes?
 A. The other major change is in the Social Security tax. A person earning more than $53,000 will be subject to increased Social Security taxes on income up to $125,000. And since the Social Security tax is a matching tax, both the employer and the employee could pay up to an additional $1,050 each in 1991.
Q. Any final words of advice for taxpayers?
A. Yes. Read the instructions, pay close attention to the homestead rebate form, and don't wait until the last minute to file.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Newspapers

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Times are tough for the newspaper industry. Advertising is in a slump some analysts are calling the worst in 20 years. Profits are down substantially at many papers. Vacancies are being left unfilled and budgets are being squeezed if not slashed. Almost everywhere -- especially in the Northeast, where papers have been hit hardest -- the mood is black.
Perhaps because the business has been so lucrative for so long, the painful decline in advertising caught many in the industry unprepared, prompting a wave of anxiety about the future. 
 But the current misery seems also to have snapped the industry out of its torpor and has propelled the most energetic effort in decades to face problems that pose a long-term threat to newspapers, such as declining readership and new demands from advertisers. James K. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., said that in this respect, the current recession is "a blessing in disguise."
Across the nation, newspapers are broadening their services to advertisers by devising new marketing strategies. For example, newspapers owned by Harte-Hanks Communications Inc., based in San Antonio, Tex., now offer advertisers access to extensive data bases on their communities, created by the company's local papers.
Some major newspaper companies are also creating delivery systems to compete with the United States Postal Service. The Times Mirror Company, Gannett Company Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc., for example, have all signed agreements with Alternate Postal Delivery Inc., giving many of their newspapers the right to be part of a new national postal network.
 
New Designs to Help the Reader
 And many papers have begun experimenting with changes in both design and content. The Los Angeles Times has revamped its design to help speed readers through the paper, and has added such features as a letters-to-the-editor section for arts and entertainment to let readers talk back to the critics. The Boston Globe is publishing a music section on Fridays. Several papers are creating geographically zoned sections that focus on local news and attract local advertising.
Poor economic conditions have delayed execution of some ideas. But the currents of change are powerful nevertheless and will not be forestalled for long.
Even now the economic pain is relative. Advertising has remained sufficiently ample and cost-cutting has been sharp enough that most papers are simply experiencing lower profits, not outright losses. John Morton, an industry analyst, says operating profit margins for papers owned by publicly traded communications companies peaked in 1985 at 20.2 percent, and have fallen steadily since. Profit margins were 17 percent in 1989 and about 15 percent for the first nine months of 1990, a level most businesses would envy in good times. Northeastern newspapers generally had lower margins, however; The New York Times newspapers showed an operating profit margin of 10.7 percent for the first nine months of last year, compared with 15.4 percent in 1989.
Largely because of advertising rate increases and the fact that some regions have not experienced the huge advertising slide seen in the Northeast, the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, a sales and marketing organization, predicts that total expenditures on newspaper advertising for 1990 will be five-tenths of 1 percent above 1989 levels and will grow 2 percent in 1991. The average annual increase for the last 20 years is more than 9 percent.
While a 2 percent increase does not make up for a variety of rising costs, any growth in advertising suggests, to industry analysts, an inherent strength. Money-losing newspapers, like The Daily News in New York City, are essentially an aberration; most papers long ago won the labor efficiencies The News is seeking from its striking unions, and most dailies do not face competition from other papers.
Owning a community's only newspaper has generally proved so profitable that many proprietors had come to regard themselves as economically unassailable. It is that confidence, or overconfidence, that is giving way.
No one knows how much of the former advertising will return once the economy rebounds, or how much may have been permanently lost to such rivals as direct-mail companies and cable TV. Moreover, some major industry clients, like large department stores, are so battered that they may never return to former strength.
"Newspapers' cheeks are rosy -- but they are hemorrhaging internally and their former success is not a guarantee of long-term survival," said Albert E. Gollin, co-director of research at the Newspaper Advertising Bureau. And of the present condition, Walter E. Mattson, chairman of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau and president of The New York Times Company, said, "Nothing focuses one's attention like pain."
Rethinking the newspaper business is occurring on two tracks. The first attacks the basic product -- from content to the way advertising is sold. The second is moving to create an entirely new range of information and marketing services.
 
Fewer Readers
 The future of the daily paper itself clearly depends on its ability to cope with one fundamental -- and, thus far, unsolvable -- problem: People increasingly do not read newspapers.
At the end of World War II, most American households subscribed to a morning and an afternoon paper. Newspaper market penetration was 135 percent, meaning more papers were sold every day than there were households. Circulation climbed until the early 60's, then leveled off at about 62 million, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. But population kept growing, bringing a steady decline in penetration.
In the mid-70's, as baby boomers were about to turn 30, executives were gleefully anticipating a surge in readership. But it never came.
Television largely replaced the afternoon paper as post-work entertainment, and young women, who had comprised a huge portion of newspaper readership, went to work.
In 1989, the Bureau of the Census counted 93 million households in the United States, and total morning and evening newspaper circulation was 62.6 million; penetration had thus fallen to 67 percent -- less than half of the figure at the end of World War II.
Another point is that those who say they are newspaper readers increasingly do not read a paper every day. The National Opinion Research Center reports that the percentage of adults who do dropped to 50 in 1989, from 73 percent in 1967. At the same time, the percentage that read "once or more weekly" increased to 38 from 18 percent.
But while readership penetration was declining, profits were soaring. Labor costs fell with advanced technology; advertising linage rose, especially during the booming 80's, and ad rates rose faster than inflation.
With profits increasing steadily, the nettlesome problem of declining penetration could be neglected. Indeed, there are still newspaper executives who regard the furor over circulation as beside the point.
 
Reaching the Affluent
 "I think the penetration issue is a red herring," said W. Dean Singleton, chief executive officer of Media News Group Inc., a chain that includes The Houston Post and The Denver Post. Mr. Singleton argues that newspapers must have "effective penetration" of the middle-class and affluent audience with buying power. He said his newspapers -- and, he suspects, most others -- still reach most of this audience, while the people lost by newspapers include those "who don't read, period, and also don't buy."
However, many other newspaper executives say the readership problem is real and to ignore it is to court disaster.
Some believe that, unless ways can be found to attract young readers and recapture older ones, the traditional mass-market newspapers will evolve into niche publications, aimed at the rich and well educated or at sports fans or segments of the business world, for example. The other side of this equation is the concern that, in their pursuit of readers, newspapers could enter the world of outright pandering, and, like much of television, become slaves to ratings. The historic role of newspapers as the Fourth Estate, or as a kind of village billboard of vital information, would disappear, with profound consequences.
Such problems defy easy solutions.
Research by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau and many newspapers suggests that the enemies of newspaper readership are a shortage of time and ever more media options. Inconsistent newspaper delivery and even guilt at the sight of unread papers piling up have also been cited as factors. Some executives concede that they have not been effective at promotion.
But many publishers believe the unpleasant fact is that newspapers simply have not been important or interesting enough to their readers, and they are trying to correct that.
"We believe in breaking the boredom barrier with every issue," proclaims The Daily Sparks (Nev.) Tribune, a 6,000-circulation daily.
Many publishers say that, as recently as two years ago, many editors were reluctant to join the chase for readers by making content changes that seemed to trivialize the news. A speaker at an American Society of Newspaper Editors convention in 1988 evoked disapproval when he said he had solicited postcards from readers detailing their travel experiences, and then used precious space to publish them.
Publishers say that their top editors now see a crucial need to improve their product, though agreement will probably never come on what precisely will constitute improvement and what trivialization.
Content is not all that is getting close attention; circulation, delivery, promotion and advertising are being examined as well.
Many analysts expect that, when the economy springs back, advertising will too. But new competition has arisen in the meantime in the form of real-estate magazines, for example, and computer networks and help-wanted data banks.
 
Discounts on Ads
 So the papers are focusing on ways to expand the old advertising base. On days that are light, like Monday and Saturday, for example, they are offering discounts.
And they are creating sections with special themes to attract related ads. No one is suggesting that newspapers should break the line they have strived for between advertising and news: that they sacrifice honesty and objectivity and begin printing a certain story in return for a certain ad.
But, without crossing that ethical barrier, a somewhat closer relationship between content and advertising has developed and is now generally regarded as beneficial -- to newspaper, advertiser and reader. Lumping related stories together in a package that attracts advertisers of products related to those stories can be useful to everyone without breaking sacred lines. Still, such cooperation has prompted concern that a timid newspaper might not print a critical article on a defective product, say, for fear of offending an advertiser.
Large retailers, discount stores and grocery store chains are targets of the ad salespeople as well.
These advertisers often make their decisions from some central regional location, and thus one company can strip away business from hundreds of papers because of a policy to use direct mail, for instance, or television. In the past, advertisers seeking a broad audience have often been less attracted to newspapers because they had to place each ad individually and pay each paper separately. One of the major pushes now is to connect dailies into market networks in which national advertising can be bought with a single check.
And a variety of other marketing and sales and circulation techniques are being tried. Indeed, the bad times have forced newspapers to sharpen their business acumen in almost every respect. Newspapers have not always demonstrated great vision in this area when it has come to protecting their financial future. Now they feel they have no choice.
 
PRODUCT REDESIGN FOR THE BABY BOOMER
In an experiment closely watched by the newspaper industry, Knight-Ridder Inc. is publishing a newspaper dramatically redesigned to lure the busy baby boomer.
In the new Boca Raton (Fla.) News, no article jumps to another page. None. Ever. Long articles are broken into two or more smaller ones. The type is larger than the traditional, and, though the old News splashed garish colors on its front page, the reinvented paper uses softer pastels.
Louis Heldman, supervising editor, said research indicated color and design helped readership, but only as a complement to meaty content. "When we presented people in focus groups with fairly shallow packages, no matter how attractive they were, they were rejected," he said.
Knight-Ridder's chairman, James K. Batten, said he hopes the new paper will make readers "feel plugged-in and smart, touch their emotions, recognize their time poverty and help them with their lives."
One goal is to guide the reader, but some innovations seem almost didactic, if imaginatively so. For instance, Page 3 is devoted to world news and each of the 13 or so articles of varying length has a number next to its headline. In the center of the page is a map of the world and the geographical subject of each article is located by a number -- creating a bit of a geography lesson.
A pull-out tabloid magazine called Essentials appears with a theme for each day. Monday's deals with business, Tuesday's health and fitness, Wednesday's parenting.
Knight-Ridder began the so-called 25/43 project -- for the ages of the baby boomers it is designed to reach -- as a laboratory to try ideas that may later be used at the company's other newspapers, which include The Charlotte Observer, The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Since October, when the new format was introduced, circulation has risen by 3,200, from 21,000.
 
WEEKLY READERS
 Rethinking the newspaper business has begun with a look at cherished -- and now largely invalid -- assumptions.
For instance, the daily newspaper is not a daily at all, at least in a business sense; it is more of a weekly published on Sunday, because the Sunday paper carries the lion's share of the week's advertising.
Sunday, when circulation is always much higher, has become the one day when people have the time to read, and the Sunday paper has evolved into a feature-loaded, magazine-style publication packed with advertising and pre printed circulars.
In 1989, 847 of the nation's 1,626 dailies published Sunday papers, but Sunday's total circulation -- 62 million -- was the same as that for the rest of the week when all the papers were publishing. Now all but the smallest newspapers have a Sunday issue; while the total number of dailies has dropped since 1946, the number of Sunday papers has nearly doubled.
Actually, today's paper is more of a thricely. Two other days have also become especially important: Wednesday, the grocery paper, carries most of the food advertising, and Friday, the weekend paper, has become an entertainment guide.
But in some communities the other four days can get pretty thin.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Why a U.S. Recession Still Matters

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Desynchronization is fast becoming one of the economic buzzwords of the 1990's. It is shorthand for the divergence of economic growth patterns around the world. Rather than everyone following the leader -- which had been the United States -- economies have become more independent. Right now, the United States and Britain are in recessions while Germany and Japan are growing.
Desynchronization is another of the proofs that the United States is not the center of the global universe anymore. But it does not mean that when the world's largest economy goes into decline it does not hurt elsewhere. 
 Some economists in Europe are already worried that a deeper or longer-than-expected American decline will slow European growth even more than anticipated as sales of European exports suffer.
But an even more dramatic impact is likely in the so-called emerging economies: the developing countries from Latin America to the Far East that depend on the American market and consumer for much of their economic growth. Those economies -- as well as their stock markets -- will be facing some bad times.
Nine major emerging economies -- Mexico, Brazil, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Thailand and Malaysia -- depend on the United States to buy an average of 27 percent of their exports, according to International Monetary Fund data for 1989. The American market share ranged from 11.8 percent of India's exports to 63.3 percent of Mexico's. Almost 37 percent of Taiwan's exports and almost 34 percent of South Korea's went to the United States that year.
"The United States is still the biggest and most open economy," said Richard O'Brien, chief economist at American Express Bank in London. "The old adage -- if the U.S. gets a cold, everyone else gets pneumonia -- is not true. But if the United States has a recession, everyone else is affected."
And that means trouble for the stock markets in these nine countries, as well as other emerging nations, many of which have been spectacular performers in recent years. The market in the Philippines rose 58.65 percent in dollar terms in 1989; Malaysia 58.84 percent; Taiwan 103 percent; Thailand 123.61 percent, and Turkey 366.85 percent.
The strong growth potential of such young economies made it easy for their stock markets to outdo the mature markets in the United States and Europe. In fact, in 1990, Mexico was the top performer in dollar terms for the third year in a row in the Financial Times World index of 24 markets.
But overall, 1990 was not a good year for emerging markets, with many falling even further than those in the United States and Europe. The markets were devastated by the sharp rise in oil prices that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. And concern about the slowing United States economy also contributed to the sharp decline. The continuing bleak outlook for America can only add to the downward pressure, especially given the risk of investing in these very volatile markets.
Making matters even worse last year was the fact that shares in many of the popular closed-end country funds performed even more poorly than the stock markets they represented. The funds are the vehicles through which many American and European institutions and individual investors get a stake in the developing world.
According to Lipper Emerging Market Funds Service, the 16 closed-end funds listed on the New York Stock Exchange that invest in emerging markets showed an average decline of 12.6 percent in net asset value in 1990. But the price of shares in those funds fell an average of 27.7 percent. The reason for the disparity is that closed-end country funds are ruled by two masters: the prices of the underlying foreign securities and the demand for the stock in the fund itself. This is why these funds can trade at a discount or a premium to the underlying value of their stocks.
William G. McBride, international editor of the Lipper funds service, said that the key factor in the deeper declines in the share price of the funds was the boom in the number of funds. About 70 have been started around the world in the last two years alone, raising the total to about 230. This sharp increase diluted demand, he said.
"You saw a fad come crashing down," Mr. McBride said. At the beginning of last year, many investors who rushed to buy the funds got out when they saw fund prices dropping even as the underlying markets rose. In addition, many Japanese investors who had pushed up the value of the funds sold out as the Tokyo stock market declined and money was needed back home, he said.
All this means that the emerging markets are beginning the new year hobbled by the recession in the United States. And the funds that invest in these markets face a decline in demand.
That, in turn, means some funds could offer good value because of steep discounts. But take care, says Mr. O'Brien of American Express. Such investments have to be long term, he said, because the drag on the emerging markets could well continue for two years.

HEADLINE: Diversifying to Counter A Slump on the Slopes

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN M. BERRY

 BODY:
When the Resort at Squaw Creek opened near Lake Tahoe in California two weeks ago, its ski slopes were packed tighter than a cable car at Aspen, Colorado's legendary ski resort famed for its crowds and opulence.
Squaw Creek's owners hope their venture can approach Aspen's success, so it was not surprising that the resort, which cost $135 million and includes a 405-room hotel and a 36,000 square-foot conference center, looks as much like a luxury spa in Hawaii or Hilton Head, S.C., as it does a ski area. 
 From California to Maine, the nation's ski resorts are struggling to hang on to their share of the consumer's leisure dollar at a time when competition is increasing and the industry must cope with high operating costs, fewer skiers, scarce capital, several years of disappointing weather and budding environmental concerns. As the competition increases, more and more ski areas are for sale and the anxious owners are looking to Japanese investors to bail them out.
"The ski industry is in a market-share game now," said Jerry Jones, the head of Jerry Jones & Associates, a marketing firm in Aspen. "To grow, you have to take market share away."
The ski industry, with annual revenues of $7 billion, wants to recapture the gilded age of the 1960's and 70's when annual revenue growth reached 15 percent and the number of new skiers taking to the slopes seemed to have no bounds. But baby boomers are older now and there aren't enough young people coming along to take up the slack. Moreover, the economic squeeze in the last few years has left many resorts undercapitalized and cut into profit margins.
During the holiday season that ended last week, attendance at ski areas was down 10 to 40 percent from the same period a year ago, according to a check of regional ski associations. Annual revenue growth is now only about 4 percent.
Such dismal figures have forced ski operators to look beyond winter snow and people on skis.
"If you build the Waldorf Astoria just 10 feet from a ski lift, you can't survive on a purely winter business," said Bob Gillen, a spokesman for Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado. "That's the crisis that ski resorts face."
The ski operators' fondest dream is to take market share away from other leisure industries and not just from their fellow ski operators. To do this, many areas are imitating other industries, building theme resorts equipped with health spas, tennis and golf facilities and hiking trails.
With their large, luxurious conference center, the developers of the Resort at Squaw Creek have targeted an upscale business clientele. The owners, an investor group led by the Perini Land and Development Company in San Francisco, are marketing the resort to executives at the country's 1,000 largest companies. Next summer, long after the snow is gone, Squaw Creek's owners hope the center will be vibrant with people mixing business with recreation.
"The salvation of the ski industry is to find a niche to move into, whether it's catering to older skiers, kids, executives, whatever," said Charles Goeldner, a business professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Ski areas built on a theme are not new. One of the first theme resorts was Vail, Colo., which began as a European-style alpine ski center catering to the affluent athlete and now has become both a summer and winter mecca for others as well.
Competition is stiff among Colorado's 27 ski areas, so smaller areas have developed themes in an attempt to set themselves apart from the crowd and to build summer business.
Keystone Resort pitches itself to families and has designed special programs for senior citizens. Telluride's theme is its setting, a high-mountain town filled with restored Victorian-era buildings. Steamboat Ski and Resort Corporation, which was acquired by the Japanese Kamori Kanko Company last September for an undisclosed amount, has a frontier theme.
Ski areas are also pooling their resources with local towns. The town of Mt. Crested Butte recently passed a lodging tax to collect money for summer advertising. Keystone, Copper Mountain and Breckenridge have a system of shared lift tickets and packages that helps them compete against Vail and Aspen.
But even as ambitious development plans are being launched in many areas, signs of a downturn are growing.
Family-owned and privately held ski operators have been hit the hardest. In the last decade, the number of ski areas in the United States has shrunk to 560 from 880, according to the United States Ski Association.
Consolidation among a few top companies, the influx of Japanese investment, warm weather and the high cost of snow-making equipment has made it difficult for the marginally profitable and usually undercapitalized companies to survive.
To some extent, technology can solve the snow problem, as long as there are enough stretches of below-freezing weather. But snow-making equipment is expensive and requires an adequate water supply.
 "For some people, it makes or breaks your business," said Pam Murphy, assistant director of marketing at Mammoth Moutain Ski Area in California, which is purchasing its first snow-making machine, at a cost of between $7 million to $10 million, for the 1991-92 season. "If we didn't have snow making most areas wouldn't be open," said Betsy Perry, communications director for the Northeast Ski Areas Council.
 The Northeast has been hit particularly hard by warm weather and the economic downturn. In New England, only two of 70 areas posted gains this season. In Vermont, only three or four of 17 ski areas in the state are turning a profit, according to the Vermont Ski Areas Association. Even when the balance sheet is positive, the news is less than cheering. For example, Killington-based S-K-I Ltd., one of the few publicly held ski companies and historically one of the most profitable, had to content itself last year with revenues of $84.5 million, up from $82 million a year earlier.
Mr. Jones of Jones & Associates in Aspen estimates that as many as 25 percent of the nation's ski areas are for sale right now. Fortunately for many operators, Japanese investors have begun to appear, checkbooks in hand. Heavenly Valley and SkiUSA, two California operations, were bought last year by groups of Japanese investors.
 Adding to ski operators' woes are growing environmental concerns.
Mammoth Mountain is uncertain about the water supply next year for its new snow-making equipment. Ms. Murphy said that ski operators have not yet thought through how snow making will contribute to water shortages, especially in drought-ridden states like California.
Some ski operators are running up against groups that want to restrict growth. Executives at Killington Inc., a subsidiary of S-K-I, say that they spent $2 million last year fighting efforts to restrict their development.
In part the industry's problems stem from the fact that there are 25 percent fewer people in the 15-24 age group this year than there were in 1970, according to the Census Bureau. Executives hope the current baby boom will produce a new generation of teen-agers shortly after the turn of the century who will take to the slopes with gusto.
 
EQUIPMENT'S SIMILAR SLIDE
 The ski equipment industry's bitter winter comes after a year of poor sales.
While some retailers are unloading goods at wholesale prices to stay out of the red, others are closing their doors for good.
"Retailers are going to get killed this year, especially in the Northeast," said I. William Berry, publisher of two ski industry newsletters, one for retailers. "For some, there's no place to go but out."
The slump is at least in part a reflection of poor sales by retailers nationwide. Mr. Berry said that sporting goods stores, and ski shops in particular, could expect a decrease in sales of 15 to 30 percent this year.
Though sales of ski products in the United States remained level at $1.5 billion last year, fewer skis are being sold.
About 650,000 pairs of skis were sold last year, down from a peak of 1.1 million in 1986. Sales of clothing and accessories have risen slightly.
After record low sales last year because of poor weather conditions, some retailers cut back on inventory by as much as 15 percent.
"We're surviving better than last year, so in a sense it's an improvement," said Bruce McElroy, general manager of Olympic Sports, a chain of retail stores in Seattle with about $25 million in annual sales.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
The Trouble With Private Bank Insurance
 
Questionable loans, nervous depositors, pliant public officials, a depleted insurance fund -- the collapse of Heritage Loan and Investment Company in Providence, R.I., at first glance seems familiar. The likely involvement of organized crime provides a dash of local color. But instead of sticking around to blame his troubles on regulators, Joseph Mollicone Jr., the bank's president, vanished. He had made $13 million in what investigators describe as fraudulent loans to himself. An investigation caused a run on deposits, draining the private fund that insures 45 banks and credit unions. The state's Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, declared a bank emergency on Tuesday, shutting the affected institutions. Many will reopen with Federal insurance, but depositors at the weakest might lose their money. Will the story end in Rhode Island? Probably not, said Bert Ely, a financial institutions consultant. With private insurance programs for banks and credit unions elsewhere, he said, "One serious hit that isn't quickly and convincingly dealt with can bring the whole plan down." Some other states are likely to require privately insured institutions to switch to Federal coverage, resulting in depositor losses or state bailouts for those too shaky to qualify.
 
Putting a Good Spin on Bad News
 
Higher unemployment is good news of sorts when it is still lower than economists had expected. The rate rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December to the highest level since mid-1987. Non-agricultural payrolls fell by 76,000, but the decline was less than a third the drop in November. William C. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said that even these figures overstate the economy's weakness, since hours worked in December rose six-tenths of 1 percent. "The report makes you more comfortable that the production cutbacks happened quickly enough in October and November so that further big cutbacks may not prove necessary," he said. A record 5.9 percent plunge in November factory orders was worse than economists expected, but no great surprise after news of low orders for durable goods.
 
Dinkins, the Optimist
 
First Donald J. Trump came up with his forecast for Atlantic City casinos. Then Robert Campeau and his New York deal-makers issued their outlook for retailing. Last week the Dinkins administration raised its 1991 earnings estimate for the York City's pension fund to 9 percent, more optimistic than about 9 in 10 of the nation's other cities. New York City's hopefulness certainly doesn't spring from its 1990 record, when forecasted earnings of 8.25 percent actually came in at just eight-tenths of 1 percent. More likely, the city's optimism comes from its need to reduce pension contributions and come up with millions, quickly, to finance 5 percent raises for workers under contracts reached last week. At this rate, Yankee management, come April, is bound to predict a pennant.
 
A Skeptical Eye at Christie's
 
For conservative valuation and fiscal prudence in New York, look instead to Christie's. The auction house prepared for the sale this week of the Ferdinand E. and Isabella Marcos collection of Old Master paintings by scrutinizing several pieces. Seven of the Marcos Canalettos were busted down to the Circle of Canaletto. What was a Giovanni Bellini in Manila, valued at perhaps $1 million, is School of Bellini in New York, worth a tenth as much. Several million dollars worth of English silver is for sale, too; no doubts, apparently, about whether copper lurks underneath.
 
In Brief
 
For the first time since 1979, American semiconductor makers gained in 1990 against the Japanese. Their share of the worldwide market rose to 36.5 percent from 34.9 percent.
 
The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the makers of infant formula colluded to raise prices.
 
The prospect of Middle East peace talks pushed oil prices down to $24.90 a barrel, the lowest since the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
 
There Goes the Prime
 
The nation's major banks lowered their loan rates last week for the customers they still consider unquestionably credit worthy. The prime rate, a benchmark for many other loans, fell half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent, the first decline in a year.
 
COMPANIES

 
Hello? Hello? New York?
 
Wish fulfillment? New York was cut off from the rest of the nation on Friday when an American Telephone and Telegraph Company line was severed in New Jersey. Airline flights were delayed and diverted, and the New York Mercantile Exchange closed. Last January, computer troubles shut down A.T.& T.'s long-distance system nationally for about nine hours.
 
Sears Slashes the Work Force
 
Sears, Roebuck & Company is hoping that fewer people in the stockrooms, loading docks and back offices will lower costs and bring more shoppers into its stores. The nation's largest retailer announced on Thursday that it would cut 21,000 jobs. Some analysts shrugged. "The announcement shouldn't be over-read," said Samuel G. Liss, director of research at Salomon Brothers. Most of those laid off will be part-timers, he said, and in a slack economy, the savings are unlikely to be evident for several quarters. Sears's overhead has been twice that of its competitors; some stores still keep track of merchandise shipments with handwritten logs. Sears had slower sales in December than several discount chains. Comparing sales in the same stores with the year before, Sears suffered a three-tenths of 1 percent decline.
 
The Best Products Company went private in 1988. On Friday, it became the latest retailer to seek bankruptcy protection.
 
Giving Back LBO Loot
 
Wall Street's wheeler-dealers might want to see about malpractice insurance. Bankers, lawyers, maybe even shareholders who profited from leveraged buyouts that later failed could be forced to surrender their gains. Barry L. Zaretsky, an examiner appointed by the Federal Bankruptcy Court, said that Revco D.S. could sue to recover fees paid in a 1986 buyout. Professor Zaretsky, of Brooklyn Law School, concluded that Revco's advisers and investors pulled out so much capital that they rendered the company insolvent. Revco filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988.
 
Mideast Flights Grounded
 
Nobody wants to insure flights to the Middle East anymore. So Pan American World Airways announced on Thursday the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Insurance had risen to $65,000 for the Israeli flight, $162,500 to Saudi Arabia. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines canceled its three weekly flights to Amman, Jordan.
 
Matsushita's Yosemite Crisis
 
Now that the Japanese own the concessions at Yosemite National Park, Washington has become eager to protect the wilds. Last week, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. threatened to cancel the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's newly acquired contract to run the park's hotels, shops and restaurants. Profits from the park should not flow abroad, he said. He demanded that Matsushita donate its subsidiary, the Yosemite and Curry Company, to the United States, or sell it to a foundation at a low price. Matsushita picked up the concessions in its $6.6 billion purchase of MCA Inc. Environmentalists have accused Curry of abusing its franchise, packing convention facilities and a virtual shopping mall into the park and luring enough tourists to choke the area with traffic and smog. MCA has called Mr. Lujan's threats "Japan-bashing," but agreed to put its Yosemite earnings in escrow for the time being.
 
A Bank on the Brink
 
The Bank of New England Corporation said it expected to post a fourth-quarter loss of $450 million, more than wiping out its net worth and bringing it to near-collapse. The Boston-based institution is trying to raise capital to avert a Government takeover, which would lead to major losses for the Federal deposit insurance fund. The nation's 33d-largest banking company, the Bank of New England has suffered severe losses on real estate loans.

Walesa on the Free-Market Path
 
Poland's march toward free markets appears likely to continue under Solidarity leader and now President Lech Walesa. During his campaign, Mr. Walesa had the habit of promising faster progress and less pain at the same time. But he is filling his Government with ministers committed to economic reform. His Prime Minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, is an economist so devoted to capitalism that he founded a trucking business while the Communists still held sway. Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of the nation's economic programs and Finance Minister to Tadeusz Mazowiecki, whom Mr. Walesa defeated, appears likely to keep his job. Keith Crane, an economist at Planecon Inc., cautions that Mr. Walesa might bend to pressure to ease the impact of free markets. But Mr. Crane doubts the Government will reverse direction, saying, "In no way will it undo what has been done before."
 
Mexico's Market Miracle
 
The Mexican stock market completed its third straight year as the world's strongest. Mexico led the 24 markets in the Financial Times World index last year by advancing 79.6 percent in dollar terms. . "Money is coming back to Mexico, and new money from the U.S. and Japan is going in," said Robert A. Pastor, director of the Latin American program at the Carter Center. Dr. Pastor said coming trade talks with the United States are likely to accelerate the investment flow. A possible danger: As demand for the peso helps improve its performance against the dollar, Mexico's exports could suffer. On an early December visit to Mexico, Dr. Pastor said, "I was surprised by how much more expensive things had become."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Why Stocks Make Sense Now

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Should you sink money into stocks this year? No way, most mutual fund investors would probably say. And with good reason: Many were badly burned in 1990, when the average stock fund lost more than 7 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds.
But sidestepping stocks would be a big mistake, experts say. Although most believe the market hasn't hit bottom -- many expect the Dow Jones industrial average to fall to about 2,100 by mid-year and some expect an even steeper drop -- the consensus among analysts is that there will be a recovery this year. And the biggest profits always are made in the early part of a bull market, when many investors are not invested in stocks. 
 For that reason, four investment advisers, asked by The New York Times to craft model portfolios for 1991, all included a good sampling of stock funds. In fact, some funds are favorites of more than one adviser: Brandywine Fund, Harbor International and the Gabelli Asset Fund.
Here's what the four advisers have to say.
 Kenneth E. Gregory, principal in the San Francisco-based money management firm Litman/Gregory, said he would put 60 percent of his holdings in intermediate-term bonds to avoid the risk in the stock market early this year and to reap capital gains from falling interest rates. Because of the recessionary environment, he would concentrate on high-quality bond funds. Two favorites: Vanguard Bond Market Fund and the PIMIT Total Return Trust. Top-bracket investors should consider tax-free bond funds, he said, and he likes the Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund Intermediate Term Portfolio.
The remaining 40 percent of the portfolio is evenly split between American and foreign stock funds. On the American side, he likes small-company stocks, which, battered for years, are now are as cheap as they've been since the mid-1970's. He would put half that money into growth funds, many of which have a small-company component. For aggressive investors, he recommends the Brandywine Fund; for conservatives, SteinRoe Special or Counsellors Capital Appreciation. The balance is split between a pure small-company fund, the Nicholas Limited Edition, and the Gabelli Asset Fund. On the foreign side, he likes Harbor International and the T. Rowe Price International Discovery Fund.
 He expects the stock market to near its bottom in the first quarter;that's when he would shift the allocation, putting 80 percent into stocks and leaving the balance in bonds.
Another investment adviser, Tom Bailard, chairman of Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, in San Mateo, Calif., would keep 10 percent in cash, "partly for safety and partly to shift over into equities." He would put it in the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund.
Mr. Bailard would put 45 percent into 15- to 20-year Treasury bonds, and likes the Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund Investment Grade Bond Portfolio. And 15 percent would go into international bonds.
Another 15 percent should go into American stocks; Mr. Bailard prefers the Vanguard Index Fund, and would move more money there late in the first quarter. The remaining 15 percent is split by the Vanguard World International Growth Fund (10 percent) and the Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio (5 percent), because REIT's, he says, have been "beaten through the pavement because of negative investor sentiment, but still yield 10 percent."
Kurt Brower, partner in Brower & Janachowski, San Francisco-based investment advisers, would put one-half of a conservative investor's portfolio into the Harbor Bond Fund. The balance is split between the Vanguard Equity-Income Fund, the Janus Fund and Gabelli Asset Fund.
He chose a different portfolio for investors willing to take more risk: half would go into the Brandywine Fund; the rest would be split between Harbor International, which he likes because it has very little invested in Germany and Japan, and the Robertson and Steven Emerging Growth Fund, a small-company fund that invests heavily in bio-technology and medical technology companies.
Marc O'Brien, a Cambridge, Mass.-based adviser, has a dimmer view of the 1991 markets than his colleagues. He warns investors to "readjust their expectations" and recommends a very conservative approach. He expects "recession, major bankruptcies and generally difficult economic times." For him, the theme is quality. He also focuses on income, invests in small-company stocks and keeps a sharp eye on fund expenses.
He said he would tiptoe into the market. He would begin the year with all his cash invested in the Scudder Short-Term Bond Fund, using that as "a temporary parking place." Then, every two months, he would shift one-sixth of the money into long-term funds. By year-end, investors following that formula would have equal amounts in Scudder's Short-Term and International Bond Funds; Wellesley Income, a high-quality bond portfolio; Ivy International; SBSF Growth Fund, a conservative growth-and-income fund, and Babson Enterprise, a small-company fund. Over all, the portfolio would be roughly split between stocks and bonds, and international and domestic investments.
 
WHEN BIG IS BEAUTIFUL
Conventional wisdom holds that after a growth fund gets too big, its managers cannot be quick enough on their feet to keep up the fund's performance. The huge asset base must be invested in too many different issues, the reasoning goes, and handling that much cash deftly is simply too hard.
That's not so, as the accompanying chart shows. Furthermore, the average five-year gain for the 25 largest growth funds is 11.9 percent, nearly two full percentage points more than the average for all growth funds, while the 25 smallest funds returned an average of 4.6 percent.
D. Tyler Jenks, director of research for Kanon Bloch Carre & Company, a Boston-based mutual fund consulting firm, concludes: "The average investor is actually pretty smart." In other words, the biggest funds are getting bigger because investors like the results.

HEADLINE: All About/Silver;
With the Price Right, the White Metal Heads for a Rebound

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
When the price of silver reached a momentary peak of $48.70 an ounce during the Hunt brothers' buying spree a decade ago, and averaged out in 1980 at a stratospheric $20-plus, manufacturers abandoned the precious metal in droves.
But since then, silver has fallen to about $4.20 an ounce, its lowest point since the late 1970's, and the metal is once more attractive, particularly in photography and electronics. Industry analysts estimate that global silver use by manufacturers climbed 2.3 percent last year to 480 million ounces, the most since 1976. They also estimate that 123 million ounces were used in the United States, the most in a decade. 
 Jewelers are hopping on the bandwagon as consumers find silver more affordable, certainly more affordable than gold. Even makers of silverware, an industry that nearly vanished, are saying that business is up.
Manufacturers are using silver more economically this time around. Makers of photographic film use more silver overall, but a bit less for each frame. Electronic equipment makers employ more silver as a conductor, while its use in computers has soared.
Producers, meanwhile, are still suffering. Many major silver-mining companies are losing money and curtailing production. Others, who mined silver as a sideline, are abandoning it altogether. Analysts anticipate further price declines before tightening supplies force a price uptick in 1992.
The largest American silver producer, Asarco Inc., mined 7.4 million ounces in 1989, followed by Nerco Inc., with 6.1 million ounces. Several foreign silver companies are larger, Industrias Penoles of Mexico holding the title of industry giant, with 23.7 million ounces in 1989. Next is MIM Holdings of Australia, with 13.9 million ounces.

 
 
At the Mines
Costs Are Down, But So Are Profits
 In most businesses, a company that cuts operating costs in than half would be profitable indeed. But Thomas Albanese, chief operating officer of the gold and silver mining subsidiary of Nerco Inc., has little to show for reducing his silver production costs from $8 an ounce in 1983 to $4 an ounce early last year. "The recent prices have been putting the silver mining industry into a fix," he said.
The decline in operating costs has been largely due to a mining technique known as heap leaching. Companies scoop ore from open-pit mines and then leach out the silver by applying potassium cyanide, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. This technique requires less labor and eliminates the need for costly underground mines.
But when silver sells for $4.20 an ounce, many mining companies turn to other metals. Two-thirds of the United States silver producers also unearth gold, copper or zinc. Mr. Albanese has been turning to gold. "That attention to other metals has helped our operations to be profitable," he said. "There really isn't much choice."
For producers with no alternatives, low prices have meant steep losses. Production costs for most silver miners fall between $4.75 and $5 an ounce -- yielding narrow profits at the average 1989 price of $5.50 an ounce and losses last year. "Globally, silver companies have lost hundreds of millions of dollars," said Jeffrey M. Christian, managing director of the CPM Group, a New York-based precious-metals consulting company.

 
 
Film and Flatware
Photography Is The Growth Focus
 In the United States, silver is most likely to be found not in bank vaults or table settings or jewelers' cases, but in rolls of film. Photography accounts for more than half of United States consumption, up from a third in the late 1970's. The amount of silver in each frame of film plunged 17 percent between 1978 and 1980.
Since then, it has risen, although not quite to the same levels as before the Hunts' heaviest buying. Americans take about 5 percent more pictures each year and doctors take more X-rays, accounting for about a third of all photographic silver use.
Silver demand in the dining room has seriously lagged that in the examining room. "Silver on the table is better than money in the bank," says Miss Manners, but few young families trying to make a downpayment on a house agree. Consumption of silver tableware in the United States fell from a peak of 44 million ounces in 1973 to an estimated 4 million ounces in 1990 -- down from 22 percent of total silver demand to 2.4 percent. Analysts note that young couples gave up throwing formal dinner parties illuminated by silver's glint. "Americans moved to a more informal lifestyle and silverware was seen as something from one's parents' generation," said Mr. Christian. "And when the price rose in the 1980's, that was another nail in the coffin." Of the leading American silvermakers -- once known as the Seven Sisters -- two have halted silverware production and the others have cut back sharply.
But some producers say that Americans are again beginning to buy silverware worthy of the name. "We're enjoying a resurgence," said Anthony D. LaChapelle, vice president of sales and marketing with the Reed & Barton Corporation, of Taunton, Mass., one of the country's oldest silverware makers. Mr. LaChapelle said that the company's sales, in ounces, were up nearly 10 percent in 1990.
One obvious source of stimulation: a four-piece place setting, which cost an average $400 in the early 1980's, goes for just $140 to $185 today. Then there is the revival of formal entertaining as the postwar generation ages. "There has been a return to traditionalism," Mr. LaChapelle said. "The Baby Boomers are now well educated and they are spending money on the home. And companies that make finer quality goods for the home have benefited."

 
 
New Applications
From Windshields To Computer Chips
 Although overall silver demand has diminished during the last 20 years, the metal has found new uses as its cost has declined. It is a very effective conductor of heat and electricity.
In 1986, the Ford Motor Company introduced an optional windshield for its Taurus that had a molecular layer of silver laminated between the layers of glass. Heating the silver layer cleared the windshield of frost and ice within two minutes. Now many American models and some of the Japanese offer the silver-lined windshields as standard equipment.
Silver films are increasingly common in microelectronics. There, they are replacing $90-an-ounce palladium, which once had an exclusive role in connecting silicon chips on circuit boards for computer and other equipment. And silver plating is showing up in more electrical uses, like contacts in switches. In these applications, it is copper that is displaced. "Manufacturers are finding the cost is no longer prohibitive and that silver is a better conductor," said Mr. Christian of the CPM Group.
John Lutley, executive director of the Silver Institute in Washington, says that the white metal might become the primary conducting material if superconductors, which carry electricity with little resistance, become viable. For superconductors, "any commercial use is probably a decade away," he said. "But silver is one of the few materials that can be used successfully with that technology."
 
 
COINS FOR REMEMBRANCE
 For decades, a silver dime, quarter, half-dollar or dollar was really silver. But by 1964, the metal's price had risen to the point that the silver was worth more than a coin's face value. The United States mint turned to copper and nickel as the principal metals instead.
Several European nations still use silver for their standard, circulating coinage. But other nations have begun minting silver coins intended primarily as investments. So far, the largest such issues have come from the United States, which accounts for about a quarter of the world's silver demand for this purpose. Canada is the second-largest issuer, West Germany third.
Silver investors buy the coinage primarily as a hedge against inflation. And demand for it has grown in the United States from 1.8 million ounces in 1982, when prices came down with a thump, to 6.8 million ounces in 1989.
The United States Eagle and the Canadian Maple Leaf have come to account for about three-quarters of demand from small investors, according to the Silver Institute, a trade group in Washington.. In some states, investors who buy official coinage are exempted from paying taxes on their purchases.
Commemorative silver coins have also become increasingly popular, feeding the fortunes of private operators, like th Franklin Mint, as well as Washington's coffers. The United States itself has issued coins for the 1976 Bicentennial, the 1984 Olympic Games and the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty. Next will come issues for the centennial of Mount Rushmore, the 40th anniversary of the Korean War and the 1992 Olympics.
The prices of the official coinage varies with the cost of silver, the size of an issue and, of course, investor demand. The Eagle, one ounce, now costs slightly less than $10. Appreciation is the general rule, but those who stocked up when the Hunt brothers were investing are almost certainly stuck with a loss.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Are Computer Safety Laws Taking the Right Tack?

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors last month passed an ordinance that will require larger businesses in the city to pay more attention to the health and safety consequences of using computers in the workplace. The legislation, which Mayor Art Agnos signed after some last-minute compromises, is being heralded by labor unions as a model for other cities and counties.
The health issues of computer use in the office, including radiation from video display terminals, job stress and repetitive motion disorders, are likely to receive widespread attention in the coming decade. Tens of millions of computer workers will enter the job force, joining tens of millions of current computer users who will be getting older. 
 "In the 90's, with the aging of the Baby Boom generation, there will be a lot more people entering their 40's, and that's when you start seeing increases in wear-and-tear injuries," said Rani Lueder, president of Humanics Inc., an ergonomics consulting company in Encino, Calif. "There is also a cumulative effect from a number of years of exposure to automation." Ms. Lueder and other critics say that although the measures adopted in San Francisco may help reduce the physical ailments of computer users, they do little to address what may be a greater cause of computer-related injuries: the increasingly stressful workplace.
The San Francisco legislation is similar to a law passed in Suffolk County, N.Y., in 1988 that was struck down by a state court on the ground that only the state had the authority to make such law. Because the San Francisco law was negotiated with the business community, however, perhaps no legal challenge will be mounted.
Neither the San Francisco nor Suffolk County laws directly addressed the issue of video display terminal radiation, which is being investigated as a possible factor in increased cases of some types of cancer and pregnancy problems. Rather, the San Francisco law focuses on repetitive motion injuries, eye strain, headaches, general malaise and other neuromuscular ailments that are believed to be caused by extended computer use.
The San Francisco law requires the use of adjustable chairs and tables, lighting, angle-adjustable screens and keyboards, work time at tasks away from the computer, training of workers and supervisors and the use of printer covers to reduce office noise.
 In general, the law affects any business with 15 or more daily employees, and those employees who spend more than half their working hours at a computer terminal.
Business owners and business associations opposed the San Francisco bill, as they had the Suffolk bill, because of the perceived high cost of buying new tables, chairs, light fixtures and other equipment. Supporters of the measure say businesses pay even more for the lost work time, higher medical bills and lost productivity that the current environment brings.
Under the compromises reached by business leaders and Mayor Agnos late last year, companies have 30 months to refit existing work stations to comply with the law, but no company is required to spend more than $250 per work station. All new work stations installed after this year must comply with the law, regardless of cost.
Repetitive motion injuries of the sort associated with computer use are among the fastest-growing categories of workplace injuries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. They accounted for 18 percent of all workplace injuries in 1981, the year the International Business Machines Corporation introduced the first I.B.M. PC. The percentage rose to 52 percent in 1989, by which time there were some 40 million personal computers in use. The bureau reported 28 percent more repetitive motion injuries in 1989, the latest year for which figures were available, than in the year before.
Although repetitive stress injuries are also associated with many assembly-line jobs where people perform one task over and over, some office workplace researchers feel that hand and wrist problems caused by use of computer terminals may be a much larger problem.
The most frequently cited ailments among computer users are carpal tunnel syndrome and wrist tendonitis; the most common victims are secretaries, telephone operators, data entry clerks, airline reservation workers and journalists.
The affliction is caused when wrist and hand tendons are stressed repeatedly without sufficient time to recover. Over time it can become debilitating, causing pain so great that some workers resort to surgery or leave their jobs.
 Some ergonomics researchers fault the approach taken in San Francisco, saying that simply buying adjustable furniture may do little to help people who suffer from those ailments.
"Like other VDT laws it is inadvertently designed to sell products and services rather than protect VDT users," said Bert Dumpe of Ergotec, a nonprofit office ergonomics association in Arlington, Va.
Ms. Lueder of Humanics added: "I don't know of a single study that has found that ergonomic furniture or adjustable VDT workstands will prevent carpal tunnel syndrome or improve it in any way."
Increasing workplace stress, she said, rather than ill-fitting furniture, is the probable cause of most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. "Computer use is becoming a lot more stressful than it used to be," she said. "The technology is pushing people more than ever before. At a phone company I visited recently, for example, they keep adding new software systems that make people spend more time on the job and intensify the work."
The stress is exacerbated, she said, by the current recession, which has caused many computer workers to fear for their jobs.
Another problem is that most workers do not take advantage of the adjustable furniture when it is provided. "In a study at Ontario Hydro in Canada, they found that only 5 percent of the adjustable furniture had ever been adjusted, and that only 12 percent of the workers even knew it was adjustable," Ms. Lueder said.
The San Francisco ordinance calls for workplace education to inform computer users about health issues of computers. All employees are to be given training on proper use of computers, adjustable furniture and lighting, foot and wrist rests, and other work station equipment.
In the end, though, the best defenses against computer-related ailments are low tech or no tech. Frequent short rest breaks are better than infrequent long ones for people doing computer work. Other advice from experts: get plenty of rest and exercise, do not smoke, lose weight, sit up straight and learn to manage stress. And workers who hammer away at the keyboard are more likely to injure themselves than those who type lightly and smoothly.

Doing Business in Hard Times

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS; Deborah L. Jacobs is a Brooklyn-based business writer.

 BODY:
Lawrence Caplan knew it was time to diversify when he noticed a decline in orders for poached salmon and a new appreciation for turkey sandwiches.
 Mr. Caplan, whose New York business, Berkeley Caterers, once catered $30-a-head lunches at law firms, advertising agencies and investment banks, shifted gears in 1989. He began by renting party equipment to companies that preferred to do the work themselves. Last summer, he added a sideline: a discount supply company that offers everything from beverages to Band-Aids. 
 "When income declines, you look for other ways to generate income," he said. Adding sidelines has enabled Berkeley to compensate for a 20 percent drop in its food business since the 1987 stock market tumble, he said.
 As large corporations trim their budgets for everything from legal fees to office temporaries, service companies that once helped with the workload or provided the extras find profits sagging. To survive, many are cutting overhead and offering discounts. But the ones most likely to thrive, economists and management consultants say, are the strategists: those able to shift emphasis in services they already offer, or introduce new sidelines to replace segments of the business that have gone flat. The ability to take advantage of changing opportunities can spell the difference between bankruptcy and success.
Perhaps the best test cases of business flexibility are in the Northeast, where the service industry -- long driven by Wall Street -- has been battered since the 1987 market crash. After adding an average of 16,400 jobs a year to the New York economy between 1982 and 1987, business and professional services have nearly stalled, and are now adding only 2,600 new jobs a year, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Virtually every service is affected.
 Many law firms, hit hard by declining work in real estate and mergers and acquisitions, are moving into burgeoning fields like bankruptcy and environmental law. Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler built an instant bankruptcy department in July by acquiring a small firm of bankruptcy specialists, Levin & Weintraub, Crames & Edelman. "Each week we get another major company either on the verge of bankruptcy or going into Chapter 11," said Peter Fishbein, chairman of Kaye, Scholer's executive committee. "The biggest challenge is to reprogram our lawyers and reallocate our resources."
When Richard Ross, president of the New York firm TempsAmerica, saw his business threatened by the growing popularity of in-house temporary services, he began offering a seminar on how to start an in-house temporary pool. "This is the time when you have to come up with other services to stay competitive," he said.
 The MAC Group, a management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., has compensated for less work for financial institutions by increasing revenues from overseas, said Scott Parker, a managing director. KPMG Peat Marwick, the big diversified accounting firm, faced with a drop in mergers and acquisitions, is emphasizing services in cost containment, capital raising and credit, said Steven Roberts, a partner.
 Unfazed by the dwindling job market for young attorneys, Kerry Lutz founded Lutz Legal Services to help lawyers collect delinquent accounts. "As the recession kicks in and more and more judgments get entered and fewer of them get paid, there's more and more need for the service we provide," he said.
Bill Herz, a New York magician specializing in corporate events, is expecting his best year ever in 1991. "I'm a cheap alternative" to laser shows and ski resort weekends, said Mr. Herz, who charges $1,000 or more for a performance. He says one of his most popular tricks these days is turning a one dollar bill into a $100 bill.
To keep the money coming in, many service businesses -- including advertising and accounting agencies and public relations firms -- are slashing rates and offering volume discounts to loyal clients. Service firms must "figure out new methods to provide the same service at less cost," said Philip Kotler, professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
 
GETTING AWAY FROM THE FRILLS
Wendeen H. Eolis, who heads the New York-based legal search firm, W. H. Eolis International Inc., has been in business for 22 years and has weathered other recessions. She can deal with a drop in revenues but not in profits, she said, so she has been trying to cut overhead.
Ms. Eolis now audits her books to focus on a different business expense each month. She said she has cut her annual advertising budget by more than $100,000 and saved 35 percent on stationery by switching suppliers. Instead of expensive "power lunches" she substitutes breakfast meetings or invites clients to her office. Streamlined cocktail parties have replaced dinners she once hosted. "We're running lean and mean and being mindful about getting away from the 80's frills," she said. "It's like being anointed with a renewed humility."
These are some other steps she recommends to cut overhead:
* Negotiate discounts with caterers by offering to entertain at their least busy times.
* Request winter discounts for office landscaping.
* Use several different long-distance telephone carriers, taking advantage of each one's favorable rates for calling cards and special calling plans.
* Self-insure office equipment and appliances, rather than buy service contracts.

HEADLINE: Hard Edges Aside, Manhattan Still Lures the Ambitious

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
After months of persuasion, Sylvia Laniado, a recruiter for an advertising agency, convinced Bonnie Brainin, a talented copywriter from Connecticut, to set aside her fears about crime in Manhattan and take the train into the city for a job interview.
In the short walk to Ms. Laniado's office from Grand Central Terminal, Ms. Brainin's wallet was stolen from her purse. "She spent the first half hour of the interview on the phone with the police and the credit card companies reporting the theft," recalled Ms. Laniado. "Needless to say, it was not exactly the best way to start the interview." 
 While such stories abound, recruiters and corporate human resources executives are divided as to whether the perception that the quality of life in New York City has steadily deteriorated has made it harder to lure talented workers to the city.
And when job candidates balk, it is far more often because of the high cost of housing in the area, rather than the high rate of crime, according to experts. The New York City area is the third most expensive in the country, after San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm in Rochester, Wis.
For many job seekers, however, the unique attractions of the New York City job market continue to outweigh the well-publicized problems. However one may feel about $1,000-a-month studio apartments or the possibility of being mugged or knifed on a subway platform, for those who aspire to work at a certain level in fields like finance, communications, advertising and the arts, a job in New York at some point seems all but mandatory.
"If you want to be in the big leagues, frequently you don't have that much of a choice," said Martin H. Bauman, an executive recruiter. "There are certain industries that if you are not in New York, you probably have not arrived."
"For people who want to do finance, Mecca is Mecca," said Mark Bieler, executive vice president of human resources for Bankers Trust.
Many recruiters say that it has always been difficult to attract outsiders into the city and that it is not getting harder.
"We don't see any difference in our ability to attract people into New York," said Mr. Bieler of Bankers Trust, adding, "I can't recall the last time that New York was a significant impediment to a hire.".
Some experts say that the faltering economy and the large number of unemployed executives have made New York -- or any location -- less of an issue. "It is just getting so hard to get a job, the desirability of the venue is less important," said Theodore Erikson, a recruiter with Canny Bowen Inc. "There is a hierarchy of needs. When you are unemployed and you've been unemployed for a while, you'd move to Alaska."
But others detect a growing resistance to relocating to New York. "Is it getting more difficult to attract people to New York? "Yes, it is," said Karen N. Gerard, a vice president with the management consulting firm, Moran, Stahl & Boyer.
Ms. Gerard, a deputy mayor during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, said the city has gone through cycles when it was hard to bring people in. She said the back-to-the-land movement that began in the 1960's soured a generation of young people on the idea of life in Manhattan. "This isn't the first time there has been a disillusionment with the Big Apple," she said.
But Ms. Gerard calls the growing distaste for New York "pretty serious" compared with earlier down cycles.
Martin H. Bauman, an executive recruiter, said, "It has been getting harder every year" to attract people to the city.
Carol A. Filippi, a relocation specialist for Time Inc. Magazines, a division of Time Warner, said, "It certainly is getting harder, because of the high cost of the whole New York area." Ms. Filippi said that high housing costs and long commutes, not crime, were the most frequent objections to New York.
The slump in the Northeast has made housing slightly more affordable in the metropolitan area, but house prices are still among the highest in the country. Rents for some types of apartments have dropped recently, too, but not as fast or as much as other housing prices. While there is no hard data on resistance to moving into New York, Ms. Gerard and others said corporations are encountering the most problems in filling middle-level management jobs.
"Companies are not getting their first choice," said Ms. Gerard. "I've heard people in this region say, 'Our problem is we can't bring people in and we can't get the quality of people we want,' " she said. More and more middle-level jobs are going to the No. 2 or No. 3 choice or being filled locally, she said.
Mr. Bauman said he detects a definite resistance to moving to New York for jobs below the $200,000 level. Senior executives are paid enough that they can avoid many of the city's most corrosive elements.
Senior-level appointments are still readily filled because corporations are willing to pay whatever it takes to hire the person they feel is best suited for the job, employment experts say.
Larry Materi, a veteran banker, recently switched jobs, leaving his employer of 10 years rather than accept a transfer to New York. Mr. Materi worked in Cleveland for a Canadian bank that decided to close its office there and move it to New York. After extensive discussions with his wife, Mr. Materi, joined a different bank in Chicago.
"We felt it would have been difficult on our family life," he said of a move to New York. Mr. Materi has two children and was concerned about the long hours he would be away from the house commuting. He now commutes from a suburb of Chicago, but "At least I get home and have dinner with my kids and read them a story before they go to bed."
Ms. Gerard said companies could do more counseling and education to help overcome reluctance about moving to New York. A division of American Express is putting together an orientation program for the 60 to 80 top-ranked business students the company recruits each year.
Margaret Gagliardi, a senior vice president at the American Express Travel Related Services Company said, "We are going to make an effort to try to get at some of the options that people have when they consider working in New York." While the program is still being planned, it will probably include sessions on buying versus renting, the suburbs versus the city and perhaps even a talk on how to make friends.
"The M.B.A. market is an incredibly competitive market," said Ms. Gagliardi. "You hate to lose capable individuals because of misconceptions that they might have about New York."
Neither Ms. Gagliardi nor Ms. Laniado who works in advertising, have detected an increase in resistance to moving to New York. However, Ms. Laniado said New Yorkers are now far more willing than they were in the past to entertain and accept offers from the hinterlands.
New York salaries are significantly higher than those in other parts of the country. For transfers, many companies grant cost-of-living increases. Some companies offer interest-free loans for housing, help with day care and private school costs. Companies will pay for "anything that's legal" to attract top executives," said Mr. Bauman.
Others note that employees are becoming less willing to relocate to any city. "People are getting much more selective in making a move," said Linda K. Stroh, of Loyola University in Chicago, who was a co-author of a recent study on relocation. The changing demographics of the labor forces -- more women in the work force, single-parent families and dual-career couples, for example -- are having an impact on workers' willingness to relocate. The study found that employees in 1989 were far more negative about the benefits of moving than were employees questioned in 1978.
Despite such feelings, Mr. Bauman said he has found that many outsiders' misgivings about New York quickly dissipate. "It's hard to get people into New York," he said. "It's even harder to get them out."

HEADLINE: A Gift Certificate to Pampering

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
As women in white coats peered at his pores, Kenneth Levine, a 34-year-old clothing company executive, lay under a sheet in a small, dim, clinic-like room last Thursday. Cotton pads covered his eyes and his feet, in black tasseled loafers, stuck out of the sheet. His chin was being painted with a mask of mud and sufhur that felt, he said, initially like good old shaving cream.
Mr. Levine, whose skin-care regimen was a splash of after-shave lotion, was having his first facial. "My wife gave me a gift certificate for the holidays and I gave her a tennis racquet," he said, waving freshly manicured hands in electrically heated mitts, "but this is much more relaxing." 
 "Sometimes they fall asleep," said Astrid Bedrossian, director of technical services at Georgette Klinger salons. "Sometimes they snore," a facialist, Gabrielle Eniou, said.
Leaving the Men's Clinic, on the Spa Level of the Klinger salon at 978 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, Mrs. Bedrossian drifted along the white corridors, looking in on other recipients of holiday gift certificates. Thanks to loved ones, they were having scalp treatments, exercise lessons, nutritional counseling, all sorts of services meant to make them look and feel better.
In an ideal world, they might all be at Main Chance or Golden Door. They might be taking the waters at Baden Baden. But at this Klinger salon, a so-called urban spa on the scenic Upper East Side, the philosophy is, Mrs. Bedrossian said, "If you can't get away for four days, five hours will do."
Miss Klinger herself was away on vacation in Arizona. But Anne Thompson, the company's vice president for sales, said that the 74-year-old dean of skin care would be back soon to celebrate her 50th anniversary in business. Meanwhile, how about a low-calorie, low-cholesterol lunch like the one served during the $260 Day of Beauty or, in the case of male clients, the $205 Day of Caring.
Trays of green salad, mineral water and herbal tea appeared. Mrs. Thompson sank back on a white leather banquette and talked about business during tough
times. Sales figures at Klinger salons in New York and five other cities around the country were up about 10 percent for the last quarter of 1990, she said, compared with the same period for 1989.
"We had an enormous gift certificate business this year," Mrs. Thompson said, peeking from a wide-brimmed black hat. "Despite the recession people still want an updated makeup or hair style, to feel a bit pampered or to relax after the stress of the holidays."
Catching a bracing whiff of peppermint oil, Mrs. Bedrossian came upon the mummy-like figure of Conni Weissman. Only Mrs. Weissman's tanned face, diamond studs gleaming at the ears, was visible. She had just returned from a month in St. Martin where, she said, she had employed liberal quantities of the salon's No. 15 sun block and achieved a healthy tan. Mrs. Bedrossian looked pleased.
Enveloped in towels saturated with essential oils, Mrs. Weissman was having a body treatment to rid the skin of toxins. It was part of a Day of Beauty, a Christmas present from her husband. "It's a great gift,although right now I'm having a very strange sensation, almost like suffocating," Mrs. Weissman said. "I'm sure it's just temporary."
Mrs. Bedrossian nodded and moved on to Hilary Schaffner, whose 12-year-old face was aglow from the special Facial for Teen-agers, given on the Clinic Level. "I consider this a wonderful luxury," said Hilary, a seventh grader at Brearley School. She was holding a small bag of Klinger cleansing products and beaming at her mother, Cynthia Schaffner.
As they prepared to leave, a facialist appeared, asking if Hilary wanted just a smidgeon of blue eye shadow. Eye shadow was part of the package. Hilary glanced at Mrs. Schaffner who said perhaps in a year or so.
Eye shadow was in order for 25-year-old Gigi McHugh. A private school teacher and freelance sportswriter, she was having a makeup lesson on the Salon Level. "My mom gave me the facial and the makeup," she said, staring into the mirror and fluffing her hair, "and one of my ex-student's parents gave me the haircut."
Miss McHugh's gift certificate also entitled her to lunch. To save time, though, she decided to dine on raw carrots while, a makeup artist, Richard Downs taught her to twirl a mascara wand like an expert.
"This is the best gift," she said, carrot stick in one hand, mascara in the other. "There's no point in getting stuff for Christmas if you don't feel good. If you look good, you feel good."

HEADLINE: Kean at Drew: Economics and Bikes

 BODY:
In "For Kean, Drew Has Become a Laboratory for His Ideas" (Nov. 18), former Gov. Thomas Kean is quoted as saying: "One thing Keynesian and supply-side economists agree upon is that raising taxes in a falling economy is a mistake. I hope that if the economy continues to drop, the current administration will find some way to readjust the taxes."
Mr. Kean is in serious error here. The liberty to run a deficit (financed with debt) belongs only to the Federal Government, which can, in ultimate distress, fund its debt by printing money. States do not have that liberty because their debt is not regarded as being free of default risk.
If the Florio administration were to "readjust the taxes," it would also have to cut expenditures by an equal amount. This confronts the question of how much collective expenditures the electorate wants.
The distinction between Federal and state fiscal freedom is important and is one that anyone with Potomac fever would do well to understand. It is to be hoped that Mr. Kean will not teach economics at Drew.

HEADLINE: Tungsram's Track Record in Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "Running on Fast-Forward in Budapest," Dec. 16, which described the joint venture between General Electric and Tungsram, a Hungarian firm specializing in electric lighting, it may be of interest that, between the two World Wars, Tungsram created, in addition to its manufacturing facilities, one of the strongest research laboratories in Europe.
The discoveries made and developed in this lab were patented by Tungsram and are the basis of its leading position in the industrial world. One of these discoveries by the distinguished physicist Imre Brody was the krypton incandescent lamp. (His great contributions did not save Mr. Brody and his family from being murdered by Nazis in 1944.)
After the war, Tungsram continued its high-quality basic and applied industrial research. Apparently there are organizations that not even Communism can destroy.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Philippines Set For New Talks on Bases

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
A deal on a new military basing agreement between the United States and the Philippines will probably not be reached before a Jan. 31 deadline imposed by President Corazon C. Aquino, negotiators for both sides say. But they are convinced that a deal will be struck before the old agreement expires on Sept. 16.
The fourth round of negotiations on the future of the six American bases are scheduled to resume on Jan. 8. Previous rounds have been marked by intricate discussions of who, in any new deal, will cut the grass on the bases, run the taxis and deliver the mail; whose currency and driver's licenses will be used; who will profit from the fast-food restaurants, and whose courts will have jurisdiction on sensitive cases. 
 But more basic questions remain unresolved, too: the duration of a new agreement, how much it will cost and whether it will be cast as a treaty, requiring ratification by the United States Senate.
"We're in a bleak period on the bases," a senior Western diplomat said. "But the makings of a settlement and its outlines have been identified. A deal is doable and defensible in both countries. But to satisfy the demands for real drama here, you need to fail to meet your deadline."
 
'Need for Theatrics'
 A senior Asian diplomat who follows the talks closely said similarly: "This is the Philippines, and the need for theatrics and dramatic crisis must be satisfied in order to prove that a deal everyone knows is coming has been in fact a great accomplishment and has humbled the Americans."
The Americans want a 10- to 12-year phased reduction of the their military presence here, after which the two main bases at issue, Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base, could be available on a pay-per-use basis, as in Singapore.
The Americans have already announced the withdrawal by September of all fighter planes and 1,800 military personnel stationed at Clark.
"We no longer need big chunks of real estate and all the trappings of ownership," the senior Western diplomat said. "We need access to places where we can do what we need to do."
The Americans want to preserve warehousing for predeployment, regular visits, training facilities, ship repair, military resupply and a few other functions, including the maintenance of a counterterrorist unit.
 
Range of Philippine Views
 The Philippine side embraces a range of views from Health Secretary Alfredo Bengzon, who calls in public for the Americans to leave in September, to Foreign Secretary Raul S. Manglapus, who says Manila's position is for a 5- to 7-year treaty to allow for a sensible transition, at the end of which the Americans will leave.
The Filipinos have talked about separate arrangements for Subic, with the other bases coming under complete Filipino control after September. But Manila has since backed away from demanding full operational control over Clark, in large part because the Philippine military says it has neither the trained personnel or the budget to handle the task.
Mr. Bengzon complained during the last round, in mid-November, that the Philippine panel was feeling pressure from Aquino officials responsible for the economy and from the military.
About 70,000 Filipinos are employed at the bases, which house about 16,000 American troops and add about $1 billion a year to the local economy.
Filipino negotiators acknowledge that the country's severe economic problems have helped make a new agreement much more likely. They say an American departure would further distress needed foreign investors, who are already shying away because of political instabilty.
While the Philippine Senate has been critical of the American bases in the past and must ratify a new deal, Manila officials are confident that an agreement that is construed as a final phase-out of the American presence will win the necessary two-thirds vote.
 
Philippine Pride Cited
 American negotiators, for their part, complain that the Philippine side appears to be divided and seems unwilling to negotiate specifics in an orderly way. But these complaints both amuse and annoy the Filipinos, who are very sensitive to perceived slights by their former colonial masters.
"It's contentious, and there's a large measure of pride at stake," a Filipino negotiator said. "The Americans can't conceive that we really want them out. So we argue about who mans the gate and who cuts the grass. It may not be entirely rational on the Filipino side, but it goes to the heart of sovereignty."
"We own it, and we want to cut the grass," the Filipino said. "The Americans say, 'But you're not into maintenance, you won't cut the grass.' And so we actually said, 'O.K., we'll get some goats, and they'll cut the grass every day!' "
"We are not unreasonable allies," the Filipino continued, "and we understand the global role of the U.S. All they need to do is ask permission. Access is O.K."

HEADLINE: CRIME OVERWHELMS PRETORIA'S POLICE

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Before dawn on Christmas Day, a gang of youths raided a Salvation Army home sheltering teen-age girls in the black township of Soweto.
The gang members, who nicknamed themselves the Zebra Force, beat the night watchman unconscious, stabbed a matron who tried to stop them, smashed windows and beds, stole Christmas presents, food and money and abducted eight girls who were gang-raped. 
 The attack evoked the kind of public outrage around Johannesburg that the assault on a woman who was jogging in Central Park in New York City prompted last year -- but with a difference.
Residents of Soweto's Mopholo and Phomolong districts, where the attacks took place, had little confidence in the police, who reportedly took an hour to respond to the shelter's call for help.
So they assembled a posse of men who tracked down 11 gang members and delivered them to the police station. Eleven more gang members are being pursued in connection with the attacks.
 
Upsurge in Common Crime
 Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok warned against vigilantism even as he congratulated the Sowetans for public spiritedness. But last weekend, he promised that 10,000 more police officers would be patrolling streets around the country by next June as part of an aggressive anti-crime campagaign.
Mr. Vlok was responding to a broad surge in crime that the police has been unable to stem. South Africa reported nearly 3,500 deaths in politically motivated violence in 1990.
But even more people were victims of savage mayhem motivated by profit. About 13,000 South Africans were slain in 1990, an increase of 25 percent over 1989, and the police reported similar rises in rape, assault and robbery.
Criminals once content to hijack cars have begun shooting the drivers.
 
Attacks on the Elderly
 In Soweto on Christmas Eve, a Johannesburg businessman who drove two employees home was slain at a traffic light by a gang who wanted his car. Nineteen days earlier, a woman was gunned down in front of her home in Morningside, an affluent Johannesburg suburb, and her vehicle was stolen. A motorist near Durban was fatally shot when he tried to protect his car.
Attacks on the elderly rose more than 30 percent in the first six months of 1990 over the corresponding period in 1989.
In Pretoria, an elderly couple were stabbed and strangled in their home last month and in northern Durban, an 84-year-old man was suffocated by robbers.
Muggings in downtown Johannesburg have reached such "intolerable proportions" that tourism is threatened, Spencer Thomas, executive director of the South African Tourism Board, told the Johannesburg newspaper The Star.
Critics of the Government attribute the jump in crime to a perception, especially in the black townships, that the police are more inclined to protect the state and unjust laws than citizens. They also say unemployment and inferior education have made criminals of black youths who cannot find another way to live.
 
Armed Security Guards
 The police contend that the African National Congress and its allies, by encouraging protests and destabilization, have promoted an anarchic climate in which crime flourishes.
At least 91 policemen were killed in the line of duty in 1990, 65 of them in political unrest, according to Mr. Vlok's office, and 1 of every 10 officers was wounded.
The South African police, half of whose 75,000 members are nonwhites, are viewed as undermanned.
The police are seen patrolling so infrequently that whites, who live with high walls and burglar alarms, routinely hire armed security guards to protect their homes and businesses, giving South Africa four times as many private security guards as police officers.
Whites are also buying firearms. As of a year ago, 1.1 million South Africans had permits for 2.7 million firearms. In other words, one in two white families owned at least one firearm, and gun ownership is expected to soar this year.
Residents of black townships cannot afford such protection. A Soweto resident said the only recourse in a mugging was to report the crime later at the police station.
 
Crime and Apartheid
 Criminals are also more heavily armed. More than 7,700 firearms were stolen from owners last year. And AK-47 assault rifles, smuggled in from Mozambique, are now common in robberies.
The police reported that 385 people were killed or wounded in 1,083 robberies in Johannesburg in 1990.
The rising crime rate could erode white tolerance for the dismantling of apartheid that President F. W. de Klerk has undertaken, because most crimes of violence are committed by blacks. But as the attack on the Salvation Army shelter illustrated, blacks are also the most frequent victims.
As a result, black sympathy has increased for the African National Congress's proposal to form self-defense units in the townships.
Kgabisi Manunkutu, a spokesman for the Soweto Civic Association, said the gang raid on the Salvation Army shelter showed that "the people can't fold their arms and wait for the police to protect them against criminals."

HEADLINE: Editors' Note

 BODY:
An article in The Week in Review last Sunday headed "It Isn't Just a Downturn, It's the Bill for the 1980's" discussed fears that structural weaknesses in the United States economy could contribute to a serious recession. The article ended with a description of what the country had learned about preventing such factors from leading to a depression.
Through an editing oversight, the final paragraph, dealing with the prospect of war, included revisions on which the writer was not consulted;they did not accurately convey his meaning. 
 The writer did not mean to say that if there was a consensus of American economists it would probably be that if war was deemed unavoidable, the nation should go all out to win it. He intended to say that while peace would clearly be bullish for the economy and a long war would inflict a severe economic blow on the United States, no one knew the costs, benefits and further consequences of even a short war.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Text of the Radio Address by the President

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Following is the text of the radio address by President Bush today, as issued by the White House: 
 As the new year begins, new challenges unfold -- challenges to America and the future of our world. Simply put: 1990 saw Iraq invade and occupy Kuwait. 1991 will see Iraq withdraw, preferably by choice; by force, if need be. It is my most sincere hope 1991 is a year of peace. I've seen the hideous face of war and counted the costs of conflict in friends lost. I remember this all too well, and have no greater concern than the well-being of our men and women stationed in the Persian Gulf. True, their morale is sky-high. True, if they are called upon to fight the aggressors, they will do their job courageously, professionally and, in the end, decisively. There will be no more Vietnams.
But we should go the extra mile before asking our servicemen and women to stand in harm's way. We should, and we have. The United Nations, with the full support of the United States, has already tried to peacefully pressure Iraq out of Kuwait, implementing economic sanctions, and securing the condemnation of the world in the form of no less than 12 resolutions of the U.N. Security Council.
This week, we've taken one more step. I have offered to have Secretary of State James Baker meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Switzerland. yesterday, we received word that Iraq has accepted our offer to meet in Geneva.
 
 Baker's Message
 This will not be secret diplomacy at work. Secretary Baker will restate, in person, a message for Saddam Hussein: Withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally and immediately, or face the terrible consequences.
Eleven days from today, Saddam Hussein will either have met the United Nations deadline for a full and unconditional withdrawal, or he will have once again defied the civilized world. This is a deadline for Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations resolution, not a deadline for our own Armed Forces. Still, time is running out. It's running out because each day that passes brings real costs.
Saddam already poses a strategic threat to the capital cities of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and Syria, as well as our own men and women in the gulf region. In fact, Saddam has used chemical weapons of mass destruction against innocent villagers, his own people. Each day that passes brings Saddam Hussein further on the path to developing biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them. If Saddam corners the world energy market, he can then finance further aggression, terror and blackmail. Each day that passes increases Saddam's worldwide threat to democracy.
 
 Economic Effects
 The struggling newborn democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America already face a staggering challenge in making the transition to a free market. But the added weight of higher oil prices is a crushing burden they cannot afford. And our own economy is suffering, suffering the effects of higher oil prices and lower growth stemming from Saddam's aggression.
Each day that passes, Saddam's forces also fortify and dig in deeper into Kuwait. We risk paying a higher price in the most precious currency of all -- human life -- if we give Saddam more time to prepare for war. And each day that passes is another day of fear, suffering and terror for the people of Kuwait, many who risked their lives to shelter and hide Americans from Iraqi soldiers. As the Emir of Kuwait said to our Vice President just last week, those who advocate waiting longer for sanctions to work do not have to live under such brutal occupation.
As I have discussed with members of Congress, just two days ago and in our many other consultations, economic sanctions are taking a toll, but they are still not forcing Saddam out of Kuwait. Nor do we know when or even if they will be successful. As a result, America and her partners in this unprecedented coalition are sharing the burden of this important mission; and we are ready to use force to defend a new order emerging among the nations of the world, a world of sovereign nations living in peace.
 
 Forces at the Front
 We have seen too often in this century how quickly any threat to one becomes a threat to all. At this critical moment in history, at a time the cold war is fading into the past, we cannot fail. At stake is not simply some distant country called Kuwait. At stake is the kind of world we will inhabit.
Last Thanksgiving, I broke bread with some of our men and women on the front lines. They understand why we are in Saudi Arabia, and what we may have to do. I witnessed courage unfazed by the closeness of danger and determination undiminished by the harsh desert sun. These men and women are America's finest. We owe each of them our gratitude and full support. That is why we must all stand together, not as Republicans or Democrats, conservatives or liberals, but as Americans.

HEADLINE: Strapped, Big Cities Take Painful Steps

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 5

 BODY:
With chronic deficits, ruined credit and little sympathy from state officials, Philadelphia is in the worst fiscal shape of any big American city. But many other cities are in trouble, too, and around the nation the steps mayors are taking to keep their budgets afloat are burdening residents and in some cases making government more efficient, officials in 40 of the nation's largest cities said in interviews.
The steps are often painful, and elected officials acknowledge that how they manage them will probably affect their political futures. 
 Many cities have had to raise taxes and fees, but other measures that have been adopted are as different as the cities themselves. Philadelphia put off buying pants for graduates of its police academy. Virginia Beach stopped buying library books. New York and Baltimore are closing firehouses. San Francisco stopped a therapy program for mental patients.
"Across the land, it's just harder times than usual," said Mayor Maynard Jackson of Atlanta, who has not yet announced how he will manage a $9 million revenue shortage this year.
 
'A Death Spiral'
 As the nation slides toward recession, tax revenue at all levels of government are dropping below projections, leaving growing gaps between what cites are collecting and spending. Many cities have been pushed to the limit. "Cities have raised property taxes, lowered services and only the poor can't move to the suburbs," said Frank H. Shafroth, director of government relations for the National League of Cities in Washington. "Cities are caught in a death spiral."
But not everyone holds that view. Daniel J. Mitchell, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington, said the worsening financial condition of the cities offers opportunities to improve management, like having private contractors perform services like garbage collection.
"Many cities still have bloated work forces and they still haven't privatized enough services even though it has been demonstrated in city after city that the private sector does some jobs much more cheaply than the cities," Mr. Mitchell said.
Chicago recently began hiring private contractors for services like trash recycling, vehicle towing and building maintenance to help eliminate an anticipated $75 million shortage in its $3.2 billion budget for this fiscal year. "It used to cost us $25 to tow a car, but now that we privatized towing, they pay us $25 to tow every car," said Avis LaVelle, press secretary to Mayor Richard M. Daley. "We're making a couple million a year on towing, instead of spending a couple million a year."
The towing company pays the city and collects its own fines from drivers.
 
Trying to Affect the Fewest
 But in most cities, officials say streamlining government is not enough. A top goal, they say, is to raise taxes and cut programs in ways that affect the fewest people.
San Francisco, for example, faced a $27 million budget gap this year, including a $15 million reduction in state aid for health and welfare programs. The city raised business taxes by $8 million and trimmed services that officials said would matter least to residents.
Mental health programs took the deepest cuts. The city eliminated or reduced programs, including one for juvenile offenders and one that provided individual therapy for mentally ill people, many of whom were homeless. "It means we will be sustaining people and making sure they don't get sicker as opposed to helping them get well," said Carol Wilkins, the city's Deputy Mayor for finance.
One of the fastest ways to save is to cut a payroll. New York will eliminate up to 20,000 jobs next year, half through attrition and half through layoffs, said Philip R. Michael, the city's budget director. On Friday, just after the city granted 150,000 city workers a 5 percent pay increase, Mr. Michael issued new estimates on the budget gap. An estimated $250 million shortage had doubled this year, he said, and it could run as high as $2.1 billion next year.
Mr. Michael said the raise was covered by savings in city payments to pension plans and did not contribute to the city's growing shortage. He acknowledged for the first time that the city is in a fiscal crisis.
 
Detroit Focuses on Hiring
 Detroit is trying to work off a $32 million budget gap, primarily with a hiring freeze and other administrative savings. Washington, which faces a budget gap of about $100 million, has stopped filling vacancies, eliminated 500 contract employees and halted promotions, bonuses and most overtime pay.
Baltimore has balanced its budget primarily by eliminating 1,400 positions, or almost 12 percent of its work force, in the last two years, said Edward J. Gallagher, the city's budget director. He said the city reduced trash collection, recreation programs and library services, and closed four fire units. "We're continuing to down-size government," he said.
Nashville, with a $1.2 million shortage on a $702 million budget, is eliminating 80 of its 2,050 jobs in police and fire departments, and is closing 40 of its 208 hospital beds.
Miami, short $16 million on a $198 million budget, eliminated 207 jobs, but has found other areas to cut; the city sold $1 million worth of city cars and ended a program that gave $1.3 million to arts programs.
 
'We Did Everything'
 Walter C. Kraemer, budget director of Virginia Beach, Va, said, "We did everything from buying fewer library books to reducing road maintenance" in the current fiscal year. After rapid growth in the 1980's the city is adjusting to a $15.4 million budget gap.
Taxes are an unpopular option, but most cities have raised fees and fines, and 40 percent raised property taxes, the National League of Cities reported. San Antonio, for instance, increased property taxes by 8 percent this fiscal year and Long Beach, Calif., increased utility taxes by 2 percent.
Philadelphia, which has a $229 million deficit, eliminated 1,700 positions from its work force in the last fiscal year, and reduced spending this fiscal year by $65 million by cutting back on services like street cleaning and programs for the homeless.
A plan to save the city from bankruptcy remains elusive, since city officials are relying on more state and Federal assistance that may not be forthcoming. "The state's billion dollar deficit this year makes it even more difficult for the city to expect help from the state," said Robert C. Jubelirer, a Republican from western Pennsylvania who is president pro tempore of the Republican-led State Senate.
State officials have also insisted that as a precondition to any new state aid to the city, a state control board be established to oversee the city's finances.

HEADLINE: After Release From Foster Care, Many Turn to Lives on the Streets

BYLINE: By J. C. BARDEN

 BODY:
A large and disproportionate number of the nation's homeless are young people who have come out of foster care programs without the money, skills or family support to make it on their own.
Some left foster care for the streets because of an inability to adjust to their foster families or to group homes. Others managed life as blue-collar or service workers until they lost their jobs in the economic slowdown. 
 Still others simply never learned the basics of existence, like finding and keeping a job and a place to live.
Experts in the field do not fault the concept of foster care, in which a child ideally in the temporary custody of the state lives with a foster family or in a group home while social workers try to sort out the problems in the child's family. This type of intervention, experts say, has saved many young troubled people from fruitless lives.
 
A System Overwhelmed
 But they say foster care systems around the country are being overwhelmed because of the growing number of children in them and the lack of government money to finance them. The experts also say that many states may be hurting youths in foster care by releasing them from the system at the age of 18, before they are emotionally or professionally able to manage alone.
For whatever the reason, four studies have confirmed what has long been hinted in informal surveys of homeless populations: People formerly in foster care are vastly over-represented among the homeless. The studies, in different parts of the country, found that the percentage ranged from 38 percent in Minneapolis to about 13 percent in rural Ohio.
"The foster care kids are there, and there is no question about it, by whatever standard of measure you use," Prof. Irving Piliavin of the University of Wisconsin, who led the study in Minneapolis, said in a recent telephone interview.
 
Some Will Lead Chaotic Lives
 There are now more than 360,000 youths in foster care. About one-third of those are at risk of leading chaotic lives, ranging from homelessness to criminality, a recently published study led by a Columbia University professor estimated. Still another survey, this one under way in San Francisco, has indicated that about half of those who leave foster care for the streets turn to trading sex for meals or a place to sleep.
A 17-year-old in San Francisco who did, Valerie M., was in seven group homes or family homes before running away from the last one several months ago. Valerie, who was placed in foster care at the age of 13 after repeated sexual assaults by her stepfather, said she had reached the point where she did not want anyone to tell her what to do.
"So many placements try to act like parents," she said in a recent telephone inteview, "and I refuse to to let anyone else tell me how to run my life."
Valerie, who is now living in an abandoned housing project with her boyfriend, said she spends most days at the Larkin Street Youth Center, a private organization that provides food, medical care and counseling for young people in need.
Experts say the adjustment to foster care is particularly difficult for young people who were physically or sexually abused by their parents. "These kids are a lot harder to handle because of the psychological damage they've suffered," said Diane Flannery, executive director of the Larkin Street Youth Center. "They don't trust adults, so for the foster care relationship to get going is almost impossible."
 
Not Enough Aid
 Ms. Flannery, like other experts interviewed, was not critical of the concept of foster care. They said foster care could be lifesaving for young people subjected to abuse and neglect in families devastated by drugs, alcohol and poverty.
But these experts said the foster care systems of almost every state were overwhelmed because of insufficient money from the Federal, state and local governments. They cited Family Court judges who have too little time to make decisions that will determine a child's future; children placed in foster care by social workers because of a lack of programs to aid troubled families, and young people placed in incompatible group and family homes by undertrained workers who do not have time to monitor them properly.
The experts were also critical of foster care systems that stop paying for foster care when young people turn 18 and force them into the working world before many are ready to make their own way. New York is one of the handful of states that retains an obligation to youths in foster care to the age of 21.
"The vast majority of 18-year-olds are not ready to live on their own in the best of circumstances," said Rich Gordon, executive director of Youth and Family Assistance, a private group in Redwood City, Calif., that helps youths in need. "And the youngsters in foster care have never had the kind of childhood we think of as normal. They have not completed the task of being children, and yet the system demands they become independent at 18."
The New York State foster care system raised its age limit to 21 in the mid-1980's after advocates for the homeless won a lawsuit on behalf of a group of young people who had been discharged from the foster care system on their 18th birthdays and subsequently became homeless. Many states that say their obligations to foster care youths end at 18 do make exceptions, like allowing the youths to complete high school or a vocational course if it can be done before they turn 19.
Now, advocacy groups are pushing all states to raise their foster care age limits to 21. Congress last year raised the age limit to 21 on the Federal Foster Care Independent Living Program, a program that helps these youths learn to manage life on their own. And the American Civil Liberties Union has begun pressing for expanded independent living plans in lawsuits aimed at forcing states to spend more money to improve their systems.
But the independent living programs, which are run by the states, vary in intensity, from little more than two-day seminars to two-year plans that include setting up the young people in their own quarters.
"These crash courses in how to battle a budget and get a job are not going to make a big difference if you're not equipped to interact with people who are going to be your employer," said Della Hughes, director of the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services, an information and lobbying group for about 500 youth shelters around the country.
 
Lack of Necessary Skills
 The lack of skills that are necessary in a more technical marketplace and the absence of family members to lean on in hard times were mentioned repeatedly by the experts as major factors in the homelessness of former foster care youths.
An example is Warren Gage, 31, who has been living in homeless shelters in St. Louis for a year after the painting jobs that had sustained him for 15 years dried up and he was evicted from his apartment for not paying the rent.
Mr. Gage said he was placed in foster care when he was 14 because his mother physically abused him. He ran away a year later when the court ordered him returned to his own home. "I wasn't going back to any more whippings with an extension cord," said Mr. Gage, who had managed through work and friends to have someplace to live. Now his work is reduced to the jobs he sometimes gets on a daily basis, with his home now one of the five shelters run by the New Life Evangelistic Center in St. Louis.
When it is not possible to keep a troubled family together, foster care can be the best choice. The study led by the Columbia University professor, David Fanshel of the School of Social Work, found that 60 percent of 585 children who had been in foster care in five Western states were leading stable lives seven years after leaving. Another 20 percent were sent back to the courts because they could not get along in their foster homes, and a high proportion of these youths later became involved in crime. An additional 20 percent returned home, with many having problems in leading independent lives later.
The report concluded that about one-third of those in foster care are in danger of leading unstable lives, which could range from being street people to criminals, Professor Fanshel said. The study, "Foster Children in a Life Course Perspective," was published in November by Columbia University Press.
 
An Estimate on Homelessness
 While that study did not try to estimate the number of former foster children who had become homeless, another did. Richard P. Barth, an associate professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley, studied 55 people who had left foster care in the San Francisco Bay area in recent years, Of them, 29 percent reported that they had no home or were moving from week to week, while 39 percent said they sometimes or often had problems with housing. The study was reported in the October ssue of Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal.
In a study still in progress, researchers at the College of Social Work at Ohio State University found that 13.4 percent of 921 homeless adults interviewed in 21 randomly selected rural Ohio counties had lived outside their homes during adolescence. This figure included a small number who had been in juvenile detention centers, said Prof. Beverly G. Toomey, one of those involved in the study.
A study in Chicago found that 14.5 percent of the homeless people had been in foster care at some point. The study, led by Michael R. Sosin, a professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration, questioned 535 of the people who obtained their main meal of the day free at 31 sites. Professor Sosin said this method is much more accurate than interviewing people in shelters.
In the Minneapolis study, conducted by Professor Piliavin and the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Research on Poverty, 337 people were interviewed at nine meal sites.
Harder and Kibbe Research, a private firm, is conducting the San Francisco study that found about a half of the youths who had been in foster care were among those using sex to survive. Researchers began following 50 young people who fit this description two years ago in a three-year study intended to assess the effectiveness of state programs to help these youths.
Using "survival sex" seemed to most of the young people as the easiest way to go, said Paul Harder of Harder and Kibbe Research, because two-thirds of them had been sexually abused at home.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Islamic Bloc Gains in Jordan, Provoking Unease

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 4

 BODY:
A shake-up of Jordan's Cabinet this week has increased concern in this capital about the growing strength of Islamic fundamentalists and touched off an intense debate about how best to contain them.
Many officials and prominent Jordanians are disturbed by Prime Minister Mudar Badran's decision to bring 5 members of the Muslim Brotherhood into his 23-member Cabinet. Mr. Badran announced on Tuesday that the fundamentalists would head the ministries of social development, health, education, religious affairs and justice. 
 Mr. Badran said the Government had little choice but to make concessions to the Brotherhood, whose members have dominated Parliament for a year, ever since the country's first parliamentary elections in 22 years. Their inclusion was required, he and others said, to avoid parliamentary paralysis or debilitating divisions over how to respond to the growing financial and political pressures on Jordan caused by King Hussein's refusal to join the American-led coalition against Iraq.
Bringing the Brotherhood into the Government, they maintained, would require its members to share responsibility for Jordan's problems, help split the movement and tame its most hard-line elements.
 
Officials Reported Alarmed
 But some senior officials are said to have warned that such "appeasement" risks further enhancing the substantial influence of the Islamic bloc and its ability to advance what many charge is its unstated goal of overturning the monarchy in favor of an Islamic government. They said that opposition to the Brotherhood's inclusion in the Cabinet was a major factor in the departure of Marwan al-Kasim, the Foreign Minister, as part of the Cabinet shuffle. Mr. Kasim, a 29-year government veteran, had angered fundamentalist leaders by openly challenging several of their proposals.
Mr. Kasim was also accused, particularly by leftist secular members of the Parliament, of pursuing a "Jordan first" policy that meant less than staunch support for Iraq, despite statements by King Hussein that Washington and its Arab allies have interpreted as openly sympathetic to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President. Mr. Kasim was said to be increasingly concerned about Jordan's isolation.
Mr. Kasim was replaced by Taher al-Masri, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin who, until his latest appointment, was chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the lower house of Parliament. Mr. Masri, who was Foreign Minister from 1984 to 1988, has shown stronger public support for Iraq and has advocated better ties with the P.L.O. along with "political, if not mechanical linkage" of the Persian Gulf crisis and the Palestinian problem.
 
'Both the King's Men'
 Arab and Western diplomats, however, said they did not believe that Jordan's foreign policy would change dramatically. "They are both the King's men," said a diplomat of Mr. Masri and Mr. Kasim.
Mr. Masri agreed. "This country's foreign policy will not change," he said. "There will continue to be harmony between the feelings of the public and the policy of this Government, including toward Iraq."
Several political analysts said Mr. Masri's appointment might reinforce the impression in the West that King Hussein was siding with extremism in deference to the prevailing mood among Jordan's Palestinians, who make up more than half of the population. But some maintained that choosing domestic popularity at the expense of political support from the West and economic support from Saudi Arabia and the other gulf nations could endanger his rule.
Mr. Masri defended the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Government. "Their influence, not only in the Parliament, but also on the street, is evident," he said. "We have to admit it. That's democracy."
While Jordan has had free elections, King Hussein still controls Government policy and the composition of the Cabinet. But even though Parliament's authority is still sharply limited, realistically the King cannot ignore it.
Earlier this week, King Hussein approved a national charter endorsing constitutional rule, political pluralism and the legalization of political parties, which had been banned for years. The King said he hoped the moves would help counter the Brotherhood's radicals.
 
'A Calculated Risk'
 Some analysts said that the King had decided to move out ahead of the growing public support for the Muslim fundamentalists here. Several Jordanians noted that King Hussein had grown a beard, which is associated with Islamic devotion. Still others said the Cabinet shuffle would defuse the Brotherhood.
"The Brotherhood is already splitting between those who wanted to be part of this Government and those who didn't," said Kamel Abu Jaber, a political scientist. "Sure this is a calculated risk, but I think under the circumstances it is hard to think of an alternative."

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Sees Evidence of Wide Tax Cheating on Child Care

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service has striking new evidence that large numbers of Americans have been cheating on their taxes, claiming deductions for children who do not exist and child-care credits for baby sitters who are paid cash under the table.
In 1989 the agency began requiring taxpayers who take the dependent-care credit to give the name, address and Social Security number of the baby sitter or day care center they paid. The new rule was intended to force child-care providers to report and pay taxes on their income and to give employers an incentive to put the baby sitter on the books. The year the rule went into effect, thousands of day-care providers began reporting income, but 2.6 million baby sitters effectively vanished, since the number of taxpayers claiming the credit dropped by 30 percent. 
 "What probably happened in most cases is that people were paying their baby sitters off the books, and their baby sitters would not provide their Social Security number or go on the books, so the family had to choose between finding a new baby sitter or giving up the tax credit," said John Szilagyi, an I.R.S. researcher who is compiling the results of the new law.
Only 6.1 million taxpayers claimed a dependent-care credit in 1989, as against 8.7 million in 1988.
 
$1.2 Billion Revenue Gain
 The dependent-care credit can be claimed by any taxpayer who is paying someone to care for a dependent child or disabled adult so that the taxpayer can work. For those with two or more dependents, the credit can be as much as $1,440 a year, or 30 percent of up to $4,800 in child-care expenses.
Mr. Szilagyi estimated that the I.R.S. collected an additional $1.2 billion from the 2.6 million families who stopped taking the dependent-care credit in 1989.
Although the law requires families to pay Social Security taxes for any household employee who earns more than $50 per calendar quarter, most families do not comply.
Child care has always been an informal, off-the-books industry, made up of baby sitters who come to a child's own home and the far more common day-care arrangements, in which a woman takes care of several children in her own home. One I.R.S. study found that 80 percent of such family day-care providers did not report their income.
 
Going on the Books
 While the new law apparently led more than two million families to give up the tax credit, it also prompted many day-care providers to put their operations on the books for the first time. Mr. Szilagyi said the number of child-care businesses reporting income to the I.R.S. rose to 429,569 in 1989 from 261,372 in 1988, an increase of 64 percent.
"It's a good thing to go on the books if it brings better professional status and better pay," said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign, a national advocacy group. "It can also mean that day-care providers become eligible for Social Security, unemployment and disability, which can be very important."
Another change in the tax law has yielded even more blatant evidence of widespread cheating. Starting in 1987, the I.R.S. required that taxpayers report the Social Security number of all dependents over the age of 5. That year 7 million American children disappeared from the nation's tax returns, representing a 9 percent drop in the 77 million dependents claimed the previous year and $2.9 billion more in yearly tax revenue.
 
Some Nonexistent Dependents
 The tax agency said about 20 percent of the vanished dependents were children who had been claimed as dependents by both parents after a divorce. Under the law, only one parent may claim the child as a deduction.
Most of the others probably never existed, Mr. Szilagyi said. And some families apparently became quite greedy in creating dependents, each worth a $1,080 deduction in 1986, and $1,900 in 1987.
About 66,000 taxpayers who claimed four or more dependents in 1986 claimed none in 1987, after the Social Security identification rule went into effect. And more than 11,000 families claimed seven or more dependents in 1986, but none in 1987.
Those returns are now under investigation, with more than 1,000 audits in which the 1986 dependents were disallowed, and back taxes and fines collected. Mr. Szilagyi said some cases of apparent fraud have also been referred to the authorities for criminal investigation.
 
'Big Areas of Abuse'
 "In any individual family, you can imagine that one or two children might legitimately have stopped being dependents in 1987, but it's hard to imagine a legitimate situation in which a taxpayer had seven dependents one year and none the next," said Mr. Szilagyi, who drafted the proposal to require Social Security numbers from dependents and baby sitters.
Mr. Szilagyi said his research indicates that there are probably four million to five million more dependents being claimed illegally, either because they are fictitious or do not legally qualify as dependents.
The I.R.S. is now checking the Social Security numbers provided in an effort to winnow out nonexistent numbers or those claimed on another return. As of this year, taxpayers must provide Social Security numbers for all dependents over a year old.
"We knew from our sample audits that the dependent deductions and the child-care credit were big areas of abuse, and relatively easy ones to check," Mr. Szilagyi said. "There are other areas we're looking at, including hobby losses and real estate taxes, where we may have some proposals."

HEADLINE: Nobel Physicist Raises Alarm on U.S. Science

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Despite the nation's growing budget problems, the next president of the country's largest general science organization plans to recommend that the Federal Government double the amount of money it spends on science.
In a report stunning for its assertiveness in the normally circumspect world of science policy, Dr. Leon Lederman, a Nobel prize winner in physics, raises questions about the future of scientific research in America and warns that the nation is losing its leadership role. 
 He hopes to raise an alarm by holding a news conference in Washington on Monday and sending copies of a report called "Science: End of the Frontier?" to 130,000 scientists and other members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the organization he will lead starting in February.
After questioning 250 researchers at 50 universities, Dr. Lederman said in the report that their responses "paint a picture of an academic research community beset by flagging morale, diminishing expectations and constricting horizons."
 
'Once Upon a Time'
 Dr. Lederman, a professor at the University of Chicago, added, "From one institution to the next, across demographic categories, across disciplines of research, the nation's scientists are sending a warning: Academic research in the United States is in serious trouble."
The report continued: "Once upon a time, American science sheltered an Einstein, went to the moon, and gave to the world the laser, the electronic computer, nylon, television, the cure for polio. Today, we are in the process, albeit unwittingly, of abandoning this leadership role."
Dr. Lederman recommended doubling the Federal budget for science over the next few years, and following that with annual increases of 8 to 10 percent. The Federal Government spent $7.8 billion in 1989 to support basic and applied research at colleges and universities.
Though its conclusions have been voiced before, the report has already set off a clattering debate in the quiet circles of science policy. Dr. Lederman has broken with etiquette in science politics by saying that science is so important that it cannot be made to take the kind of budget cuts that other fields must suffer.
 
A Distaste for Pleading
 Among science policy professionals in Washington, Dr. Lederman's action was seen as bold because his organization has historically shied away from such public advocacy, and it has created some controversy because many scientists are not willing to engage in "special pleading like any other interest group," as one Congressional policy analyst said.
Dr. Lederman's case argues that Federal financing for science was only 20 percent more in 1990, when adjusted for inflation, than it was in 1968. But in the intervening years, the number of scientists with Ph.D.'s has more than doubled, the cost of instruments and laboratory buildings has gone up several-fold and the cost of paperwork and overhead have sharply risen.
One major factor is "sophistication inflation," he said in the report. "As our understanding of nature increases, the questions we need to answer become more complex," he said. "There is a corresponding increase in the sophistication (and cost) of the equipment needed to do research, both for small 'table top' experiments and large facilities such as telescopes and accelerators."
Dr. Lederman said he felt deeply about the matter and is determined to press the case even if he appears to be a special pleader. "I am well aware of the hesitations of some colleagues, hesitations based on the desire not to appear self-serving, not to bring science down to the level of 'just another interest group,' " he wrote. "However, if in fact U.S. science is at risk, then what course should we take? It is my opinion that the risks of appearing to be self-serving are far outweighed by the risks inherent in not making the case."
 
Choosing His 'Crowd'
 In a telephone interview, he said politicians could say to him: " 'We helped you and you still complain more than ever.' Well, that's true. But the fact is the American science is important to the future of the country. I need to get that across."
There are essentially "two crowds," he said. "One says show restraint; take our share of the budget cuts; make use of limited resources by setting priorities. The other crowd says we have to expand the base. Science is the best investment we can make, and we are now using up all the capital from our golden age, the late 1960's. I am clearly on the side of the second crowd."
Washington experts on science policy generally agree with Dr. Lederman that the United States is under-investing in science.
But there are also critics. As Michael Davey, a science and technology analyst at the Congressional Research Service, asked: "Is the Federal Government in business to make sure every Ph.D. gets funds? Shouldn't we look at the problems in cancer or AIDS or computer science, and ask whether we are spending the right amount before we talk about spending more?"
 
'Tough for the Politicians'
 Many of the science dollars must be allocated in the same Congressional committees that decide what is spent on housing and veterans affairs. "It makes it very tough for the politicians who have to look at housing and hospitals and make decisions about how to distribute the money," said Dr. Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, which is made up of the most prominent scientists in all fields of research.
Dr. D. Allan Bromley, the nation's top science policy officer in his job as the President's science adviser, said in a statement that Dr. Lederman's report "raises important issues that deserve, and are receiving, serious con sideration." But, he went on, "Federal support rose from $5 billion in 1968 (in 1988 dollars) to $8 billion in 1988."

HEADLINE: Art of a City Hall Labor Deal: 11 Months of Agony

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Compared with the momentous fiscal and political issues at stake for New York City, the final point settled in the labor contracts for many municipal workers last week was tiny and arcane.
After nearly a year of tortuous negotiations, the moment of truth arrived last Sunday night in the basement of Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's official residence. Mayor David N. Dinkins was face to face with two major union leaders, Stanley Hill and Barry Feinstein. 
 The last sticking point they resolved concerned vacation time for new employees that had been given up in a prior contract in exchange for adding the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a holiday. Some of the lost time would be restored, the three men agreed -- but not until July 1, 1991.
The value of that seemingly obscure change equaled a mere 0.2 percentage points out of a 5 percent total benefit and wage increase estimated to cost $233 million this fiscal year, ending June 30, and next.
But by agreeing on the restoration and thus settling the contracts, Mr. Dinkins made perhaps his single most important decision in the worsening financial crisis that has gripped his administration since its inception.
 
Deal Done, but Not Fighting
 "Finally someone said, 'We have a deal,' but I don't remember for sure who it was," said Eric J. Schmertz, the city's Labor Relations Commissioner. Mr. Feinstein, of the Teamsters, and Mr. Hill, of District Council 37, leaned across the table to shake the Mayor's hand.
But although the deal was done, the fighting was not over. Neither was the controversy about the contracts, nor the harsh feelings between some critical negotiators.
The most immediate result will be a raise for about 152,000 civil servants, nearly half the city government's work force. The $233 million settlement also set a precedent for the 130 other contracts remaining to be bargained, including those with police, fire and sanitation workers.
In its broader impact, the settlement appears to worsen the city's future budget gaps and increase the prospect of more tax rises, service cuts and layoffs.
 
Anger and Indecision
 An agreement on a higher raise was almost reached as early as May and again later, officials now say. But because of the city's steadily deteriorating finances and moments of anger and indecision during bargaining, those efforts collapsed.
The talks lurched along since February, in ever-changing formats. Sometimes they were formal sessions, with dozens of people arrayed along opposing sides of a 30-foot table in the Presidential Suite on the 21st floor of the Sheraton Centre hotel in midtown Manhattan. Other meetings and caucuses took place at City Hall, the office of the city's labor relations agency on Church Street and the Teamsters' headquarters near Manhattan's meatpacking warehouses on the lower West Side.
Some sessions lasted hours without progress, while some important overtures sprang from quick telephone calls, sidewalk encounters and hallway huddles.
One persistent obstacle was the unions' doubts about the severity of the city's finances. Even today they express skepticism on the need for widespread layoffs or a wage freeze next year. Critics of their settlement say it makes those unpleasant prospects all the more certain.
 
Mayor vs. 2 Close Allies
 The negotiations pitted the freshman Mayor and two of his closest political allies. As early backers of Mr. Dinkins's candidacy, Mr. Hill and Mr. Feinstein had been instrumental in his election.
Critics accused the Mayor of capitulating to the contract demands because of the unions' support. He rejected the charge. So did the unions, who said they found it paradoxical that their chosen Mayor had given them their roughest negotiations and smallest raise in more than a decade.
During most of the talks, the Mayor was not at the table. His team was led by his Labor Relations Commissioner, Mr. Schmertz, with First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Budget Director Philip R. Michael.
When the turning point came last weekend, however, Mr. Dinkins was there, wearing a green Super Bowl jacket.
 
Sessions Quicken
 After months of public and private wrangling, the talks had quickened with secluded sessions in Gracie Mansion's sedate museum room, where historic city artifacts are displayed. The Mayor met with the two union chiefs, Mr. Hill and Mr. Feinstein, and a handful of his top aides.
They assembled a puzzle with a few big pieces and a couple of little ones. The all-important raise was the 3.5 percent raise the first year. Then they extended the term by three months and added 1 percent to the raise for those months. They increased the health and welfare fund $100 a worker, equal to an 0.3 percent raise. Last came the vacation clause, which brought the total wage and benefit increase to 5 percent.
Besides the contracts, another vital understanding was reached. The Mayor would announce plans to freeze wages for the fiscal year beginning July 1; the unions would dissent now but postpone the fight til the next negotiations. Both sides agreed on the roles they would play.
Mr. Feinstein, president of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is still steaming, characterizing the city's bargaining as "amateur night at the opera."
"The budget office kept changing their numbers all the time," Mr. Feinstein said in an interview. "They would say this is what our number is today, then the next day they would say that's not the real number -- here, it's something else. Nothing was the same tomorrow as it was yesterday. They made a mistake or miscalculated or forgot. It was always something."
Mr. Feinstein said that after he objected to the Budget Director, Mr. Michael, "they took him out of the loop, so he became a nonplayer."
But Mr. Michael said the budget numbers had changed not from errors but because economic conditions had kept eroding. And he said he had been kept fully apprised of the talks and had missed sessions only when preoccupied with the latest budget revisions.
 
Final Credit to Mayor
 Mr. Feinstein also complained that the administration team had fought among themselves."At one point we had a deal with Steisel," he said, "but the Mayor said no. I couldn't believe the First Deputy Mayor didn't have the authority to make a deal. At another point, Eric Schmertz recommended a settlement, but the Mayor blew that up, too."
Recollections from the other side differ. Mr. Steisel said he had been amenable to one proposal if its financing had withstood scrutiny, "but when we looked at the numbers, it didn't work."
Despite his dismay over some of the Mayor's earlier actions, Mr. Feinstein credited him with ultimately resolving the prolonged dispute in the final hours.
As soon as the city and the unions agreed on the contracts, they promptly disagreed on how to release the news. City officials wanted to do it the next day, Dec. 31. Unions leaders protested that the event would receive little notice.
 
Bad News the Next Day
 So the settlement was not announced until Wednesday -- three days after the official handshakes. In a full-dress news conference at City Hall, the Mayor and union leaders beamed smiles, patted each other on the back and praised the pact.
Critics of Mr. Dinkins's fiscal and labor policies, including Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier, assailed the contracts as irresponsible. They said the raise would worsen the deficit, service cuts and layoffs. The administration's rebuttal was that the raise was covered by reserves in the budget and by new pension savings, which critics called a precarious gimmick.
Now there is grumbling in the union ranks because the raise did not keep pace with inflation and failed to match the 5.5 percent raise and 0.3 percent benefit increase in a 12-month contract the city granted to teachers in October.
Although Mayor Dinkins declined to divulge details of the negotiations, saying "it would not be fruitful," other participants discussed the art and the agony of the city's premier labor deal.
Negotiations were almost settled in May, said a city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He was not a principal in the talks but monitored them closely.
As the lead union, the Teamsters were bargaining to renew a contract that expired in June. They thought they had an unofficial agreement for a one-year raise of about 5 percent. The teachers' union was expected to follow with a slightly bigger raise. But settling with the Teamsters was postponed until the summer to allow the city to finish its budget and start the fiscal year July 1.
 
Pledge Dropped With Revenues
 That delay proved crucial because the city's revenues deterioriated, and it could no longer honor the unofficial commitment. The same frustrating cycle was later repeated.
Also during the summer, Mr. Hill's 140,000-member union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, started its talks.
The teachers, meanwhile, threatened to strike if they did not have a new contract for the fall semester. Facing that deadline, the Mayor summoned Mr. Feinstein to Gracie Mansion the last weekend of September for one more attempt. A raise of about 4.5 percent was under consideration. But the Mayor's advisers were split, so he declined it.
Then the teachers' talks moved to the fore. The next day Mr. Dinkins announced their settlement.
The rest of that week spun wildly out of control. The Mayor announced a $1.8 billion crime-prevention program that would hire thousands more police officers. But then his press office suddenly issued a warning that falling revenues could result in at least 15,000 layoffs.
Mr. Hill and Mr. Feinstein, caught unaware by the layoff warning, denounced it as a betrayal.
Several weeks later the two labor leaders joined forces, held a news conference with the Mayor and began a new round of sessions, which also foundered. The unions broke off the formal talks but kept almost daily informal contacts, which eventually led them back to Gracie Mansion.

HEADLINE: Worker Mistakenly Cut Phone Cable

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
New York City's most important telephone link broke on Friday because an A.T.&.T. employee mistakenly snipped it with a large pair of wire-cutters while removing old cables, the company said yesterday.
Michael P. Tarpey, an American Telephone and Telegraph Company spokesman, said the damage was not caused by workers who were pulling out old cables and accidentally snagged and broke an active cable, as the company initially believed. 
 The worker, whom he did not identify, will not be disciplined, Mr. Tarpey said. "He didn't do it on purpose, and he's on a union contract," he said.
In a separate accident yesterday morning, 52,000 residents of northeastern Pennsylvania lost most or all long-distance service when a contractor drilling test holes for a sewer authority severed a fiber-optic cable belonging to Bell of Pennsylvania. Eric W. Rabe, a company spokesman, said such accidents happened several times a year in Pennsylvania and typically were fixed the same day.
 
Questions About Vulnerability
 The breakdown on Friday was the third time in a little more than two years that a large part of the A.T.&T. network failed because of a failure in a small piece of the complex system.
The incident raised two important questions in the minds of some regulators and telecommunications experts: Have technological changes made the nation's telephones more vulnerable? And has deregulation removed incentives for the long-distance giant to re-invest in equipment?
But some experts, and A.T.&T. itself, say those concerns are unfounded. They argue that competing companies effectively serve as a back-up if A.T.&T.'s system fails. And they point out that there is a limit to how much extra capacity can be built into the system economically -- it is easy to plan for slack periods, but the break on Friday morning occurred at a time when phone circuits are heavily loaded.
A.T.&T. crews in hard hats worked all night on Friday and through the day yesterday to replace their emergency repairs of the severed fiber-optic cable with sturdier permanent repairs.
 
Previous Breakdowns
 In the previous breakdowns in the A.T.&T. system, a cable break in November 1988 disrupted millions of East Coast calls for nine hours, and a faulty computer program shut down half the network on the afternoon and evening of Jan. 15, 1990.
The company's heavy dependence on a single cable surprised many experts because of New York's enormous reliance on telephone communications. According to a study released last May, residents and businesses in New York State make more local and long-distance calls each year than are made by the entire populations of France or the United Kingdom, each of which has about three times as many people. New York City alone accounts for a third of the country's international calls.
Some consumer groups have suggested in the past that the deregulation of A.T.&T. may be allowing the nation's largest long-distance network to deteriorate.
The Federal Communications Commission has gradually reduced its regulation of A.T.&T. since the company divested its local telephone companies on Jan. 1, 1984. And in July 1989, the agency abandoned so-called rate-of-return regulation, which had guaranteed the company a high return on all investments during its days as a monopoly and thereby gave it an incentive to spend heavily.
The F.C.C. replaced rate-of-return regulation with price-cap regulations, which allow A.T.&T. to set prices freely within a certain range and keep any profits that may result from cost reductions, including any cuts in investment. A.T.&T.'s smaller rivals, such as the MCI Communications Corporation and US Sprint, are not subject to either set of regulations because they are not former monopolies.
Consumer groups and some communications experts have expressed concern that price-cap regulations are giving A.T.&T. an incentive to save money and increase profits by cutting the quality of service and eliminating costly back-up systems.
 
Incentives to Invest
 "The incentives are to not overbuild, to have as lean and mean a network as possible," said Samuel A. Simon, a consultant and lawyer in Washington who works on telephone issues for consumer groups and phone companies. "Instead of gold-plating, now the issue is whether there's enough."
But A.T.&T. and the Federal Communications Commission contend that the new regulations give the company an incentive to invest more efficiently, and that competition from rivals like MCI and US Sprint forces A.T.&T. to maintain a reliable network or risk losing customers.
A.T.&T.'s annual investment in its network has been steady at $2.5 billion to $3 billion for several years, said Thomas H. Norris, an A.T.&T. vice president for regulatory affairs.
Competition in the long-distance market now provides the back-up capacity that once was the responsibility of A.T.&T., said Carl Oppedahl, a lawyer involved in telephone issues in New York. "You want a redundant network, you've got it: A.T.&T., MCI and Sprint," he said. "An anarchic terrorist could destroy one network, and you'd still have the other two."
Fiber-optic cables are more easily broken and carry more calls than the copper cables and microwave links they replace, so more people are affected by a single accident. Friday's accident occurred shortly before mid-morning, when calling volume typically peaks. A.T.&T.'s four alternative cables into New York City were already mostly full, making it harder for A.T.&T. to redirect calls.
But to install completely redundant equipment just to be ready for any cable failures would be very expensive and increase the cost of calling on the A.T.&T. network, the company says.
However, A.T.&T. is installing more sophisticated electronics in the network, which the company says will provide improved service and increase capacity, so that problems like the breakdown on Friday can be circumvented quickly.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH LEAVES OPEN TIMING OF ASSAULT ON IRAQ'S FORCES

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
President Bush said today that American military action against Iraq would not necessarily begin immediately after Jan. 15. But he warned President Saddam Hussein in a letter that he would "face destruction" if he did not withdraw his forces from Kuwait by that date, an Administration official said.
In a radio address delivered 10 days before the United Nations deadline, Mr. Bush said "time is running out" and that each additional day the United States waits to act could mean more casualties. 
 "We risk paying a higher price in the most precious currency of all -- human life -- if we give Saddam more time to prepare for war," Mr. Bush said.
 
No 'Secret Diplomacy'
 The President, who met today with the United Nations Secretary General to review the crisis, promised in his speech to explore a peaceful solution. But he said there would be no "secret diplomacy" when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d meets with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq in Geneva on Wednesday.
"Secretary Baker will restate, in person, a message for Saddam Hussein: Withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally and immediately, or face the terrible consequences," Mr. Bush said. [Text of his address, page 4.]
In an apparent effort to step up the pressure, Mr. Bush used blunter language in a letter that Mr. Baker is to hand Mr. Aziz in Geneva. A senior Administration official said the letter warns Mr. Hussein that he must withdraw his troops from Kuwait or "face destruction."
 
'Two Choices' for Hussein
 "The letter says to Saddam, you have two choices: Get out or we will use force, there will be a war," the official said. The purpose of the letter, the official said, is to "hand over something tangible that Saddam Hussein will have to read in case Tariq Aziz doesn't have the nerve to repeat our message word for word."
In Baghdad today, a senior Iraqi official said the Iraqi leadership still believed that a meeting in Baghdad between Mr. Baker and President Hussein should "not be excluded" from the final rounds of diplomacy. But Iraq rejected a meeting with the European Community, which on Friday offered to work to resolve all problems of the Middle East if the gulf crisis could be settled peacefully. [Page 4.]
Mr. Bush seems to be leaving himself some room to maneuver at a time when the United States expects a flurry of diplomatic activity -- perhaps even some new effort by Mr. Hussein.
Administration officials said the United States was approaching the meeting with Mr. Aziz with the expectation that the Iraqi official would come with some kind of surprise. The challenge for Washington, they said, was to find a way to continue to show a desire for a peaceful solution without raising public expectations or pressure to make a deal with Iraq.
Mr. Baker will be in London on Monday to meet with European Community officials. Mr. Bush has said he would reject any direct linkage between the gulf crisis and the plight of the Palestinians, but has not explicitly ruled out an approach like the one suggested by the European Community. The White House has otherwise been silent on the European offer to address Middle East issues generally, and Mr. Bush did not mention it in his speech, which was taped on Friday.
Asked about the proposal today, an Administration official said the White House considered it a "nonstarter" but did not want to get into a public dispute with its European allies about it. The official said the United States viewed the proposal as linking the gulf crisis with other Middle Eastern issues, but that the Europeans did not define it that way.
"It's a matter of semantics that's certainly not worth creating a hornet's nest about," the official said.
 
Meeting With U.N. Chief
 France, which had extracted the commitment from the community to help resolve other Middle East conflicts, also suggested that it would be "desirable" for the United Nations Security Council to meet again near Jan. 15 "before unleashing a war."
Mr. Bush met today at his Camp David retreat in Maryland with the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Mr. Bush said on Friday that while he did not see any need for further United Nations action, "I'd be interested to hear if the Secretary General feels to the contrary."
A White House statement issued after the meeting said the two men "discussed the general situation in the gulf, including diplomatic activities aimed at resolving the crisis in a peaceful manner." Mr. Bush had invited the United Nations leader to Camp David to compare notes. White House officials gave no indication that anything more than that had occurred.
In his radio address, Mr. Bush said, "We should go the extra mile before asking our servicemen and women to stand in harm's way," adding, "We should and we have." He called next week's meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz "one more step."
 
'Time Is Running Out'
 "Eleven days from today, Saddam Hussein will either have met the United Nations deadline for a full and unconditional withdrawal, or he will have once again defied the civilized world," Mr. Bush said. "This is a deadline for Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations resolution, not a deadline for our own armed forces."
The remark seemed to give the President some leeway in case the meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz produces some movement toward ending the stalemate in the Middle East. But Mr. Bush said: "Time is running out. It's running out because each day that passes brings real costs."
Mr. Bush, who has drawn criticism for not fully explaining his reasons for contemplating war, said that Iraq "already poses a strategic threat to the capital cities of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel and Syria" with its missiles and warplanes.
 
Burden of Rising Oil Prices
 He noted that Iraq has chemical weapons, and he repeated his assertion that "each day that passes brings Saddam Hussein further on the path to developing biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them."
"If Saddam corners the world energy market, he can then finance further aggression," Mr. Bush said. "Each day that passes increases Saddam's worldwide threat to democracy."
The President also raised an economic argument: higher oil prices are "a crushing burden" that the new democracies in Eastern Europe and Latin America cannot afford. "Our own economy is suffering," he said, "suffering the effects of higher oil prices and lower growth stemming from Saddam's aggression."
He said the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations "are taking a toll, but they are still not forcing Saddam out of Kuwait."
"Nor do we know when or even if they will be successful," he said.

Rangers Prevail in Overtime as Nicholls Scores

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 5

 BODY:
The red light went on and then in an instant the riot of a celebration was under way, the Rangers pouring over the bench in exhaustion and shock, a 3-2 overtime victory over the Blues officially recorded in the National Hockey League books even if it had not yet fully registered in their consciousness.
The Rangers, wiped out by a grueling series of games and a draining 62 minutes of close checking and cheap shots, nonetheless manufactured the drama to defeat the Blues when Bernie Nicholls tucked a loose puck under Vincent Riendeau and inside the far post with 1 minute 48 seconds remaining in overtime. 
 Nicholls, slicing in front of the crease as Normand Rochefort let a blast go from the left point, scooped the bouncing puck into the net for his 17th goal of the season and thus sent his teammates bouncing off the bench.
The celebration ended, the Rangers streamed for the exits and the start of the trip back to New York, possessors of a perfect 2-0 record on a road trip that concluded with their third game in four nights, their sixth in nine days. It also lengthened their lead in the Patrick Division to 7 points over the Flyers and ran their mark for the season to 24-13-7.
 
Big Night for Hull
 The climactic goal also negated and abruptly ended Brett Hull's latest night of terror. The right wing for the Blues with dynamite in his wrists and an almost unfathomable 41 goals in 41 games scored 2 against the Rangers tonight.
But the Rangers, having absorbed the impact of Hull's relentless offensive onslaught, were not defeated by it, and Hull was on the bench when the game sudenly ended, his sublime skills rendered useless by Nicholls's impromptu magic.
Hull, who tends to lurk inconspicuously before he pounces, pumped his second goal of the game behind Mike Richter 11:50 into the second period to give the Blues their second advantage of the game. In his trademark style of making no great moves but no mistake with the puck once presented with an opening, Hull trailed the play into the offensive zone and slid to the slot when Jeff Brown cranked up an uncontested slap shot from the right face-off circle.
Richter kicked out Brown's shot, but then could only close his eyes and dive once the puck trickled straight to the stick of Hull at 10 paces. The squat right wing promptly nailed his 41st goal of the season to the back of Richter's net.
Darren Turcotte, as John Ogrodnick had done earlier in the period, equalized affairs by depositing a power-play rebound goal with a wicked economy at 17:16 of the period to send the game into the third squared at 2-2.
Hull, on one knee, had given the Blues the game's first goal at 8:15 of the first. The Rangers, undermanned and undecided about how to combat the St. Louis power play, were ultimately outmaneuvered in a fatal sequence that left Hull alone at the lower rim of the left circle. Richter had no look at Hull's quick redirection of Adam Oates's soft pass across the slot.
 
SMITH PLEASED WITH PROSPECTS
 Neil Smith, the general manager of the Rangers, returned from a scouting trip at the junior world championships enthusiastic about the performances of Steven Rice of Canada and Doug Weight of the United States, two forwards who are among the organization's top prospects. "Weight does a lot of things well," Smith said of the American center, who plays for Lake Superior State and who accumulated 18 points in seven games for the United States team. "He's a good skater, a strong defensive player, his size is O.K. and he can handle the puck." Of Rice, the captain of the Canadian team, which won the gold medal, Smith said, "He could have been the strongest player in the tournament." Rice, who played in nearly a dozen games for the Rangers at the start of the season before being returned to his junior team, is expected to return to the club before the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A Hemmed-in Congress, Cranky From Gavel to Gavel

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the 102d Congress convened last week, the usual heady talk of prospects for vital new initiatives was drowned out by grousing over what will never be accomplished thanks to the threat of war in the Persian Gulf and the budget constraints at home.
Perhaps it was the possibility of combat or that a surprising number of lawmakers had close brushes with defeat in November, but many said the climate was unusually tense and uncomfortable. 
 Representative Jerry Lewis, a California Republican, for one, saw signs that this session might be the least civil in his 12 years in Congress. Moments after House members took the oath of office on Thursday, he said, the back-slapping gave way to impatient gavel-pounding and flaring tempers over a successful move by Democrats to push through a measure that would alter provisions of last year's budget agreement.
"It's already a tense environment," said Mr. Lewis, chairman of the House Republican Conference. "The whole institution came close to falling apart this last session. Now it may get even worse."
Indeed, anxiety among members seems far greater than when the session opened a year ago. The jubilant talk then that the end of the Cold War would yielda "peace dividend" for domestic programs long forgotten. Now the speculation is over how many billions of dollars Operation Desert Shield will cost.
As he roamed the Capitol corridors shortly after the session opened, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee, could think of few new proposals with a chance of being enacted. "You're going to have much more in the way of extraordinary constraints, considering the budget agreement," he said. "And you've got a wild card in the cost of Desert Shield."
But not all lawmakers saw it that way. Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker, insisted that there will be "some room for expansion of domestic" programs, though he acknowledged there would be tough decisions about shifting spending priorities.
And Representative Constance A. Morella, a Maryland Republican, predicted that "the fact that there's such anxiety and concern about the gulf is going to goad Congress into pushing itself into other issues." Collectively, she said, the new Congress was unusually serious, with "people who want to concentrate their energy on accomplishing something."
 
Examining New Options
 Members say the initiatives with the best prospects will be those prompted by either the gulf conflict or recession. Normally, lawmakers would endeavor to pep up the faltering economy by cutting taxes and encouraging the creation of new jobs, options that seem unrealistic in the current fiscal climate.
But Congressional leaders say they are examining other options, such as expanding unemployment insurance, and many said they would back a major proposal to rebuild the nation's crumbling public facilities. Everyone on Capitol Hill, it seems, is talking "infrastructure." It is an issue whose time has come, Mr. Foley said, recession or no. "The infrastructure bill is something that is important to do in any event," the Speaker said."I believe we're tragically behind in catching up to the deterioration of highways, airports, various kinds of public facilities."
Tensions with Iraq, meanwhile, have rekindled interest in some moribund energy issues, such as the formulation of a national policy to promote the development and conservation of domestic energy sources.
Issues with no crisis cachet are likely to float to the top of the legislative agenda only if they lack dollar signs. One such proposal is to grant three months of unpaid leave to workers with new babies or sick family members, a measure that President Bush vetoed last year.
House Democrats have have already begun one effort to push legislation that Mr. Bush vetoed, by introducing, as the first bill of the new year, legislation that would make it easier for minorities and women to prove employment discrimination.
Such measures may stand a better chance of enactment this year because Democrats picked up one seat in the Senate and nine in the House, which may make it more difficult for Mr. Bush to continue his record of never having a veto overridden. The new Congress may also have a stronger left wing than its predecessor, with new liberals including Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who was an anti-war demonstrator, and Neil Abercrombie, who won back a seat for the Democrats in Hawaii and took part in radical causes in the 1960's.
In a preview of what leading Democrats are pushing, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, has scheduled hearings beginning this week on such issues as needs of the workforce in times of recession and proposals for universal health insurance. And, once again, lawmakers are also pledging to overhaul the campaign finance system.
Although Congress is taking up issues earlier than usual because the members have assembled to address the Persian Gulf crisis, it is often the President who sets the legislative agenda, and his State of the Union address is not scheduled until Jan. 29.
But some experts argue that a humdrum legislative session is unavoidable. Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that what with the gulf crisis, the deficit and redistricting, the new Congress will be nowhere as productive as the 101st, which was vilified because of the budget stalemate but still passed notable measures like the child care and clean air bills.
"The combination of simply not having any money," Mr. Hess said, "and the unique political constellation that comes with redistricting, means that it is not going to be a memorable Congress."
In fact, with expected partisan sniping over the economy and issues such as civil rights, he added, "I think it's going to be one of those especially unpleasant Congresses before we're finished."

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS got a small, bitter taste of the future last week. The city closed three fire companies, the first of 41 that may eventually be shut. It shifted traffic agents to replace more than 150 it has already lost. It began the process of laying off 280 workers in a purge that might trim more than 7,000 employees from the municipal payroll in the coming weeks. And it prepared a financial plan that seemed likely to make the city even less livable in dozens of different ways for years.
None of the austerity, though, stopped two large municipal unions from securing for their members raises and benefits that would amount to a 5 percent increase over 15 months, or the administration of David N. Dinkins from arguing that it was a fair settlement, and the best deal it could get. 
 The situation reminded some of the confusing week in October when, on successive days, the city announced that teachers would get a 5.8 percent raise in wages and benefits, put forth a plan to raise taxes to hire more police officers, imposed a job freeze and finally warned that 15,000 layoffs might be needed.
Now as then, fiscal experts wondered whether the administration, or Mr. Dinkins himself, had fully grasped the weakness of the city's economy and the constraints that placed on the municipal government, despite ever more gloomy news from the administration's own budget office.
"I think that's certainly true, that we're in a crisis," Mr. Dinkins said when asked late last week about budget gaps now estimated to have widened to $500 million for the current year and perhaps $2 billion for the next one.
But to Felix G. Rohatyn, departing chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which has watched over the city's finances since it nearly went bankrupt in 1975, the latest labor settlement seemed to suggest business as usual, or an uncomfortably close approximation of it.
"It really does seem that there is no sense of impending crisis here," he said, "because if there were, these negotiations would not have come to this conclusion."
The criticism from Mr. Rohatyn, who played a central role in resolving the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, was no surprise. Once a Dinkins adviser, he had likened the administration's actions in October to parts of a Calder mobile that hang in the air with "their own motion and their own life."
Even the administration was acknowledging that it had boxed itself in by settling first with the teachers, who are underpaid compared with their suburban counterparts and so had the strongest argument for a raise. Given New York's me-too brand of bargaining, the 5.8 percent increase they won became the target for the other unions.
 Because the contracts depend in large part on money the city would otherwise contribute to worker pension funds, the administration could claim that they would not add to the budget gaps. The contracts' structure -- 3.5 percent in the first year and the rest thereafter -- make them cheaper than they appear. And officials hinted that they might get some of the money back, when the January budget plan is announced and unions interested in keeping more members on the payroll might be willing to make concessions. (Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez has already suggested that the schools might be closed for three days in the spring and workers furloughed without pay to avoid laying off thousands of employees.)
Settling the contracts now also enables the city to draw up a budget plan with fewer uncertainties and establishes a climate of labor peace that may be valuable in even tougher times later on.
Those who defend the Mayor's fiscal vigilance note that one of his first press releases announced that a police class would be delayed because of budget problems. He has already cut the city's capital expenditure budget, which relies on borrowed money and thus has served a symbol of the city's restored creditworthiness. And after he worked hard to reassure Wall Street, the latest batch of city bonds sold out, though at slightly higher interest rates than the city had hoped.
Even so, the new contracts, combined with the ever-worsening budget problems, suggested to Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent research organization sponsored by businesses, that the Mayor might be receiving "divided counsel."
"I think there's been an enduring split within his administration over whether to sit back to see if things will get better," Mr. Horton said, "or plunge ahead on the assumption that they are not going to get better and take decisive action."
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, another monitor of city finances, said he was disappointed with what he saw as the administration's lack of long-term planning. When he has discussed contingencies with the administration, he said, "The answer was always, 'We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.' "
Mr. Dinkins's inauguration on a frosty morning a year ago was the culmination of years spent negotiating the treacherous currents of city politics. His campaign, which stressed innovative approaches to social ills, raised expectations. His being the city's first black mayor no doubt increased them. Which can only make the progressively worsening fiscal news he has received since taking office, the result of a faltering city economy, mounting job losses and slumping consumer spending, that much harder to bear.
The man who brings him the dismal numbers, Philip R. Michael, the city budget director, said Mr. Dinkins "absolutely takes it all in and appreciates what is going on, but he very steadfastly rejects the idea that he should have a knee-jerk reaction to it."
Mr. Michael has been going over the financial plan with the Mayor line by line and agency by agency. While Mr. Dinkins's deliberateness can sometimes be frustrating, it can also lead to deep reflection on the consequences of cuts. For instance, Mr. Michael recalled, when they got to the Human Resources Administration, caretaker for the city's impoverished and abused, Mr. Dinkins posed a question pointing up how numbers on a budget sheet could affect lives: "Whose babies are these we're talking about?"
In appearances before corporations and business organizations, the Mayor has stressed the importance of a balanced budget to the point where he has sounded to some like his predecessor, Edward I. Koch. But Mr. Horton said that in some respects Mr. Dinkins brought to mind Abraham D. Beame, who also assumed office after a long public career and as the city's economy was tumbling. Back then, Mr. Horton said, there was "a profound feeling that this just couldn't be happening."
It is true that even as the Beame government was facing its bleakest hour the city was about to begin a spectacular economic resurgence that would result in hundreds of thousands of new jobs and annual budget surpluses of hundreds of millions of dollars. So maybe the fortunes of New York City, and Mr. Dinkins, will soon change.
But it is also true that Mr. Beame was a one-term mayor.

Somalia, Abandoned To Its Own Civil War With Others' Weapons

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: NAIROBI , Kenya

 BODY:
IT has taken longer than many people thought, but the unraveling of Somalia, a small country that wraps like a boomerang around the eastern border of Ethiopia, is under way. Western nations started to weary of propping up one of Africa's most corrupt and brutal regimes two years ago. They regard last week's warfare in the capital, Mogadishu, as the final bloody coda: a struggle fought with rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles and machine guns mounted on four-wheel-drive Toyotas stolen from aid agencies.
The current battle is more than the obvious one: an effort to oust President Mohammed Siad Barre, the octogenarian autocrat who has ruled the country for 21 years. It is a blood feud, fought between the President's Marehan clan, who constitute the bulk of the armed forces, and the more numerous middle-class Hawiye, who inhabit the center of the country around Mogadishu and make up the rebel United Somali Congress. 
 The authority of President Siad Barre, until recently a handsomely supported military ally of the United States, crumbled two years ago. That was when the Somali National Movement, formed by a third clan, the Isaaks from the north, returned to Somalia from Ethiopia as part of a peace treaty between the two countries.
The treaty ended 11 years of hostilities over control of the Ogaden, a desert area in eastern Ethiopia, and appeared to be one of the few promising developments in the ethnically fractious Horn of Africa. But to the surprise of President Siad Barre, the Isaak rebels returned home armed by Ethiopia, and won control of the northern section of Somalia. In that battle, a State Department report said, 5,000 unarmed Isaak civilians were purposely killed by the army, a brutality that began to stir second thoughts in Washington about its Somali client.
The United Somali Congress, a newer insurgency group, was formed about two years ago and is under the military leadership of Hawiye who defected from the Somali army, diplomats here say. These rebels seem to be armed mostly with weapons captured or bought from soldiers reportedly eager to sell their arms for money to buy food. In all, five clan-based rebel groups of various strengths are arrayed against the President.
For more than two decades, Somalia was little more than an expensive sideshow in the theater of the cold war. The Horn of Africa, with its proximity to the Middle East, was a region that both superpowers competed in. When he grabbed power nine years after independence in 1960 from Britain and Italy, President Siad Barre embraced socialism and was rewarded with weapons by the Soviets. But after neighboring Ethiopia, a traditional American ally, turned Marxist, the two superpowers switched sides. Moscow provided Ethiopia with military equipment for its war against Somalia and the United States won access to Somalia's port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden. Between 1986 and 1988, Somalia received $100 million in military and economic aid from Washington.
The strategic value of Somalia has now diminished, but the legacy of all the weapons accounts for much of the ferocity of the current fighting, those who have fled the capital say. A typical Somali soldier, an evacuee said last week, wears an American-supplied uniform and brandishes a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle. But the soldiers at checkpoints in Mogadishu last week usually lounged, bare chested, in the shade of a tree, wore sandals and chewed chat, a leaf popular in the Horn of Africa for its marijuana-like qualities, according to aid workers who fled last week. The police, they added, were armed with modern Italian machine guns, and many civilians were armed with weapons purchased from "under the mangoes" at open street markets.
Washington pursued its support of President Siad Barre much longer than some people, including the American military attache at the in Mogadishu from 1987 to 1989, thought wise. The attache, Col. Alfred Girardi, wrote congressional offices after his retirement in mid-1989 that the Somali army was "poorly motivated due to a lack of pay and basic comforts, poorly led by inept officers and unfortunately tempted to salvage what they can by hook or crook."
Washington became disenchanted when President Siad Barre, in an effort to reassert his presence, unleashed the presidential guard, the Red Beret. The guards slaughtered hundreds during street demonstrations in July 1989, according to Western diplomats. In the last year, Washington has virtually cut off its aid. Even the Italians, the most stalwart of the regime's friends, dramatically cut back. The last straw for the Italians seemed to be the killing of an Italian professor: He wandered from his hotel one evening and was found hanged the next morning in the headquarters of the Red Beret.
The Libyans stepped into the breach last year, Western diplomats say. Two small passenger jets from Libya were seen at the Mogadishu airport after the latest round of fighting started, prompting speculation that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader who enjoys meddling in the region, was attempting to bring the President more arms.
With the fierce fighting and the lack of foreign aid, the economy of the nation of 6 million, most of them camel-herding nomads, has fallen apart, as have attempts at peace talks. Most Westerners say the only uncertain element is how long it will take to dislodge the President. Colonel Girardi, who thought President Siad Barre a lost cause, cautioned the Congress: "A future regime will lack the charismatic and singular ability of Siad Barre to juggle the many opposing factions and therefore with no true leader in sight, more turmoil and instability will result." That warning may now be coming true.

HEADLINE: Hussein's Handy Home Survival Guide

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq

 BODY:
SADDAM HUSSEIN doesn't talk much about the goals of Baath Party socialism these days. The party principles that ostensibly provide the ideological glue for the regime are largely forgotten, at least for the moment -- overtaken by a fierce pragmatism based on survival.
The invasion of Kuwait has accelerated a process of corrosion of party ideals that began several years before -- a process that reflects how much rule in Iraq under Saddam Hussein has become a matter not of ideology but of the exercise of personal power. 
 The Arab Baath Socialist Party was founded in Damascus in the 1940's by two French-educated Arabs. It saw its task as the creation of a new Arab man: disciplined, uncorrupted and committed to a romantic blend of Arab nationalism and mild socialism. But the ideology -- an artificial, secular hybrid whose principles were always vaguely stated -- never resonated among the people of Iraq in the same way, say, that religion did among the people of Iran.
Instead, the party structure in Iraq came under the domination of one man -- Saddam Hussein -- who has invoked the ideology when it suits his purposes and has strayed from it when other principles seem to be needed if he is to survive in power. The Baath Party also took root in Syria, but the party's two branches have split, with Saddam Hussein and the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, each asserting that only he is the correct personality to lead the movement.
As an economic plan, Baath socialism didn't work, despite some early achievements; in Iraq, when the eight-year war with Iran ended in 1988, the promised earthly paradise of jobs, access to consumer goods, a lifting of wartime restrictions and expansion of the country's infrastructure didn't come. Now, with the invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi people have been handed food rationing, bread lines, unemployment, more military service, a worthless currency and the threat of an all-out war with the United States.
Certainly, as a political organizing principle, the party structure still works here. The party carries out the food rationing system, buses in women and children for "spontaneous" demonstrations, mobilizes the masses for civil defense exercises and penetrates all segments of Iraqi life. But people can't eat ideology, and in a country where the price of eggs has risen 500 percent since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and rationing tickets buy less and less flour, sugar, tea and rice -- when they are available at all -- the lofty rhetoric had to be adjusted. Survival of the fittest now seems more important than collective sacrifice.
Under Mr. Hussein, Iraq has always succeeded in ruthlessly suppressing even the slightest hint of unrest. But the regime does not rule by terror alone. It survives because it has been supple enough to respond to the basic physical needs of the people. The philosophy of governing is best expressed in two key words: "tarhib" -- terror -- and "targhib" -- enticement.
For the moment, to insure that private grumbling does not burst into public protest, the regime has introduced a new level of flexibility that is often in conflict with the discipline that is supposed to be at the core of the new Baath Arab man. The regime closed the traditional tea houses of Baghdad after the invasion, but the grumbling got so loud that they were opened again -- with enough tea and sugar.
 
Rising Corruption
 "Saddam Hussein is very pragmatic, very realistic and in the present circumstances, his priority is that people enjoy a minimum standard of living," said an ambassador from a developing country. "When you're pragmatic, you're not bound by rigid lines. You make your compromises along the way. So the regime has shut its eyes to all sorts of things."
Perhaps most dramatic is corruption. A decade ago, it would have been unthinkable for an average Iraqi to offer to change local dinars for hard currency, because the prison sentence would have been too long. In the face of war, however, the practice is not only tolerated but encouraged. Even the armed forces, whose loyalty to the regime is guaranteed by layers of party apparatchiks and security officers in the ranks, has been affected. Army reservists tell of paying off their commanders either to delay reporting for duty or to get assignments closer to Baghdad where they may be able to work part-time. Others have simply not shown up for reserve duty.
 
A Plea for Smuggling
 The corruption of the army is most obvious in Kuwait. The elite Presidential Guards benefited more from the massive looting of the country than the regular army, and many soldiers have complained to foreigners about the inequity of the spoils. And an Amnesty International report last month documents cases of soldiers who released detained Kuwaitis in exchange for payoffs, particularly television sets and videocassette recorders. A 17-year-old Kuwaiti was offered his freedom in exchange for an Indian or Filipino woman, the report said.
In addition, Western diplomats say that after the invasion, officials claiming ties to the Ministry of Trade visited a number of foreign businesses doing work here and told them that any restrictions would be waived if the businesses would help smuggle in goods.
 Some Iraqi officials quietly acknowledge that relaxing the rules carries potential political risks. In Iraq's repressive atmosphere, the introduction of flexibility in everyday life can only be temporary if the regime hopes to maintain the stability that has been the hallmark of its 22-year history. If the regime survives intact after the current crisis, it will have to find a way to rebuild loyalty to the state and purge corrupting influences. The only way to do that, say a number of foreign diplomats with years of experience here, will be to crack down again. "The total control will have to return, and it will," said one European diplomat. "The regime has nothing else to use to bind the people."

Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Masses Yearning To Be With Relatives

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE term "push-pull" is a simple bit of shorthand used to explain why millions of people have undertaken the vast journeys of immigrants. Poverty pushes them. Economic opportunity pulls them.
Leaving aside political refugees, who are considered the exception to the rule, this fundamentally economic model of immigration served as the guiding principle for major revisions of American immigration laws completed late last year. As Congress debated how immigration could help meet the nation's labor needs, a variety of experts and scholars were developing more complex views of immigration that incorporate historical, cultural and social factors in trying to explain why people emigrate. 
 Those using the new approach, which does not yet have a name as neat as push-pull, say economic factors alone do not explain why New York and Los Angeles have attracted thousands of Koreans as grocers, and not similar numbers of would-be merchants from Thailand or Indonesia.
Nor does push-pull alone explain why nurses from the Philippines have become a major presence in American hospitals and why people from other poor densely populated countries have not.
Some scholars, like Alejandro Portes, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, argue that the American military presence in Korea and the Philippines along with the events that brought it about may be as important in stimulating immigration as purely economic motivations.
Similarly, Mr. Portes and others say economic considerations do not explain why certain areas of Mexico send more immigrants to the United States than other regions that are either poorer or closer to the border or both. Long-established migration patterns create powerful links between certain communities in Mexico and the United States, according to recent studies. Understanding such dynamics and predicting immigration flows are becoming increasingly important in formulating policy.
Immigration has been on the rise for at least a decade and Congress last year mandated that the numbers continue to rise. As a result, immigration now plays a greater role in shaping the labor force than at any time since the Depression.
Washington has attempted to shape immigration's economic impact through two laws that together produced the first major revision of immigration policy since 1965. The first law, enacted in 1986, sought to curtail the flow of illegal aliens by prohibiting their employment and thus cutting off the supply of jobs that pull them here.
Then, last year, Congress turned its attention to legal immigration. In late October it enacted a law that will increase the number of immigrant visas to 700,000 a year from the current level of 500,000. As in the past, the families of citizens will get preferential treatment for most of the visas, but the new emphasis on economic considerations dictated that most of the additional 200,000 visas go to people selected for their job skills or their ability to make major financial investments. The assumption is that there are plenty of such immigrants pushing to get into the United States and that the doors just have to be opened to them.
 
Kinship With Lands Afar
 Non-economic considerations, however, may diminish the laws' effectiveness.
"Immigration from the Philippines is a textbook example of why it is wrong to base policy on the idea that people are just calculating where they can make the most money and then traveling there," said Mr. Portes. "People immigrate to where they find connections and a measure of familiarity."
The extent to which the United States permeates modern Philippine history and culture means that "potential immigrants are partially Americanized even before they leave," he said. The same, he argued, holds true for South Korea and Taiwan, and similar historical connections explain why many people from former British and Dutch possessions in the Caribbean have chosen to migrate to London and Amsterdam even though Miami is much closer.
Even some staunch advocates of a strictly economic approach to immigration now agree that those additional factors need to be taken into account.
George J. Borjas, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, said, "Someone in the Philippines is not going to become an immigrant unless they think they'll improve their economic condition, but having a lot of information about the United States is an economic consideration that makes immigration more likely by reducing costs and risks."
Aside from the connections between two countries, the case of Korean grocers illustrates how connections at a more personal level can affect immigration flows. Successful immigrants have paved the way for new arrivals by helping them with information, employment and financial assistance. This is merely a modern version of a kind of networking that historians believe is as old as immigration itself.
Among Mexican immigrants, especially those who come illegally, similar patterns exercise a powerful influence. Analyzing extensive studies that have been conducted in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Jalisco, Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, has described a "culture of out-migration."
"In these communities that have been the traditional sources of migrants for decades, the kids grow up with a whole world view that is shaped by the prospect, if not the inevitability, of migration to the United States," he said. "It is an expectation so widespread that it is impervious to the machinations of the governments on either side of the border."

HEADLINE: America's Duty to New York;
Fighting for Fairness: I

SERIES: To Restore New York City: First, Reclaim the Streets -- First of two editorials

 BODY:
New York City is staggering because of tax dollars lost to the recession, which no one can control, but also because of massive Federal unfairness, which Congress can control. America calls on New York and its other largest cities to serve as the nation's poorhouse, but so far the rest of the country refuses to pay its fair share.
Medicaid, foster care and other expenditures for the poor cost New York City $3 billion a year. That's almost a fifth of all the money the city spends on its own programs, and far more than the amount needed to close the present critical budget gap. And that $3 billion doesn't include the cost of police and schools, driven upward by the needs of the city's poor. 
 Cities, most of all the largest cities, contain a disproportionate number of the nation's poor and afflicted. New York did not create its schizophrenic homeless, crack addicts or AIDS carriers. Indeed, the city's humane response has served as a magnet for these victims. And New York, like Los Angeles and Miami, provides socializing institutions for waves of Asian, Latin and other immigrants.
New Yorkers are no less responsible for these needy fellow residents than neighboring suburbanites or Midwest farmers. But why should they be required to carry substantially more of the burden?
Last Sunday we urged that, in this period of darkening fiscal storms, New York's first priority be to reclaim the streets. Today and tomorrow, we urge that, to make that possible, Congress's first priority be to spread the burden.
Cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are centers of culture and excitement -- and violence and despair. Some of the decay arises from political fumbling. But self-inflicted wounds cannot explain the spreading pattern of urban distress.
John Yinger of Syracuse University and Helen Ladd of Duke University document how economic and social factors beyond the control of major cities make it ever harder for them to provide reasonable public service, especially for children and the poor.
The civil rights revolution revived the old tides that swept the white middle class to the suburbs. Recent years have seen a black middle-class tide in the same directions. Cities, meanwhile, feel a vicious dynamic. As the urban cores decline, people who can depart do so, leaving behind a more concentrated distillation of poverty.
In cities studied by Richard Nathan, the public policy expert at the State University of New York, Albany, the percentage of poor blacks trapped in extremely poor neighborhoods increased from 25 percent to nearly 40 during the 1970's.
The Reagan Administration compounded the problem by cutting back Federal grants for housing, education and public works. Over the past decade, Washington has whittled its share of state and local budgets from 25 percent to 17.
There is little logic and no fairness in asking city taxpayers to pay for the poor on the same basis that they pay for schools and garbage collection. Social welfare is different. The poor are not their poor but America's poor, and being poor, they are drawn to big cities.
Forced to assume the consequent costs, cities and states are prompted to drive benefits lower, hoping the poor will settle elsewhere. No wonder states have passively allowed inflation to eat into the value of their welfare benefits. Welfare is a national problem that demands a Federal solution. Only a Federal program can guarantee that everyone will pay a fair share.
The point is not that Iowa farmers or Marin County lawyers should be asked to bail out New York. It is that New York and other big cities are strapped and, even with the best will in the world, cannot long continue to pay everyone else's bill.

HEADLINE: Why

BYLINE: By Richard Nixon; Richard Nixon, the former President, is author most recently of "In the Arena."

DATELINE: WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.

 BODY:
It is time for some straight talk about why 400,000 young Americans spent Christmas in the deserts of Saudi Arabia and why in less than two weeks the U.S. may be once again at war.
We must first be clear about what the conflict is not about. 
 If we must resort to military force to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, it will not be a war about democracy. While our goal is to restore Kuwait's legitimate Government, it is hypocritical to suggest that we hope to bring democracy to Kuwait. Except for Israel, there are no democracies in the Mideast, and there will be none in the foreseeable future. The Emir of Kuwait is among the world's more benevolent dictators, but once he is back in his palace in Kuwait City, he will still be a dictator.
Nor is intervention justified because Saddam Hussein is a cruel leader. President Bush has been criticized for equating him with Hitler. Whether he is that bad is irrelevant. He is bad enough. His soldiers are murdering, torturing and raping defenseless Kuwaitis and pillaging their country. He violated international law by using chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds.
But if our policy were to punish cruel leaders, we would not be allied with Syria's President Hafez al-Assad. He ordered the massacre of 20,000 innocent people in the city of Hama in his own country, has supported international terrorism and presided over an army that has committed brutal atrocities in Lebanon. Both Syria and Iraq threaten our interests, but today Iraq poses a profoundly greater threat.
Those who fault President Bush for enlisting President Assad's support should remember Winston Churchill's classic rejoinder to those who criticized him for supporting Stalin after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union during World War II: "If Hitler invaded Hell, I think I would find a kind word to say about the Devil in the House of Commons."
We are in the Persian Gulf for two major reasons.
First, Saddam Hussein has unlimited ambitions to dominate one of the most important strategic areas in the world. When Senator Bob Dole said we were in the gulf for oil and Secretary of State James Baker said we were there for jobs, they were criticized for justifying our actions on purely selfish grounds. We should not apologize for defending our vital economic interests.
Had we not intervened, an international outlaw would today control more than 40 percent of the world's oil. While, by stringent energy conservation, the U.S. might be able to get along without oil from the Gulf, Western Europe and Japan could not. What happens to the economies of other great industrial nations directly affects the economy of the U.S. We cannot allow Mr. Hussein to blackmail us and our allies into accepting his aggressive goals by giving him a choke hold on our oil lifeline.
Because he has oil, he has the means to acquire the weapons he needs for aggression against his neighbors, eventually including nuclear weapons. If he succeeds in Kuwait, he will attack others, and he will use whatever weapons he has to achieve his goals. If we do not stop him now, we will have to stop him later, when the cost in young American lives will be infinitely greater.
There is an even more important long-term reason for rolling back Iraq's aggression. We cannot be sure, as many believe and hope, that we are entering into a new, post-cold-war era where armed aggression will no longer be an instrument of national policy. But we can be sure that if Saddam Hussein profits from aggression, other potential aggressors in the world will be tempted to wage war against their neighbors.
If we succeed in getting Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait in accordance with the U.N. resolution and in eliminating his capacity to wage war in the future -- which must be our goal if he refuses to get out peacefully and forces us to act militarily -- we will have the credibility to deter aggression elsewhere without sending American forces. The world will take seriously U.S. warnings against aggression.
Some critics argue that we should continue sanctions for as long as 18 months before resorting to force. They contend that even if sanctions do not work, Mr. Hussein will be so weakened that we will suffer fewer casualties if war does come.
They are wrong on three counts. First, while the Iraqi people suffer the effects of the sanctions, President Hussein will direct his resources so that the Iraqi military will not. Second, while the sanctions will weaken Iraq, they will weaken us even more, because of the political difficulty of holding our alliance together abroad and maintaining support for our troop commitment at home. Finally, the most the critics can claim is that it is possible that sanctions might work. It is certain that military force will work. The stakes are too high to risk failure.
Other critics believe diplomacy will eventually convince Saddam Hussein that he should get out of Kuwait. But neither diplomacy nor sanctions has a chance unless he knows that if he does not get out of Kuwait peacefully, the American people and our allies will be united in support of driving him out military.
Should Secretary Baker's meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, fail to produce an ageement that complies unconditionally with the U.N. resolution, we must remember that when dealing with an insatiable aggressor a bad peace is worse than war because it will inevitably lead to a bigger war.
If we must go to war, it will not be just a war about oil. It will not be a war about a tyrant's cruelty. It will not be a war about democracy. It will be a war about peace -- not just peace in our time, but peace for our children and grandchildren in the years ahead.
If Saddam Hussein gains in any way from his aggression, despite our unprecedented commitment of economic, diplomatic and military power, other aggressors will be encouraged to wage war against their neighbors and peace will be in jeopardy everywhere in the world. That is why our commitment in the gulf is a highly moral enterprise.

HEADLINE: Education Lobby Getting Crowded

BYLINE: By Karen De Witt

 BODY:
NEXT MONTH the higher education lobby in Washington, D.C., will swing into action when Congress takes up the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1986. Once, the most effective charge would have been led by the 27 education groups housed in the National Center for Higher Education -- more frequently referred to by its address, One Dupont Circle -- groups such as the American Council on Education, the National Council of University Research Administrators and the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation.
But in the last 10 to 15 years, the postsecondary education lobby has exploded in number and location. Today, education aides on Capitol Hill and officials in the Department of Education say that One Dupont Circle is no longer the center of higher education power. 
 "There has been such a significant proliferation of groups representing higher education that it very often gets confusing as to who actually speaks for college campuses," said Richard T. Jerue, staff director ofthe House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. "But the most effective associations today represent very targeted, very specific interests."
 
 
Effective Groups
 Discussions with education experts elicited the names of a few groups particularly effective in producing Federal regulations favorable to their constituencies or an increase in Federal financing for their programs. Among these are the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, the Consumer Bankers Association, the National Council of Educational Opportunity Associations, the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools, the National Associations of Independent Colleges and Universities and the Association of Independent Colleges and Schools. Only the last is at One Dupont.
Michael McPherson, an economics professor at Williams College and former Brookings Institution education policy analyst, noted that three of these groups were not education groups at all, but bankers and for-profit school organizations. The banks, Professor McPherson said, have been particularly successful in getting rules for student loan guarantees written in their favor.
"The way the rules are written for the payments that come to the banks," he said, "the banks are thoroughly insured against inflation risks. And whenever there are any proposals floated that would reduce the benefits banks would get, the banks warn that if their returns are cut, they will pull out of the program."
Many consider the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, which represents 3,200 campuses nationwide and 9,000 financial aid officers, to be the lead lobby because of the technical expertise of its president, Dallas Martin.
"He has a better grasp of the issues than Dupont Circle and understands the politics on the issues," said one Capitol Hill aide. "He is willing to take risks and say things that are not always status quo-oriented."
The power of the bankers and financial aid officers goes to theheart of a change in education that occurred more than 20 years ago, when Congress was working out the best way to assist American higher education. One faction thought Federal aid should be delivered directly to postsecondary institutions; the other, that aid should go to students. The groups at One Dupont lobbied for institutional aid: they lost.
 
 
'90% Student Aid'
 So today, a Congressional education committee aide explained, "Ninety percent of what we do up here on the Hill is student aid." He added: "In the last Congress, if you judge effectiveness by the budget increases, then student-aid groups did very well."
The organizations at One Dupont Circle are called presidential associations, because they almost exclusively represent college and university presidents. But spokesmen from the new groups contend that presidents don't deal with day-to-day issues such as student aid or student and research grants, which is why athletic academic standards, medical research using animals and other controversies caught the presidential groups off guard.
The traditional education lobbies have been further weakened by the growing diversity of their constituencies and the groups' hesitancy to play rough-and-tumble in the political arena. "They don't have political-action committees or make contributions or deliver a vote," said a staff member of the House Labor and Human Resources Committee. "All that works against them."
Robert Atwell is president of the American Council on Education, which has been particularly effective over the years in maintaining appropriations levels for the 1,800 institutions of higher education it represents. He has enjoyed considerably less success in persuading members to form a political-action committee.
Dr. Atwell said the presidential associations felt that such involvement meant "buyinginto an unhealthy dimension of American politics," and that they wanted to present themselves, the presidential associations, as something "other than just another interest group."
But the most dramatic example of the rise of a new education lobby that considers itself an interest group is the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools -- a rise tied to growth of student aid, narrow, targeted lobbying and an organizational makeover.
It represents 1,300 private, for-profit, accredited postsecondary institutions that train students in careers ranging from avionics maintenance to X-ray technician. Less than a decade ago, the organization's lobbying strategy was to stay low and keep quiet -- and with reason. Its members' reputations were less than exemplary, their public image frequently that of fly-by-night operations that promised training to low-income people but never delivered, and often the focus of investigations by the Federal Trade Commission.
 
 
A Strategy Shift
 That strategy shifted when the organization hired Stephen J. Blair as president in 1985. Mr. Blair had been director of policy and program development in the Federal Education Department's Office of Student Financial Assistance, responsible for policy and program development of the annual Federal student-aid programs.
One of his first actions was to collect data on who Natts' members were and how many students they served. He hired a public relations firm to help members reduce student default rates. When Congress began investigating default rates in postsecondary education, Natts had evidence that it was aware of the problem and doing something to correct it.
Mr. Blair also created a seven-member, full-time lobbying staff, assembled one of the few political-action committees in higher education.
"All of a sudden they were able to go out in the field and organize constituent groups," said John B. Lee, who runs a consulting firm in higher education.
But sensitivity to the marketplace isn't the only measure of an education lobby's influence.
The National Council of Educational Opportunity Associations persuaded Congress to increase its Federal financing by 38 percent, from $242 million in fiscal 1991 to $333 million in fiscal 1992.
The nine-year-old organization is a public-advocacy policy group representing intervention programs such as Upward Bound, Talent Search and Student Support Services, which help low-income and minority youngsters. "It was a very important victory," Dr. Mitchem said. "We argued that our programs were helping about a million students, only a fraction of the population that was eligible. We pointed out the changing demographics of the country and the productivity crisis and said, 'Hey, you can get more bang for your buck by increasing money for these programs, which help keep kids in school or help them go to school.' Talent Search and Upward Bound help with dropout. Eighty-two percent of people in Federal and state prisons are dropouts. It costs $16,000 to $20,000 a year to keep them there. Keeping a student in one of our programs costs about $2,000 a year. We had very effective witnesses on our side."
When Federal higher education programs come under the scrutiny of reauthorization next month, questions will come up such as whether student aid should be tied to educational outcome, what the structure of the system of student-aid delivery should be, whether private lenders work best in the program or whether there are other ways to deliver money to students, and what the appropriate balance is between grants and loans. At that point, no matter what their approach, whether loftily ethereal or eminently pragmatic, all the academics will be haunting the halls of Congress with something to say.

HEADLINE: R.O.T.C. Doesn't Want You

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher

 BODY:
THE Reserve Officers Training Corps, one of the best-financed Federal education programs in the 1980's and a rare source of scholarships for middle-class students ineligible for aid programs based on need, is shrinking in the 1990's.
The R.O.T.C. is a 74-year-old program to train military officers at colleges and universities other than the nation's three main military academies. Now it is cutting back recruitment, closing units and releasing some students from their military obligations. 
 Better relations with the Soviet Union have allowed the United States to trim its armed forces, including the number of officers. The American military deployment in the Persian Gulf has delayed but not stopped this process.
 
 
Fewer Opportunities
 Politicians and economists have been looking to reductions in military spending as a way to limit growth in the Federal budget deficit. But for thousands of Americans, a smaller R.O.T.C. means more limited educational opportunities.
Paul A. Merwin, a junior at Manhattan College from Hunter, N.Y., said an Army R.O.T.C. scholarship enabled him to study civil engineering. His father died when he was very young, his sister is in college and his mother has been working two jobs to support them. Without the scholarship, Mr. Merwin said, he would have had to attend a two-year college. "There are no two-year civil engineering colleges that I know of," he added.
For Ingrid R. Stabb, a senior from San Diego majoring in Russian studies at Columbia University, an Army R.O.T.C. scholarship meant attending an Ivy League school, not a state university in California. Ms. Stabb said family income made her ineligible for other financial aid. "My mother was in the hospital. The future looked uncertain. I really needed the scholarship," she said.
Yet in the last four years,combined enrollment in Army, Navy and Air Force R.O.T.C. fell 10 percent, to 86,000, while the number of scholarships was reduced by 21 percent, to 21,700, making the scholarships more competitive than ever. There were, for example, 11,421 applications last winter for 1,232 Navy R.O.T.C. scholarships starting in the current academic year, said Lieut. Comdr. Ray P. Kempisty, a Navy spokesman. No figures are available from any of the services on applications since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
The most dramatically shrinking R.O.T.C. program is that of the Army, which is closing 50 of its 416 college and university units and asking students at campuses no longer served to commute to campuses where programs remain.
In an even more drastic measure, all nonscholarship seniors in the Army R.O.T.C. were offered exemptions from military service last year. The Army ended up releasing 1,136 cadets and commissioning the remaining 8,217 as officers.
 
 
Air Force Cuts
 For the current academic year, the Army is commissioning only 6,000 officers. No decision has been made yet about offering releases from military service to this year's seniors, said Capt. Mary Ann Kilcullen, an Army spokeswoman.
The Air Force is reducing to 2,200 the number of R.O.T.C. cadets it commissions during the current academic year,from 2,335 during the last year and 2,823 the year before. An offer last spring to release seniors from military service attracted 104 cadets; a similar offer last autumn drew 141 more, said Terry S. Boksan, a civilian Air Force spokeswoman.
Scholarship cadets released from service must repay all benefits received over a 10-year period at an annual interest rate of 9 percent.
 
 
Navy Following Suit
 The Navy is reducing the number of incoming midshipmen for its R.O.T.C., which also trains officers for the Marine Corps. But it is not closing units or offering releases from military service.
"We do commission all of our graduates, and we intend to keep it that way," Commander Kempisty said.
Many R.O.T.C. students are finding that those commissions, and their school financing, come at an unexpected price.
Allan D. Barall, a senior majoring in business at New York University on an Army R.O.T.C. scholarship, said he was recently jeered when he walked in uniform past a demonstration in Greenwich Village against sending American troops to the Persian Gulf.
Faculties on several dozen campuses, including Harvard's have passed nonbinding resolutions asking that administrators expel campus R.O.T.C. units if they do not alter policies that exclude homosexuals. And the long-run value of military service to private-sector careers is being widely debated.
Stories abound of R.O.T.C. officers receiving dull postings that teach them little. But laudatory accounts are also easy to find. Randall . Tobias, one of two vice chairmen of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said he met his wife and learned to speak with confidence in public after he was assigned to teach at the Army's artillery school in Fort Sill, Okla. "Those are experiences that are difficult to duplicate in terms of leadership development," he said.

HEADLINE: Defeating Iraq Would Create Worse Problems;
Winners and Losers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Roger Fisher, professor of law at Harvard University and director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, has said that unless we answer two questions about Iraq's presence in Kuwait, we will be unable to resolve the conflict. The first is "What happens to Iraq if it remains in Kuwait?" The second is "What happens to Iraq if it withdraws?"
We are certainly addressing the first question. Economic sanctions have taken a tremendous toll on Iraq and its people, and President Bush's tough rhetoric and military presence are definite responses to the first question.
However, as Professor Fisher also points out, until we begin to address the second question, Saddam Hussein has no incentive to leave Kuwait, no matter how intolerable we make the circumstances. And until he sees that the fire won't be hotter than the frying pan, he will not leave.
The sanctions have not extricated President Hussein from Kuwait and restored the Kuwaiti Government because of our failure to address the second question. One problem with asking it is our very normal reaction against allowing Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait without being punished, even if all of our demands are met.
This view, however, assumes that there can be a winner and a loser (we win, they lose), which is clearly the option we would prefer. Yet, of the three scenarios, win-lose, win-win or lose-lose, the win-lose scenario is not practical or possible.
Resorting to military force, even assuming victory, would result in the loss of thousands of lives, create a schism in this country deeper than Vietnam, deepen an economic recession and perhaps lead to a depression, result in the loss of the oil fields we are there to protect, unite the Arab nations of the world against the United States, lead to terrorism within our borders, promote an attack on Israel and perhaps initiate the use of nuclear weapons. Thus, even in winning, we would lose.
When left with the remaining options, win-win or lose-lose, win-win becomes our best course. It is now time for us to discover creatively the win-win scenario.
With the President's deadline of Jan. 15, we had better get on with it quickly.

HEADLINE: School Finance: It's a Jungle

BYLINE: By William Celis 3d

 BODY:
In the world of school finance, these are unsettling times. From Texas to Mississippi to Illinois to Nebraska, states are struggling mightily to repair or reconfigure finance plans that are being challenged by parents and school districts or have already been struck down by courts as unconstitutional.
The embattled states, without exception, have long used finance formulas that lean heavily on local property taxes, a method that courts have increasingly rejected as unacceptable because they allow property-rich districts to spend more on students than property-poor districts do. The result, state and Federal courts have said, has been an inferior education for the children in less-affluent school systems. 
 The states' efforts to overhaul these property-based plans have given birth to a variety of approaches, most of which attempt to address inequities in financing. Other plans are designed to raise money to support education improvement statewide. Some ambitious efforts try to do both.
But state lawmakers have found the going exceedingly tough in the face of voter opposition to higher taxes, recently seen in Nebraska, Oklahoma and New Jersey; a sputtering economy, and the lack of models from which to learn.Texas, for example, home to some of the nation's richest and poorest school systems, is under court order to narrow the disparity in spending among them. Last summer, the State Legislature approved, and a reluctant governor signed, a $528 million package financed by a state sales tax increase.
But a state judge rejected the plan because, he said, it didn't go far enough in closing the school spending gap in a state where the richest district spends nearly $20,000 a year per pupil as against about $2,000 in the poorest district.
 
 
Tax Increase Likely
 In rejecting the proposal, State District Judge Scott McCown forced the newly elected Governor, Ann Richards, and the State Legislature back to the drawing board to produce a plan that likely will require tax increases in a state where the economy still is recovering from the oil industry's collapse in the mid-1980's.
Other states have approved school-equalization formulas, but not without a battle. Under a Nebraska plan, approved by state legislators last April, the state sales tax jumped to 5 cents from 4 cents and the state income tax was increased by 17.5 percent, generating $178.8 million on top of existing state education spending in the firstyear and $238.8 million more in the second. The plan bars property-rich school systems from raising spending in any year more than 4 percent, while allowing poorer districts to increase spending 6.5 percent.
State education officials called the plan a "shift-in-taxes" approach, because under the new system, districts will receive 45 percent of their aid from the state, up from 25 percent under the old system. Some Nebraskans, however, called it unfocused and tried to repeal it through a voter-led initiative on the ballot last November. The initiative failed.
Mississippi, by contrast, tried raising money generally for education spending without addressing spending differences among school systems. The state's three-year plan, which officials last year estimated would cost $250 million, addresses virtually every aspect of education programming, from early childhood to adult literacy. But the package approved last spring is stalled because of disagreement over how to best support improvements. Some lawmakers favor higher taxes; others do not. Later this month, the legislature will try to settle the issue.
Some states have attempted the near impossible by addressing both school-wealth inequities and overall educational improvements -- a one-two approach best seen in Kentucky.
In that state, which was under court order to revamp its entire school system, the Governor and the legislature worked together to boost a variety of taxes, including the sales tax, to 6 percent from 5 percent. The total package is expected to raise $1.3 billion to help support the first two years of a mammouth five-year plan to improve schools.

 Under Kentucky's plan, poor districts receive larger state aid and an additional allotment of state money if they raise their taxes to stipulated levels. According to state education officials, if all districts take advantage of this offer, spending differences between rich school districts and poor ones will narrow to 45 percent.
Critics believe that is still too large, while proponents of the new formula say it eliminates disparities that were sometimes triple that. "At least Kentucky tried to do it all," said John Augenblick, a Denver lawyer and school finance expert who worked on the Kentucky reconfiguration. "It bit the bullet, which most states don't even try to do."
Some education policymakers and local educators believe states blanch at voter opposition to higher taxes -- opposition that, they say, reflects an attitude among taxpayers that because they worked hard and bought homes in good neighborhoods with good public schools, parents in poor systems should do the same. "I'm sure there are feelings of resentment in some communities," said Charles L. Slater, superintendent of the Alamo Heights Independent School District, in San Antonio, which serves some of that city's more affluent students. Over all, though, Mr. Slater said, "Our feeling is that we are one part of San Antonio, and if we're going to have good services and successful people in our community we must have good education for everyone."

HEADLINE: SPECIAL REPORT;
A Learned Response

BYLINE: By Janet Elder

 BODY:
Think again if you think the ability to reason comes easily, if at all. Think again if you believe that scientists are about to solve the mystery of human thought and its underlying biochemistry. Still, Americans are increasingly recognizing the importance of reasoning skills and are trying to develop, hone and teach them to adults and children alike. The endeavor is commanding national attention and demanding individual thought.
 THINKING IS NOT like breathing, educators agree; it doesn't come naturally. Thoughts do, but the ability to organize, explain and defend those thoughts is more like learning to ride a bicycle. It's shaky going at first; training wheels and a steady, patient tutor are usually needed. But once mastered, the learner will always be able to get somewhere on his or her own steam. 
 That is why in kindergarten classrooms and college lecture halls, educators are starting to teach students to think. "Of course it's better if children start to learn this when they are young," said Carol Camper, director of critical thinking at Marymount College in Manhattan. "But learning to think is a permanent thing, so it's really never too late."
But what does it mean to think? Educators more often explain what thinking isn't than what it is. "It is not a collection of little skills," said Lauren Resnick, a psychology professor and director of the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh. "Its very nature resists precise forms of definition. It is an emergent process you can't predict."
Educators agree that critical thinking, creative thinking and reasoning are members of the family of "higher-order thinking." But definitions of higher-order thinking are vague. "What we mean is thinking through complicated issues in a fairly serious way," said Daniel P. Keating, professor of education at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, in Toronto. "Developmentally, that means different things at different ages."
 
 
From Stacking Blocks to Classifying Data
 For the 5-year-old, it may mean experimenting with different heights to find out how high you can pile blocks before they tumble down. For the college student it may mean figuring out what type of information is needed to compare major economic systems. Dr. Resnick, in her book "Education and Learning to Think," written for the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences, offers some of what educators seem to agree are characteristics of higher-order thinking: "It is complex, nonalgorithmic, yields multiple solutions and involves nuanced judgment."
The new classroom emphasis on learning to think results partly from the failure of the back-to-basics movement to educate children to think beyond the facts taught by rote. "We as a society are finally realizing that people are graduating from high school without learning how to synthesize large amounts of information," said Shari Castle, coordinator for research and development at the Center for Innovation, part of the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' organization. Dr. Castle added: "For educators that means moving away from rote learning"
But giving up the predictability of rote learning is difficult, for teachers and students alike. Teachers have to give up some classroom control and let students come up with their own ideas, said Robert J. Sternberg, professor of education at Yale University, adding, "Theyalso have to change their perspective. They have to see that giving kids the facts isn't enough."
For students, thinking means giving up the inertia of passive learning. "This society spoon-feeds them everything and doesn't encourage them to process deeply," Dr. Sternberg said. "After a certain age, it's hard to rock them out of their chairs." And when it comes to teaching them to think, he said: "Some of them long for the old days of being told what to do."
 
Where Thinking Reigns, Problems Vanish
 In classrooms where thinking is the heart of each day's mental workout, where right answers are no longer as important as right questions, problem students tend to disappear, educators say. "There is no such thing as a child who is intellectually lazy; they are just uninspired," said Perry Halkitis, a sixth-grade teacher at Hunter Elementary School, a public school for gifted children in New York City. "If you ask the right questions, kids dive right in. The function of the school is to help pull the information out of kids."
One such dispirited student was Peter Wilson, 11 years old, according to his mother, Yvette Wilson, an employee of the Social Security Administration from Berkeley, Calif., who said, "Nothing mattered to him emotionally, intellectually -- nothing." Then Peter took an algebra class designed to teach fourth-graders to think and trust their own ability to think. "Ms. Molnar's class lit a fire under him," Mrs. Wilson said. "He was like a puzzle -- his mind was in a million pieces. She helped him put it together into a beautiful picture."
There is another side to thinking. Educators are finding that children who learn how to think do better not only in school but in life. In Peter's case, thinking through the confusion of higher mathematics has helped him think through other tasks and activities. "When I fight with him now," Mrs. Wilson said, "he won't slam around and say, 'I want to do something.' He'll say, 'I want to do this because . . .' "
In Jane Molnar's class at Malcolm X School in Berkeley, children "discover" mathematics. Ms. Molnar asks the questions, but the class finds the answers through discussion and by reasoning with her and with one another. "The whole emphasis is on getting them to think, not to parrot the right answers," Ms. Molnar said. "At first it makes them anxious to just let a paradox emerge. But as the weeks go by they begin to trust their own instincts and ability to think."
Ms. Molnar's method was developed by William Johntz at the nonprofit Project Seed in Berkeley, whose intent was to bolster minority students' self-esteem.
Stimulating children to think abstractly, as Ms. Molnar and others do, goes against much of the groundwork laid by the psychologist Jean Piaget for early-childhood and elementary education. "Piaget said children are not able to think abstractly and we should leave them in a concrete mode with plenty of social interaction until they are ready," said Matthew Lipman, founder and director of the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children at Montclair State College in New Jersey. "That thinking has resulted in two generations of cognitively deprived children."
Dr. Lipman has used philosophy as the basis for a set of books designed to be used from kindergarten through high school as the catalyst for classroom discussion and exploration of philosophical ideas. Like Ms. Molnar, Dr. Lipman uses an abstract subject to teach children to learn by thinking, not memorizing. In the process, he says, teachers have told him that students are benefiting from enhanced self-esteem. "Being listened to by their peers is an intoxicating experience for children," Dr. Lipman said.
The other benefits of learning how to think are less easily envisioned. As Dr. Sternberg said: "One thing no one is thinking much about is that if we are successful at teaching children how to think, are we as a society prepared to deal with the consequences?"

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: 515 Park Avenue;
An Old Holdout Is Imperiled

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
WHEN it is viewed in a lineup with the other apartment houses of Park Avenue, nothing remarkable distinguishes 515 Park, built in 1912 at the southeast corner of 60th Street.
But in a quiet way, the 12-story building stands to play a part in the long-term evolution of land use that has characterized Manhattan real estate since the start of the 19th century. 
 Now the latest episode in this transition may have begun. The building stands vacant and dark, part of a site for an office development project begun years ago. Eventually, office use may displace residential use, as it has often before.
The electrification of the railroad under Park Avenue in the early 1900's produced a sudden wave of residential construction on what had been a middling street. The first of the luxury apartment houses was completed in 1907 at 471 Park and by 1910 a dozen were finished or under construction.
In 1911, John J. Hearn, a developer who was living in one of his own buildings at 417 Riverside Drive, near 113th Street, filed plans for a 12-story apartment house on the southeast corner of 60th, adjoining the Mineola garage at the northeast corner of 60th.
There were two apartments on a floor, of seven and nine rooms. Advertisements promised "every up-to-date improvement and convenience known to the builder's art" and the "advantages of a private house with the comforts and conveniences of an apartment."
"Park Avenue itself," the advertisements said, "is an unusually wide street, planted with grass and kept in apple pie order by the Department of Parks."
Rents ran from $200 to $300 a month.
The design of Hearn's architects, Denby & Nute, followed very closely that of their building at 417 Riverside Drive.
"Modern Renaissance" was the term of the period, with classically derived details in a stone base, brick midsection and terra cotta crown. Early tenants were what you might expect: Harris D. Colt, a founding partner of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle; Dr. Byron Stookey, a prominent neurologist, and Harry Ward, head of the Irving National Bank.
In late 1927, 515 Park was acquired by the Apperson Realty Corporation, controlled by William Randolph Hearst (Apperson was his mother's maiden name). Hearst was active in midtown real estate, buying established properties like the Lombardy Hotel and the Ritz Tower in this period. But he apparently bought 515 Park Avenue for development because early in 1929 Apperson petitioned the Board of Estimate for a zoning change for the corner.
All four corners at 60th and Park had been restricted to residential in the 1916 zoning resolution. Apperson claimed that the garage "operates day and night with the resultant noises and odors" making it difficult to rent apartments at 515. The zoning change was opposed by the Fifth Avenue Association, the Park Avenue Association and neighboring property owners, but the Board of Estimate approved it.
The Park Avenue Social Review, protesting what it called a "zoning subterfuge," said, "When a single corner is so designated, leaving the remaining three corners thus residential, we question the legality of such a procedure."
But apparently no suit was ever instituted. Hearst continued to buy adjacent property through 1931, eventually acquiring the four adjacent brownstones on 60th Street. But the Depression killed any plans for new construction and the assemblage was later broken up.
The zoning remained in place, however, and in 1958 the Jewish Agency, a social services group, acquired the building for its own use and gutted its interior in an office conversion.
In 1989, William Zeckendorf Jr. bought the building from the Jewish Agency, which moved out that year, and he confirms that he is interested in developing the site for "an overseas client," but is unsure of the actual shape of the project. In any event, he calls 515 Park Avenue "very ugly."
Mr. Zeckendorf has not acquired the adjacent brownstones at 106 and 108 East 60th Street, but according to the New York Association of the Blind, he is negotiating with them for air rights from their building at 110 East 60th Street.
Diana Elrod, a spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning, said current zoning would permit an office building of as much as 180,000 square feet on a combined site of 515 Park Avenue and the two brownstones, rising as high as 36 stories, although a lower, bulkier configuration would probably be more economical.
And if the market for office space does not seem promising?
Ms. Elrod noted that, despite the commercial zoning, city rules would allow something besides an office building on the site -- an apartment house.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 20, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A Streetscapes column on Jan. 6 about 515 Park Avenue referred incorrectly to 471 Park as the first luxury apartment house on Park Avenue. The first was at 449. Because of an editing error, both the headline and the index misstated the subject of the article. In addition, the article misstated the location of the now-demolished Mineola Garage. It was at the northeast corner of 59th Street and Park Avenue.

HEADLINE: Mr. Klug Goes to Washington: Winning Was Easy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Two months ago, Scott Klug of Wisconsin won an election to Congress and thereby entered an alien world. Now he grapples with what his chief aide calls "the monster" -- the letters, telephone calls, resumes and bureaucratic decisions that can engulf new lawmakers.
For Representative Klug, a 37-year-old former television anchorman who scored a stunning upset over the Democratic incumbent, Robert W. Kastenmeier, the pressure goes beyond just setting up an office in a new city and a new profession. 
 Mr. Klug says his performance in the 102d Congress is critical to his future in Washington. As a political novice and a freshman in the minority party, he has little influence. And the Democrats, he says, want his scalp.
"They've as much as said this is an aberration that will not stand," Mr. Klug said, referring to his election in a district that includes the liberal bastion of Madison. "The sandal crowd will be here forever, for better or worse, and I can never make them happy unless I become a Democrat, or more like a socialist."
 
'It's Culture Shock'
 While Mr. Klug's political challenges may be greater than those of some other newcomers, they have at least one thing in common.
"It's culture shock," said Rick Shapiro, director of the Congressional Management Foundation, a research organization that tries to help Congress operate more efficiently. "New members have been thrown into a new environment. And many of the decisions they make now are going to lock them on courses that they're going to follow for the rest of their terms."
Mr. Klug and the 43 other new House members were given guidance in seminars by the House Administration and Ethics Committees as well as a six-day program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
But as helpful as the conferences are, Mr. Klug said, the work can be distracting. "It was not so much that I was running around as it was that I had to sit in a room for eight hours a day when there were 9,000 other things to do," he said, referring to the Kennedy School session. "There I was, in a room with my hands folded, listening to a lecture on micro-economics. It's sort of like taking exams when you're about to get married."
 
Deciding Over Pizza
 Before he decided to run, Mr. Klug planned to go into the business side of journalism and was working on a master's degree in business administration at Northwestern. One night over pizza and beer a friend suggested he run against Mr. Kastenmeier.
"I do have a certain entrepreneurial spirit, and I wanted to be the captain of my own ship," Mr. Klug said. "In a lot of ways, Congress will be fun; it's something I've wanted to do for a long time."
Among the tasks Mr. Klug faced were hiring a staff, selecting a telephone system, deciding where to open a district office. He has had to make decisions ranging from ordering carpet to how to spend the $475,000 each member is granted to pay up to 18 full-time and four part-time aides.
Through it all, he has had to cope with what he views as an antiquated computer he inherited from Mr. Kastenmeier. "I don't think that Bob has sabotaged us," he said. "But they haven't exactly given us the world. When we turn on the computer it says, 'Hi' and not much more."
 
What About the Issues?
 On issues, Mr. Klug said he planned to begin modestly by focusing on the needs of his district, but he added that he would work to create laws to limit the terms that members can serve. He said he also wants to see safer conditions for farm workers and their children, tougher penalties for environmental polluters and a cap on government spending.
His administrative assistant, Brandon Scholz, the former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, will work most of the time in Madison with people who specialize in cutting red tape for constituents, Mr. Klug said. In Washington, Mr. Klug will keep a group of aides hired from other Congressional offices.
In addition to staffing his office, Mr. Klug must create a system to handle the flood of mail. The volume into Congressional offices has grown by 2,000 percent in the last 20 years, the Congressional Management Foundation says. Most members receive between 500 and 1,000 letters a week.
Asked how much mail he had got, Mr. Klug said: "I don't have any idea what's in there, and I don't want to look. I think they'll probably bring it into the office with a forklift truck."

HEADLINE: THE GUARD CHANGES; THE PROBLEMS REMAIN; Weicker Faces A Bumpy Road

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ON Wednesday, as the last echoes from Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s 19-gun inaugural salute die away over the State Capitol, Connecticut will begin its great experiment in non-party government -- or multi-party government, or whatever it is that the Weicker administration finally decides to call itself.
Some of the pomp and pageantry will hold to tradition. The Governor's Foot Guard, which attended the inauguration of Samuel Huntington in 1791, will be on hand, resplendent in red Grenadier uniforms and plumed busby hats. 
But other elements will be new. Mr. Weicker and Lieutenant Governor-elect Eunice S. Groark will take their oaths of office outdoors on the north steps of the Capitol, barring catastrophic weather. Most previous governors, including William A. O'Neill in 1983 and 1987, have held the ceremony in the Hall of the House.
 Despite the innovations, Connecticut faces a hard road, as Mr. Weicker has pointed out repeatedly since he entered the race as an independent candidate for governor last March. The state's coffers have been battered, with many businesses earning lower profits, and thus paying less corporate taxes; and many residents spending less money on cars and appliances, and thus paying less sales taxes. The state budget, which totals just over $7 billion, is expected to have a revenue shortfall of $670 million during the next six months and another $1.5 billion shortfall in the year that begins on July 1. When the state's budget documents were signed last year, revenue from the 8 percent sales tax, which provides about 40 percent of Connecticut's general-fund tax money, had been projected to grow by 3 percent. Last week, the Comptroller's office said that those revenues are now expected to show a decline of 3 percent. Unemployment, which stood at 4.1 percent in November 1989, now stands at 5.2 percent, according to preliminary figures for November from the State Labor Department. A University of Connecticut poll published last week by The Hartford Courant found that state residents had the gloomiest outlook about the future since surveys began in 1981.
 Some state lawmakers have said that Mr. Weicker's first task as Governor should be to convey hope to residents that things will get better, and Mr. Weicker's supporters and staff members say that that will not be a problem. The self-assurance that he has displayed over the years, which some people have called arrogance, may be just what the state needs now, said the Governor-elect's staff director for transition, Peter W. Gold.
 "He's very sure of himself," Mr. Gold said. "He doesn't lack for confidence in any way, shape or form. That probably bodes well for Connecticut."
 Whether Mr. Weicker's bravura form will translate into legislative success in dealing with the General Assembly remains to be seen. The Assembly, which Mr. Weicker will formally convene with his State of the State address following the swearing-in ceremony, remains firmly in the control of the Democrats, although changes have been apparent there as well.
 In the House of Representatives, where Mr. Weicker served in the mid-1960's as a young Republican legislator from Greenwich, the Democrats gained one seat in the November elections and now hold 89 seats to the Republicans' 62.
 In the Senate, by contrast, the Republicans have moved closer to parity with the Democrats but still remain the minority party, with 16 seats to the Democrats' 20. Before the election, the Democrats held a 10-vote margin, controlling 23 seats to the Republicans' 13.
 With an independent Governor taking office, however, and an administration shaping up composed of people from both parties, no one is quite sure that the old formulas of majority and minority will apply.
 
'Sending a Signal'
 Mr. Weicker spent his entire career in the Republican Party until last year and will certainly receive at least some support from that caucus. And as a liberal, he has always drawn support across party lines. His choice as budget director -- William J. Cibes Jr., a Democrat from New London and a legislative veteran who spent the past two grueling years as co-chairman of the tax-writing committee -- was significant, many lawmakers said.
 Mr. Weicker "was sending a signal," said Representative Janet Polinsky, a Democrat from Waterford and Deputy House Speaker. "He was saying, 'Hey, we are going to have to work together.' "

HEADLINE: Civil War Games for Modern-Day Lees

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THE climactic battle for the Shenandoah Valley, General Pickett's headlong charge at Gettysburg and the first and second battles of Manassas are the stuff Richard Berg has fashioned a business from. Mr. Berg, 47 years old, a former New York City criminal defense lawyer, is the inventor of more than a dozen Civil War games designed to give Civil War buffs an opportunity to change history.
"I think of the games as paper time machines that re-create the Civil War," Mr. Berg said. "We give players the battlefield, the soldiers and the basic rules. Then it's up to them to do what they will with them. For instance, take Gettysburg; if General Lee had not stopped early on July 1, because his troops were tired, even though he had a couple of hours of daylight left, the outcome of the battle and the Civil War might have been very different. You can see it on the board." 
 Explaining that Union forces had not yet established a defensive position that fateful day, on Cemetery Ridge and Culps Hill, Mr. Berg pointed out, had General Lee kept going, the Union troops might have been forced to withdraw.
 
One Was Voted Best Game
 Several editions of his game on Gettysburg, Terrible Swift Sword, have been strong sellers and one has been voted best game of the year by the game industry. "More than 50,000 people have bought the games to see if they can do better than General Lee," Mr. Berg said. "A third edition is in the works now."
Mr. Berg began designing games as a hobby when he was a high-school student at Poly Prep in Brooklyn. As an adult, he became a contributor to S.P.I., a military and history magazine. "A strategy and tactics game is included in every issue," he said. "My assignment was to come up with a game for them. The one I did on the Crusades is still in existence. The magazine grew rapidly and the games began to attract a following. Eventually, I began designing board games for the general market. Terrible Swift Sword was my second board game." Inventing games was his avocation, he said, until a few years ago when the pressure stemming from his job as a criminal defense lawyer began to get to him.
"It wasn't exactly burnout, but something close to it," he said. "On the other hand, I was getting a tremendous amount of satisfaction doing my games and I thought, well, maybe I can make money doing what I want to do," he recalled. "I recall being somewhat apprehensive about my colleagues' reaction to my announcement that I was leaving the legal profession to become a game designer full time, but I needn't have worried. When I made the announcement, they all wanted to join me."
 
How the Business Was Built
 However, Mr. Berg said he made the change slowly, a step at a time. "I resigned from my job, did a lot of research, and founded a company, Simulation Design, with a partner, Thaddeus Kubits, who furnished some of the start-up capital. Mr. Kubits is a former client of mine. I did legal work for him in a civil case."
Mr. Berg set up an office in his Scarsdale home and began producing his games. The first step, he said, in designing a game is to do the board.
"After the research, which I enjoy thoroughly, I draw the maps. Then I write the rules," he said. "The basic rules are the same. But before I had a computer, I used to do them on the typewriter and they took forever. With the computer, I can move them around with ease."
A well-designed game, he said, plays fair and square with the players. "It should allow the players to see the alternatives before they make a move. Some games last longer than others. Some can be played in two hours, others are good for an entire weekend."
Although there has been heightened general interest in the Civil War, thanks to recent television programs, Mr. Berg said Americans have always been fascinated by the conflict.
"It's a war that has always attracted a large number of history buffs. They support three hefty magazines published solely on the Civil War."
Mr. Berg, who ranks himself as an ardent Civil War buff who is familiar with every regiment General Lee had in battle, also designs games on other subjects, such as his "Lord of the Rings" games and sports games.
 
The Biggestv Expense
 "Almost any event lends itself to a game," he said, "I've designed crisis-management games, and now we're working on one that is a reflection of the times. Business is the theme, and each player is out of work and trying to get another job."
Mr. Berg, who uses the services of free-lance professionals, noted that his biggest expense was for printing the board games.
"Our printing costs are phenomenal," he said. "We shopped around and looked at plants overseas that do the work much cheaper. But we found quality control in the Far East to be somewhat haphazard, primarily because of language differences. The slightest alteration in the wording of the rules, for instance, blows the whole game. So we now print at a plant in Dallas, where our main distributor is located."
The games, which retail in the $35 to $50 range, are distributed to hobby shops in Westchester, he said.
"It's a peak and valley business. October to December are busy months, then we fall off until late February, when the large hobby shows are held. But you can make money as a games publisher if you have a good reputation and a fairly good inventory. I'm inclined to think games are pretty recession-proof because when people have less money to spend on entertainment they'll be home more often and perhaps they play more games. The biggest game moneymaker of all time, Monopoly, was invented during the Great Depression."
When asked what made a good game, Mr. Berg replied, "A good game is different every time you play it. I give players many choices. And they are Hobson's-type choices of the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't variety. I like to build chaos and random events into the game; it makes it more interesting."
Mr. Berg said he got fan mail and an occasional irate letter from game players.
"People who play games are very passionate about them," he said. "I know, I am one of those types myself. On the other hand, my wife is indifferent to games. But I know groups who have played regularly three or four times a month for years. Most games are designed to be played by two to four players."
War games are always popular, he noted. "Look at the number of chess players," he said. "Chess is perhaps the oldest war game in existence." Mr. Berg, who is also a frequent lecturer at schools and historic societies in the county, said games are much under-used as a teaching tool.
"I hope to expand into the school market with specially designed games," he said. "Games are a marvelous way to get kids interested in history. It helps them understand why and how events occurred."

HEADLINE: Classroom Innovations Encourage Students and Teachers to Excel

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
IN some schools, a visiting parent usually means that a student is in trouble. But J. Brian Lally, a teacher at the Tashua School in Trumbull, has parents in the classroom so often that the pupils take their presence for granted. Parents help Mr. Lally teach everything from computers to cooking.
"You can tap a wealth of experience when you get parents involved," said Mr. Lally, whose innovations in the classroom recently won him national recognition in a contest conducted by two professional publications, American School Board Journal and Executive Educator. 
 Another winner from Connecticut, Mary A. VanDerMeid, developed a curriculum to teach students at Andover Elementary School about heroes. The program incorporated history, sociology, science and other subjects to teach students about figures like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and about the kind of heroes who emerge from emergencies like earthquakes, fires or floods.
 
Beyond Ninja Turtles
 "It was something to present a set of values to kids," Ms. VanDerMeid said. "Our goal was to broaden their outlook, so they didn't just think of Mutant Ninja Turtles when they were asked to name a hero."
Four Connecticut programs were among the 88 recognized by the contest. The other two were an oral-history project developed by John Vincenzo, a teacher in Newington, and a program to intoduce New Haven's high school students to colleges, begun by the district's supervisor of guidance and counseling, Cynthia Beaver.
"There's a great deal of creativity going on in our public schools, but it's not well communicated to the public," said the executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, Terry P. Cassidy.
George A. Coleman, chief of curriculum and instruction bureau at the State Department of Education, said schools are finding new ways to capture children's interests. For instance, he said, he went to one school in Hartford recently that handed out calculators to kindergartners, so they could do more advanced, real-life problems, like as figuring how much change they would get back after making a purchase.
"The feeling is, once the students see an application for a concept, they get a lot more excited," Mr. Coleman said. "And once they understand the concept, they can use their time a lot more purposefully."
Trumbull's Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Edwin T. Merritt, said: "A combination of the recession we're in, which means there are fewer resources available to educators, and the situation in the world, where our kids are not performing as well as their counterparts in other countries, has scared parents and teachers into trying different ways of getting kids focused. Americans are creative, and when we're in a crisis we tend to do better. Clearly, we're in a crisis now."
In order for innovation to work, Dr. Merritt said, teachers have to know they have a relatively high degree of freedom in curriculum design. "When a system is tightly controlled from the top down, these things don't happen," he said.
 
Appreciation of Risks
 Mr. Coleman said the state has supported innovation as well, with its Teacher of the Year program, Celebration of Excellence awards, and awards of up to $25,000 from the Milken Foundation.
"As a department, we have looked for ways to appreciate those individual teachers and programs that are innovative and help students achieve," Mr. Coleman said. "It's given teachers more of an appreciation for taking a risk."
In addition to the support of administrators, the programs have been enthusiastically endorsed by parents, he said.
"There are parents who are concerned, they don't want us to give up on reading and writing," Mr. Coleman said. "But these programs are designed to enhance those skills, and once parents understand that, they become very supportive. "The kids come home from school excited, want to talk about it, and the parents are impressed."
Some of the innovations are originating outside the schools. The Windham Textile and History Museum, for instance, is testing a curriculum it developed that encourages students to research local history or family trees. The history lessons are more meaningful, because the children are learning about things in their own neighborhoods, said a spokeswoman for the museum, Linda Riquier.
"I wish I was a kid again, some of this stuff is so much fun," said Ms. Riquier. "The teachers who are using it are finding the kids are responding beautifully."
But most of the new ideas come from teachers. Mr. Vincenzo, a history teacher at Martin Kellogg Middle School in Newington, developed a program in which his students compile oral histories, which are published in a school magazine. Last year, the students learned about the Depression by interviewing people at a local nursing home. This year, the youngsters interviewed Vietnam War veterans at a local veterans hospital.
"Some of these veterans were on the verge of tears, even today, recalling what they went through," Mr. Vincenzo said. The interviews were much more emotionally charged, and more interesting, than reading a dry account of the war in a textbook, he said.
"A lot of the kids were quite apprehensive about going to the hospital, probably just because of the reputation of veterans' hospitals," Mr. Vincenzo said. "But the kids enjoyed it so much that the one student who was absent the day we went to the hospital found his own veteran to interview."
Mr. Lally said his award-winning program, Parents Getting Involved, was developed when he was teaching third grade. He had students and their parents write stories separately, then bring them to school to read aloud and critique.
It worked out so well, he said, that even when he switched to a kindergarten class this year, he continued to use the concept. Because the students are too young to write their own stories, though, he has parents keep a "Teddy Bear Journal," reading stories to their children and transcribing the children's reaction.
The more parents got involved with their children's schoolwork, the more they volunteered for other duties, Mr. Lally said. He now has parents coming in two or three days a week. Of 37 children in the two sections he teaches, parents of 21 come in regularly.
"It gives the parent a more realistic view of their own child's strengths or weaknesses," Mr. Lally said. "If the child is having a great deal of difficulty writing, the parent is going to be much more sensitive to the child's needs if they see that in the classroom.
"And another advantage is, in kindergarten, you need 13 arms and legs and about a thousand eyes. Just having another adult there can be a great help."
 
Finding Definitions
 Educators said that thematic teaching, as in Ms. VanDerMeid's program on heroes, is growing in popularity.
"When we surveyed kids in the beginning, the heroes were often rock stars and athletes," Ms. VanDerMeid said. But when those figures are caught using drugs or steroids, "kids get really disillusioned," she said.
"Our goal was not to give them one definition of hero," Ms. VanDerMeid said. "It's kind of like talking about love -- everyone has their own definition."
The program looked at heroes in history, at heroes in different countries and at how the definition of hero has changed.
"When you plan an all-school program, you have to have something that can cross all ages, all cultures," Ms. VanDerMeid said. "Schools get a lot of criticism nowadays that we're not doing enough. Whatever we do in education, we have to validate. But our kids are writing, are doing history, are doing oral presentations -- I don't think anyone can object to that kind of program."

JAPANESE TAKEOVERS
The Global Contest for Corporate Control.
By W. Carl Kester.
298 pp. Boston:
Harvard Business School Press. $29.95. 
 One chilly board-meeting morning in the mid-1970's, when I served as president of a joint-venture publishing company in Tokyo, I tried to amuse my Japanese colleagues with a story about the latest unfriendly takeover action in New York. They reacted with incredulity. "Takeover?" "Unfriendly?" These were fairly sophisticated Japanese businessmen -- from two major companies and one of the leading banks -- but they did not understand what I was talking about. That kind of merger did not fit the Japanese business thought pattern.
In the intervening 15 years Japanese executives have grown far more knowledgeable about the gang warfare of international business. They have bought into their share of companies around the world and even sustained the assaults of American takeover experts like T. Boone Pickens on their home ground. But their approach to the buying and selling of companies, at home or abroad, remains a very distinctive one, quite beyond the ken of the average Wall Street analyst. This distinctiveness, backed by the greatest cash reserves in the world and a very strong yen, has made them objects of considerable fear and superstition. After the purchases of Columbia Pictures, National Steel, Firestone and MCA, much of the American public is wondering where they will strike next.
W. Carl Kester, a professor at the Harvard Business School, gives us his answer in a coolly written and very informative book, "Japanese Takeovers." In the business of acquiring companies -- as opposed to purchasing more obvious targets like real estate and art masterpieces -- the Japanese, Mr. Kester says, are not nearly as grabby as is popularly supposed. Almost giving the lie to his subtitle, "The Global Contest for Corporate Control," he finds that a Japanese company or financial group will generally acquire another corporation only in pursuit of a product- or market-oriented business strategy, or to protect itself from either competition or the loss of a supplier. For the most part, the Japanese prefer to expand existing complementary relationships or make new ones. They tend to avoid mergers or acquisitions, intrinsically abrasive activities that are far harder on the cozy Japanese corporate culture than on the American.
Employing the business school case study approach, Mr. Kester backs up his conclusions with useful accounts of particular Japanese corporations -- Sony, Bridgestone and Dainippon Ink and Chemicals among them -- that have made acquisitions in the United States, as well as one American company, Merck, that has made a significant acquisition in Japan. He documents the very specific motives involved. But by far the most interesting part of his book is his discussion of the Japanese system of corporate governance, so totally different from ours.
After tracing the historic development of Japanese business, with its original close links to the 19th-century Meiji rulers, Mr. Kester depicts the contemporary Japanese company as the creature of various "stakeholders" rather than simply of shareholders and management, as is the case in the United States. These stakeholders include employees, the banks (which in Japan can hold shares in companies), related companies and affiliates, as well as the shareholders, who are not the top dogs they are in this country. Management, of course, plays a leading role. (My Japanese publishing company, for example, could not be sold without the consent of the management-dominated board of directors.) Corporate goals are the traditional Japanese ones of full employment, increased market share and long-term expansion. All this is well known.
Mr. Kester goes well beyond this picture, however, to show how, since the 1970's, a variety of factors have put heavy pressure on Japanese corporate patterns. These include the internationalization of business and financial markets, internal and external competitive pressures and excessive financial liquidity resulting from the massive corporate profits of recent years. Japanese companies are no longer as dependent on bank financing as they used to be. The acquisition of a company's stock by rich real estate and trading interests, ultimately with a takeover as the goal, has become more evident. At the same time, many companies have been forced into possibly unwise diversification in their efforts to hold on to their employees in the face of slowing growth.
Will these pressures edge Japan toward what one leading American investment banker, Joseph Perella of Wasserstein, Perella & Company, calls a "single standard of [merger and acquisition] dealmaking . . . the Anglo-Saxon standard"? Mr. Kester would like to say yes. "The genie is now out of the bottle," he writes, "as far as Japanese shareholder activism and contests for corporate control are concerned," and he expects some increase in takeover activity in coming years. But while he finds Japan's corporate governance system weakened, he understands that it is still very much in force. Foreigners ignore it at their peril. When he presents a hypothetical Japanese takeover drama, he cautiously dates it in 1997.
I would second such caution. The days of Japan's excessive liquidity are probably over. The Tokyo stock market has lost almost 50 percent of its value from its high point last year. The nation's big banks are potentially in as much trouble as their counterparts in the United States. And if the hugely inflated bubble in real estate values ever bursts, we shall witness the financial equivalent of the 1923 Tokyo earthquake -- in which case the reaction of Japanese business (and Government) will probably be to close ranks, regroup and charge again, in the traditional flying wedge formation. The corporate governance system -- which I would say pace Mr. Kester is as much cultural and political as economic -- will be vital to any such resurgence.
Nonetheless, despite my own rather different assessment of Japan's economic future, I would say that Mr. Kester has given us an excellent and lucid guide to Japanese corporate structure and behavior. His book has the added virtue of showing how financial deregulation, international trading and indeed Japan's very success have been changing Japanese business. Its present realities are quite different from the myths created about it. Mr. Kester show us how and why those realities are different, with an insight and a clarity rare in books on this well-worked subject.
 
PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN

Japan has lost the advantage of being small. Few if any large Japanese companies can rely on export growth today as heavily as in the past to maintain full employment while implementing (or even deferring) a plan for restructuring over a long time horizon. Indeed, just the opposite is true. The rest of the world is demanding that Japan help other economies by shifting its consumption patterns to include more imported items, and the charge is to do so fairly quickly.
Nevertheless, the basic impulse of Japanese managers today remains very much as before: to continue growth of the enterprise as a means of fulfilling the expectations of some key stakeholders (labor, in particular) and avoiding, or at least forestalling, potentially divisive and costly recontracting among the broad coalition of stakeholders making up the corporation. But what are the alternatives? For manufacturers in mature industries such as Nippon Steel, growth opportunities in existing core businesses are few if any. . . .
Moreover, attractive investment opportunities in the growth businesses most frequently targeted for entry by restructuring Japanese corporations -- telecommunications, computer electronics, advanced materials, and biotechnology -- tend to be shared with other competitors around the world. If new Japanese entrants to these businesses are to avoid being pre-empted by competitors, they must acquire market share at home and abroad at a faster pace than is generally afforded by internal development of products, manufacturing, and marketing know-how. Confronted with this reality, Japanese managers are gradually overcoming their unfamiliarity with, and even distaste for, mergers and acquisitions. -- From "Japanese Takeovers."

HEADLINE: Seattle, Too Much of a Good Thing?

BYLINE: By JON BOWERMASTER; Jon Bowermaster is co-author, with Will Steger, of "Crossing Antarctica," to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.

 BODY:
A FERRYBOAT WHISTLE SINGS OFF NEARBY ELLIOTT Bay and a warm rain dances off the awning that covers the sidewalk espresso stand -- one of a multitude that line the wide, spotless avenues of downtown Seattle. The streets are packed with people on the way to work in the gleaming skyscrapers that tower above Puget Sound or shop in the fashionable indoor malls that are the heart of the new downtown. The affluent crowd shuffling past is young, sharply dressed, upwardly mobile: for every briefcase, there's a backpack; for every pin stripe, a pair of blue jeans. Everyone looks fit and prosperous. The whole scene is an advertisement for the good life. I feel like I've stumbled onto the set of a credit-card commercial.
Over the last decade Seattle has gained a reputation as the adopted home of America's hip and young, but it was popular even before that; in the last 20 years there have been roughly three waves of immigration. The first began at the height of the 60's and featured Birkenstock-wearing, guru-following, back-to-earth peaceniks lured by the town's frontier charm and boundless natural beauty. Many came without jobs, opting for "quality of life" over career track. But as word of Seattle's laid-back pace and affordability got out (and as magazines insisted on labeling it the nation's "most livable city"), the migration swelled. During the late 1980's a quarter of a million people moved to this corner of the Northwest. 
 The second wave of newcomers was richer and better-educated than the first and represented more the Saab-driving, home-buying, conspicuous-consumption class. They came from the East Coast, the upper Midwest and California, burned out on big cities, attracted by Seattle's proximity to the great outdoors, its "big city" art and culture scene and flourishing computer software and import-export industries.
But the good word could hardly be confined to the yuppie pipeline. As the newcomers sprawled beyond the city's limits, their developments of town houses and split-levels swallowing farmlands and threatening to climb the nearby Cascade Mountains, they were joined by a third wave of paradise seekers. These were as likely to be of Hispanic or Asian origin as white, from Saigon as from Boston. Refugees from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand; laid-off factory workers from the Rust Belt; disillusioned Sun Belters; the underemployed and unemployed from around the nation -- like their predecessors, they came to Seattle because they'd heard it was a "better place."
In numbers, this last wave may have been less dramatic than the others, but there are plenty of representatives around. At an outdoor cafe, a black man in his early 30's -- neatly dressed in a white shirt, blue slacks and bow tie -- sits down and asks to borrow the sports pages. After a perfunctory swapping of scores, he introduces himself as Derrick Thomas and explains that he's lived in Seattle for just a month. A 13-year veteran of Chrysler in Detroit, he had just joined his wife and three sons, who preceded him two months earlier.
While it was lack of work that encouraged Thomas to search out a new home (he was laid off last January from his $15.65-an-hour assembly-line job), it was a quest for more basic security that finally lured him to Seattle. In recent years, he tells me, he had taken to wearing a bulletproof vest in his car when he drove to work through some of Detroit's worst neighborhoods; his eldest son, now 13, had been taunted at school by classmates waving wads of money they'd made selling crack; a friend's 15-year-old daughter was shot and killed while she sat on a neighbor's stoop.
In Seattle things improved immediately. Thomas's kids are doing better in school, his wife is working part-time, he's got an application in with Boeing, the area's biggest employer. There have been sacrifices, though. The best job he could find is busing tables in a cafeteria for just over minimum wage. Until recently, it was costing him more to live here, too. Thomas paid $350 a month for a four-bedroom house in Detroit; here he paid $550 for a two-bedroom apartment on Martin Luther King Jr. Way, a street in a rundown neighborhood, until he found an apartment in a low-income housing project. Unlike earlier newcomers to Seattle, Thomas did not come for the natural beauty that abounds but because the city has a reputation as a safe place -- and because it has jobs. "It's peaceful here, everybody seems to be nice," says Thomas, drawing a last puff on a cigarette. "I think we made the right move."

THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON THE NOTION that there must be a "better place" over the horizon. In the 1990's, we're still on the lookout for an American mecca. In the 60's, San Francisco (the Paris of the West) was reputed to be America's hottest city; in the 70's it was Denver. Eventually both were sullied -- the former by a skyrocketing cost of living, the latter by an economy tied to the vagaries of the oil industry. The hip moved on. In the 80's, Seattle became the place to be.
It's not hard to see why. From the bow of one of the city-financed ferries that deliver commuters across Elliott Bay, the skyline of Seattle shimmers and sparkles in the first light of day. Twenty-strong, the new buildings jut into the sky, their mirrored facades reflecting the snowcapped peak of Mount Rainier and the Puget Sound. Anchored to the north by the Space Needle, to the south by a crane-littered port where ships load and unload containers filled with everything from doorknobs to prefab buildings, the city sits poised on a thin isthmus between the bay and Lake Washington. Its waterfront is rimmed with a string of picturesque clam and oyster saloons; above them whirs a six-lane highway, bringing scores of commuters into downtown. Within easy reach are old-growth forests, glaciers, wild ocean beaches, national parks and Canada. Theaters, galleries, symphony, opera and ballet are first-rate and well attended; the downtown streets are lined with public art, from poetry carved in the sidewalks and engravings on manhole covers to sculptures by Henry Moore and Alexander Calder. Seattle spends more on arts per capita than nearly any other city in the nation.
Seattlites have always been proud of their image as a kind of last frontier. In the 80's, a strong economy nourished that pride. Boeing, the region's largest employer, with 104,000 workers and an annual payroll of $4 billion, was flourishing; the Seattle-Tacoma port had emerged as a center for Pacific Rim trade; the high-tech industry, dominated by the giant Microsoft and with 350 other software companies, was in a boom phase. While other downtowns withered, Seattle's prospered.
All this good word swelled the region's statistics. The population grew by 18 percent in the last decade (the national figure was only 9); unemployment is now at a 22-year low (3.4 percent). Demand drove the housing market wild: last year the average selling price of a house in Seattle was 40 percent higher than the year before, and it was not unusual for anxious buyers to line up three and four deep and make offers on the stoop.
People liked Seattle for its small-town, big-city mix and lack of pretension. Many came to start families. In a recent poll the most common reply to the question "What Is Your Favorite Place to Unwind After Work?" (asked by the Seattle Weekly) was "Home." Migration to Seattle was so intense in the last few years that it became virtually impossible to rent a U-Haul to the area; trucks and vans were getting stuck here. No one was leaving.
That nothing lasts is nowhere more conspicuous than in the United States. As the 90's dawned, Seattle -- and its booming suburbs and exurbs -- was beginning to pay the price for its good press. That price is easily measured: the rising cost of living is making it harder for the middle class to live within the city limits, and there is an emerging clash between rich and poor. Tolerance, moderation, the small-town virtues that attracted people, are in shorter supply. Seattle is no longer a quaint frontier town but a booming metropolis teetering precariously on the brink of becoming something it did not particularly seek to become: a big urban city, with all the advantages and headaches that accompany that designation.
Must the growth of a city inevitably lead to decay? That seems to be the pattern in this country, in "livable city" after "livable city." We populate our urban areas to the point of degradation, then abandon them. Our cities, like so many other products of contemporary life, are disposable. The advance of technology, the change from a manufacturing to a service and information-based economy and the accumulation of private wealth have made it possible for people and commerce to settle pretty much where they please. And settle we do -- over and over and over. The average American moves 11 times in a lifetime; nearly one-fifth of the population relocates each year. How long can this search for a "better place" continue before we have trashed them all?

TAKE A STROLL THROUGH OCCIDENTAL PARK, a brick-and-tree-lined commons just off First Avenue downtown. Homeless men loiter there; many curl up at night in the doorways of the hip coffee shops along First Avenue. Panhandlers energetically hustle the tourists, and crack dealers have made the corners around the well-known Pike Place Market their domain. Recent acts of gay-bashing have shaken the sanctity of downtown neighborhoods; racial attacks have unnerved city high schools. The school system is faced with large classes and an ineffective bureaucracy. Courts are overcrowded; plans for a new county jail are in the offing. Local businesses -- among them Weyerhauser, Boeing, major banks and airlines -- have recently announced layoffs. "It's a healthy economy, but it has plateaued," says Jim Hubert, editor of the Seattle-Everett Real Estate Research Report.
Seattle, more than most cities, is wary of outsiders. The relatively low housing prices of the mid-1980's attracted many equity-rich Californians, who sold their $750,000 homes in places like Orange County and bought similar houses here for a third of the price. Others bought inexpensive houses with good views and then tore them down and built neo-mansions in their place, raising tax assessments throughout the neighborhood. (Though the real-estate and home-construction boom abruptly ended in the past six months, the price of a home in neighborhoods like Queen Anne and Capitol Hill runs as high as half a million dollars.) Aggravating anti-outsider sentiment was the disclosure a few months ago that the Pike Place Market is actually owned by a Manhattan-based property management firm. Nor does it sit well that the city's professional baseball team, the Mariners, is owned by a businessman from Indianapolis, its football team by a California developer.
These days it is popular for Seattlites -- both old and new -- to blame their problems on this influx of newcomers. The biggest gripes are traffic congestion, air pollution, crime and the high cost of living. Voters proved they were against the "Manhattanization" of Seattle's skyline when in 1989 they forcefully ratified a cap on the height and size of downtown buildings. A growing faction has adopted the hostile rallying cry: "Have a Nice Day -- Somewhere Else."
Perhaps the worst result of Seattle's uncontrolled growth in the last few years is the effect it's having on the pristine environment that drew so many people to the Northwest in the first place. In the past the city was a leader in urban environmental policies: Seattle has one of the highest garbage collection rates in the nation in order to afford the best recycling program; 82 percent of the city's residents participate in curbside recycling. In November 1989, 70 percent of King County voters agreed to tax themselves a total of $117 million so that the county could buy 3,000 acres of open space and 70 miles of trails.
Now that "forever wild" posture appears to be wilting. A statewide initiative on the ballot last November would have provided $160 million to help communities enact and enforce growth controls and zoning laws. The complex proposal was defeated 3 to 1, losing in every one of the state's 39 counties. The opposition was well financed; it spent $1.5 million raised from developers, real-estate agencies, Boeing, Weyerhauser and others. But the defeat is seen as a signal that even pro-environmentalists are beginning to check their pocketbooks before voting.
Yet now more than ever the Seattle area needs environmental consciousness: its landfills will soon be full. (As a temporary solution, the city has hired Waste Management Inc. to haul its 400,000 tons of annual garbage to a cash-poor county in Oregon, beginning next April.) According to the state departments of Ecology and Health, 40 percent of Washington's recreational beaches are "seriously threatened by pollution." Traffic congestion around Seattle is so bad that on many summer days a haze clouds Mount Rainier from view. Every day the city is becoming more and more like the Southern California megalopolis it so detests.
Seattle's growth is limited by its physical boundaries, but the region continues to expand. The population of the surrounding three-county area grew by 21 percent in the 1980's, to an estimated 2.5 million, with another 200,000 people expected by 1995. Dairylands and truck farms are being replaced by strip malls and warehouses, surrounded by tract homes on cul-de-sacs. Laurie McCutcheon, a local demographer who has spent the last few years studying population shifts for some of Seattle's biggest firms, isn't convinced that government leaders are prepared to deal with this growth. "In the early part of the decade, Seattle dominated the county," she says, "but today the growth in the suburban cities is dwarfing it, and the whole balance of power is shifting. We are fighting tooth and nail over governance issues, like 'Should the county take over all government -- city, suburban, transportation, sewer and water?' "
David Bricklin, an environmental lawyer who headed the Initiative 547 drive, is even more skeptical. "When I moved here there were four tall buildings downtown," says Bricklin, a native of Philadelphia. "There was not a rush-hour traffic jam; now there are traffic jams any time of day or night, weekday or weekend. It took me an hour and a half to get from downtown to the airport the other day, in the middle of the afternoon. It is typically a 20-minute drive."
The problem is lack of foresight, he says. "We have virtually no mass transit -- no rail, no segregated bus ways. We are just now trying to develop a plan for mass transit from Seattle out into the suburbs, but that's a decade away at best."
Bricklin maintains that things are not as bleak as the 3-to-1 defeat of 547 indicates, but he still despairs: "Am I optimistic about Seattle's future? No, I don't think so."

FROM HIS OFFICE 12 stories above Fourth Avenue, first-term Mayor Norm Rice looks out on the skyscrapers that block the once clear view of the Puget Sound. Building more of them, he says, is not on his agenda. Mayor Rice understands that if he wants to govern a truly "great" city, expanding Seattle's diversity -- of economy, ethnicity and race -- is essential. It won't be easy, but Rice insists he is optimistic about Seattle's future. At the recent "urban summit" in New York, presided over by Mayor David N. Dinkins and attended by 35 big-city mayors, he appeared downright smug. A lot of mayors are struggling to save their cities; Rice is worrying about how to preserve his.
"Every major urban city is a magnet," he says, tugging at the knot of his tie and propping his feet on a glass-topped table. "Some people come in hope, some to hide. Some succeed, others fail. But as the number of people coming to Seattle who are unable to climb the ladder of success grows, they and their problems begin to consume your whole sense of what you want to do as a city."
The explosive growth of the last three years has been "great," Rice admits, "but I think it is possible for us to oversell ourselves." He also admits that he welcomes a slowdown in the economy and rising housing prices: both will slow the numbers moving to Seattle and give the city time to figure out how to accommodate the population that is already taxing existing facilities and services.
One of Mayor Rice's biggest challenges will be convincing Seattlites to stay and fight rather than head for the next mecca -- or the suburbs. "It used to be that when things like schools got bad the middle class would flee -- to a place like Seattle," he says. "But now all cities face the same problems. There is no 'better place' to escape to. People have to stick around and get involved if they want to save their schools and their neighborhoods."
Preparing the city for an increase in Asian, black and Hispanic minorities is also near the top of the Mayor's list. Seventy-five percent of Seattle's population of 512,000 is white. Rice, who is black, knows that Seattle must be successfully integrated if it is to make the transition from a "livable" city to an "international" city (as neighboring Vancouver has done so successfully). "Our biggest balancing act now is that we don't want a city that's all white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Seattle deserves a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic population."

AT A SMALL TABLE IN the Phnom Penh Noodle House, across the street from a sprawling Asian restaurant-grocery store-pharmacy-gift shop called Uwajimaya, I share a bowl of noodles with Lin Nouen, an 18-year-old Cambodian who has lived in Seattle just one month. Smiling broadly, he repeats how glad he is to be here. When he first moved to the States -- thanks to a sponsor in Austin, Minn. -- he'd been disillusioned. It was too cold, and there were too few Asians. He kept hearing that Seattle was the place to be, and he arranged a "transfer." Today, dressed in the uniform of a typical high-school junior -- stone-washed jeans and high-top sneakers -- he says it is better here than he ever expected. "In one month I make more friends than I made in eight in Minnesota."
Outside the window, Asians of all ages, armed with shopping bags and bus schedules, pop in and out of markets that line the streets, their shelves laden with seaweed, noodles, exotic fruits and sake. This neighborhood is called the International District: there are Filipino clothiers, Laotian-run bars, Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese newspapers, Asian welfare agencies, Korean movies and a Cambodian hair salon. Asians are Seattle's most visible import -- their population increased 16 percent between 1985 and 1988.
Lin says he is already investigating the job market. He hears there are $7-an-hour jobs at a clothes manufacturing shop and is considering quitting school to take one. "Already I like Seattle, very much," he says. "I think I may stay here, maybe all my life." He has sent word to family members -- scattered through Cambodia, Thailand and Laos -- that this is a good place.
Less than a mile from the International District, another kind of trade featuring another kind of immigrant flourishes as dusk settles over the port city. From near-downtown apartments and dilapidated wood-frame houses in the Rainier Valley neighborhood come street hustlers, crack dealers, whores and gang boys, eager to begin their day while the commuters are heading home. Up and down Pine and Pike streets, from Capitol Hill to the Alaskan Way viaduct, clusters of young toughs -- of a variety of ethnic groups -- gather on street corners. They hassle passers-by and peddle their illicit wares to drivers who cruise slowly by.
Police have been battling this "invasion" for several years, ever since Seattle became a favorite stopping-off point for gang members -- Crips and Bloods -- from Southern California. They came for the wide-open drug market, traveling straight up the Interstate 5 corridor that stretches from Los Angeles to Vancouver. Teen-age prostitution was already a problem downtown, and soon crack houses proliferated.
Then last summer a new explosion of cocaine dealers surfaced on the corners near the Pike Place Market. Patrols were beefed up; more of Seattle's first-in-the-nation mountain-bike cops were deployed. Mayor Rice and the City Council armed the police with a controversial new drug-trafficking and loitering ordinance that enabled them to arrest anyone observed selling drugs on the basis of "conspicuous actions," even when no contraband is found. "I worry when I see gangs hurting people on our streets, when I see gangs fighting in our parks," says the Mayor, "but the biggest issue facing us right now is the fine line between being 'tough on crime' and harassment. We have yet to come to grips with it."
The apartment of the novelist Tom Robbins looks out over this troubled neighborhood (known as "the Blade" because it is "on the edge"). From his window he can see signs of all the changes that the recent boom years have wrought on his adopted home (he moved here from Richmond, Va., in 1962): traffic jams, smog, street punks, skyscrapers. "In many ways this place was wilder 20 years ago," Robbins says. "The difference is, while it has always been easy to get beat up on these streets, 20 years ago you didn't worry about getting killed."
Now 54, the cult storyteller divides his time between Seattle and a house near the sound, an hour outside town. "The changes are all a matter of perspective," he says. "People who come here now rave about the place -- but I know that 15, 20 years ago Seattle really was paradise. For those of us who were here then, we do see the place today in much darker hues." He pauses and looks out on the neon-lit street below. "But I could live anywhere in the world, and I choose to live in Seattle."

UNLIKE MOST AMERICAN cities, Seattle enjoys a strong economy despite recessionary rumblings. Boeing appears to be on an unstoppable roll: profits for the year will exceed $1 billion and the company has a backlog of orders for nearly 2,000 jets, worth over $90 billion, enough to keep it busy through 1995.
"The only wild card in our future is what goes on in the Middle East," says Craig Martin, a spokesman for Boeing. "We can't predict exactly what the results would be if there is some kind of economic upheaval as a result. Barring a major shooting war, our outlook is pretty positive." Just before Christmas the company's Seattle office handed out holiday bonuses equal to 5 percent of each employee's salary -- a total of $253 million.
But Seattle's strongest economic card in coming years may be its proximity to the Pacific Rim. Closer by ship and air to Asian markets than any California city, the Port of Seattle is thriving: international air freight was up 8 percent last year; more than a million containers of cargo passed through the docks. It is also home to the $3 billion-a-year North Pacific fishing fleet. At a time when many big cities are cinching their belts, Seattle is expanding.
Shortly after this new decade began, David Brewster, publisher of the Seattle Weekly, gave warning about the obstacles that faced his adopted hometown (he came here from New Jersey in 1965): "The highest drama is to fashion a lasting marriage . . . to have vitality along with grace, hustle along with humaneness. Few American cities have managed to combine these qualities without toppling into giantism or heartlessness." That is still Seattle's challenge, but it won't be easy to achieve, especially given Americans' penchant for moving on instead of digging in.
Some of the more restless already have their bags packed. I met a fellow one afternoon outside the Osho Suravi Meditation Center (he'd moved here from Milwaukee five years earlier), and he explained why he would soon be heading for, in his words, "greener pastures." Greener? Really? "Seattle, for all its beauty, is just too big, too dirty, too congested. Don't tell anyone, but I know where the next mecca is," he whispered conspiratorially. "Burlington, Vermont."

HEADLINE: Despite Economic Woes, 2 States Seek More School Spending

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
When legislatures in Texas and Mississippi reconvene this week, they will renew their drives to raise more money for public education, in laborious efforts that have attracted widespread attention elsewhere.
The process is expected to be tumultuous in both states because of their weak economies and a broad-based reluctance to raise taxes. 
 Texas is being closely watched by several other states that, like Texas, have been forced by the courts to address inequities in public school financing. Mississippi, on the other hand, has voluntarily undertaken efforts to increase spending on education so that it can finance school improvements approved last year by the Legislature.
But the absence of serious discussion about new taxes and the weak economic conditions in both states have prompted experts on public and education policy to predict that the drives to raise more money for education will fail.
 
An Urgency in Texas
 "I think the situation in Texas is very grim," said Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "Mississippi is genuinely poor, but Texas doesn't have the excuse of being as poor.
Texas does, however, have an urgency to its agenda. The state faces a court deadline of Sept. 1 to come up with a new school finance plan.
"People think there will be progress," said Al Kaufman, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, which helped bring the lawsuit against the state in an effort to equalize financing among districts. "But not many people believe it will be easily solved."
An additional $2 billion a year is needed to correct disparities in school spending, say several education officials and state lawmakers. The average amount of money spent for each student in the state's richest school districts is about $20,000 a year, as against $2,000 per pupil annually in the state's poorest school systems.
An increase in the state sales tax passed in a special session of the Legislature last fall would have generated only $528 million, a sum rejected by a state judge as inadequate.
 
A Variety of Options
 In preliminary discussions, legislators, business leaders and community organizations have considered a variety of options, including the introduction of a lottery and the consolidation of school taxes on a countywide basis.
The notion of a lottery is not expected to be embraced in Texas, a state with conservative values, and the idea of consolidating tax revenue on a countywide basis has met with resistance from affluent school systems.
"We do not want to be consolidated with another school district," said Charles L. Slater, superintendent of the Alamo Heights Independent School District in San Antonio, which is in Bexar County, where there is a wide disparity in spending among districts. Alamo Heights, as one of the richer school systems in Bexar County, did not want to lose its property wealth advantage through the pooling of tax revenue, he said.
Lawmakers have also discussed a plan that would force the state to shoulder the brunt of supporting the public education system.
 
California Comparison Cited
 Under the current system, Texas pays about 50 percent and local tax revenue pays the other 50 percent. California, by comparison, supports about 85 percent of its public school system. But Texas legislators say such a plan would require huge infusions of cash that the state does not have.
There is a deep-rooted reluctance to raise existing taxes or create new ones, especially now, as Texans point to the absence of personal or corporate income taxes in a effort to lure business to a state that is still recovering from the collapse of the oil industry in the mid-1980's.
For Mississippi, the economy has long been an Achilles heel. Already poor by any national measure, and with a school system that ranks among the most deficient in the nation, Mississippi also faces a budget deficit of more than $100 million in the current fiscal year.
In addition, it is looking for ways to raise money for the broad three-year, $150-million education improvement plan passed last spring. Because of economic hardship, lawmakers are considering approaches that avoid new and higher taxes entirely. State officials have talked about higher prices for state services and about reducing the rebate given to people and companies for early tax payments.
Legislators believe the rebate plan will generate an additional $3.7 million toward the $30.6 million needed to put into effect the first year of the education improvement package.
 
Opposition to Lottery Idea
 Noticeably absent from revenue discussions in Mississippi is the use of a lottery. Gov. Ray Mabus strongly supports the lottery idea, but many religious, civic and business groups oppose it and have effectively killed it.
For all the opposition to taxes, there are indications that some people in both Mississippi and Texas are beginning to realize that raising taxes or creating new ones might be the only way to improve public education.
In a recent meeting of business executives in Jackson, Miss., for example, one executive lamented that he had to give a basic competency test to 400 people before he found qualified workers to fill 15 jobs.
"When you hear something like that from the business community, it helps drive the point home that we need better schools," said Kevin Vandenbroek, a spokesman for Governor Mabus.

HEADLINE: USX Reopening Talks With Steelworkers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The USX Corporation and the United Steelworkers of America will reopen negotiations today that could determine whether the nation's largest steelmaker can retain the edge in cheaper labor costs it has enjoyed over its rivals for two years.
USX's contract with 18,000 steelworkers expires at the end of this month. Talks between management and the steelworkers on a new four-year contract broke down six weeks ago. Industry analysts and experts say it is too soon to tell if USX, which suffered through a six-month shutdown four years ago, will have another strike on its hands. 
 "It would make no sense for the situation to result in a strike," said Ben Fischer, director of labor studies at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. "But sense does not always govern these situations, and it is certainly a possibility."
While many experts contend that the economy has declined too deeply for either side to accept a strike, some USX customers, preparing for the worst, are already lining up other suppliers, and USX has itself been building up inventories to keep customers in steel during a strike.
Both sides are still far apart on all basic issues. The steelworkers are pushing for job protection for employees in case USX's steel business is sold or spun off as some shareholders hope and as management has said it will consider doing. The union also wants wage and benefit increases comparable to the 5 to 10 percent raises provided in 1989 by the five other leading steelmakers to employees over the life of their contracts.
 
Harsher Climate Today
 These companies negotiated contracts when the market for steel was healthier. Because of the harsher conditions now, USX is proposing a more modest increase, tied to improvements in quality. Some analysts doubt that USX will succeed in selling its proposal to workers because the steelmaker is still faring better than many competitors.
A strike would delight the company's besieged rivals. Steel industry operating profits plunged by half, to $890 million, in the first nine months of 1990 over the similar period of 1989. Steel prices have tumbled nearly 10 percent in the last year as demand has fallen for steel for automobiles and appliances.
 
Contingency Plans
 A strike at USX would tighten supplies, cause steel prices to climb and give other steelmakers a chance to win customers from USX.
Thomas J. Usher, who has been president of the company's steel division since September, said he was optimistic about reaching an agreement, although "neither side has changed their basic objectives." But he said the company has "a lot of different contingency plans" if a strike occurs.
Still, a few customers say they have begun looking elsewhere for steel to keep a steady, uninterrupted supply. "We aren't abandoning USX altogether so far," said the purchasing manager of a large Midwestern steel service center. "But we have started increasing our purchases from LTV and others."
 
Pressure to Spin Off Steel
 The contract talks come at a time when USX is in transition. Steel, the company's main business just 10 years ago, now accounts for less than a third of its sales. And USX's largest investor, Carl C. Icahn, is again prodding the company to separate the steel operations from USX's vast energy holdings.
Mr. Icahn, who holds 13.3 percent of USX's shares and last year waged an unsuccessful proxy battle on a resolution to spin off or sell the steel business, disclosed two months ago that he had formed a new shareholder committee to press again to unload the steel business.
There are other reasons why the union is pushing for job protection. Union officials pointed out that the company conducted talks last year with British Steel P.L.C. about a possible acquisition of the steel business. USX also announced last fall that it was transferring the steel operation to a wholly owned subsidiary, which industry analysts saw as a move by the company to prepare the steel business for a sale.
 
Union Concessions
 The unions are also seeking to eliminate the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker's labor-cost advantage in an era in which $1 or $2 an hour in operating costs can mean the difference between profit and loss. USX spends $22.83 on labor to produce a ton of steel, compared with the $24.50 spent by the second-lowest-cost producer, the Inland Steel Corporation, and $26.85 by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest producer.
The union contends that its workers made huge sacrifices during the money-losing years of the early 1980's, when they agreed to concessions that they say diminished their wages and benefits by 9 percent in 1983 and by an additional 8 percent in 1987. The union regained some of those wages under the 1987 agreement, but workers are still at roughly their 1982 pay level.
"At this point we are apart on wages, benefits, health insurance for retirees, and, of course, the question of successorship," said Richard F. Fontana, a spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based union. "The question of protecting jobs if the steel company changes ownership is particularly important because of what is going on with Carl Icahn."
 
An Industry in Recession
 Mr. Fontana is also critical of the company's plan to link pay increases to improved quality, arguing that "the requirements for a payout are so difficult to achieve that we believe that it would be unlikely that a payout would be possible."
Many analysts say that the company will press hard to maintain its labor-cost advantage. "It is a difficult time for USX to match the other pay levels because the industry is in a recession," said John Jacobson, a steel analyst with AUS Consultants in Philadelphia.
Still, others contend that the company's steel business will fare better than most because USX derives more of its business than its major rivals from the pipe and tubular steel market, which is holding firm because of sales to the oil industry. "In profitability, USX has led the pack," said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group, a market research firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
That will make it hard for USX to depict itself in the contract talks as having more formidable problems than its competitors. "They have a broader market scope because they are more tied to oil, energy and capital goods, instead of solely relying on the automotive market," Mr. Plummer said. "And USX has a completely funded pension plan, which most of the others do not. I think we will find that these will be difficult negotiations."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Profitable Year For Global Bonds

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
INVESTORS in government bonds around the world generally fared much better than their counterparts in stocks last year. The government bond markets in Britain, Spain, Italy and Australia all posted big gains. In the two worst-performing markets, Japan and Germany, a strong fourth quarter enabled investors to break even. That was better than the stock market did in 1990 and much bettter than the bond markets did in 1989.
Rising interest rates sent bond prices down sharply in Germany and Japan. But already high and relatively stable interest rates -- in Britain, Australia, Spain and Italy -- brought in strong returns for investors. In Australia, Spain and Italy, government bond buyers got extra help as rates declined, pushing bond prices up and giving bonds in those markets the only capital gains for the year in the 11 countries that make up the J. P. Morgan Government Bond Index. Except for Australia and Canada, a declining dollar increased all the returns. 
 In the 11 major markets that make up the index, total returns were up 6.97 percent for the year in terms of local currency. Excluding the United States, which was up 8.64 percent, the 10 other countries were up 4.77 percent.
Americans who bought government bonds abroad did much better, as the decline in the dollar over the year provided on average about 70 percent of their returns when the bonds in stronger foreign currencies were turned back into dollars. Over all, the weak dollar was enough to triple to 15.64 percent the average return in the 10 markets outside the United States.
The dollar's weakness was even able to turn a barely perceptible 0.78 percent gain at home in Japan to a 7.2 percent return for Americans. The dollar translated a 1.09 percent gain in German bonds in local currency into a 14.8 percent return for Americans.
Stock markets in these 10 countries outside the United States all declined in dollar terms, according to the Financial Times world index. Only British stocks rose in local currency, but the 4.40 percent rise was less than half the gain posted by bonds. In local terms, the stock markets were off 32.45 percent. When adjusted into dollars, the loss was trimmed to 26.10 percent.
The overall performance of government bonds for the year far outdistanced that of 1989, when the dollar's rally against the Japanese yen at the end of the year helped to drag down gains outside the United States. In dollar terms, the return declined 2.27 percent for 1989.
The best bond markets in dollar terms were Britain, with a 31.30 percent total return, and Spain, with a 31.07 percent return. In Britain, the Government kept interest rates high all year, with only a percentage point decline in the fall, to 14 percent. These rates, combined with the country's entry into the European Monetary System, also pushed the pound sharply higher, which accounted for 63 percent of the return for Americans.
In Spain, the same combination of high rates and a strong currency worked again. The strength of the peseta accounted for 46 percent of the total return.
Australia was the best for local investors, rising 18.81 percent. It had the best capital gain on bond prices, up 5 percent for the year, as interest rates declined in the fourth quarter. But for American investors, the gain was reduced to 16.25 percent in dollar terms, the seventh-best showing out of the 11 countries. A decline in the Australian dollar caused by lower interest rates was the reason for the lower return.
Canada was the one bond market that did not perform all that well last year despite high interest rates. The Canadian market rose only 7.41 percent in local terms. Interest rates did decline in the fourth quarter, which helped raise bond prices by 2.53 percent, the best in the 11 countries. But that was not enough to offset losses earlier in the year. The weakening Canadian dollar also cut slightly into the return for Americans, which was 7.23 percent.
In the fourth quarter, Japan's bond market was helped by falling yields, which pushed up prices. That helped cut in half the capital gains losses for the year. In Germany, the gain at the end of the year came mostly from the dollar, which accounted for 65 percent of the total return.
Going into 1991, both the German and the Japanese bond markets face the prospect of continued high interest rates. Interest rates could even rise in Germany as the central bank, the Bundesbank, seeks to curb the inflationary impact of the unification of Germany.
Because of the recession in Britain and the slowing of growth in the rest of Europe, including France, interest rates are expected to fall there, which is why some analysts are still betting on the European bond markets.
