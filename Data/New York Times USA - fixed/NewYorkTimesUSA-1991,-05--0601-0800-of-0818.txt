HEADLINE: Back in the Maelstrom; Filming Resumes

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
In any other season, it might have been just another New York nightmare. A film crew had cordoned off 40th Street and Eighth Avenue, and angry cabdrivers were leaning on their horns. The midtown Manhattan sun blasted pedestrians as they detoured past the pavement where the actress Michelle Pfeiffer was shooting a scene. Hustlers and hawkers, beggars and bag ladies were dislodged from their customary territories. In short, it was a mess.
 
Welcome Element of the Raw
 "It's beautiful, just beautiful," said Garry Marshall, the producer and director of "Frankie and Johnny." 
 The $29 million Paramount Pictures film is the first -- and so far only -- production to return to New York City under the rules of the new contract that was approved last Thursday by film-crafts union members, ending a seven-month Hollywood boycott of feature films in the city. Reversing an earlier vote, the rank and file of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators accepted a settlement with Hollywood producers.
"It's a raw beauty here in New York, to be sure," said Mr. Marshall, whose credits include "Pretty Woman" and "Flamingo Kid." He smiled as an Emerency Medical Service siren began yowping. "But this picture is all about raw beauty."
Al Pacino and Ms. Pfeiffer star in the film, based on "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," Terrence McNally's 1987 play about the possibilities of love after the age of 40. The film is the story of Johnny, an ardent short-order cook who calls himself "knight of the grill," and Frankie, a sarcastic waitress who works in the same greasy spoon.
 Such a public arrival of a major movie production in midtown was proof of the end of a bitter stalemate that had virtually shut down major-studio filming in New York City, and cost the city $100 million worth of movie business, according to an estimate by the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcast.
Mr. Marshall said, "New York was essential to our film, and we're very fortunate to be here." He will shoot for five days in the city, filming Ms. Pfeiffer and Mr. Pacino in exterior locations, as they stroll down streets, wander in the park and go in and out of buildings. The two stars declined to be interviewed.
"It's great to be back out on the street," said Joe Trammell, a video technician on the set who has been a member of Local 52 for five years. "Seven months is a long time. I worked only four union days since last Oct. 31." Before the boycott, Mr. Trammell had worked on 25 movies in 2 years.
"This is the first time I've worked this year," said Dick Kratina, the production's camera operator. "I was on unemployment for a while, and then I dipped into my savings." Mr. Kratina's union, Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries, accepted the agreement with the Hollywood producers on May 3.
The "Frankie and Johnny" production began shooting in Los Angeles last January, and Mr. Marshall had planned to film in New York in mid-April. But after Local 52's April 15 vote rejecting the contract settlement, at least 10 films were steered away from New York City, including "Frankie and Johnny."
Thus far "Frankie and Johnny" has been the only major studio film to return. "It'll probably be August before we see considerable activity, given the lead time needed for productions," said Nina Streich, the deputy director of the Mayor's film office.
Last week's settlement was viewed by film makers as a breakthrough that would bring substantial savings to producers for night and weekend shooting, which had previously entailed substantial overtime.
"I think the new contract will bring many more productions to New York City," said Alexandra Rose, an executive producer of "Frankie and Johnny."
The rank and file wasn't as sure as Ms. Rose. "The producers promised that there would be more work for us, but no one really knows," said Mr. Kratina, the camera operator.
"But I feel optimistic." He smiled. "In this business, you've absolutely got to be."
While the contract will significantly increase health-care and pension benefits, it will also reduce wages more than 30 percent, said to Walter Stocklin, the former president of Local 52, who resigned from his post on Tuesday, citing "personal reasons" in a prepared statement.
"I voted against the settlement," said Kathleen Dolan, the set decorator on "Frankie and Johnny" who has been a member of Local 52 for 14 years. "The producers took too much away from us, in a year during which they've made billions."
"I don't think I'll ever make what I used to earn under the old contract," said Mr. McDermott, who was also skeptical that work in New York would increase. "It's not going to be any busier than it used to be."
 
And So, Back to Abnormal
 But for now, at least, all was busyness on the impromptu movie set. Leather-lunged production assistants steered passers-by and star-seekers away from Ms. Pfeiffer, as she ambled down Eighth Avenue in a mousy gray coat while the camera rolled.
New Yorkers, deprived of the street-clogging trailers and traffic-stopping bustle of a star-studded movie set for more than half a year, seemed all too ready to resume their old roles of gawkers, rubberneckers and sidewalk superintendants.

HEADLINE: Redeeming Albany's Sorry Record

 BODY:
Astoundingly, Gov. Mario Cuomo and New York's legislative leaders have yet to agree on a budget -- 52 days after they were required by law to produce one. That's a record. The word from Albany is that the Governor and lawmakers are finally talking to each other, however sullenly. That's good news, of a sort. But the news would be better still if the state's leaders would also confront New York City's fiscal crisis.
New York City and New York State cannot be thought of separately. Yet even after months of delay, Albany's key players have yet to address the city's problems in any sustained and comprehensive fashion. 
 At the urging of Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, the state is likely to cough up more aid. But it may not be enough to prevent even greater cuts in city services than those already threatened in Mayor David Dinkins's proposed budget. The city's economy is not improving and some of the Mayor's revenue assumptions seem unduly optimistic.
If Mr. Cuomo would exercise the kind of leadership his predecessor, Hugh Carey, demonstrated during the city's last fiscal crisis, he might use these final days of high-pressure bargaining to assemble at least the elements of a long-term plan for the city -- a plan involving not just state aid but services, taxation and spending.
That, of course, may be asking too much of state leaders who cannot get their own act together. So far, their dithering and dawdling have created nothing but damage, forcing localities all over the state to meet day-to-day needs by borrowing at high interest rates. The delay has already cost New York City alone $19 million, and the longer the wait, the less tolerable it becomes.
The city can handle near-term problems, like meeting its payroll and selling bonds, albeit with some difficulty. The long-term impact of the budget crisis on everything from children to bridges to street lights is depressing to think about.
If Mr. Cuomo would use this final phase in a long, undistinguished budget season to begin to address the city's fundamental problems, it might be worth the record-breaking wait. Otherwise, it will remain an embarrassing footnote to an embarrassing year.

HEADLINE: Smaller Families, Bigger Futures

 BODY:
A Republican President of the United States once made stirring comments about the importance of birth control. "Governments must act and private citizens cooperate urgently through voluntary means to secure this right for all people," Dwight D. Eisenhower said. "Failure would limit the expectation of future generations to abject poverty and suffering and bring down upon us history's condemnation."
During the last 25 years many governments, and the United States Government in particular, have indeed acted to secure the right to birth control information and technology. The results, described in a new report from the United Nations, are remarkable. 
 Thirty years ago, fewer than 10 percent of couples in developing countries used some kind of birth control. Today more than half do. In Latin America and Asia, women are giving birth to three or four children where once they had six. And in Africa, where the fertility rate is highest and contraceptive use lowest, births are starting to decline.
Even so, the multiplication rate remains awesome, and so do its consequences: the impoverishment of the planet and many of its inhabitants. The 1990's represent America's chance to make an extraordinary impact on the future -- by resuming the leadership of international family planning efforts it renounced during the Reagan years.
At the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, the United States announced it would try to end financial aid to any agency that so much as mentioned abortion. The Agency for International Development then withdrew funding from the U.N. Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation.
Last week, the Population Crisis Committee, a Washington research and advocacy group, sent recommendations on global population control to Congress. They deserve serious consideration by legislators and by anyone concerned about world population, mass poverty and the environment -- and, above all, by the current Republican tenant in the White House. The group seeks renewed support for the U.N. fund and the federation; a substantial budget for A.I.D.'s population programs, and more comprehensive approaches to family planning.
"A.I.D. programs are plagued by the ghost of the Reagan Administration," says Sharon Camp, a senior vice president of the population crisis group. It's well past time to shake off that ghost of the past, for the sake of the future.

HEADLINE: Irony in Health Care: Loss of Local Control

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clearly the time for piecemeal reforms and Band-Aid approaches to reforming a system that eats up more than 12 percent of our gross national product, while leaving millions of citizens with substandard or even no medical care, is over, especially when Canadians, Swedes, Britons and others have proved it can all be done much more humanely and cheaply. Your series "The Price of Health" (front pages, April 28 to May 2) missed one area, however: the loss of local control over health services. 
 It is one of the ironies of the health care mess that as Washington reformers turned to the marketplace for solutions, hoping consumer choice would help cut costs, consumers lost what little control they once had. Why? Along with medicine has come corporatization.
Today, 25 percent of American hospitals are either owned or run by corporate chains that determine in remote corporate boardrooms local hospital policies, levels and kinds of service offered, and even whether or not a hospital will stay open. Many more hospitals, formerly run locally by nonprofit boards, are echoing this trend and surrendering financial control to large parent organizations. Where the rest of the modern industrial world is getting socialized medicine, here in America we're getting corporate medicine.

HEADLINE: Libraries Can't Ban the Homeless, U.S. Court in Newark Rules

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., May 22

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled today that public libraries cannot bar homeless people because their presence, their staring or their hygiene annoys or offends other library patrons.
At a time when libraries across the country are increasingly used as a refuge by homeless people, however, the judge, H. Lee Sarokin of Federal District Court in Newark, did not dispute the right of public libraries to draft rules governing its patrons, including the homeless. 
 "Libraries cannot and should not be transformed into hotels or kitchens, even for the needy," he said. But, he said the regulations must be specific, "their purposes necessary and their effects neutral."
Judge Sarokin ruled in a case involving the Free Public Library of Morristown and Morris Township here, which adopted a set of rules in July 1989 specifically to keep out a 41-year-old homeless man from Morristown, Richard R. Kreimer.
While upholding the library's rules banning patrons without shirts or shoes, he said that other rules were too vague or broad, including ones barring patrons who are not reading, studying or using library materials, who harass or annoy others through noisy activities or by staring, or whose "bodily hygiene is so offensive" that it is a nuisance to others.
"If we wish to shield our eyes and noses from the homeless, we should revoke their condition, not their library cards," he wrote. Judge Sarokin said the unconstitutional regulations violated the First Amendment rights of the homeless by denying them access to the ideas in the books and newspapers in the library. "The First Amendment protects the right to express ideas and the right to receive ideas," he said.
He went on, "Society has survived not banning books which it finds offensive from its libraries; it will survive not banning persons whom it likewise finds offensive from its libraries."
Standing outside the library this afternoon with his lawyer, Bruce S. Rosen, Mr. Kreimer called Judge Sarokin's decision a "great ruling."
"The issue is does a homeless person have the same right to read, to sit and think, as someone else," he said. "You cannot discriminate. Just because a person doesn't look as good, smell as good or dress as good, you're not going to keep him out of the library."
Mr. Rosen, Mr. Kreimer's lawyer, called the ruling "novel."
"I don't know if there are any other rulings in the country dealing directly with homeless rights to public libraries under the First Amendment," he said.
The chief librarian, Nancy Byouk, declined to comment on the case, referring questions to the library's lawyer, Clifford W. Starrett.
Mr. Starrett said he would not comment on the ruling, or a possible appeal, until, after he and the library's board of trustees had discussed it.
 
Libraries as Shelters
 The executive director of the New Jersey Library Association, Patricia Tumulty, said she could not comment on the ruling until she read it. But she said the question of when a librarian can ask someone to leave has been increasingly discussed in New Jersey, where homeless people have appeared in city libraries more and more frequently, particularly in the winter.
"One of the things that librarians never do is ask people why they are there," Ms. Tumulty said.
Under New Jersey statutes, she said, it is up to libraries to develop policies and procedures on when a person will be asked to leave. A subcommittee of the library association is trying to develop a position paper on the subject.
Across the country, homeless people often turn to public libraries as daytime shelter, especially in winter. One community, Haverhill, Mass., has even designed a new library with a separate room specifically for homeless people.
Judge Sarokin's ruling is Mr. Kreimer's second legal triumph in the last month. On April 19, New Jersey's Attorney General, Robert J. DelTufo, held that the homeless in New Jersey must be allowed to vote even if they have no permanent mailing address or specific domicile in the election district where they are staying.
 
Calls Ball Park Home
 That case also involved Mr. Kreimer, who had applied to vote through the Morris County Election Superintendent, using the address of "Streets of Morristown, Fourth Ward." Election officials here had requested guidance from Mr. DelTufo on Mr. Kreimer's application.
Mr. Kreimer said today that in lives in Ledgewood Park, a baseball and basketball complex, in the Fourth Ward here. He said he had played both sports there as a youth.
"Sometimes I sleep under blankets, sometimes in a sleeping bag," he said. "If it's raining, I may go into a baseball dugout."
Asked where he took his meals, he replied, "I get them from a friend."
Mr. Kreimer grew up in Morristown and had worked as a house painter and in the warehouse of his family's paper goods business until about a decade ago, he said. He said he had been homeless since he lost his own house in 1982 "because of some family problems." He would not elaborate.
While his lawsuit against the library was pending before Judge Sarokin, library officials softened their regulations against his presence in the building and allowed him to enter.
 
Reading About Sports
 He said he generally spent an hour each morning and an hour each evening there, reading mostly books on sports.
"I just finished a biography of Yogi Berra," he said. He said he had also recently read books on Ron Guidry, the former Yankee pitcher; on the Yankee-Red Sox rivalry over the years, and on what he called the chronological stories of Eskimos.
During his months-long, highly publicized fight with the library, Mr. Kreimer has become widely known here and apparently fairly deeply disliked.
As he spoke outside the library this afternoon, at least five passing motorists shouted derogatory remarks at him. He also got into a heated exchange with one couple on the sidewalk.
"None of them know what it's like to be living on the streets," he said. "Despite the social and economic disadvantages of the homeless, we have the same rights to a library as everybody else."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a Federal judge's overturning of regulations to bar a homeless man from the public library in Morristown, N.J., misidentified the park where the man, Richard R. Kreimer, sleeps. It is Lidgerwood Park in Morristown.

HEADLINE: Japanese Electronics Profits

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 23

 BODY:
Four big Japanese electronics companies today reported lackluster profits for the year ended March 31. They blamed intense competition for their performances, but cautiously forecast an improvement this year.
The Toshiba Corporation said its profits fell 8.3 percent, to 120.85 billion yen, or $875 million, and forecast earnings of $869 million this year. 
 Hitachi Ltd. said profits rose 9 percent, to 230.19 billion yen ($1.66 billion), and predicted this year's results would be little changed.
Fujitsu Ltd.'s profits fell 4.7 percent, to 82.67 billion yen, or $599 million. It expects this year's earnings to rise to $652 million.
The Mitsubishi Electric Corporation's earnings rose 3.9 percent, to 79.76 billion yen, or $577 million, and this year could fall to $536 million.
The flat profits were expected after a sharp drop in the price of computer chips and intense competition in the computer market, especially personal computers, the companies said.
Prospects also hinge on currency fluctuations and on whether the United States economy recovers, companies and analysts said.
"The major assumption here is that there will be a U.S. recovery," said David Benda, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd (Securities) Japan Ltd. "The greenback is not collapsing and the silicon cycle shows definite signs of bottoming."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Lab's Role In U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AMERICA'S research universities are under increasing pressure to find ways to strengthen the United States position in international trade, spur the nation's lagging economic growth and avoid giving the fruits of scientific and technological progress to foreign competitors.
To help America gain more commercially from its research leadership, should this country restrict foreign access to America's great research universities and laboratories? 
 At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a faculty study group headed by a political science professor, Eugene Skolnikoff, and including professors from economics, the physical sciences and engineering, has just issued a report warning against the dangers to both the university and the nation of a shift toward intellectual protectionism.
The intense economic competition among nations, the report says, is "increasingly driven by the growing strength of science and technology abroad," and M.I.T.'s broad and open links with the international science and technology community are crucial to its ability to serve American society.
The group said M.I.T. must remain committed to the publication of all research and open to foreign visits and direct participation in laboratory work. M.I.T. has long prohibited research tagged exclusively for industrial sponsors, although proprietory research was occasionally permitted before World War II for special reasons. Classified research, in the big wartime laboratories, was accepted during World War II and in the cold war atmosphere until the 1960's, but no classified research has been accepted on campus since then.
The Federal Government still finances 75 percent of the research on the M.I.T. campus, with the biggest sums coming, in rank order, from the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Defense and the National Science Foundation. None of those studies are classified. But classified research is conducted at the Lincoln Laboratory, in Lexington, Mass., which M.I.T. continues to operate largely for the Department of Defense. Lincoln, which is kept outside the academic structure and campus research budget, had a $420.1 million budget in the fiscal year 1990. On-campus, unclassified research that year cost $310 million.
M.I.T. got only 3 percent of its on-campus research budget in 1990 from foreign-based companies. Indeed, while some critics argue that M.I.T. and other American universities are being biased by support from foreign companies or governments, others, like Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, and Ernst Bloch, former director of the National Science Foundation, contend that foreign beneficiaries should pay more to support American research; they see "cream skimming." The M.I.T. report urges foreign companies and nations to help insure that the "research base is maintained by adding money as well as knowledge to it."
Foreign support is accepted at M.I.T. under the same conditions as United States-sponsored research: that it advances the research and education missions determined by M.I.T., fulfills the faculty's research goals, is enriching for students and can be freely and openly published and discussed.
But foreign institutions appear to have been quicker and more thorough in developing opportunities stemming from American research. To correct the relative weakness of United States companies in translating research to the marketplace, the faculty report says the president of M.I.T. should consult with industrial leaders to establish a continuing dialogue and mechanisms for additional action.
At his inauguration as M.I.T.'s 15th president this month, Charles M. Vest declared that "when our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges," M.I.T. must reaffirm "our responsibilities to American society at the same time as we continue to participate in the evolving international research community."
The institute already has several programs, like the Industrial Liaison Program and Leaders for Manufacturing, to move new knowledge from labs to commercial applications. The Skolnikoff report suggests that M.I.T. faculty members should give American companies first crack at new research results. M.I.T. already requires that licenses for inventions require "substantial" manufacturing of the licensed product in the United States, whether federally or privately financed.
M.I.T. has begun studies on helping particular industries, starting with autos and pharmaceuticals, and intends to establish programs on using information technology to accelerate American productivity growth, along with other large research projects that will overlap several industries.
Helping America's industrial performance will also require reducing the cost of capital, to lengthen the time-horizons of American management and spur long-range investment and research; remedy the shortage of venture capital; improve labor relations, and strengthen the quality of American management and its alertness to new opportunities. A closer and deeper relationship between American industry and the nation's great research centers will be a key element in the process.

HEADLINE: Why Drugs cost More in U.S.

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Americans pay some of the world's highest prices for their prescription drugs. While other governments usually negotiate prices, the United States has traditionally let companies decide for themselves what to charge.
According to one study, Americans paid an average of 54 percent more than Europeans for 25 commonly prescribed drugs. Some essential drugs are especially costly in the United States. A month's supply of Eldepryl, a Parkinson's disease medication from Somerset Labs Inc., costs about $28 in Italy, $48 in Austria and $240 in the United States. 
 Aerosolized pentamidine, inhaled by people with AIDS to prevent a deadly form of pneumonia, costs $100 wholesale and about $150 retail in the United States, where it is made by the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company of Deer Park, Ill. In France, Germany and Britain, Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s retail price for the identical vial is $26.
 
Charging for Research
 These disparities have become central to a growing debate over how the United States can control its drug costs. Regulators and insurers who have been trying for years to limit hospital costs and doctors' fees are now trying to rein in drug expenses as well.
Drug costs are increasing even faster than other medical expenses. Economists say that drug companies -- even foreign ones -- are able to charge American patients a disproportionate share of their research costs. Most European governments bargain prices down to levels that cover companies' manufacturing and distributon costs, but much less of their research.
Some of the reasons that drug costs are so high in the United States also have to do with rising medical costs in general. The growing expense of medical technology, the absence of a national health plan and the payment of most medical bills by third parties have confounded most attempts to manage the nation's medical bills.
High drug prices afflict the elderly and chronically ill the most. Americans older than 65 use an average of five prescription drugs, said Ewe Rheinhardt, an economist at Princeton University. Old people are also more likely to have to pay for their prescription drugs themselves because Medicare does not cover drug costs except in hospitals, said Stephen Long, an economist at the Rand Corporation in Washington.
Many old people are devastated by the prices of their prescriptions. Of their $1,100 monthly income from Social Security, Joseph and Margaret Landin of Dallas spend more than $600 for 10 prescription drugs. Mr. Landin has ailments of the esophagus and prostate gland, and his wife has heart troubles, two slipped disks and arthritis.
"It's terrible," Mr. Landin said, reflecting on the sacrifices necessary to pay for their drugs. "We don't subscribe to the newspaper any more. We don't turn on our air-conditioning," despite summer temperatures that often top 100 degrees. "We used to go out twice a month to eat, but we don't do that any more."
Economists and Federal regulators are concerned that companies are agreeing to sell their drugs cheaply elsewhere, while piling research and development costs onto their prices in the United States. "Obviously, we subsidize the world," said Richard Zeckhauser, an economist at Harvard University.
The costs of producing and distributing most prescription drugs are low, yet the cost of research can be very high. Companies that develop new drugs can negotiate low prices for some buyers and still turn a profit, provided they can charge others enough to pay for their research.
"There is a lot of discretion in how you set prices," the Rand economist, Dr. Long, said. "If you had different markets willing to pay different amounts, then you can produce and sell very cheaply in some of them."
Executives of drug companies attribute the price differences to the workings of the American free market. They warn that attempts to control drug prices in the United States will backfire.
 
Warning on Meddling
 "The U.S. drug industry is one of the strongest in the world," said Gordon Binder, chief executive of Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company. "If the Government meddles with the free market, it could well destroy the industry."
But many large purchasers of drugs say that such high prices in the United States merely guarantee high profits. Lately, drug stocks have been soaring.
"The drug industry has been very successful," said Dr. Norrie Wilkins, president of Clinical Pharmacy Advantage, a Minneapolis company that buys drugs for health maintenance organizations and other cost-containment programs. "Its percent of profits are probably higher than in any other industry. We are in a recession now and a lot of business people and the Government are asking: 'Why has the recession not hit the drug industry? Do they have an unfair advantage?' "
A Federal law passed in December requires drug makers to cut their prices to the Medicaid program for the poor. Hospitals, insurers and other large purchasers are trying to keep the drug companies from shifting the costs to them.
 
European Methods Urged
 Some authorities say that to receive Europe's prices, the United States should adopt more of Europe's methods. "One of our options is to negotiate prices like they do in Europe, using big buying groups that include public and private purchasers," said David G. Schulke, chief of oversight for the Senate's special committee on aging.
A Federal study has found that state Medicaid agencies paid $474 million more for prescription drugs in 1989 than they would have if they had been bought at the prices negotiated in Canada.
Dr. Zeckhauser of Harvard said that some countries like Australia were particlarly adept at negotiating low prices. In a recent study, he and one of his students, Mark Johnston, found that average American prices were more than double the average Australian prices for 80 widely prescribed drugs.
 
Frustrating Drugstore Visit
 In some European countries, including the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, drugs cost about as much as in the United States. Guido Adriaenssens, who surveys drug prices for the Belgian Consumers Association, said that none of these countries negotiated their prices. But the Netherlands and Denmark control the amounts of drugs that doctors can prescribe, limiting overall costs, he said. Germany is more like the United States, he said, with high prices and high consumption.
Patients' frequent inability to postpone treatment and their dependence on doctors' recommendations contribute to the high costs of drugs. Dr. Reinhardt, the Princeton economist, said that when he recently stopped at a drugstore to pick up a prescription, he felt helpless. "I was madder than hell," he said. "It was my doctor who wrote my prescription. I was never given any option. And when I went to the pharmacy, some gum-chewing clerk threw a bag at me and said, '$40.' "
Drug companies are free to set their prices but consumers have little opportunity to comparison-shop, Dr. Rheinhardt said. "We are the world's last free market," he said. "It's not a perfect market, but it is free. A perfect market is one where the customer can really evaluate the product and where it is not an emergency situation." Buying a prescription drug, he said, "is not like buying a pair of socks."
 
Malpractice Suits Feared
 Doctors, assuming that their patients want the best and fearful of malpractice suits if they recommend anything less, may disregard prices when they prescribe drugs, Dr. Long said. Doctors sometimes prescribe an expensive drug when a cheaper one is better. Cardiologists continue to prescribe TPA, a drug that dissolves blood clots, for $2,000 a dose, even though studies have shown that streptokinase, at $200 a dose, serves heart attack patients even better.
Industry representatives agree that Americans are paying a large share of their research costs, but add that the nation enjoys the benefits. Dr. Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said that France's stringent price controls had resulted in a drug industry that he described as "no longer world class," adding, "There really is a cause-and-effect relationship between economic pressure and the amount of research."
Dr. Mossinghoff accused some countries, like Portugal, Greece and Spain, of negotiating "outrageously low" prices for drugs and failing to pay their fair share of research and development costs. "In that context, American consumers are paying for cheaper drugs elsewhere," Dr. Mossinghoff said.
But the association says that drug makers can still cover their costs and turn a profit in these other countries -- as long as they do not have to extend the same low prices everywhere.

HEADLINE: Panel Backs Arctic Drilling, But Not Fuel-Efficient Cars

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
In a move attacked by environmentalists, the Senate Energy Committee approved a national energy bill today that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and would not require auto makers to build more fuel-efficient cars.
While today's vote was the first time in more than a decade that Congress has moved this far in drafting a national energy policy, the package faces vigorous opposition from those who complain that it emphasizes production over conservation efforts. 
 If the measure reaches the Senate floor, it is headed for a contentious battle, where many members are unlikely to support Arctic drilling unless they can point to other provisions, like fuel economy standards, that show a commitment to conservation.
Even the committee chairman, J. Bennett Johnston, said that to have a "balanced" bill the measure would need to tighten the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard, or CAFE, which now requires auto makers' fleets to average 27.5 miles a gallon.
Mr. Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who is one of the most influential Senate chairmen, pleaded with committee members today to accept an amendment he drafted that would add a modest increase in fuel standards. But he was rebuffed for the second time by Republicans who argued that the proposal went too far and by Democrats who said it was not stringent enough.
Even after he implored committee members for support, saying, "We need help on this -- we need it now," Mr. Johnston's amendment was defeated by a vote of 14 to 6. It would have increased the average fuel economy standards to 34 miles a gallon by the year 2001 and 37 miles a gallon by 2006.
The committee voted 11 to 8 to keep the Arctic drilling provisions, but Mr. Johnston and Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama were the only Democratic proponents. The committee went on to approve the overall bill 17 to 3, although some backers warned that they would seek changes in the proposal on the Senate floor.
While the debate has centered on arguments over Arctic drilling and fuel economy standards, the bill includes several other important provisions. They include exempting large electric power producers from Federal regulation, streamlining nuclear plant licensing, unfettering utilities from state regulation and requiring limited energy efficiency measures.
 
Full Senate May Not Vote
 The House is waiting for the Senate to act before it moves on an energy bill. Some have speculated that bill may not be brought to a vote by the full Senate unless more lawmakers express support for it. The White House proposed a national energy policy in February, but it has encountered opposition in Congress, and White House officials have suggested that the President would support a bill similar to what passed the Energy Committee today.
Mr. Johnston conceded after today's vote that if the measure reached the Senate floor he expected "a tremendous debate" over Arctic drilling. He said he hoped that supporters of the bill could still come up with a proposal on the fuel economy standard that would win over enough lawmakers to pass the package.
Proponents of the Arctic drilling provision said it was needed for the nation to build up its sagging oil reserves. Mr. Johnston declared that the Arctic refuge was "the best prospect in America today by any order of magnitude" for additional oil and gas. "We're running out of oil in this country no matter what we do," he said.
After the vote, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, predicted that "the floor debate should be very heated." But, he said, "the bottom line here is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil," adding, "Do we want to import that oil and export U.S. jobs and money, or do we want to create new jobs and expand our tax base?"
 
'A Very Bad Decision'
 But opponents warned against what they feared would be the destruction of the last strip of the Arctic shoreline in the United States that is free of development. They said the committee's bill should put much greater emphasis on conservation efforts.
"This is a very bad decision to make," Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, told his colleagues, adding that drilling would come "at enormous destruction" to the environment.
"Promoting domestic oil and gas drilling is laudable, but does not by itself make an energy policy," Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat, said after the vote. "Energy conservation measures are also important."
Daniel F. Becker, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, derided the bill as "the environmental destruction act of 1991," and said Mr. Johnston's failure to win support for his fuel standards proposals showed that he was losing clout. "It's the bill that ate Bennett Johnston," he said. "This bill ain't going anywhere very fast."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Lower In Thin Pre-Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened yesterday against major foreign currencies in thin pre-holiday trading as dealers shrugged off the latest Government report on durable goods.
Gold prices also declined. 
 The Commerce Department said orders for industrial products like aircraft, cars and computers rose 2.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $115.5 billion, up from $112.2 billion in March. It was the first rise since a 3.5 percent advance last December.
"Even if durable goods were going up, we know the country is in a recession," said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York office of Banco di Sicilia, "and the Federal Reserve is not going to tighten credit any more."
Tighter credit, which means a likely jump in interest rates, is considered bullish for the dollar.
 
Dollar Up 0.50 Yen in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar rose 0.50 yen to close at 137.95 yen. It traded at 137.65 yen in London, and edged down to 137.79 in New York, from 137.80 late Wednesday.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared with Wednesday. Sterling fetched $1.7345 in London, up from $1.7270, and $1.7350 in New York, up from $1.7280.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.71265 German marks, down from 1.7227; 1.4555 Swiss francs, down from 1.4602; 5.8185 French francs, down from 5.8455; 1,273.50 Italian lire, down from 1,279.00, and 1.14935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14975.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's, were 1.7135 German marks, down from 1.7210; 1.4560 Swiss francs, down from 1.4598; 5.8200 French francs, down from 5.8425; 1.9305 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9390; 1,274.00 Italian lire, down from 1,277.50, and 1.1507 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1490.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current delivery settled at $355.20 an ounce, down $1.10 from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $354.70 an ounce, off 80 cents.
Currency dealers said that technical factors, exaggerated by thin trading before the Memorial Day holiday, were largely responsible for the dollar's decline.
"It's just a squaring off of positions for the weekend," Mr. Glamuzina said. "Right now the market is in a period of coasting. We really don't know where it's going to be."
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $355.20 an ounce, from $356.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $355 an ounce from $355.90. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold lost $2.82 an ounce to close at $354.85.
Silver prices headed higher. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.039 an ounce, up from $4.032 late Wednesday. Silver rose in London to $4.04 an ounce from $4.03.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Dealers Buy Notes, Sell Bonds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed again yesterday, as dealers sold bonds and bought shorter-term notes and bills for the second straight session.
Although the Treasury also sold $9.25 billion worth of new five-year notes yesterday, the surprising developments took place in the secondary market. 
 At the start of the week, most market participants had expected that the sales of two-year notes on Wednesday and five-year notes yesterday would put upward pressure on short-term interest rates, and have little or no impact on bond yields. That has not taken place.
"We have had two pretty unusual days, " said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management. "You can count on the fingers of one hand the days of the year when prices of two-year notes go up and bonds sell off. But at the moment people seem to see the short end as the best place to be, and are selling bonds to get there."
 
Yield Virtually Unchanged
 At the Treasury sale, the notes went for an average yield of 7.69 percent, a bit lower than dealers had expected, but a level that was virtually unchanged from the average 7.70 percent yield generated at the last five-year note sale on April 25.
Economic data released yesterday were far from robust. But some analysts said the gains recorded in durable goods orders, which rose by 2.9 percent in April, and in 10-day motor vehicle sales, which increased to 5.9 million units at an annual rate in mid-May, from 5.4 million units during the first 10 days, provided further evidence that the worst of the recession was over. A report showing a slight dip in initial unemployment claims for the week ended May 11 buttressed that view, the analysts said.
"We may be close to the bottom and beginning to come out," said Paul Lally, an economist at Citibank Global Finance. "There is a glimmer of hope that the economy is picking up."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 98 5/32 late yesterday, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.29 percent, up from 8.27 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.07 percent.
 
Notes Perform Well
 However, the new 6 3/4 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday continued to perform well. In late trading the new notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.73 percent. Late yesterday the new five-year notes were trading at their average auction yield of 7.69 percent in the when-issued market.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.37 percent, down 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by 2 basis points, to a late-offered rate of 5.60 percent. And one-year bill rates also fell by 2 basis points, to a late-offered rate of 5.73 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended May 13.
The gains were somewhat larger than anticipated by Wall Street economists, but the report had no adverse effect on prices in the credit markets.
 
New Corporate Issues
 A number of new issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a competitive sale of $100 million worth of two-year notes by the International Lease Finance Corporation.
A bid from a group led by Bear, Stearns & Company won the securities. The 7.40 percent issue was reoffered to investors at a price of $99.91, to yield 7.45 percent, 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which mature June 1, 1993, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said prices of most issues had fallen by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in quiet trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues fell by roughly 1/8 point in slow trading, market participants said.

The Easygoing Portuguese? Steer Clear of Them

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LISBON

 BODY:
The Portuguese have the reputation of being a quiet, law-abiding and introverted people who even in times of political turmoil go out of their way to avoid using violence. But, mysteriously, when they get into their cars, they turn aggressive and dangerous.
In Lisbon, they career up and down the city's steep hills, immune to the presence of pedestrians or other drivers. Outside the capital, their specialty seems to be overtaking on blind corners, a problem aggravated by the fact that the country still has only 200 miles of modern highways. 
 Foreigners venture onto the roads with trepidation. A shaken French couple, who recently drove here on vacation, put their car on a train for the trip home. American diplomats posted to Lisbon are given special advice on how to survive highway-jousting with reckless locals.
And if anyone still doubted that the Portuguese are Europe's worst drivers, the death rate on Portugal's roads is consistently the highest within the 12-nation European Community. Measured in relation to total vehicles, it is four times higher than in Britain, the Netherlands - and the United States.
 
'No. 1 Public Health Problem'
 "Driving is Portugal's No. 1 public health problem," said Maj. Gabriel Mendes, the deputy commander of the country's Transit Brigade. "People behave very differently when they sit in the driver's seat from what they do in ordinary life."
To be fair, not everyone blames the drivers for Portugal's accident rate. Although construction of a network of new highways began after this country joined the European Community in 1986, its roads are still the narrowest and worst-kept in Western Europe.
Thanks to a recent burst of economic growth, the number of vehicles here has jumped by 25 percent in the last five years, further straining the road system. Portugal's two million vehicles also include many cars and buses that in other countries would be considered too old to be safe.
But in more than 80 percent of accidents, Major Mendes insisted, the drivers are at fault. "The cars and roads are getting better, but the driver is not," he said.
Alcino Cruz, who runs the Moderna Driving School here, said this was unsurprising since the driving test had not changed since his grandfather's day. "People learn in the city, going at 30 miles per hour and never getting into top gear," he said. "They get their license without ever having driven on a highway."
As a result, he said, many young drivers are unprepared for the surprises of fast driving or highways clogged with heavy trucks. "That's why we give two simultaneous courses," he said, "one to teach learners how to pass their test and the other to teach them how to drive."
But the Transit Brigade's chief of operations, Maj. Jose Francisco Barata, blamed excessive speed, drunken driving, overtaking illegally and ignoring rules of priority.
So what gets into the Portuguese on the road? "They're normally very well mannered and conservative, but all their repressed hostility and daring seems to come out behind the wheel," a Lisbon psychologist suggested.
Jose Alves, a journalist, joked that the Portuguese like the unknown. "That's why they made all those discoveries in the 15th century and that's why they drive round a blind corner today," he said. But he added more seriously, "The Portuguese came to cars after most other Europeans so, for them, it's still a symbol, a cult object."
 
Drunken Drivers Are Common
 Perhaps nowhere is the price of their driving ritual higher than along the Marginal, the 20-mile stretch of road that runs along the coast between Lisbon and Cascais. A winding four-lane highway, it has no separating wall to prevent drivers from overtaking or swinging out of their lanes around corners -- and colliding head-on with other cars. In the winter, spray from breaking waves can blind drivers for 10 to 15 seconds. At night, the road's surface is usually damp.
But perhaps the real problem is that the Marginal runs through an area with many restaurants and nightclubs so drunken drivers are common.
The Government has run advertising campaigns against drinking and driving, but the number of deaths has barely changed. Major Mendes said that because of a shortage of police motorcycles and cars, it is also hard for the Transit Brigade to control speeding and dangerous driving.
So what can be done? Major Barata said education was the only solution, but Major Mendes had a more practical suggestion. "I avoid the Marginal as much as possible," he said. And foreigners would agree: a favorite going-away present for Americans is a T-shirt that reads, "I survived the Marginal."

"That's why we give two simultaneous courses, one to teach learners how to pass their test and the other to teach them how to drive." (Ingeborg Lippmann for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Rose by 4.8% In Midmonth

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 23

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose by 4.8 percent in the middle of the month over the comparable period last year, when results were unusually weak because consumer incentives were expiring.
Retail sales during the May 11-to-20 period, reported today by the nine auto makers building cars in North America, totaled 166,826, a 3.8 percent increase from last year. Sales of domestically built light trucks were up by 6.5 percent, to 104,836.
 
No Post-War Spurt Yet
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.9 million cars sold in mid-May suggested that the pickup in automotive sales that had been expected to follow the Persian Gulf war has still not materialized. Last year's rate in mid-May, using different seasonal adjustment factors, was 6.2 million. Automobile executives have been hoping for the rate to recover to closer to 7 million. 
 "Sales are better than they were in April and in early May, but that's not saying much," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "The auto makers won't be raising annual sales estimates or increasing production schedules based on these numbers."
Economists say consumers are fearful of buying big-ticket items in the face of possible layoffs. Personal income levels have also been weak.
The General Motors Corporation posted a 13.4 percent increase in car sales, to 82,312, and a 9.9 percent gain in light-truck sales, to 43,279. The Ford Motor Company's car sales totaled 43,278, a 1.3 percent increase, and light-truck sales were 35,047, a rise of five-tenths of a percent.
G.M.'s Chevrolet, Pontiac and Buick car divisions, as well as its G.M.C. truck operation, reported gains, while the Oldsmobile and Cadillac divisions posted declines. G.M.'s Saturn division, which started selling cars less than a year ago, had been reporting steady increases in sales as production rose, but sales totaled only 1,843 in the latest period, lower than 2,180 in late April.
 
Lincoln-Mercury Gains
 Ford's increase in car sales resulted from strong results from the Lincoln-Mercury division, specifically the Mercury Grand Marquis, Sable, Tracer and Topaz cars and the Lincoln Continental. Except for the Ford Taurus, all the car maker's models declined in sales. Ford's truck sales were flat over all, though they reflected strong sales of the new Explorer utility vehicle.
The Chrysler Corporation does not report 10-day sales, but Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication, estimated that Chrysler's car sales dropped by 31 percent, to 14,450 in the period, and that light-truck sales were nearly flat, at 21,750.
During the second quarter, the Big Three increased their incentives on many car and truck models to generate buyer enthusiasm. In the period, incentives have risen 10 percent to 15 percent over the first quarter, according to the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
Two of the top three Japanese auto makers posted strong sales gains for vehicles produced at their American plants. The Honda Motor Company's car sales totaled 14,173, a 28 percent gain, and the Nissan Motor Company's car sales were 3,287, for a 72.3 percent rise. But the Toyota Motor Corporation's domestic car sales were 6,207, a 29.6 percent drop.
 
Accord Does Well
 The sales of Honda's Accord compact car, spurred by added dealer incentives, rose sharply, to 9,354, from 5,978. But those of the smaller Honda Civic slipped by 5.4 percent, to 4,819 from 5,098.
Both of Toyota's domestically built cars showed sharp sales declines. Camry sales were off by 31 percent, to 3,451, and Corolla sales were down by 27.9 percent, to 2,756.
The Mazda Motor Corporation's sales of American-built cars fell by 29 percent, to 904. Those of the new utility vehicle, the Navajo, totaled 203. Nissan's truck sales rose by 32 percent in the 10-day period, to 3,359.

HEADLINE: Bush Backs Baker View of Mideast Peace Barriers

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
A group of senators harshly chastised Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today for his contention that nothing has more complicated his peacemaking efforts in the Middle East than Israel's expansion of settlements in the occupied territories.
But President Bush defended his Secretary of State, saying: "Secretary Baker was speaking for this Administration and I strongly support what he said and I strongly support what he is trying to do. Our policy is well known, and it would make a big contribution to peace if these settlements would stop." 
 Mr. Bush's defense of Mr. Baker's statement came in an afternoon chat with reporters, after he gave a somewhat more cautious answer when he was asked at a morning news conference whether he shared Mr. Baker's assessment. Those restrained earlier comments were intrepreted by some reporters as suggesting that the President was distancing himself from Mr. Baker, and when the State Department made this known to the White House the President held a second impromptu news conference that left no doubt where he stood.
"I am backing the man," he declared. "I'm stating the policy of the United States of America and so was the Secretary. We would like to see those settlements stopped."
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations issued a statement today saying that it was "shocked and dismayed" by Mr. Baker's remarks on Wednesday before the House of Representatives, and that view was also shared by members of the Senate Foreign Operations subcommittee, where Mr. Baker testified today.
The Senators, however, did not confine themselves to criticizing Mr. Baker for his rebuke of Israel. They also scathingly expressed their disgust with the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for not being more forthcoming toward Israel after the Persian Gulf war and for their failure, as the lawmakers put it, to institute even the most token democratic reforms after having been rescued from Iraq by the United States.
Mr. Baker was on the defensive from the moment he sat down in the witness chair, as Saudi Arabia was denounced for barring entry of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, because he had an Israeli visa stamped in his passport, Kuwait was denounced for sentencing someone to 15 years in jail for wearing a T-shirt with Saddam Hussein's picture, and Syria was depicted as a terrorist state that has used all the money it got from Saudi Arabia to buy Scud missiles from North Korea.
 
'They Sent Out a 911'
 "I must tell you, Mr. Secretary," said Senator Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, "it is a significant frustration of mine -- that we seem to have gotten nothing -- nothing from Saudi Arabia or Kuwait or the other countries whose lives we saved, whose sovereignty we saved, whose assets we saved. They sent out a 911. We responded as no emergency team has ever responded in history. And what do we get? We don't even get payment on the pledges that they made to help us through the financial crisis."
Mr. Lautenberg then asked: "Can you imagine what would have happened if the Israelis tried a Palestinian who had a picture of Arafat on his T-shirt and gave him 15 years in prison without representation? Hell, we'd have the United Nations declaring that Israel is a non-valid state."
Mr. Baker insisted that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were paying their pledges to Washington on the schedule they promised and that the State Department had spoken to the Kuwaitis about their behavior. But this seemed to do little to mollify the Senators.
The committee chairman, Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said to Mr. Baker: "The Emir of Kuwait, who was living in splendid comfort throughout the whole war, took over a month to just find his way back to his country after we and others had liberated it, and then only after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a more comfortable place for him to stay. I mean, he is in a family that's only a couple of generations from living in tents and they should have been willing to go back."
 
'It Bothered Them'
 Senator Leahy added: "I could tell you what I hear in Vermont from people across the political spectrum. That's to say that it bothered them."
Mr. Baker responded by saying: "When we went in, we went in because it was the right thing to do, and we went in because we did not think that unprovoked aggression should be permitted to succeed, and we went in because we had some substantial national interests at stake. You can't say you're doing this to keep the world safe for democracy, because these aren't democracies that you're going in here to assist. But it was still the right thing to do."
As for Mr. Baker's statement on Wednesday to the effect that there was no greater obstacle to peace in the Middle East than Israel's putting up a new settlement every time he comes to the region, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, asked:
"Mr. Secretary, is the settlement activity more of a threat to peace than Syria's recent delivery of North Korean Scud missiles? More than the state of war that Arab nations have maintained against Israel since its inception? More than the continued refusal of Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and all the other Arab states except Egypt to recognize and negotiate directly with Israel?"
Generally speaking, Mr. Baker sought to defuse the issue by stating that in his view all parties needed to do more.
"We are not going to get peace, we are not even going to be able to develop a process unless both sides are willing to move, both sides. And I am not in the business of pinning blame." While still insisting that settlements were a major obstacle to peace, Mr. Baker added today that "there are other obstacles that are every bit as big," including the continuing refusal of Arab countries to suspend the state of war that technically exists with Israel or to suspend their economic boycott.

HEADLINE: Kurds, Fed but Fearful, Still Dubious on Future

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CUKURCA, Turkey, May 23

 BODY:
They sell fresh eggs and tomatoes now on the mountain slopes where only recently the Kurds went hungry and counted their dead.
Peddlers line the dusty paths, some wearing field jackets and ponchos that they managed to cadge from American soldiers. For a reasonable price -- dollars and Iraqi dinar are accepted here -- one can find cigarettes, packaged cookies, chocolates and, inescapable even on high peaks, Coca-Cola. 
 It may be going too far to say that a dollop of free-market economy has brought prosperity to Iraqi Kurds still hunkered down on this side of the craggy border between Turkey and Iraq. By any standard, this last Turkish outpost with a significant concentration of refugees is a miserable place: Garbage is strewn everywhere, tents are scattered crazy-quilt, some children suffer from malnutrition despite ample food stocks, and roads run from mud to choking dust and then back to mud, depending on the whims of the clouds.
But it is obvious that conditions have leaped forward by bounds from the death and desperation that only a few weeks ago clung to these slopes like dank fog. Now food is available, as are medical care and adequate water, at least until mountain springs dry up as summer approaches. By then, however, the military rescue operation that the United States and its allies set in motion five weeks ago should have shut down inside Turkey.
"No matter what measurement you use, the troops have been very successful," said Brig. Gen. Richard Potter, commander of the United States Army Special Forces units working in the mountains. "We've gone from no food distribution in a situation where the thugs and the meanest guys in camp got the food to an equitable position."
Cukurca's population is officially put at about 70,000, as against an estimated peak of 120,000 in mid-April following the Kurds' flight into Turkey after their failed rebellion against President Saddam Hussein.
Other large encampments in the Turkish mountains have all been closed, with refugees transported home or to more benign settlements in the valleys of northern Iraq.
Army officers say it is simply a matter of time, perhaps two weeks, before trucks can carry everyone in Cukurca back to Iraq. On this score, the refugees have received a taste of the seamier side of a free-market.
Some Turkish and Iraqi truck drivers hired to do the hauling by the International Organization for Migration have mastered the art of what some soldiers call "double dipping."
 
Some Fights Break Out
 From the migration group they receive a flat fee equivalent to about $200 for each truckload of refugees taken to Iraq. The Kurds are supposed to pay nothing. But some drivers make individual families pay as well, thereby collecting twice for the same job. Now and again, fights break out over who gets on which truck first.
Military leaders say they are delighted at the speed with which they have taken the Kurds down from the mountains. "Basically turning the situation around in just 30 days is incredible," said Col. James L. Jones Jr., commander of United States Marines assigned to the relief operation. "I think only the United States could have done all this on such a magnitude."
Still, tens of thousands of refugees have left Cukurca and other outposts not for home, but rather for new camps in the Iraqi valleys. Most come from Dohuk, a provincial capital that lies outside the allied-protected zone in northern Iraq. And they say they will not go back unless they can feel safe there. Unless this bottleneck can be unplugged, officials say, allied troops could be forced to remain in Iraq even if they have finished up in Turkey.
 
High Hopes on a Deal
 The United States has pinned its hopes on an agreement with Iraq under which all Iraqi soldiers and secret police officers are to be withdrawn from Dohuk by Friday morning. As they leave, American forces will move in, although plans now call mainly for a contingent of several dozen military and civilian engineers and other technical experts who are supposed to help the city return to normal.
Whether this deal will be enough to calm Kurdish fears may not be clear for a few more days.
Reservations were obvious today among several groups of refugees who had left Cukurca and gone to temporary camps outside Sarsang, Iraq. They had heard about the agreement, they said, but they would first have to send people into Dohuk as scouts to report on whether they should return.
At one encampment, refugees repeated what by now is a litany -- that United States soldiers must stay in Iraq and that, if the Americans leave, the Kurds will once again run.
"Nobody wants the Americans and the allies to go because we know our enemy well," said Saleh Youssef, a young farmer.
 
Real Fear or Real Politics?
 One dilemma for allied commanders is sorting out the degree to which the Kurds are genuinely afraid, or instead are calculating politically that by keeping foreign troops here as long as possible they improve their bargaining position in autonomy talks under way in Baghdad with the Iraqi government.
Contributing to the allies' cynicism are instances in which Kurdish guerrillas have set up roadblocks to stop other Kurds from returning to Dohuk.
"We'd like American forces to stay in our land forever," said Amar Abdi, a tribal elder who stopped near Sarsang after leaving Cukurca.
The worry for American commanders is that he may well mean it.

HEADLINE: President Is Reacting Coolly To Aid Plea by Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he was keeping "all options" open in his desire to spur Soviet economic reform, but he reacted coolly to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's suggestion that the industrialized democracies should help the Soviet Union financially.
"A hundred billion is a large piece of change," Mr. Bush said at a Rose Garden news conference, adding that he still had reservations about whether huge infusions of aid would be of much use at this stage in Soviet economic development. 
 Mr. Bush was responding to news reports in The New York Times and other papers that said Mr. Gorbachev had asked at a news conference on Wednesday for $100 billion in Western aid. But those reports were based on misinterpretations of what he said. The full text of Mr. Gorbachev's remarks indicate that while making the case for large infusions of Western aid, he did not ask specifically for $100 billion.
The remarks by Mr. Gorbachev appeared to be more of an off-the-cuff statement that "if it is possible to find 100 billion for overcoming one crisis" -- apparently a reference to the Persian Gulf war -- then the West can find money to help his country.
 
Gorbachev Wants Invitation
 The Soviet leader also said he would like to attend the annual conference of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, which is to be held in London in July.
But Mr. Bush remained deliberately noncommittal about whether Mr. Gorbachev should be invited to the meeting. He did not entirely close the door on the idea, which Administration officials have said the President opposes, but also did not temper his previous hesitation about the plan.
"I don't want to have something come out of the summit that's negative," he said. "What I want to have come out is positive. What's going to help? What's going to help bring the West closer on terms that are reasonable?"
Pressed for a more specific answer, the President replied: "I tried to answer the question as vaguely as possible, until we know more about it. You can't pin me down on it."
Administration officials have said Mr. Bush would like to defer inviting Mr. Gorbachev to the annual conference until the United States and the six other nations have settled among themselves what sort of aid to give Moscow. The Group of Seven comprises the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
 
Doubts About Kremlin
 Mr. Bush has still not decided whether to grant a Soviet request for $1.5 billion in agricultural credits, much less address additional and far more extensive aid.
The United States remains uncertain whether the Soviet leadership is genuinely committed to economic reform. Mr. Bush said today that he personally "never believed that President Gorbachev had given up on reform."
Later, in another session with reporters, Mr. Bush said of Mr. Gorbachev: "I'm not going to pull the rug out from under him. On the other hand, we have limitations on what we can do, and when we do something, we want it to be meaningful. We don't want to just have some gesture that doesn't help the struggling Soviet economy.
But officials said the memory of Mr. Gorbachev's shift last year to more conservative policies and authoritarian methods remains fresh in Washington even though the Soviet leader has taken steps for reconciliation with the restive republics and with more radical-minded political groups.
Mr. Bush said he would withhold any detailed response on Mr. Gorbachev's aid proposal pending a visit to Washington next week by a delegation headed by Yevgeny Primakov, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Optimistic on Arms Treaty
 On another subject, Mr. Bush said he remained optimistic about the possibility of resolving Soviet-American differences over a conventional weapons reduction treaty that was signed last year and a proposed accord to reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
But he seemed to be signaling that prospects for holding the next Soviet-American summit meeting by the end of June were dimming. The timing of the meeting is dependent on resolving at least the differences over the conventional arms treaty.
"There is some room for optimism on working on these remaining problems on arms control, and if that's true, there will be a summit," Mr. Bush said. But he said he could not be certain the meeting would take place in June.
After two days of talks between Administration officials and Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the chief of the Soviet General Staff, American officials said today that the two sides have come down to one final sticking point on the conventional arms treaty, which was signed in November but not ratified.
 
New Soviet Demand Reported
 The United States has complained about Soviet efforts to exempt naval artillery and coastal forces from the treaty, thus breaking its overall limits on conventional forces in Europe.
American officials said today that the Soviet Union had agreed to abide by those overall limits. Thus, if Moscow wants to retain the naval and coastal units, it will have to reduce its land forces by a corresponding amount.
But General Moiseyev added a new condition, the officials said, relating to limits on how many armaments the Soviets may keep in the European part of its territory and within that, how many tanks, artillery pieces, armored personnel carriers and other weapons must be kept in storage and how many can be on active duty.
The general said the Soviet Union wanted to revise those limits so it could keep more equipment on active duty, including about 750 armored combat vehicles in the European part of the country. The United States turned down the proposal, officials said, and is waiting for a Soviet counteroffer.
In addition to its desire to preserve the treaty's limits on weaponry, officials said, the Bush Administration is troubled by the fact that some of the equipment the Soviet Union now wants to keep on active duty would be deployed in the troubled Baltic region.

HEADLINE: As Albany Stalls a School District Sweats

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKE RONKONKOMA, L.I., May 23

 BODY:
There is nothing fancy or extravagant about the Hiawatha Elementary School, an overcrowded building where many desks are 25 years old and the 11 computers for 726 children are often broken.
But if Hiawatha has scrimped on materials, it has lavished attention on other things: extra help for children behind in reading, free lunches for those who cannot pay. For many residents of this neighborhood of office and factory workers with modest incomes but high mortgages and taxes, the district's reputation is what justifies the expense of living on Long Island. 
 Now, however, the future of Hiawatha and the other schools in its district, Sachem Central, is uncertain. It is at the mercy of the state budget impasse in Albany. As legislative leaders inch fitfully toward a budget agreement, now 52 days after their deadline, all that people here are certain of is that the state's budget problems are going to force them to cut back what they can offer their children.
 
Impossible to Plan Ahead
 Some local officials on Long Island, like Peter A. Scully, deputy town supervisor in Brookhaven, say the delay is less worrisome than the eventual cuts. Others, like Alice A. Amrhein, Commissioner of Human Services in the town of Islip, say the deadlock in Albany is making it impossible to plan ahead, and some programs are being curtailed mid-stream.
"It's very hard," she said. "When you call Albany, nobody can tell you definitively what's in and what's out."
In worse trouble than Long Island's towns are its school districts, which depend on state aid and need to have their budgets worked out by late spring. Under Governor Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to cut nearly $1 billion in aid to schools next year, the Sachem Central district would lose more than $18 million.
Legislative leaders have tentatively agreed to restore half of Mr. Cuomo's proposed school-aid cuts. But what Sachem will eventually get is anybody's guess.
 
Taxes Would Rise 37%
 In the meantime, the vote on next year's budget has been put off, and Sachem administrators are scrambling to come up with contingency plans.
"People moved to this community not because they wanted the world, but because they just wanted a really good, solid education and community for their kids," said John E. Bierwirth, the Superintendent of Sachem, a district with 80,000 residents, 16,000 students, 17 schools, and almost no industry to help pay taxes. "Now that dream is being threatened."
If the district tries to cover the reduction in state aid by raising taxes rather than cutting its own budget, he said, school taxes will go up 37 percent. The owner of a house whose market value is $145,000 -- typical in the area -- now pays $1,620 in school taxes. In a community where a proliferation of houses for sale is evidence that taxes are already beyond many residents' endurance, such an increase is out of the question.
Here in Hiawatha, where there are no assistant principals, where teachers often buy their own supplies, and where some classes are held in rooms carved out of hallways with plastic partitions, almost any budget cut would be painful.
Cutting $18 million would mean that Hiawatha would have to share a nurse with another school instead of having its own. The gifted childrens' program -- three hours a week -- would be cut in half. Two of four teachers for slow readers would be dismissed.
Music classes, art classes, sports, busing and the free lunch program would be threatened. Class sizes, manageable for the first time in memory, would skyrocket again until some classrooms would have 30 children.
"I would certainly reach into my pocket as far as I could to offset the budget cuts," said Kathe Murray, Hiawatha's nurse, who may lose her job. "But I see these kids whose parents can't even afford to send them to school with lunch or a snack -- there's nothing they'll be able to do."
"We've done just about everything we can do to be cost-effective," said Maureen Bigham, Hiawatha's principal. "We don't have things that we can take out of the school system and expect it to be the same school system."
If the Governor's budget went through, officials said, 220 Sachem district teachers would be let go.
"Every day they hold up the state budget is another day of anxiety," said James Cast, president of the Sachem Central Teachers' Association.
Under Mr. Cuomo's budget, more than half the cuts in school aid would come from districts on Long Island. State officials, pointing to districts with high salaries, many administrators and half-empty schools, have said the Island's schools are bloated.
But school advocates say Sachem contradicts that stereotype. True, some schools, like those in rich Shoreham-Wading River, which spends $17,435 per student, look like boarding school campuses, with tennis courts, beautiful libraries, and many extra-curricular activities.
 
Cutting to the Bone
 But they say that schools like Hiawatha, which spends $7,309 per student, represent Long Island's middle-class suburban dream.
"We've always prided ourselves on our public schools -- they were as good as private ones," said Alice Willett, executive director of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association. "But school districts are cutting to the bone, and this is all going to change."
Gregory J. Illenberg, chief of the state aid bureau for the State Department of Education, said Long Island would be disproportionately affected because school aid is determined by a system that involves several dozen formulas but is largely based on property values from 1988 and 1989.
Because Long Island's property values rose faster than those in the rest of the state in the 1980's, it is wealthier, on paper, than other areas. But salaries didn't rise as quickly as the prices of homes did, and unemployment has gone up.
Sachem is one of several school districts that have sued the state, claiming the state-aid formula places an unfair burden on poorer districts and does not let them offer as good an education as richer ones can.
Parents in the district, proud of Sachem's reputation, are worried.
"I feel that you can't get a decent education without reading," said Joan M. Girardin, co-president of the Hiawatha Parent-Teacher Association. "You're going to lose the top readers because they'll be bored. The slower ones will fall behind."
At the same time, they know that if the state cuts go through, necessities will come from their pockets. "I know a lot of people are anticipating the tax moving up and want to move out before that happens," said Mrs. Girardin, who looked out her window and counted seven For Sale signs on her block.
"There's going to come a time when we're going to be forced to move, too."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Court Ruling Curbing Family Planning Clinics

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the opinion of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist yesterday in Rust v. Sullivan, upholding the Federal regulations that bar employees of federally financed family planning clinics from providing information about abortion. The majority opinion was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
 
FROM THE OPINION
 
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
These cases concern a facial challenge to Department of Health and Human Services (H.H.I.S.) regulations which limit the ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related activities. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the regulations, finding them to be a permissible construction of the statute as well as consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution. . . . We affirm. 
 In 1970 Congress enacted Title X of the Public Health Service Act (Act), which provides Federal funding for family-planning services. . . . Section 1008 of the Act, however, provides that "none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." . . .
In 1988 the Secretary promulgated new regulations designed to provide " 'clear and operational guidance' to grantees about how to preserve the distinction between Title X programs and abortion as a method of family planning." . . .
The regulations attach three principal conditions on the grant of Federal funds for the Title X projects. First, the regulations specify that a "Title X project may not provide counseling concerning the use of abortion as a method of family planning or provide referral for abortion as a method of family planning." . . . Title X projects must refer every pregnant client "for appropriate prenatal and/or social services by furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of the mother and the unborn child." . . . The Title X project is expressly prohibited from referring a pregnant woman to an abortion provider, even upon specific request. One permissible response to such an inquiry is that "the project does not consider abortion an appropriate method of family planning and therefore does not counsel of refer for abortion."
 
Restrictions in Regulations
 Second, the regulations broadly prohibit a Title X project from engaging in activities that "encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family planning." Forbidden activities include lobbying for legislation that would increase the availability of abortion as a method of family planning, developing or disseminating materials advocating abortion as a method of family planning, providing speakers to promote abortion as a method of family planning, using legal action to make abortion available in any way as a method of family planning, and paying dues to any group that advocates abortion as a method of family planning as a substantial part of its activities.
Third, the regulations require that Title X projects be organized so that they are "physically and financially separate" from prohibited abortion activities. . . .
Petitioners are Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds suing on behalf of themselves and their patients. Respondent is the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services . . . Petitioners challenged the regulations on the grounds that they were not authorized by Title X and that they violate the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the Title X clients and the First Amendment rights of Title X health providers. . . .
We begin by pointing out the posture of the cases before us. Petitioners are challenging the facial validity of the regulations. Thus, we are concerned only with the question whether, on their face, the regulations are both authorized by the Act, and can be construed in such a manner that they can be applied to a set of individuals without infringing upon constitutionally protected rights.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The broad language of Title X plainly allows the Secretary's construction of the statute. By its own terms Sec. 1008 prohibits the use of Title X funds "in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." Title X does not define the term "method of family planning," not does it enumerate what types of medical and counseling services are entitled to Title X funding. Based on the broad directives provided by Congress in Title X in general and Sec. 1008 in particular, we are unable to say that the Secretary's construction of the prohibition in Sec. 1008 to require a ban on counseling, referral, and advocacy within the Title X project, is impermissible.

 	 	 		. . .	 	When we find, as we do here, that the legislative history is ambiguous and unenlightening on the matters with respect to which the regulations deal, we customarily defer to the expertise of the agency.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Congress forbade the use of appropriate funds in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. It authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing this provision. The extensive litigation regarding governmental restrictions on abortion since our decision in Roe v. Wade, (1973), suggests that it was likely that any set of regulations promulgated by the Secretary -- other than the ones in force prior to 1988 and found by him to be relatively toothless and ineffectual -- would be challenged on constitutional grounds.
While we do not think that the constitutional arguments made by petitioners in this case are without some force, infra, we hold that they do not carry the day. Applying the canon of construction under discussion as best we can, we hold that the regulations promulgated by the Secretary do not raise the sort of grave and doubtful constitutional questions, that would lead us to assume Congress did not intend to authorize their issuance. Therefore, we need not invalidate the regulations in order to save the statute from unconstitutionally.
Petitioners contend that the regulations violate the First Amendment by impermissible discriminating based on viewpoint because they prohibit "all discussion about abortion as a lawful option -- including counseling, referral, and the provision of neutral and accurate information about ending a pregnancy -- while compelling the clinic or counselor to provide information that promotes continuing a pregnancy to term." They assert that the regulations violate the "free speech rights of private health care organizations that receive Title X funds, of their staff, and of their patients" by impermissibly imposing "viewpoint-discriminatory conditions on government subsidies" and thus penaliz[e] speech funded with non-Title X monies.
Because "Title X continues to fund speech ancillary to pregnancy testing in a manner that is not evenhanded with respect to views and information about abortion, it invidiously discriminates on the basis of viewpoint." Id., at 18. Relying on Reagan v. Taxation With Representation (1983) and Arkansas Writers Project Inc. v. Ragland, (1987), petitioners also assert that while the Government may place certain conditions on the receipt of Federal subsidies, it may not "discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas.' " . . .
 
Prohibition Held Constitutional
 There is no question but that the statutory prohibition contained in Sec. 1008 is constitutional. In Maher v. Roe, (1977) we upheld a state welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for services related to childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim that this unequal subsidization worked a violation of the Constitution. We held that the Government may "make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and . . . implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds." . . . The Government can, without violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternate program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way. In so doing, the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other. . . .
The challenged regulations implement the statutory prohibition by prohibiting counseling, referral and the provision of information regarding abortion as a method of family planning. They are designed to insure that the limits of the Federal program are observed. The Title X program is designed not for prenatal care, but to encourage family planning. A doctor who wished to offer prenatal care to a project patient who became pregnant could properly be prohibited from doing so because such service is outside the scope of the federally funded program. The regulations prohibiting abortion counseling and referral are of the same ilk; "no funds appropriated for the project may be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning," and a doctor employed by the project may be prohibited in the course of his project duties from counseling abortion or referring for abortion. . . .
To hold that the Government unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of viewpoint when it chooses to fund a program dedicated to advance certain permissible goals, because the program is advancing those goals necessarily discourages alternate goals, would render numerous government programs constitutionally suspect. . . . Petitioners' assertions ultimately boil down to the position that if the Government chooses to subsidize one protected right, it must subsidize analogous counterpart rights. But the Court has soundly rejected that proposition. . . . Within far broader limits than petitioners are willing to concede, when the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Issue of Medical Emergency
 Petitioners rely heavily on their claim that the regulations would not, in the circumstance of a medical emergency, permit a Title X project to refer a woman whose pregnancy places her life in imminent peril to a provider of abortions or abortion-related services. This case, of course, involves only a facial challenge to the regulations, and we do not have before us any application by the Secretary to a specific fact situation. On their face, we do not read the regulations to bar abortion referral or counseling in such circumstances.
Abortion counseling as a "method of family planning" is prohibited, and it does not seem that a medically necessitated abortion in such circumstances would be the equivalent of its use as a "method of family planning." Neither Sec. 1008 nor the specific restrictions of the regulations would apply. Moreover, the regulations themselves contemplate that a Title X project would be permitted to engage in otherwise prohibited abortion-related activity in such circumstances. Section 59.8(a)(2) provides a specific exemption for emergency care and requires Title X recipients "to refer the client immediately to an appropriate provider of emergency medical services." . . .
Petitioners also contend that the restrictions on the subsidization of abortion-related speech contained in the regulations are impermissible because they condition the receipt of a benefit, in this case Title X funding, on the relinquishment of a constitutional right, the right to engage in abortion advocacy and counseling. . . .
. . . Here the Government is not denying a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for the purpose for which they were authorized. The Secretary's regulations do not force the Title X grantee to give up abortion-related speech; they merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from Title X activities.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The same principles apply to petitioners' claim that the regulations abridge the free speech rights of the grantee's staff.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We turn now to petitioners' argument that the regulations violate a woman's Fifth Amendment right to choose whether to terminate her pregnancy. . . . The Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally protected and may validly choose to fund childbirth over abortion and " 'implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds' " for medical services relating to childbirth but not to those relating to abortion. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989). The Government has no affirmative duty to "commit any resources to facilitating abortions." Webster.
 
FROM THE DISSENTS
 
By Justice Blackmun
Casting aside established principles of statutory construction and administrative jurisprudence, the majority in these cases today unnecessarily passes upon important questions of constitutional law. In so doing, the Court, for the first time, upholds viewpoint-based suppression of speech solely because it is imposed on those dependent upon the Government for economic support.
Under essentially the same rationale, the majority upholds direct regulation of dialogue between a pregnant woman and her physician when that regulation has both the purpose and the effect of manipulating her decision as to the continuance of her pregnancy. I conclude that the Secretary's regulation of referral, advocacy, and counseling activities exceeds his statutory authority, and also, that the regulations violate the First and Fifth Amendments of our Constitution. Accordingly, I dissent and would reverse the divided-vote judgment of the Court of Appeals. . . .
Until today the Court never has upheld viewpoint-based suppression of speech simply because that suppression was a condition upon the acceptance of public funds. Whatever may be the Government's power to condition the receipt of its largess upon the relinquishment of constitutional rights, it surely does not extend to a condition that suppresses the recipient's cherished freedom of speech based solely upon the content or viewpoint of that speech. . . .
It cannot seriously be disputed that the counseling and referral provisions at issue in the present cases constitute content-based regulation of speech. Title X grantees may provide counseling and referral regarding any of a wide range of family planning and other topics, save abortion. . . .
The regulations are also clearly viewpont-based. While suppressing speech favorable to abortion with one hand, the Secretary compels anti-abortion speech with the other. . . .
Moreover, the regulations command that a project refer for prenatal care each woman diagnosed as pregnant, irrespective of the woman's expressed desire to continue or terminate her pregnancy. If a client asks directly about abortion, a Title X physician or counselor is required to say, in essence, that the project does not consider abortion to be an appropriate method of family planning. Both requirements are antithetical to the First Amendment. . . .
The Court concludes that the challenged regulations do not violate the First Amendment rights of Title X staff members because any limitation of the employees' freedom of expression. . . . is simply a consequence of their decision to accept employment at a federally funded project. But it has never been sufficient to justify an otherwise unconstitutional condition upon public employment that the employee may escape the condition by relinquishing his or her job. It is beyond question "that a Government may not require an individual to relinquish rights guaranteed him by the First Amendment as a condition of public employment." Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In the cases at bar, the speaker's interest in the communication is both clear and vital. In addressing the family-planning needs of their clients, the physicians and counselors who staff Title projects seek to provide them with the full range of information and options regarding their health and reproductive freedom. Indeed, the legitimate expectations of the patient and the ethical responsibilities of the medical profession demand no less. . . .
The Government's articulated interest in distorting the doctor/patient dialogue -- insuring that Federal funds are not spent for a purpose outside the scope of the program -- falls far short of that neccessary to justify the suppression of truthful information and professional medical opinion regarding constitutionally protected conduct. . . .
By far the most disturbing aspect of today's ruling is the effect it will have on the Fifth Amendment rights of the women who, supposedly, are beneficiaries of Title X programs.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Contrary to the majority's characterization, this is not a case in which individuals seek government aid in exercising their fundamental rights. The Fifth Amendment right asserted by petitioners is the right of a pregnant woman to be free from affirmative governmental interference in her decision. Roe v. Wade, (1973), and its progeny are not so much about a medical procedure as they are about a woman's fundamental right to self-determination. . . .
It is crystal clear that the aim of the challenged provisions -- an aim the majority cannot escape noticing -- is not simply to insure that Federal funds are not used to perform abortions, but to "reduce the incidence of abortion."

 	 	 		. . .	 	The manipulation of the doctor/patient dialogue achieved through the Secretary's regulations is clearly an effort to deter a woman from making a decision that, with her physician, is hers to make. As such, it violates the Fifth Amendment.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
By Justice O'Connor
 "[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such constructions is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress." Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, (1988). Justice Blackmun has explained well why this longstanding canon of statutory construction applies in this case, and I join Part I of his dissent. Part II demonstrates why the challenged regulations, which constitute the Secretary's interpretation of Sec. 1008 of the Public Health Service Act "raise serious constitutional problems": the regulations place content-based restrictions on the speech of Title X fund recipients, restrictions directed precisely at speech concerning one of "the most divisive and contentious issues than our Nation has faced in recent years."
One may well conclude, as Justice Blackmun does in Part II, that the regulations are unconstitutional for this reason. I do not join Part II of the dissent, however, for the same reason that I do not join Part III, in which Justice Blackmun concludes that the regulations are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. The canon of construction that Justice Blackmun correctly applies here is grounded in large part upon our time-honored practice of not reaching constitutional questions unnecessarily. "It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint. . . . that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them." . . .
This Court acts at the limits of its power when it invalidates a law on constitutional grounds. In recognition of our place in the constitutional scheme, we must act with "great gravity and delicacy" when telling a coordinate branch that its actions are absolutely prohibited absent constitutional amendment. . . . In this case, we need only tell the Secretary that his regulations are not a reasonable interpretation of the statute; we need not tell Congress that it cannot pass such legislation. If we rule solely on statutory grounds, Congress retains the power to force the constitutional question by legislating more explicitly. It may instead choose to do nothing. That decision should be left to Congress; we should not tell Congress what it cannot do before it has chosen to do it. It is enough in this case to conclude that neither the language nor the history of Sec. 1008 compels the Secretary's interpretation, and that the interpretation raises serious First Amendment concerns. On this basis alone, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and invalidate the challenged regulations.
 
By Justice Stevens
 In my opinion, the Court has not paid sufficient attention to the language of the controlling statute or to the consistent interpretation accorded the statute by the responsible Cabinet officers during four different Presidencies and 18 years.
The relevant text of the "Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970" has remained unchanged since its enactment. The preamble to the Act states that it was passed:
"To promote public health and welfare by expanding, improving, and better coordinating the family planning services and population research activities of the Federal Government, and for other purposes."
The declaration of Congressional purposes emphasizes the importance of educating the public about family planning services. . . .
In contrast to the statutory emphasis on making relevant information readily available to the public, the statute contains no suggestion that Congress intended to authorize the suppression or censorship of any information by any Government employee or by any grant recipient.

HEADLINE: BEVERLY HILLS JOURNAL;
Recession Hits Home In the City Of Excess

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., May 23

 BODY:
Moshe Pereg knew he was really in trouble when it came to be less than a week before Mother's Day and hardly a customer stirred in his jewelry shop on South Beverly Drive. He sold no $32,000 diamond-encrusted emerald rings, and hardly any $100 trinkets.
"It used to be that rich people had the money, but now the recession has affected them, too," Mr. Pereg said, adding that he had not experienced such a steep slowdown in his 48 years making and selling custom jewelry. 
 Even such a sanctified haunt of money, privilege, ostenstation and excess as Beverly Hills is not immune to the laws of economics. True, merchants say business has picked up a bit in recent weeks. But there are more vacant storefronts along Rodeo Drive than in many a year, office buildings on Wilshire Boulevard are begging for tenants and the hotels and restaurants are hurting. As a result, the City of Beverly Hills is struggling to make up a deficit of as much as $3 million in its current budget.
Of course, everything is relative. In Beverly Hills, recession can mean postponing a facelift. Fred Hayman, a retailer of luxury clothing and perfumes walked down Rodeo Drive with his German shepherd, Chumley, and pronounced the times tough. "What has changed so dramatically is spending habits," he said. "The excesses of the 80's had to end. The days when people bought 12 to 15 dresses are gone."
Still, his specialty shop has no trouble selling beaded leotards by Josie Natori at $495 each.
The troubles began last year with the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert. The New York brokerage house had its high-flying junk bond operations in an office building on Rodeo Drive, and it was the city's largest employer. It kept a block of 100 rooms across the street at the toney Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel for the flocks of buyers who came to buy its bonds, and wined and dined them royally in nearby restaurants.
Now the office vacancy rate is 22 percent, with 1.6 million square feet of office space empty, nearly triple what it was two years ago. Gilbert Dembo, a broker who leases retail space, says vacancies on Rodeo Drive are about 15 percent. All of this, says William C. Boyd, executive vice president of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, has persuaded the local business owners that they can no longer sit back and expect the glittery name to attract new businesses.
For the first time, Beverly Hills began an economic development drive. The chamber president and the former mayor recently toured Asia, trying to lure corporate headquarters.
What is not generally recognized is that Beverly Hills, a 5.7-square-mile enclave of luxury about 7 miles west of downtown Los Angeles with a population of 32,000, is more than home to movie celebrities and the fabulously wealthy. More than 76,000 people work in the city, which has the corporate headquarters of the Hilton Hotels Corporation and Litton Industries, among others. Its tax base comes mainly from business license taxes, sales taxes and other business levies. Drexel alone paid about $600,000 a year.
So the business downturn has threatened the city's extravagant public services, considered the best in California. It recently opened a $120 million civic center by the architect Charles Moore, which cost nearly quadruple the original estimate. With revenue from sales, hotel and business taxes well below expectations, officials at City Hall are going through the process of trying to cut services or raise taxes. They anticipate a shortfall of $5 million for the budget year that begins July 1, in addition to the $3 million deficit this year.
Meanwhile the value of building permits is down by about a quarter but the number of projects is about the same, suggesting that even the rich are remodeling rather than tearing down and building new houses as had been common practice.
But none of this suggests that Beverly Hills has lost its luster. Barney's, the New York clothier, is forging ahead with plans to open a 100,000-square-foot store on Wilshire Boulevard. And Jeff Hyland, a real estate broker who caters to the rich, says showings of luxury homes have doubled since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
The new Mayor, Vicki Reynolds, says, "We are just going to have to ride the tide of this."

HEADLINE: Jobless-Benefit Claims Drop

BYLINE: AP
LP>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped in early May, but not by enough to signal much of an economic rebound, analysts said today.
For the week ended May 11, the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims fell by 5,000, to 454,000, the Labor Department reported today.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
 The small drop in claims could indicate that if the recession is ending, the recovery is not a robust one, analysts said.
"These numbers are coming down, which is good, but they are not coming down fast enough," said Michael K. Evans, who heads an economic forecasting firm in Washington.
Many analysts say the claims number will have to drop below 400,000 to be considered a sign that an economic recovery is in full swing.
The number can be extremely volatile from week to week, but analysts often view a big decline as an indication the economy is improving, while a huge jump is considered a warning that labor markets are deteriorating.
The report of 454,000 claims is a significant improvement over the numbers recorded in March, when claims exceeded the half-million mark for three weeks in a row.
Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said that on a four-week average basis claims were at 467,000, down from six weeks ago, when the four-week average was 511,000.
"This is another economic series that is moving in the right direction to end the recession and get a recovery going," Mr. Rippe said.
Still, claims are much higher than in the corresponding week a year earlier, when the number of people filing for unemployment assistance was 358,000.

HEADLINE: Factories' Orders Up Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods from American factories climbed 2.9 percent in April, the Commerce Department said today. The rise, the first in four months, was seen as further evidence that the economy has begun to stabilize.
"It's another sign that we may be turning the corner here," said Michael L. Penzer, a senior economist at the Bank of America. The economy has been in recession since July, but in the last few weeks there have been signs of firming in various sectors -- retail sales, housing, industrial production and even jobs. 
 Today's report was greeted with the same caution given the others, but it was nevertheless considered important, because a rise in orders for durables, relatively expensive items like appliances, automobiles and machinery that are expected to last more than three years, is a proven bellwether of recovery.
 
Mentioned by Greenspan
 "The first sign that this thing is actually turning," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, stated earlier this month, "will show up in the order books of the major materials producers. If companies are to increase production, rather than to continue to liquidate inventories, then business for makers of durable goods must pick up."
In another upbeat disclosure, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell by 5,000 in the week ended May 11, to 454,000, well below recent peaks.
The National Association of Business Economists, meanwhile, declared the recession to be "almost over," with 87 percent of those responding to its quarterly survey saying the low point would be reached in the second or third quarter. Sixty percent said the bottom would occur in the current quarter and 27 percent said it would come in the July-September period. The 87 percent overall figure compares with 73 percent in a survey three months ago.
 
Drop in Transportation
 The rise in durables orders, to $115.5 billion, was broadly based. The only major industry to post a decline was transportation equipment. Excluding military orders, the gain was 2.5 percent.
Some analysts fretted that the broad category of nonmilitary capital goods -- those that businesses use to produce their goods or services -- showed a 10.3 percent decline last month. But others noted that this was entirely a result of a slump in orders for aircraft and parts, and that otherwise new orders in the category advanced 3.5 percent. The Boeing Company, for one, has years worth of aircraft work, and a decline in orders in that sector has little current consequence for the economy.
And some found it sobering that unfilled orders at factories declined eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $500.5 billion, in April, with the only increase posted by electronic equipment. One component of the Government index intended to predict the economy's course is backlogs of durables.
Among new orders, electronic equipment was by far the strongest sector, rebounding 11 percent in April after dropping 13.5 percent in March. Industrial machinery rose 1.2 percent after a small March decline, while primary metals gained 7.8 percent. Transportation equipment, on the other hand, fell 4.5 percent as the decline for aircraft more than offset an increase for motor vehicles.
 
Prediction on Recovery
 "Basically, the economy appears ready to stabilize after an extended period of decline," said Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, noting particularly the rise in orders for electronic equipment. "These figures appear to confirm that a recovery will begin during the third quarter."
Analysts said that the Federal Reserve was now almost certain to shun any further easing of monetary policy for the next two weeks and that an easing would occur after that only if the June 7 report on employment in May was exceptionally weak.
Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods -- everything from dishwashers to bulldozers -- rose 5.5 percent in April after five straight monthly declines.
The 2.9 percent overall increase last month was in sharp contrast to a 4.5 percent decline in March and was the biggest rise since a 3.5 percent gain in December.
Shipments of durable goods rose 4.3 percent in April, to $119.4 billion, after declining for five straight months. All major industries posted gains, paced by a 10.9 percent jump for transportation equipment, which was twice as large as the March decline. Motor vehicles accounted for most of this increase.

HEADLINE: Banking Overhaul Bill Clears a Big Hurdle

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's plan to free the banking industry of decades-old restrictions cleared a significant hurdle today when a Congressional panel unanimously voted to send it to the House Banking Committee, suggesting that it might be politically possible to reshape the banking industry this year.
The Administration contends that the changes it proposes would help both the economy and the ailing industry by permitting banks to diversify into other businesses and to expand across state lines. 
 Its plan, the most comprehensive overhaul of the nation's banking system since the Great Depression, emerged from the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Institutions with some changes but largely intact.
Despite today's action, lawmakers and Treasury officials said that the legislation still faced many significant obstacles in the House and the Senate before it could become law.
The plan's core provisions remain: to permit industrial ownership of banks, to allow mergers of commercial banks and investment banks, and to eliminate barriers that now limit banks' ability to open new branches across state lines. But a section on consolidating the regulatory system to two Federal agencies from four and another setting modest restrictions on deposit insurance were removed.
Congressional aides said the full Banking Committee would likely begin considering the measure around the middle of next month.
While 36 of the 52 members of the Banking Committee are also on the subcommittee, the final shape of the legislation remains far from certain. Many amendments to the package have been delayed until the full committee meets.
Parts of it are also expected to be taken up by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over the securities industry. Its chairman, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, has been reluctant to repeal the major provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibits commercial banks from merging with investment banks.
Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has been holding hearings on bank reform, but has not yet scheduled a session to draft legislation. He has indicated that the committee may begin crafting legislation over the summer. Nevertheless, significant change this year now seems possible.
"We're very pleased that we completed the first step very successfully," said an Assistant Treasury Secretary, Jerome Powell. "We've gotten an awful lot out of the subcommittee."
Before final action on the measure, the subcommittee approved two amendments that would substantially roll back the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires financial institutions to meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
By a vote of 21 to 15, the subcommittee decided to provide an exemption from the act for more than 75 percent of the nation's banks. The proposal was sponsored by Representative Paul E. Kanjorksi, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and had been strongly supported by the Independent Bankers Association, a trade organization for small and mid-size banks. It was opposed by community and consumer groups.
Another provision sponsored by Mr. Kanjorski and approved by voice vote would exempt for two years any bank that received an "outstanding" or "satisfactory" rating under the act within the last two years.
Mr. Powell said the Administration would support the modifications to the Community Reinvestment Act, although the Treasury Department had not proposed them.
An amendment strengthening the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was adopted, 27 to 8. The act prohibits discriminating in providing credit on the basis of race, age or sex but has not been widely applied. The amendment was proposed by Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland.
The subcommittee defeated by a vote of 18 to 15 a measure that would have provided $11 million to the depositors at the Freedom National Bank in Harlem who were not fully protected by deposit insurance because their accounts were larger than $100,000. The amendment was sponsored by Representative Floyd H. Flake, Democrat of Queens.
The subcommittee also rejected by a vote of 27 to 9 an amendment proposed by Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, to require banks to cash Government checks of up to $3,000. Mr. Kennedy said the idea was to assist the poor and elderly who must pay check-cashing companies high fees to cash Government checks.
Representative Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, the committee's ranking minority member, said the provision was unnecessary and would add to banking costs.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Recession? Can't Get Enough of It!

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
There is clearly no recession in advertisements with recession-related themes. Anyone unaware that the economy has been in a slump since July need only watch television or leaf through a newspaper to learn all about it -- not from the news, but from the ads.
These ads began appearing in the fall, increased in frequency during the winter and now, as the recession nears its first anniversary, are in full flower. Especially unusual is that the ads use words and images at odds with the advertising's traditionally perfect universe, a world of endless horizons, blue skies and cheerfulness that might tire even Pollyanna. Here, the horizons are limited; the skies are cloudy, even stormy, and terms like "gloomy," "bad" and "recession" appear.
 
Cajoling and Advice
 "Where is the good news in all the bad news?" asks the headline of a print ad created by Grey Advertising, Los Angeles, for the Coldwell Banker Residential Group real estate brokerage. Another ad in the same campaign advises would-be home buyers on "how to step up in a down market." 
 "Look, I know you have less to spend these days," R. David Thomas, founder of the fast-food chain Wendy's International, says earnestly in a television spot created by Backer Spielvogel Bates, New York, "but that doesn't mean you have to eat less."
In a newspaper ad for Konica Business Machines USA's copiers and facsimile machines, a mock supermarket tabloid carries the headline "Expert tells how to beat recession: Try nothing." The ad, by Keiler Advertising, Farmington, Conn., pitches a program selling office equipment with no finance charge.
"The economic recovery may be months away," reads the text of a newspaper ad, created by Chiat/Day/ Mojo, New York, for the brokerage firm Shearson Lehman Brothers, "but that doesn't mean you have to wait around to start benefiting from it." The ad offers readers a research report on 14 stocks "that could start recovering before the recovery," so that "you could start your own economic recovery now."
The trend is not limited to large national advertisers. A series of small newspaper ads for the Adrienne restaurant in New York's Peninsula Hotel asks questions like "Hard times, hard rolls?"
Recession-related advertising is based on a time-honored tradition of playing off the news of the day.
"You're trying to create empathy with the consumer, and this is what's on people's minds," said Donny Deutsch, executive vice president and creative director of Deutsch Inc., New York. For one client, the furniture retail chain Ikea, Mr. Deutsch is producing print ads showing fashionably furnished rooms above headlines like "What recession?"
"Anytime you can bring anything relevant into an ad, the difference of being topical makes it fun," Mr. Deutsch said.
"It's a sensible strategy," said Judith Langer, head of Langer Associates, New York, a market research and trend-spotting consultancy. In the firm's focus-group interviews, there has emerged "a strong sense among consumers that even if they haven't been affected yet personally," she continued, they are fully aware of the depth and breadth of the country's economic problems.
Leo J. Shapiro, chairman of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market survey and consumer research company in Chicago, said: "During a period like this, it irritates people if you tempt them to buy things they don't think they can afford. So there has to be a shift in the way you advertise."
What makes recession-related campaigns stand out is that advertisers are talking to consumers about an economic climate in which they are spending less money to get them to spend more money.
"You have to give them permission to spend," Mr. Deutsch said, "because everything out there tells you, psychologically, 'Don't spend; don't spend.' " That is why, he said, his agency's Ikea campaign stresses the chain's philosophy, as described in the advertising, of offering high-quality furniture for lower prices than other furniture retailers.
One vital ingredient, Mr. Deutsch said, is humor, which leavens the otherwise serious thoughts that might be stirred by frequent invocations of hard times. For that reason many of his agency's Ikea ads also include puns. Other advertisers, including the Stouffer Foods Corporation, temper the somberness of their messages by emphasizing how their products are priced to offer "value," and playing down the economic conditions causing consumers to be concerned about saving money.
Look for recession-related campaigns to remain popular, Mr. Shapiro said, until they become so popular that "all the competitors" in various consumer-product categories are running them. Then they will be replaced by a new generation of advertising, he said, in which marketers will "talk about their products being better or different."

HEADLINE: Memphis Builds a Pyramid, But Could Use Tips From Pharaohs

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, May 18

 BODY:
For two years this city, which took its name from ancient Egypt, has lived with the expectation that a monumental steel and glass pyramid would rise and become the clarifying symbol of Memphis, just as the Empire State Building symbolizes New York.
But that hope for an identity, a downtown revival and swarms of tourists is beginning to look to some people here as a casualty of the recession at best, or as so much pie in the sky at worst. 
 The 32-story Great American Pyramid of Memphis is nearing completion, but it is behind schedule and has none of the extras promised by a promoter who envisioned the building as a glittering tourist attraction and civic center that would attract three million people a year.
Instead of the rides, exhibits and programs envisioned within its walls to celebrate this Mississippi River city and its musical heritage, there is an increasingly bitter public examination of what went wrong and questions about which, if any, of the attractions will materialize.
 
Accusations of Mismanagement
 The partners in the project's private management company are battling over who will control it and have traded accusations of mismanagement and deceit.
And officials of Shelby County and the City of Memphis, which built the $58 million pyramid, have begun to wonder at the inability of the management group, the Pyramid Companies, to obtain temporary financing for concession space, a museum and other attractions intended to enhance the drawing power of the 22,000-seat arena.
Last month, when it appeared that none of these improvements would be ready for the projected opening of the pyramid on May 29, elected officials declared the management company in default of its contract. This made the company, which is headed by Sidney Shlenker, a 54-year-old businessman and promoter who once owned the Denver Nuggets basketball team, potentially liable for payment of $3 million to the city from an escrow account supposedly set up under the contract for just this eventuality.
But now the existence of the cash in the escrow account is in question, and some people here feel they have been taken.
 
'A Fantasy to Begin With'
 "I know a shell game when I see one," said Walter Bailey, a Shelby County Commissioner who represents the district where the pyramid is situated but who has opposed the management contract since it was proposed.
"I'm not surprised there are problems," he said. "Much of it was a fantasy to begin with."
Hurrying through a series of meetings recently on the problems with the pyramid, Mayor Richard C. Hackett and other city officials sought to reassure the people of Memphis that the project's chances were still good. The real problem, the Mayor said, is "a recession, a war and a banking crisis" that intervened after the deal was struck in 1989.
"Yes, there are personalities involved and philosophical differences," he said of the arguments among the partners. "And yes, a lot happened as they were trying to get financing. But I am confident that it will be resolved."
 
A Reclusive Promoter
 Mr. Shlenker, who once aggressively promoted his plans in television and radio appearances and in newspaper interviews, now declines to give interviews. He did not return telephone calls seeking comment as he struggled to hold his deal together.
Some of his associates said he was angry at news reports -- including a series of articles in the city's only daily newspaper, The Commercial Appeal -- that have carried critical comments from partners and disgruntled contractors. They said Mr. Shlenker thought such comments would hurt his chances of obtaining the $55 million in temporary financing.
The project began in 1987 as a boxy, conventional municipal sports arena to replace an 11,000-seat coliseum where Memphis State University plays basketball. Gradually, the box metamorphosed into the pyramid and became a weapon in the fight against downtown decline.
Gene Pearson, a professor of urban planning at Memphis State, said the decision to build the pyramid represented a significant victory for advocates of the central city over suburban interests in the area. The pyramid thus joined the revitalization of historic Beale Street, a downtown mall and a trolley system as part of a larger plan to breathe new life into Memphis.
As city officials and local business leaders were discussing the pyramid, one businessman, John B. Tigrett, a financial consultant and investor, brought in Mr. Shlenker, who presented a new and grander vision.
Mr. Shlenker, an investor in Broadway musicals who has a financial interest in an entertainment booking concern, proposed adding a Hard Rock Cafe, a music awards hall of fame, rides built around a music theme and an exhibit commemorating the early days of Stax Record Company, a black-owned rhythm and blues outfit. The cost for these attractions was $55 million, and he, Mr. Tigrett and others would raise the money privately.
In addition, the pyramid itself would have an observation deck at its pinnacle and an elevator or glass-enclosed "inclinator" to carry visitors up the outside edge of the structure. The base of the pyramid would be equal in size to eight football fields.
Local officials were so impressed that the Memphis City Council also gave Mr. Shlenker's company a management contract for nearby Mud Island. The hope was that he could take the island, which had been developed as a park devoted to Mississippi River lore, and link it with the pyramid in a vast entertainment complex.
 
Signing Corporate Sponsors
 In a relatively short time, said Dean Bonham, a former associate of Mr. Shlenker whose job was to seek out corporate sponsors and concession operators for the pyramid's attractions, more than $45 million in contracts had been negotiated.
"These were ironclad contracts that could be taken to banks and used as collateral for financing the $55 million," Mr. Bonham said.
But as time dragged on and financing for the projects failed to materialize for reasons ranging from the recession to questions about Mr. Shlenker's business dealings, many people here began to question Mr. Shlenker's ability to make the deal work.
Last month Mr. Tigrett broke with Mr. Shlenker, charging mismanagement, and said he was prepared with others to take over the company and install sound management.
In an interview in The Commercial Appeal, Mr. Tigrett said he had come to doubt the extent of Mr. Shlenker's personal wealth as he had watched him spend $16 million in his and other investors' money without producing any of the improvements for which he had contracted.
Mr. Bonham said he left the management company in January because of what he called "unprofessional and unethical" things he saw happening. He would not elaborate, and said Mr. Shlenker threatened him with a lawsuit if he talked about their dealings.
Many people here are taking solace in the fact that at the very least the city would have a new and larger arena in a distinctive building. But even that is not expected to be ready for sports events until this fall.
"The basic facility is still there and it is substantial," said John Dudas, vice president of Belz Enterprises, a local developer who is a former director of the Center City Commission. "All the other stuff was the gravy, but the sports arena was what you could always count on. And that is still there."

HEADLINE: Gorbachev's Pleas for Aid Not Expected to Bear Fruit

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 23

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not get more than a few billion dollars in aid from the economic summit meeting of industrial democracies here in July, Government officials and economic experts say.
This would be true even if he reached agreement by then with the leaders of the 15 Soviet republics on the latest plan to introduce a market economy and received an invitation to pitch his appeal to the summit conference, a wide range of officials and experts from participating countries agree. 
 A spokesman for Prime Minister John Major, the host of the gathering, said that an invitation had not been ruled out despite reports that President Bush was skeptical. The British spokesman said a decision would not be made until closer to the date, by all the participants: the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the European Community. Officials in France and Italy say they would be happy to have Mr. Gorbachev come to London.
British officials said that if the Soviets made the breakthrough on economic transformation that seemed to be promised by a plan Mr. Gorbachev's advisers will soon present to President Bush in Washington, aid projects that were in the pipeline before Mr. Gorbachev's crackdown on Lithuania in January could be quickly unblocked.
 
Mostly Agricultural Aid
 But they said the summit participants and the international financial institutions they control showed little inclination to pledge large new amounts of aid.
The sums that have been blocked since January amount only to a few billion dollars in agricultural loan guarantees and credits from the United States and the European Community, which pledged $600 million in food credits and $480 million in technical assistance to Moscow last December. The European Community agreed today to begin a separate $300 million emergency food shipment program by July, officials in Brussels said.
Until the events in Lithuania, Mr. Bush and other Western leaders seemed ready to approve associate member status for the Soviet Union in the International Monetary Fund, and some officials say the summit leaders might go ahead by July.
"If the Soviet Union became an associate member, the I.M.F. and the World Bank could provide the technical assistance necessary to get reforms implemented and moving," a spokesman for the I.M.F. in Washington said, but Moscow would not be eligible for direct financial aid from these institutions until it became a full member.
"The basic apparatus of a market economy would have to be in place and well advanced before a move to full membership could be contemplated," the I.M.F. spokesman said.
Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which has made aid and credit pledges of $33.7 billion to the Soviet Union since the cold war ended, told reporters on Wednesday on the flight back from talks with Mr. Bush in Washington that it would be senseless to pour more money into a bottomless pit before long-promised Soviet economic reforms actually took hold.
A year from now, when the 1992 economic summit meeting is held in Munich, things could look different, Mr. Kohl said, and Mr. Gorbachev might attend then. But with a recession afflicting the United States, Britain and France, and Germany overextended by the burdens of last year's unification, governments seem unlikely to be able to provide the kind of investment capital Mr. Gorbachev needs.
"You have to mobilize private capital for that order of magnitude," said Francis Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies here. "Gorbachev might get money from the international capital markets if they see convincing ventures to invest in, but these will not exist as long as they haven't seriously gone into a market economy, particularly in energy."
 
Oil Production
 If Mr. Gorbachev did come to London for the summit meeting, Mr. Heisbourg said, "One area he'll be listened to very seriously is oil production, which could produce serious returns financially. Oil companies have money, big money, but where are the assurances they would have the power to run the show?"
Oil production in the Soviet Union, long the world's biggest producer, has been declining and some experts predict it will soon become a net importer unless it gets substantial investment and technology from the West.
A group of 24 industrial nations has pledged about $24 billion in aid to countries in Eastern Europe that have already begun the transition to market economies, and a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development based here has $12 billion to help investments in both Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
"If first a serious Soviet market economic plan is elaborated and implemented with the agreement of the republics, the Soviet Union could benefit from a G-24 type of effort," Mr. Heisbourg said. "By Marshall Plan standards, the $24 billion is actually not dissimilar."

HEADLINE: HOUSE VOTE BACKS BUSH'S AUTHORITY ON TRADE ACCORDS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
In a vote that was divided as much on regional as party lines, the House of Representatives today authorized the Administration to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and a 108-nation pact to lower international trade barriers.
The House vote was 231 to 192. The Senate, which began debate on the issue late this afternoon, is expected to vote on Friday to extend for two years the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements. 
 What began six months ago as a routine Congressional decision on whether to renew the Administration's negotiating authority evolved into a passionate debate on America's place in the world economy. Members of Congress on both sides of the issue, under conflicting pressures from labor unions, businesses, and environmental lobbies, described the Administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements as probably the most important and contentious vote on an economic issue facing Congress this year.
 
Worries About Jobs and Wages
 Opponents of the Administration, like Representative Don J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, warned that liberalizing trade with a low-wage country like Mexico would hasten the decline in real earnings of middle-class manufacturing workers across the United States. "The old days when the American worker earning $12 an hour could beat a guy on the other side of the world earning a dollar an hour, because he was 20 times as productive, are gone," he said.
But the Administration's supporters contended that free trade with Mexico would create jobs and prosperity on both sides of the border. "This is perhaps the most important economic and trade vote members of Congress will cast in this decade," said Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee.
President Bush praised the vote. "It's going to be good for the working man in this country and good for the environment," he said.
The actual vote in the House was on a resolution that would cancel the automatic renewal on June 1 of the Administration's authority to negotiate trade agreements and submit each pact to a single vote of Congress with no amendments allowed.
The resolution must be defeated in both houses for the Administration to retain what is known as its "fast track" authority.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said at a news conference on Monday that negotiations with Mexico could begin as soon as next week if Congress allowed the authority to be renewed. But multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade remain stalled as the European Community considers whether to accept large reductions in its barriers to agricultural imports.
David W. Martin, a British member of the European Parliament and one of the community's 14 vice presidents, said in Washington early this week that he saw no indications of a softening in the European position.
In the Senate tonight, two key Senators differed on whether the Administration could be trusted to negotiate a trade agreement in the best interests of the United States. Donald W, Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, accused the Administration of being elitist and lacking empathy for unemployed American blue-collar workers and taking a position of "let's take care of the rest of the world."
But Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who has played a central role in guiding the fast-track authority through Congress, said, "If we find any of those agreements are not in the national interest, we can vote them down, and we will."
Even if the Senate endorses fast-track authority on Friday the issue may not be entirely settled. Senator Riegle has scheduled a news conference for Friday morning to announce he will make efforts to impose conditions on any negotiations with Mexico.
The Administration prevailed in the House today because 91 Democrats joined 140 Republicans in support of the renewal. Only 21 Republicans, together with 170 Democrats and one independent, opposed it.
 
Analyzing the Split
 But simple tallies of the vote gave a misleading impression, as though the House divided like a well-split log. In fact, both parties splintered beneath the force of extraordinary lobbying efforts by labor unions and corporations, and the Administration won because it gathered more small groups of lawmakers than its opponents.
Regional interests and ideological positions were as strong as party affiliations in influencing the vote. Auto workers, fruit and vegetable farmers, and textile mill owners and workers had all warned that they might be the losers, even if other groups found extra jobs as trade increased.
The United Automobile Workers warned that car companies would move factories to Mexico to take advantage of low wages. Fruit and vegetable farmers worried about an influx of cheap imports from Mexico. Textile manufacturers joined with their employees to try to derail a virtually completed agreement in the GATT negotiations to dismantle some of the many restrictions on international textile trade.
Personal beliefs on economics also played a role. Most representatives from the auto-manufacturing states of Michigan and Ohio opposed the renewal. But Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, voted in favor of the Administration's position even though his district includes a Ford engine plant, a General Motors automobile body stamping plant and a Mazda factory.
 
Talk of Trading Blocs
 Some remarks yesterday in favor of a trade pact with Mexico reflected less than a complete acceptance of free-trade principles. "The world is moving into trading blocs -- Europe in '92, the Pacific Rim," said Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico. "We need to do the same."
Supporting fast-track authority makes more political sense for members of Congress with national political ambitions or with concerns about national perceptions of their parties. Free trade is widely perceived on Capitol Hill as a popular principle except among those directly affected.
Some House members also questioned the constitutionality of ceding to the Administration so much of Congress's power.
The Administration received vital support from the Democratic leadership in the House and from Democrats representing border states and Pacific Coast states, two regions that have benefited greatly from increased exports.
The Administration won in part because of a tactical retreat at the beginning of the month. President Bush sent a letter to Congress on May 1 committing the Administration to consider during the negotiations such issues as environmental protection, worker safety, consumers' health and assistance to workers who lose jobs because of imports.
Bill Cunningham, a lobbyist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said late this afternoon that while he was disappointed with the House vote, he was pleased that issues such as the environment and worker safety had become trade issues.
The Administration's action also split the environmental movement. Groups such as the National Wildlife Federation accepted the President's assurances while Friends of the Earth and other groups remained hostile to a possible trade pact with Mexico.

HEADLINE: More and More Young Jews Are Picking Careers as Rabbis

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Disenchanted with the prospect of careers in law, medicine and business -- and searching for something more satisfying and often as remunerative -- young American Jews are applying to rabbinical schools in record numbers.
The Reform and Conservative rabbinical seminaries are accepting larger classes for next fall than they have in almost a decade amid signs that the rabbinate has achieved heightened professional status. 
 Administrators are not certain why there has been an explosion of interest in rabbinical training. The trend is not matched in Protestant seminaries, where admissions for ministerial training have been steady for 20 years, or in Catholic seminaries, where admissions have declined.
 
'A Competitive Profession'
 The phenomenon seems to be economic as well as spiritual. As the number of Reform and Conservative rabbis has dwindled in recent years, the rabbinical pay scale has risen to levels previously confined to a handful of more conventional professions. The starting salary, including benefits, for last year's graduates of the Jewish Theological Seminary, a Conservative institution, was $60,000. Salary packages of $100,000 are common for experienced Reform and Conservative rabbis, and some earn twice that amount.
"In a falling economy, where the law is overcrowded, where medicine is on its way to socialization, where business is discredited, the rabbinate has become a competitive profession," said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a professor of religion at Dartmouth.
There is also a belief that the trend may signify a movement away from the materialism of the 1980's toward more spiritual concerns. "I sense we've turned a corner in this country," said Rabbi Gary P. Zola, national dean of admissions and college relations at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, a Reform movement seminary based in Cincinnati. "I sense more of an interest in the helping professions."
Dr. Alfred Gottschalk, the president of Hebrew Union, said about his students, "Sure, they are looking for security, but they are also looking for a sense of inner security."
Salaries among the Orthodox, as among Christian clergy, tend to be considerably lower than those offered by the generally much larger Reform and Conservative congregations. Orthodox seminaries did not experience a surge in applications this year.
"Nobody does this for the money," said Martha Bergadine Zamek of Evanston, Ill., who recently received her letter of admission to rabbinical school, "but it's nice to know that Reform rabbis make a good living."
 
Forsaking a Double Income
 Mrs. Zamek, who is 30 years old and a convert to Judaism, will be entering Hebrew Union College in the fall with her husband, Stanton, 31. She will be giving up her job with an advertising agency, and he will leave his job in a law firm. They will also be giving up a salary they describe as being in "the low six figures."
Mr. Zamek, a real-estate lawyer, said he realized a few years ago that he was not happy being a lawyer, a profession he chose because "it was practical."
"I was so 'practical' that I found myself entirely unhappy with everything I was doing," he said. "I decided to switch to something I would enjoy."
The couple's decision came in an unusual way. The Zameks had been estranged from organized Jewish life until four years ago, when they decided to marry. Their involvement in an educational program that led to Mrs. Zamek's conversion to Judaism was the beginning of their journey to the rabbinate.
Reform Judaism has admitted women to the rabbinate since 1972; Conservative Judaism since 1985. Seminary enrollments increased for both branches after women were admitted, but the numbers had leveled off until the surge this year.
Second-career applicants, like the Zameks, and converts, like Mrs. Zamek, have also added to the numbers in recent years, especially in the Reform seminary.
 
Story in Statistics
 Admissions at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, an Orthodox institution affiliated with Yeshiva University in Manhattan, have been steady for several years. Forty to 45 applicants have been admitted for next fall. The school admits only men for rabbinic training, most of them in their early 20's, right out of college.
At the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, admissions are up almost 40 percent, from 26 last year to 36 this year. Two-thirds are men, and the average age is 25.
At Hebrew Union College, which also has a branch in Manhattan, the increase is about 20 percent, from 42 last year to 51 this year. Roughly half are women, and the average age is 27.
Both seminaries said that they chose from a much larger applicant pool than in past years and that their admission standards were in no way changed to accommodate more students.
Faced with a decline in the number of rabbis available to serve congregations in recent years, the two seminaries have recruited extensively on college and high school campuses with the help of grants from the Lilly Endowment, a foundation that has been working with Christians and Jews to increase clergy recruitment and improve training.
The movements have published or reissued several books on the profession, and the Reform movement even released a 27-minute video called "Rabbi." The video shows rabbis in liturgical, educational and social-action roles, visiting the sick, teaching youngsters and working in politics.
Rabbi Zola, who worked on the video, said the message the Reform movement is trying to get across is this: "In a certain sense, lawyers, C.P.A.'s, business executives are a dime a dozen, but a rabbi -- a true rabbi -- is something very special."
Another motivator for those interested in the rabbinate is the growing availability of fellowship money, especially through the Wexner Foundation in Columbus, Ohio. For the last four years, the foundation has awarded dozens of grants to students.
Executives at the foundation review applications from all the major Jewish movements, as well as from the smaller Reconstructionist seminary in Wyncote, Pa. Larry S. Moses, director of the Wexner fellowship program, said more applications were received this year than ever before.
 
Amid a Recession
 "I don't know if this is a blip on the screen," Mr. Moses said. "There is always the possibility that this recession has something to do with it. Maybe we are reaching the point economically where the high-status, high-salaried professions -- medicine, law and business -- are not so high status any more or high salaried, but in fact plagued by their own problems."
What has struck him about the 87 applicants for rabbinic fellowships this year, he said, is that "these are people with options." They are characterized by high grade-point averages, top scores on the Graduate Record Exam and often degrees from prestigious colleges and universities.
Robert Scheinberg of Rockville, Md., who just graduated from Columbia with honors, entered college four years ago intent on becoming a doctor. "I did all right in my pre-med courses," he said, "but I didn't care enough about being a doctor. I discovered that my real passion was for Judaism." He plans to enter the Jewish Theological Seminary in the fall with the hope of eventually being a Jewish educator.
Mr. Scheinberg said there were no rabbis in his family, although his grandfather was sent to a yeshiva on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the hope that he would become a rabbi. "He became a doctor instead," Mr. Scheinberg said. "With me, I guess just the opposite is happening."
Daniel E. Levin, who is graduating from Colgate, will also be the first rabbi in his family. He will enter Hebrew Union College in the fall. Some of his classmates still can't believe his decision.
"When I tell people I'm going to rabbinical school," he said, "they say, 'Medical school?' When I correct them, they do a double take. The next question is: 'Can rabbis get married?' "

With her as she packed was her husband, Stanton, who will also be attending the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. (Steve Kagan for The New York Times) (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: Senate Rejects Weicker's Plan For Income Tax

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Friday, May 24

 BODY:
The Senate voted early today to reject the revenue overhaul and income-tax plan of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., passing instead a traditional $7.7 billion budget that would resolve Connecticut's fiscal crisis by broadening the sales tax and raising taxes overall by nearly $1 billion.
The 22-to-14 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined forces with 11 Republicans, does not necessarily mean the package will become law. It would have to be approved by the House of Representatives, and Mr. Weicker has vowed to veto it, should it reach his desk. Overriding his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers, which would mean 24 votes in the Senate. 
 If the bill does surmount those obstacles, residents would see the 8 percent sales tax -- already the highest statewide rate in the nation -- expanded to include a vast array of transactions, ranging from dry cleaning to taxi rides. Many residents would also pay higher taxes on income from interest and dividends, and the state would also impose for the first time a 5 percent tax on home and commercial mortgages above $150,000.
 
'The Votes Don't Exist'
 Mr. Weicker's plan would have lowered most of those taxes, especially the sales tax and the corporate tax, with the difference made up by a 6 percent flat tax on income over $25,000 for a family or $12,500 for an individual.
Even some of the sponsors of the substitute package said they were not entirely happy with it.
Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr., a Democrat from New Britain and the co-chairman of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee, admitted that he would prefer to vote for an income tax. He said he had decided to work for the substitute package because "the political reality is that the votes don't exist to pass an income tax in this chamber or in the House," and the best had to be made of what could pass.
One opponent, Senator Charles H. Allen 3d, a Democrat from New Haven, said he believed the approved plan would punish the poor with the sales-tax expansion and the sharp increase in tobacco and alcohol taxes and would close businesses in towns on borders with neighboring states, all of which have lower sales taxes.
 
'Dislike for the Governor'
 Mr. Allen also charged that the coalition's real driving force was not so much to avoid an income tax but rather just a simple "dislike for the governor," an accusation that the sponsors took pains to deny.
But the vote will nonetheless stand, regardless of where the debate goes from here, as an important milestone. First, it was written by a coalition of Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly, but have been deeply split on the income-tax question.
The vote also represented the first time that lawmakers actually recorded their votes on how to resolve's Connecticut's huge shortfall in revenue, caused mainly by the recession.
The plan would also begin a major consolidation of state agencies and require the legislature in future years to pass a rolling two-year budget to help control costs.

HEADLINE: Gay Bias Moves Off The Sidelines

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
THE locker room has closets of its own, deep and dark and crowded.
"We've been inundated with the names of famous athletes people want us to 'out,' " says Gabriel Rotello, editor in chief of Outweek, a gay and lesbian news weekly. "I think the proportion of gay men and lesbians who are pro athletes is higher than their proportion in the mainstream population. Overcompensating, I guess. In golf and tennis, maybe 50 percent." 
 "More like 90 percent when I was still playing," laughs Lynn Greer of Columbus, Ohio, a lesbian who was on the pro golf tour from 1978 to 1982. "The tour was a subculture of gay culture. Every dyke with two nickels to rub together got to Palm Springs for the Dinah Shore. It was the event." While 90 seems a high percentage, there was no question that the men who wanted to make money from the women's tour were concerned about its lesbian image, a concern that's now pervasive throughout women's sports.
"The real panic is in women's intercollegiate sports," says Arlene Gorton, an associate athletic director at Brown University in Providence, R.I. "Athletic departments don't even like to run workshops on sexual and gender issues, they think it will be used against them in recruiting. There's homophobia, of course, but I think it's basically a power issue, another way of controlling women. Especially now that there is money in women's sports."
Homosexuality and bisexuality in American sports has usually been treated topically, as rare outbreaks, despite a continuing roster that includes Babe Didrikson, the founder of the women's golf tour; the tennis champion Bill Tilden, pro running back Dave Kopay, major league umpire Dave Pallone, past tennis champions Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova and the Olympic gold medal swimmer Bruce Hayes.
Pat Griffin, a lesbian who has coached in high school and college and now teaches physical education at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, believes that gay male athletes are not as challenging to mainstream gender roles as are lesbians. "It goes to the heart of the struggle against sexism," says Griffin. "Sports is the last place men can hang on. By whipping out the lesbian label, they can intimidate women and keep control of sports. That's how Rene Portland gets away with it."
Rene Portland, the Penn State women's basketball coach, turned the spotlight back on two months ago, when, without allowing herself to be quoted directly, she let it be known that no lesbian could play for her. Rights groups were outraged, while some coaches grudgingly gave her credit for a cynical recruiting tool in a time of backlash. Professor Gorton found it "disgraceful" that Penn State did not disavow Portland's policy. She saw it as part of a pattern.
"It pushes more women into the closet, it pushes more issues under the rug," says Gorton. "I've seen young lesbian women get married just to get a coaching job. And I've heard athletic directors say, 'If we have lesbians coaching here, I don't want to hear about it.' "
"When I got to college in 1974," says golfer Greer, "the other golfers told me to stay away from the coach, she was one of 'them.' I thought, who do they think I am? Silence was the safe way to operate in those days."
Once known with either pride or disdain as the Lesbian Professional Golf Association, the ladies' tour has become very much more heterosexual in the past few years, Greer said. She credits Title IX with making sports more socially acceptable for straight young women, and more of a lucrative career opportunity. Others believe that as female athletes became a sales force for cigarettes, whiskey and cars, they needed to be perceived as hetero-sexy for the predominantly male sponsors. Only a superstar who is economically important to the sport, like Martina, could come out without terminal damage to her career.
But even Martina is not immune to what The Advocate, a biweekly gay and lesbian magazine, calls "dyke bashing" in its current cover story. Last summer, former champion Margaret Court accused Martina and other lesbian and bisexual players of ruining the sport and setting a bad example for younger players.
"What we're seeing is a re-creation of the discrimination against blacks," Professor Gorton says. "They will spoil the neighborhood, ruin the game, hurt recruiting. Substitute the word 'black' every time you hear 'lesbian', and wonder if Rene Portland could get away saying the same thing."
I called Penn State Wednesday and left questions for the athletic director and the sports information director: Is Coach Portland's policy acceptable, and is it policy throughout the department? I left a question for the football coach, Joe Paterno: Would he keep a gay player off his team?
As of this writing, none have responded. They were correct if they assumed that at deadline time I would go away. For now. They were wrong if they assumed the issue would leave with me.

Homeboys Hangin' Downtown

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
New York City after dark has rarely looked as enticingly cheesy as it does in Joseph B. Vasquez's "Hangin' With the Homeboys," which follows the comic misadventures of four buddies from the South Bronx over a long, hot summer night. As they prowl the streets of their neighborhood in search of excitement, and then descend on Manhattan, everything from the girls they ogle, to the discos, pool halls, peep shows and subway stations they visit, shimmers with a dangerous, alluring mystery.
This sense of the city as, in the words of Lorenz Hart, "a wondrous toy," is one of the many charms of a movie that belongs to the "cruisin' " genre of "Diner" and "American Graffiti." Willie (Doug E. Doug), Tom (Mario Joyner), Johnny (John Leguizamo), and Vinny (Nestor Serrano), represent a richly varied quartet, all at crossroads, whose Friday night on the town turns into a series of small comic disasters. 
 The gist of the movie is its incisive character sketches of the four, each of whom is so different from the others that the very fact of their friendship at times strains credibility.
Willie and Tom, who are both black, are complete personality opposites. Willie, who is perpetually broke and sponges off the others, blames even the tiniest daily setbacks on racism. "You're doing this because I'm black!" he splutters over and over, so that by the end of the film, the accusation has become a caustically humorous refrain. Tom, an unemployed actor with a job in telemarketing, exudes an indefatigable self-confidence that survives even after he smashes up his car, loses his girlfriend and is caught by the police with his friends jumping a subway turnstile.
Johnny and Vinny, who are both Puerto Rican, are just as dissimilar. Johnny, who works as a grocery clerk, can't make up his mind whether to apply for a college scholarship. A nerdy, depressive type, he combats his own self-pity by reminding himself of all the starving people in China. Vinny, the most extroverted of the four, is a shameless Lothario who lives off women while passing himself off as Italian.
Like "American Graffiti," "Hangin' With the Homeboys" is a sort of urban contemporary "Midsummer Night's Dream," in which everything has a slightly surreal aura to it. Johnny, the movie's most detailed and compelling character, has a secret crush on a sultry young woman from the neighborhood whom he is devastated to see in a pornographic loop only hours later in a peep show. The same woman later turns up at a disco into which the four are sneaked in by a friendly Rastafarian after having been contemptuously turned away at the door.
Midway in the evening, Johnny meets another woman who becomes a symbolic savior. A mysterious, sexy pool shark named Luna (Mary B. Ward), she is a cool cosmopolite who miraculously intuits his purity of soul and gives him her telephone number. The nervous, dewy-eyed Johnny resembles none of the characters that Mr. Leguizamo portrays in his one-man Off Broadway show, "Mambo Mouth." His memorable portrayal is further evidence of the actor's virtuosic range.
Mr. Vasquez's taut, funny screenplay blends a finely tuned ear for street argot with a shrewd sense of comic timing. The setups and punch lines occur so naturally that one rarely senses the workings of the script's well-coordinated machinery. The ensemble acting is at once disciplined and exuberant.
Along with Mr. Leguizamo, Mr. Serrano makes the strongest impression as a man whose hostility toward women can be measured by his obsession with quick, degrading seductions. Vinny, whose real name is Fernando, stakes so much of his identity on a phony Italianate image that when it is challenged by an Italian-American policeman, he is left shaky and humiliated. While Mr. Serrano's performance imbues the character with a full measure of sleaze, he also invests him with a certain lowdown charm.
Like many movies in the "cruisin' " genre, "Hangin' With the Homeboys" is also an allegory about growing up and making choices. Even if the odds against you seem insurmountable, the film says, survival depends on your taking charge, having faith and going up against them. By the end of the film, it is perfectly clear which of the four will go on to make something of their lives and which will be left behind.
"Hangin' With the Homeboys" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes a lot of strong language.

Le Regence
 The winds of recession seem not to have passed the doorman at the sumptuous Hotel Plaza Athenee on East 64th Street in Manhattan, the American cousin of the stately hotel on Paris's Right Bank. Every evening a conservatively dressed, polyglot group of international business types congregates for cocktails in the leathery piano bar. Many then troop into the regal dining room, Le Regence, which is more French than the miniature Deux Chevaux automobile, and decidedly more comfortable. 
 Since 1987, Le Regence has been under the jet-setting tutelage of the Rostang family from France: father Jo and son Philippe, who own La Bonne Auberge in Antibes, a Michelin two-star establishment; and another son, Michel, whose namesake restaurant in Paris has the same rating. One or more of the Rostangs are said to visit Le Regence monthly. The full-time chef is Jean Robert de Cavel.
 The dining room is a dreamy den of turquoise and ornate white trim, with soft leather armchairs, elegant mirrors, velvet banquettes and benevolent lighting. It's the kind of place where a young man would choose to propose -- that is, if his credit limit was sufficient.
 While dinner can add up, lunch at $25.50 prix fixe is a bargain. One day I started, albeit skeptically, with a special described as lobster bisque with peppermint. As odd as the combination sounds, the peppermint jump-starts the lobster broth, giving it extra spunk. Grapes and a port-and-balsamic-vinegar sauce boost tasty ravioli stuffed with minced veal.
 One of the most interesting starters is a little hockey puck of mild goat cheese encased in thinly sliced smoked salmon and nickel-size fried potatoes. A red pepper sauce adds a nice sweet contrast to this felicitous combination. Another good salmon appetizer is the delicate house-smoked salmon paired with a vibrant green lentil salad.
 The mostly French waiters and captains are well schooled in their jobs, yet for some reason on all three of my visits there was a terrible communication problem between them and the kitchen. You know service is slow when table conversation comes to a halt and diners start looking around the room wistfully. At Le Regence, I was tempted to remove my jacket and help out in the kitchen.
 When they finally arrived, many of the entrees were enticing. Grilled red snapper was enriched by a light soybean-butter sauce and scallions, while sauteed sea bass was pleasingly complex over a puree of anchovies with candied fennel and Mediterranean black olives. Sauteed lobster with a nicely balanced cabernet-sauvignon-and-port sauce was so tough it must have been frightened to death before cooking. It came with wild mushrooms and wiry fried angel-hair pasta. Roasted monkfish was well turned out, dusted with piquant paprika, garnished with mixed herbs and accompanied by red potatoes.
 A dish that sounds aberrant but actually works well is sauteed breast of duck with a sliced pear, creamy turnip puree and a lemon-brightened duck-stock sauce. Aggressively peppered squares of veal are delicious over caramelized apples and a thick pancake of ratatouille. Excellent rack of lamb was flanked by sweet roasted shallots and three flans of varying quality: ratatouille, Mediterranean olive and garlic. And roasted guinea hen in beer and fresh ginger would have been terrific had it not been for slight overcooking.
 Le Regence has an impressive French and American wine list with prices that are neither out of line nor bargains.
 Desserts are stunning, especially the trio of chocolate mousses in a cylinder of bittersweet chocolate with pistachio sauce. Coffee fans will delight in the creamy coffee mousse in phyllo dough with strawberry sauce, a special. Mandarin mousse sandwiched between sheets of chocolate is unpleasantly acidic; better is the baked black currant meringue with caramelized pears and Sauternes sauce.
 Le Regence can still be recommended for its luxurious ambiance and refined fare. But the kitchen's inconsistency combined with exasperating service problems make two stars more appropriate than the three it received in 1988.
 
Da Silvano
 This inviting Tuscan restaurant with an attractive street-front cafe has been a downtown fixture for 16 years. In the time I have been acquainted with it, food quality has been as erratic as a New York City taxi ride: sometimes efficient and smooth, other times exasperating and bumpy. Recent visits have found the odds to be slightly in the diner's favor, but only if you know your way around the menu.
 Da Silvano has a simple, tasteful decor with a semi-exposed kitchen, brick walls, an antique wine cupboard, colorful ceramics and a copious antipasto display. At lunch recently, the antipasto assortment carried a mixed bag: watery, bland mozzarella; lentils in a vibrant vinaigrette, and tasty grilled green peppers and zucchini. One of the best starters was bread salad, a blend of cubed bread, red onions, tomatoes, basil and sweet peppers moistened with vinaigrette.
 At this time of year, it is voguish to serve deep-fried zucchini flowers, sometimes stuffed with mushrooms or other vegetables. The kitchen here serves them plain but bland from lack of seasoning. Much preferred is a terrific combination of fennel sausage and wonderfully tart sauteed broccoli rape. A salad of artichoke leaves with squiggles of Parmesan looked pretty on the plate but was sorely in need of dressing. And the seafood salad was nothing but a watery bowl of mussels and calamari.
 The scenario brightened somewhat with pastas. As rich as it was, the taglierini tossed with hot and sweet sausages, cream, peas, tomato and Parmesan was impossible to resist. Spaghettini puttanesca -- tomatoes, garlic, black olives, capers and anchovies -- was pleasing too. Seafood linguine was a qualified success, suffering only from dry shrimp. And the taglierini with pesto had a flat, almost musty taste.
 The maladroit waiters here can make for a frazzling experience. Few know how dishes are prepared, and they can offer no advice about wine. Moreover, they routinely serve dishes to the wrong people. In addition, I had to call them twice to take our order, twice for wine, twice for coffee, twice for the check. I began to think it was some kind of practical joke. Fortunately, the wine list is straightforward and fairly priced, so you can probably pick something yourself.
 Among main courses, some of the typical Tuscan dishes are rewarding, like breaded boneless loin of pork sauteed Milanese style, along with roasted potatoes and mixed greens. Baby chicken grilled with lots of fresh rosemary and garlic suffered from slight overcooking, while Cornish hen, split and marinated in olive oil and cayenne, came out moist but devoid of flavor. Osso buco was meaty and succulent with its saffron-tinted rice and Swiss chard. Among seafood options, grilled langoustines, a special, were deliciously smoky and sweet, and sauteed whole turbot with a white wine sauce was subtle and pleasing, although our waiter did an inept job of deboning it.
 Few desserts are worth the calories. Semifreddi were strangely pale, and something called bongo bongo, sort of an Italian version of profiteroles, featured dried-out pastry balls filled with vanilla ice cream. The only thumbs up went to panna cotta, a rich Italian baked cream that is chilled and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce.
 It is no small accomplishment for Da Silvano to have survived 16 years in Greenwich Village. It's a wobbly vehicle at times, yet so far, its substantial charms have kept it on the road.

HEADLINE: Flawed Plan to Merge New York Ports Agency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"More City Business, for Less Money" (editorial, May 1) praises Mayor Dinkins's proposal to consolidate the city's economic development agencies. Clearly, any plan that eliminates duplicate bureaucracies and offers the same services at a cheaper price deserves support.
Unfortunately, the proposal places the functions of the Department of Ports and Trade in the City Development Corporation, a real estate development oriented agency. Placing port development functions within a real estate oriented agency is another sign of the continuing myopia that has led the last several city administrations to preside over the increasing demise of the Port of New York as a shipping and transportation hub. 
 Promoting development of the city's port and shipping facilities is sufficiently important, and sufficiently different from the economic development functions, to deserve a separate city department. If, however, New York can no longer afford an independent Ports Department, the proper place for these functions is in the Transportation Department, where they can be coordinated with other transportation-related functions. With these functions in the Department of Transportation, we can have some hope that the economic development potential of reviving a port and shipping industry in New York may yet receive a fair hearing in city government. With port development functions placed in a real estate oriented industry, it is much more likely that the waterfront will be viewed only as a "neglected" resource available for exploitation by condominium or co-op developers. Such an outcome would be disastrous for the economic future of New York.

HEADLINE: Democrats Offer 'Action Plan' for Recession

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders today proclaimed an "action plan" for dealing with both the 11-month-old recession and long-term economic growth but conceded that they had no timetable and few specifics to support the effort.
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, complained that "we're in a recession that the President has ignored." He said the Democrats would push ahead on expanding unemployment compensation, passing a highway bill and enacting a "real tax cut for the working men and women of this nation." 
Asked whether these moves, or elements of the plan that spoke of health care, education, help for the poor and an energy policy, could be passed quickly enough to ease the recession, he replied: "Some of them are over the long term. This is not purely an anti-recession package."
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said Democrats were prepared to work with President Bush "if he wants to work with us, but the Democratic Party is determined to go forward."
Mr. Foley said the Congressional committees would proceed with these issues in the normal way. But Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois offered little hint of quick action from his committee, Ways and Means, which acts first in Congress on taxes and issues like unemployment compensation. Looking distinctly uncomforfortable, he defined the "action plan" as both a "reaffirmation of Democratic principles" and "what issues may be on our agenda in the months and years ahead."
 
Move to Ease the Recession
 Asked when his committee would deal with the issues of broadening and extending unemployment benefits, he said, "Should unemployment figures go up, I'm sure you're going to see a much accelerated pace." The next set of figures will be released on June 7.
Increased unemployment compensation is one of the few items on the Democrats' agenda that might ease the impact of the recession, and House Democrats had been prepared to start moving legislation on it earlier this month. But when the national unemployment numbers fell from 6.8 percent to 6.5 percent on May 3, perhaps because of a statistical quirk, they dropped the idea.
While the Democrats were busy today deploring the state of the economy, Mr. Bush was upbeat in remarks to the National Retail Federation. "Incidentally, on the recession," he said, "I am feeling more confident about the fact that we're, if not have bottomed out, are bottoming out. And I think there's an awful lot of economic forecasters that would agree with what I've just said."
But Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, told the news conference called by the Democratic leaders: "This recession is serious. It's longer and deeper than the Administration predicted. For millions of Americans, things are not getting better." He said he would soon hold hearings on unemployment insurance, health insurance and tax relief for middle-income Americans.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a Democratic economic proposal misstated the unemployment rate for April and its change from the previous month. The civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.6 percent in April, from 6.8 percent in March.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Economist at Columbia Gets High GATT Post

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Few economists anywhere in the world are more outspoken in their advocacy of free trade than Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati, or more prolific in writing about its merits. And seldom since World War II have there been greater difficulties in negotiating another round of reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers.
So it is perhaps only natural that the organization charged with conducting the negotiations -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT -- should turn to Professor Bhagwati for help, offering him the newly created post of economic policy adviser. He will report directly to Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the Geneva-based organization. 
The appointment comes in the final months of the Uruguay Round, one of GATT's periodic efforts to lower not only tariffs, but other barriers that prevent products and services from moving easily among GATT's 96-member nations.
"These negotiations tend to become very political," the 56-year-old Columbia University economics professor said. "But there is a parallel economic analysis for all the issues, and I intend to insert these scientific arguments for free trade."
He will do this, he said, by literally sitting at delegates' elbows as the talks come to a conclusion in late summer, mostly at GATT headquarters in Geneva. Although Professor Bhagwati is not giving up his post at Columbia, he will spend a week or more a month in Geneva, under a contract that takes him on as a policy adviser at the top of GATT's hierarchy.
Various obstacles are making an agreement difficult to reach in the Uruguay Round. A big one is the tendency of the Western European countries, on one hand, and the United States, Mexico and Canada, on the other, to create regional trading blocs that give preferential treatment to products produced and sold within each region.
The Bhagwati view of such trends, briefly stated, is that free trade will produce the greatest wealth over the long run; barriers only divert the flow of goods and services, rather than making them multiply. That is the view set forth in Professor Bhagwati's book "The World Trading System at Risk," just published by the Princeton University Press, which helped get him the GATT job.
Professor Bhagwati was born and raised in Bombay, India, and educated at Cambridge University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his doctorate. He taught economics in New Delhi and then back at M.I.T. before switching to Columbia in 1980 -- making the transfer to be with his wife, Padma Desai, a specialist in Soviet economics at Columbia.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
No Vacation? A False Economy

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With companies laying people off, freezing salaries and taking other cost-cutting measures, many Americans are running scared and concluding that they had better save more in case the worst happens. Many are deciding to forgo a summer vacation.
Here's a word of advice from Diane V. Schaak, president of the Denver-based Institute of Certified Financial Planners: Don't. 
 "We all need a breather," said Ms. Schaak, whose clientele in Bellevue, Wash., includes many executives from Boeing and Microsoft. "I insist on two weeks -- the first to unwind and get business out of the system and the second to relax."
People in stressful jobs, in particular, need a refreshing stay away from home, she said, and in the long run it does more harm than good to skip it.
"It doesn't have to be a trip to Paris on the Concorde and a four-star hotel," she added. Many people enjoy inexpensive camping trips or holidays on rented sailboats. One of Ms. Schaak's executive clients finds an exhilarating but inexpensive break from the button-down life by taking long motorcycle trips every year.
Several other clients are airline pilots who do not want to spend their holidays on airplanes and in hotel rooms. They prefer to buy a home in the country and enjoy making do-it-yourself improvements during vacation.
But it is important that the vacation fit the person, she said. If a couple are really looking forward to foreign travel, then backpacking in a nearby state park will not do the trick. They might take a moderately priced foreign trip one year and drive somewhere in North America the next, she suggested. They can look for other places to save in their budget, like restaurant meals or taxis.
Linda Barbanel, a New York psychologist who has made a specialty of financial matters, agreed. "You do need a vacation," she said. "It doesn't have to be Europe. You can find a little nurturing in whatever corner you choose."
She advises people "to get a little respite from work, some psychological strength," by taking day trips, walks in the park and long weekends, as well as the once-a-year vacation. "Be nice to yourself, but don't overdo it," she said.
"My husband and I are trying once a month to take day trips out of New York City," she said, and they need not be expensive -- a visit to a friend in Hartford, a drive to the Delaware Water Gap, a ride on the Staten Island ferry. "Water is restorative," she commented.
"Some people want to continue the workaholic life style on vacation," she said. "They are the pathfinders, the adventurers. The more insecure prefer package tours. Some people are self-deniers in general. They think there's some kind of medal for doing without, but denying yourself will make you resentful in the long run. They ought to get themselves on a tour, buy a sun hat and watch the waves roll in."
Ms. Schaak encourages her clients to designate savings for both long-term goals like retirement and short-term goals like an annual vacation.
In budgeting for the vacation, she reminds people that costs go beyond just the air fare, hotel room and other expenses charged to a credit card. There are also traveler's checks, souvenirs, cash spent for meals or drinks and related expenses like house-sitting and kennels. Of course, a nice woolen suit or sweater bought during a visit to Scotland can be paid for from the clothing budget, but a grass skirt from Tahiti is a vacation cost.
The important thing about a vacation is "a different atmosphere," she said, that provides a chance to be refreshed and return to work relaxed.
 
Corporate Cost-Cutting
 The nation's largest employers are trimming staff, limiting compensation increases and focusing on managing health-care expenses in response to the recession, William M. Mercer Inc., an actuarial, employee-benefits and management-consulting firm, reported this week, based on a survey of 2,000 companies.
The majority, 63 percent, predicted the recession would be mild; 59 percent are cutting jobs and 13 percent are considering doing so; 60 percent are holding wage and salary increases to 4 percent or less and 7 percent of those surveyed are considering doing so; 6 percent are freezing wages and salaries and 4 percent are considering it. On health care, 71 percent are stepping up efforts to cut costs, and 62 percent are increasing the proportion borne by the employees.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Steady in Short, Brisk Day

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices were basically unchanged yesterday in a shortened pre-holiday trading session. The cash market in Treasury debt issues normally has no fixed trading hours, but dealers decided to close at 2 P.M.
Earlier in the day dealers described trading as quite brisk, as was reflected in the price range of the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, which serves as a barometer of long-term interest rates. 
 The price of the long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing May 2021, moved between 97 22/32 and 98 7/32, and the issue was being offered at 98 5/32, unchanged on the day, as was its yield at 8.29 percent. A week ago, the long bond's yield was 8.27 percent. The long notes, the 8's of May 2001, rose by 1/32, to 99 16/32, while the yield was unchanged at 8.07 percent.
 
 'Unusually Active' Trading

"Trading was unusually active for a short pre-holiday session, given the absence of any significant economic news," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "But we saw good two-way trading in the longer maturities all morning, which means that sellers found ready buyers and vice versa."
If there was any surprise, it was that the Federal Reserve did not intervene in the credit market. Some market analysts had expected the Fed to drain reserves from the banking system to push the sagging funds rate up to its target of 5.75 percent. Others thought the Fed would add reserves to cover credit needs over the holiday weekend.
In any case, the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans and from which most other interest rates are scaled upward, closed at 5.5 percent. The funds rate is also the finance charge that dealers pay lenders to carry the inventory of Treasury securities.
"Whatever the reason for the soft funds rate, it helps dealers carry more inventory," Mr. Sullivan continued. "One reason why some people may have been surprised at the soft funds rate was that today was settlement day for the $16 billion of the cash management bills that the Treasury auctioned last week. The dealers and other buyers apparently had no problem paying up."
Meanwhile, the demand for short Treasury notes continued. The 6.75 percent notes of 1993 that were auctioned this last Wednesday rose a further 4/32, to 100 5/32, in trading on a when-issued basis. This cut the yield to 6.66 percent from the average of 6.81 percent.
Also in when-issued trading, the 7 5/8 percent five-year notes sold Thursday gained 3/32, to 99 26/32, to yield 7.67 percent, compared with the average of 7.69 percent realized at the sale. Settlement day for both note issues is next Friday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in a Quiet Day; Gold Prices Climb Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Strong demand for the German mark spurred by a cut in interest rates in Britain left the dollar mixed against foreign currencies yesterday.
Gold prices were higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold was quoted at $356.50 an ounce, up $1.30. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $356.25, up $1.55. 
 Over all, currency market activity was light and trading was narrow because of the approach of the holiday weekend, traders said.
The most significant economic news came when Britain cut its base lending rate by half a percentage point, to 11.5 percent -- the fifth cut since mid-February. It brought the rate to its lowest level since August 1988.
The rate cut spurred demand for the mark, which rose against all major currencies and generally depressed demand for the dollar, said Ronald Holzer, vice president and chief currency dealer for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. Currencies are generally supported by higher interest rates.
The mark's rise was significant enough for traders to predict that capital would move back into Germany, which staunchly guards its interest rates to keep the mark strong.
Late rates in New York showed the dollar fell against the mark, closing at 1.70375 marks, down from 1.71265 on Thursday; in London, the dollar closed at 1.7085 marks, down from 1.7135d.
Kevin Logan, economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation, said many dealers made technical trades before the holiday weekend to limit their investment risk. He said overall volume and volatility in the market were very light.
In London, the pound fell to $1.7305, from $1.7345 late Thursday. At the closing in New York, the pound dropped to $1.7345, from $1.7350 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Friday Without Pay Provokes a Protest in Suffolk

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., May 24

 BODY:
Suffolk County shut down much of its government today, forcing thousands of employees to take the day off to help ease its budget crisis.
More than 1,000 people showed up for work anyway, massing outside locked buildings to protest the unwanted holiday, the first of 10 Fridays that 4,000 workers have been ordered to take without pay. 
 The furlough day, the Friday before a long weekend, proved relatively uneventful, with none of the angry confrontations that officials had feared.
Services deemed essential, like the police, were maintained. But all manner of other things were canceled as Suffolk carried out the first furloughs ordered by any of the many hard-pressed governments in the metropolitan area.
There was no Planning Department, so there was no one to do environmental studies or zoning work. There was no Department for the Aging, so no one was overseeing the county's nutrition programs for the elderly. At the Office of Handicapped Services, callers heard only ringing: the department could not afford an answering machine to notify people that it was closed.
At the Department of Health Services, where more than 100 people stood in tense clusters in the parking lot instead of spending the day dispensing measles vaccines, preparing payrolls and counseling pregnant women, there was bitter talk of reduced paychecks and services left unprovided.
Anna Sauber, a senior clerk-typist who is paid $22,000 a year and stands to lose $100 each day she cannot work, said she needed today to prepare contracts for doctors in county clinics.
"I have a dentist sitting on my desk now waiting to be sent out," she said, referring to his contract. "I should get this contract out today, but it will be delayed and he won't be able to start work on time."
Suffolk County is the first government in the region to close down as a money-saving device, but all are feeling financial pressures as the recession cuts into tax revenue. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have all laid off workers, as have cities from New York to Stamford, Bridgeport and New Haven. Beyond the region, Maine and Rhode Island have shut down their governments, although for fewer days than Suffolk has ordered.
The government did not come to an absolute standstill. The Police Department was still operating. The District Attorney and the County Comptroller, both Republicans, refused to participate in the plan, and the County Executive, Patrick G. Halpin, a Democrat, said that because they were independently elected, there was nothing he could do about it. Mr. Halpin signed the furlough order on Monday.
Departments that work on the weekends were left open, as were some sections of the Department of Social Services and the county's health clinics, which will close on a rotating schedule. The Parks Department, which depends on summer revenue, was ordered to take the 10 days off in the fall, beginning Oct. 21. And some departments were allowed to delay the start of the plan until next Friday.
But the drastic measure here, and the angry response of workers, signal worsening problems in a county stymied in its fight to close a budget shortfall. The shortfall is expected to reach $100 million over two years and threatens to leave the county unable to meet its payroll at the end of the month.
 
'This Is More Humane'
 Sitting wearily and without pay in his quiet office this morning, Mr. Halpin said that he regretted having to order the days off, but that the county's uncertain budget situation had left him with no choice. He complained that negotiations with the County Legislature over how to reduce the deficit were going nowhere and that the state's own budget crisis, in which aid is being delayed or cut out entirely, had left Suffolk in turmoil.
The move is expected to save the county more than $4 million.
"I regret that we have to go to a four-day workweek and reduce certain county services," said Mr. Halpin, as several aides fielded calls from citizens demanding to know why they were working and whether they were being paid (they weren't). "But I'm not going to hike property taxes to pay for the deficit, and this is more humane than laying people off."
Mr. Halpin, who is seeking re-election in November, is negotiating with both the county unions, from whom he is seeking concessions, and the Legislature, from whom he is seeking a deficit-reduction package he can live with. Members of the Legislature are also feuding among themselves over how to cut costs.
Relations between the County Executive and the top legislative official, Presiding Officer Donald Blydenburgh, a Republican, are so shaky that Mr. Blydenburgh, asked to comment on the furloughs, today called Mr. Halpin a "sick puppy" who "doesn't want to make the tough decision" to agree to a sales-tax increase, which Mr. Blydenburgh supports.
The unions are just as unhappy and are going to court in an effort to reinstate the workers' pay. When Mr. Halpin issued his order forbidding people to work, the Association of Municipal Employees directed them to report anyway. That prompted Mr. Halpin to warn employees that they could be charged with insubordination if they tried to force their way onto their jobs.
No one did, although about 25 people who were actually supposed to work in the Department of Public Works held a "sick out," arriving and then claiming they were ill. They were ordered back by the unions and will probably lose pay for the time they missed.
Among the 9,000 workers, who have already survived rounds of layoffs and who in some cases have taken voluntary unpaid furloughs, the governmental fighting is a harbinger of more uncertainty. For now, they seem to be directing their resentment at Mr. Halpin.
"They are making you suffer first, and then they are going to lay you off," said Jaymie C. Groth, 36, a divorced mother who is paid $22,000 a year to spray mosquitoes for the Department of Public Works and who wore a "Dump Halpin" T-shirt.
At the Health Services Department, Rose Mary Wiley, 53, was close to tears as she described how she went to night school and slowly worked up to a good job with the county, only to see it eliminated this spring. Although she does exactly what she did before -- preparing the department's annual report to the state on the costs of running its eight health centers -- her new job is 11 grades lower and pays $800 less a month than her old job.
"I have two grandchildren here and would like to stay," said Mrs. Wiley, who has been supporting herself since her husband walked out on her years ago. "But Suffolk County is an expensive place to live."
Mrs. Wiley says she feels enough pride in her job that she plans to get the report done by the June 30th deadline, even if means weekend work with no pay. If she misses the deadline, the county faces a 5 percent penalty. "The penalty would probably amount to my yearly salary," she said.
The employees at the Health Services Department began to drift away at about 10 A.M. But as one group lingered, the Commissioner of Health, Dr. David Harris, who is also subject to the no-work order, got out of his car and scurried toward the building.
Looking sheepish and embarrassed, he apologized for coming to work. "I'm just picking up some materials for an important speech I have to give," he insisted. "I'm not working. I'm not getting paid."

HEADLINE: Conference on Black Males Finds Many Problems but No Consensus

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
In a recognition that the problems of black males need urgent attention, politicians, civil rights leaders and corporations held a three-day conference here this week that was long on laments but fell short of any consensus on what to do about those problems.
"Admittedly, a three-day conference alone will not solve the vast array of problems confronting the black male today," Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia said Wednesday at the opening of the conference. "But we can use this opportunity to begin building a sound foundation, one upon which a massive, society-wide undertaking can arise." 
 The conference was sponsored by the 21st Century Commission on African American Males, which was begun by Governor Wilder and Senator Terry Sanford, Democrat of North Carolina, and was financed by corporate contributions. The meeting was the latest gathering on a subject that is drawing intense interest among politicians, scholars and others concerned about the problems of black males.
Conference participants generally agreed that black males faced major problems. Presently, 13.5 percent of black men of working age are jobless, more than twice the rate of unemployment among white men, the Government says. One in every four black men age 20 through 29 is in prison, on parole or probation, according to a private study published last year.
Government statistics show the homicide rate for black males aged 15 to 24 has increased by 40 percent since 1984 and is now the leading cause of death for this group. Last year, The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that the black young men in Harlem are less likely to reach the age of 40 than young men in Bangladesh.
The conference held discussions on topics including drug and alcohol abuse, alternatives to the criminal justice system and the portrayal of black men in the media. Conference officials said proceeds from a $300-a-plate dinner honoring "outstanding black men" would go into a scholarship fund.
The conference heard the condition of black males described in blunt language. Mayor John Daniels of New Haven told a panel that his city was the seventh-poorest per capita in the nation, had the fifth-highest violent crime rate, was first in infant mortality and had the highest rate of AIDS infection in Connecticut.
"And in each of these instances, in each case of these depressing statistics, it is the black community that is most suffering," said Mr. Daniels, who is black. "Not only that, it is black males who are primarily responsible for that suffering."
 
'Massive Marshall-Type Plan'
 As daunting as the problems of black males seem to be, there was little consensus on what should be done. Some participants, like the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, urged a "massive Marshall-type plan" by the Federal Government to provide jobs, a national health-care system and improved education for inner-city black youths.
On the other hand, Rev. George Clements, a black priest from Chicago, urged conference participants to "break the stranglehold" that the Federal Government has over blacks. Father Clements, who gained recognition several years ago when he defied his superiors in the Chicago Archdiocese and adopted a young black boy, said black churches had to take a more active role.
He suggested that black churches run drug-treatment centers or sex education clinics on their premises. He also urged black churches to begin their own sectarian schools that would teach values of responsibility and chastity.
"The churches must open our own schools to provide an alternative education to a white school system that couldn't care less about black children," he said.

HEADLINE: Water and Growth: Some Californians Want Less

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif., May 22

 BODY:
In 1979, the voters of Santa Barbara, hoping to limit growth and keep their idyllic coastal city from becoming another Los Angeles, voted overwhelmingly not to connect to the State Water Project, the vital lifeblood of so many arid California cities.
They succeeded -- all too well -- in the view of many Santa Barbarans who now regret their vote. The lack of state water, combined with a searing drought that has entered its fifth year, have left the city and its environs short of water. 
 More than 200,000 trees have died, hundreds of homeowners have given up on their lawns and water prices have about quadrupled, siphoning about $40 million a year from the local economy. Housing prices have risen so high that many younger Santa Barbarans must move elsewhere.
 
A Glimpse of the Future
 Santa Barbara, 85 miles up the coast from the urban cacophony that is Los Angeles, offers a glimpse into a less expansive future in the arid American West. The decision Santa Barbara made a dozen years ago is increasingly being forced on countless other cities in the West as rapid growth begins to bump against limited water supplies.
On June 4, voters in Santa Barbara and the adjoining suburbs of Montecito and Goleta will have one last chance to obtain state water -- and even that source is not the endless fount it once seemed to be. Residents will be asked to approve bonds to build an aqueduct that would pump water over the mountains from California's Central Valley. They will also vote on whether to build a permanent desalting plant as insurance against continued drought in a region where, even in a normal year, it rains only 17 inches.
Almost everyone favors desalting, which can be locally controlled, but the prospect of state water has touched off a bitter debate that has as much to do with control of political power in this beautiful city as with water and growth.
A clamor for more water has arisen from those who say Santa Barbara has consigned itself to perpetual obscurity: a nice place with a magnificent climate, beautiful flora and graceful red-tiled buildings in the Spanish style, where retirees who bring their money from someplace else can live in quiet comfort but where young people and growing businesses are forced to move away.
Defenders say that if water was much more plentiful, developers would turn Santa Barbara into yet another suburb of Los Angeles burdened by traffic and crime. Desalting, alone, they say, can meet the city's most urgent needs.
After the 1979 vote to reject state water, many thought Santa Barbara's population would stabilize. It did not. Its population grew about 15 percent, to 85,571 in 1990 from 74,414 in 1980.
Strikingly, the Hispanic population swelled 69 percent, to 31 percent of the total. But many Hispanic residents are crammed into illegally converted garages or are doubled up.
 
Water Use Grew in 80's
 Water use in Santa Barbara continued to grow, from 12,745 acre-feet in 1978-79 to 16,092 acre-feet in 1988-89. Then it plummeted after the drought left the city's two reservoirs nearly dry. (An acre-foot is 325,851 gallons, or about enough to supply two typical households for one year.)
Santa Barbarans get about 10 percent of their supplies from wells, which have become increasingly salty and less reliable.
Advocates of obtaining state water say that if the 1979 hookup had been approved, it would have meant an average of 20,000 more acre-feet a year for the city.
The hardships inflicted by the drought have changed many minds about state water. "I no longer feel that you have to rely on shortage of water to limit growth," said David M. Yager, a lawyer and former county supervisor who was born here 60 years ago. "For an economy that is based on tourism and agriculture, you cannot have brown lawns, brown fields and empty fountains if you want to survive economically."
Much of the decorative vegetation at his former home in Montecito, now occupied by his former wife, has died. By one estimate, $30 million of tourist business was lost last year because of publicity about the drought and fires.
"Look at the economic damage that's been done, and at what environmental cost," said Pier A. Gherini Jr., president of the Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce. He said he believed that a ballot measure passed two years ago to limit commercial development would be a much better tool to control growth than contrived water shortages.
 
'Another Suburb'
 None of these points have swayed opponents of state water. "We are trying to use anything we can to keep this area from becoming another suburb of Los Angeles," said Gordon J. Fulks, a physicist who works at a research center here.
The most powerful force fighting growth and state water is Bob Klausner, a former New Yorker who made his fortune in the textile industry, became fed up with life in New York and moved here with his wife, Betty, in 1973 after searching the country for his notion of the ideal spot. He bought and remodeled a magnificent Spanish-style house on the ocean in Montecito and became a potent behind-the-scenes political force in Santa Barbara County.
"What brings most people here is the environment, low density, ease of living, beauty," Mr. Klausner said. "Most people come here because they choose to, not because they need to." He complained that traffic had become so heavy that there are often as many as seven cars ahead of him as he tries to turn onto the freeway to go downtown.
"A community should decide on how large it wants to be and stabilize at that level and regenerate," Mr. Klausner said, adding that he thought Santa Barbara should encourage only small businesses that would not stimulate growth. Companies wanting to recruit people to come to work in Santa Barbara, he said, should subsidize employee housing if they really want to bring the workers here. Meanwhile, he said, lower-income people may not be able to come here or may have to leave.
Mr. Klausner favors the desalting plant, which he said would cover existing water needs and could be turned on and off locally as needed in case of continued drought. Adding state water, he said, would provide more water than is needed and "would ultimately open the area to more growth."
To Sheila Lodge, the Mayor since 1981, too much water could be worse than too little water. "Our economy is based on retirement, tourism, high tech," she said. "Our economy depends on a relaxed, uncongested, not big-city feeling. Our lifeblood is not in endless growth."
 
Burden of Exclusivity
 But with exclusivity comes problems. Because new water hookups are almost impossible to obtain, housing prices have risen to the point where the police department has chronic problems recruiting and retaining officers; some commute from as far as Santa Maria, 55 miles north. The University of California campus has trouble attracting faculty and staff. Even doctors are daunted by the prices, according to local hospitals. Families complain that their children are forced to move away to find jobs and housing.
Since 1988, Santa Barbara has required anyone building a house to pay to retrofit plumbing in older buildings in the city -- someone else's house -- to offset the new water use. Under the rule, the builder must save twice the amount of water that is expected to be used in the new house.
Thus, permits for just 28 new single-family houses were issued in Santa Barbara last year, compared to 173 in Santa Maria. In Montecito, water authorities have put in place a limit of 19 new houses a year, and the middle-class suburb of Goleta has had a moratorium on new water hookups since 1973.
Combined with the influx of Hispanic people, all of this suggests to some that Santa Barbara is becoming a city with many poor Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who live in squalor and work as gardeners and servants for the wealthy, while the middle class workers have been forced to commute long distances.
"We have an unbalanced town," said Peter Murphy, a home builder. "We are winding up with a two-class society. If you want to start a business, you know you cannot recruit good people. The only thing that will be left will be the rich and Mexican gardeners. If that is a perfect town, I don't buy it."
Water policy has racist overtones, in the view of two locally prominent Mexican-Americans, Fred Vega, a retired Los Angeles firefighter, and Frank Banales, an insurance salesman. Water shortages, they said, have destroyed the jobs of hundreds of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans working in landscaping, construction, restaurants and hotels. Also, many landlords have closed down laundry rooms, forcing large families to go to coin-operated laundries, where prices have risen sharply.
 
Appealing to Voters
 Voters are being bombarded with confusing and conflicting claims about the costs and virtues of state water and desalting.
State water proponents say this is Santa Barbara's last chance to obtain state water because inland communities like Santa Maria are almost certain to approve it, meaning that the aqueduct will be made large enough to accommodate only their needs and no more. They say, among other things, that desalted water is of uncertain quality and has high energy costs.
Those who oppose obtaining state water say that the Santa Barbara area might be stuck with decades of debt to pay for water it may not need if the rains come again, and that the state water has proved unreliable in drought years anyway. They charge that state water forces are backed by wealthy developers who are poised to open up Santa Barbara to development.
Whatever the case, even lifelong natives like Karen Stevens are finding it tough to remain here. A 29-year-old advertising manager for a developer, she lives in a studio apartment behind her parents' house. "I want my own place and to be on my own," she said.
"There's a saying about Santa Barbara: 'Only the newly wed and nearly dead.' When people get married and start having children, they leave."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies Move to Ease Cold War Limits on Exports

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24

 BODY:
The United States and its allies have decided to ease restrictions substantially on the kinds of high-technology goods, like personal computers, that the West can export to the Soviet Union and other nations considered security risks.
The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom, agreed to cut in half the number of high-technology items that cannot be exported to these countries without special licenses. It is the most sweeping action yet in liberalizing high-technology trade with the Soviet Union, other Communist countries and the members of the recently dissolved Warsaw Pact. 
 The countries involved include Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, three emerging democracies in Eastern Europe that have received strong public support from the 17 members of Cocom. American officials also said Cocom would try to simplify procedures for those three countries and grant exceptions when it was clear that controlled items would have only civilian uses there and would not be diverted to other countries on the list.
In addition to the Soviet Union, the controls also apply to Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, China, Mongolia, North Korea and Vietnam.
Some Cocom members have expressed concern that the restrictions are directed just at the former Soviet bloc and other Communist countries, and not at developing countries, like Iraq, that might pose a military threat. Some Cocom officials say that whether and how to extend the controls to the third world will be a subject of future debates.
 
Many Restrictions Remain
 Under the new rules agreed upon late Thursday in Paris after a year of often tense talks, restrictions will be lifted on the export of almost all personal computers, some semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and most civilian aircraft and civilian aircraft engines.
Controls will remain on items like night-vision systems and supercomputers that are considered essential to maintain the West's superiority in military technology over the Soviet Union. Restrictions also continue on high-performance fiber optics, some computer software systems, thermal-imaging equipment, advanced machine tools, advanced semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and some super-strong carbon fibers and composites.
Allan Wendt, head of the United States delegation to the Cocom talks, said here today that the streamlined list fulfilled the goal of "building higher fences around fewer items."
"The new list will provide stronger controls on truly strategic items while freeing from control those items that are needed to modernize the economies of the proscribed countries that are no longer considered militarily critical," said Mr. Wendt, who is the State Department's senior representative for strategic technology policy.
American computer and telecommunications equipment makers said that while they were generally pleased with the liberalization, they felt the changes did not go far enough in two areas: computers and telecommunications equipment.
"When you view it relative to the political changes in Eastern Europe, we think we had a right to expect more," said Eric L. Hirschhorn, a former Deputy Assistant Commerce Secretary for export control who is now a Washington lawyer representing some American computer makers.
 
Ugly Relic for Soviets
 Soviet officials see the controls as an ugly relic of cold war distrust, while Cocom officials say that despite the collapse of Communism such controls are needed because hard-line anti-Western forces could still seize power in Moscow.
Cocom, which comprises Japan, Australia and all NATO nations except Iceland, decided to reduce the list of restricted items in response to the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and what Mr. Wendt called "the changing strategic situation." Cocom members also moved to streamline the list because many of the items on it, like personal computers, are readily available worldwide, making many of the restrictions unenforcable.
Cocom was established in 1949 to restrict exports of civilian goods with potential military uses to the Soviet Union and other Communist nations.
Last summer, Cocom members proposed a broad liberalization of the restrictions, but the Soviet crackdown in the Baltic republics and the Persian Gulf war caused the United States, Britain and some other nations to take a more cautious approach to easing restrictions. But Germany and several large European telecommunications companies that have a strong foothold in the East argued that the United States, which was weak in those markets, wanted to keep the controls far too restrictive in areas like fiber optics and telephone switching equipment.
 
Critical to National Security
 American officials said the gulf war underlined the importance of having, for example, a superior night-vision system. Mr. Wendt said the new list, which takes effect on Sept. 1, was intended "to maintain the existing significant gaps between Western and Soviet-based military systems, gaps that were demonstrated to be critical to our national security" in the gulf war.
The streamlined list ends controls on most optical sensors used in scientific instruments and industrial equipment. The list reduces by 45 percent the number of electronic components covered, and cuts by 50 percent the number of engines covered. It is expected to result in a 70 percent drop in the number of computer-export applications submitted to the Commerce Department.
Personal computers using microprocessors up to the level of the Intel Corporation's i486 will be free of special licensing requirements under the new rules. But work stations that use the more powerful reduced instruction set, or RISC, computers will remain controlled, computer makers said.
Commerce Department officials said the licensing process would be speeded up, with most export applications cleared within two weeks.
The new rules also restrict the ability of United States telecommunications equipment makers to sell more advanced fiber-optic telephone equipment to the Soviets. While American corporations have argued that the Soviet telephone system must be modernized if the Soviet Union is to become a full economic partner, American intelligence and military agencies have resisted the export of the equipment the nation needs.
"The U.S., United Kingdom, Australia and Canada took a more conservative stance in the negotiations," said Chris Padilla, manager for government relations for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. "The source for most of these concerns in the United States was the intelligence community, particularly the National Security Agency."
 
Up to Soviet Border
 The core list of restrictions permit the installation of advanced fiber-optic links up to the Soviet border. Currently, the most advanced commercial fiber-optic links between large United States cities are 38 times faster than the equipment used in Soviet telephone networks.
"It strikes me as ironic that Mongolia will be able to buy a more modern telecommunications systems than the Soviet Union," Mr. Padilla said.
American officials said they fought hard against any major liberalization in fiber optics. Such systems are harder for American intelligence agencies to tap than conventional telecommunicatons systems.
"No one is trying to keep the Soviet Union in the Stone Age with regard to telecommunications," Mr. Wendt said. "What the Soviet Union needs is good old-fashioned telephones."
At their meeting, Cocom officials vowed to strengthen export-control procedures on the smaller number of items that will be restricted. The meeting called for all nations to adopt common standards for export controls by Jan. 1, forcing those nations with more lenient procedures to tighten their controls.
Despite appeals from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Cocom decided not to lift all restrictions for those countries. Cocom officials said it was not enough for them to have rules barring the re-export of sensitive goods to nations that fall under Cocom restrictions.
 
Some Old Worries Remain
 American officials said the three countries must show that they have effective procedures to control the technologies before all controls are lifted. American officials also expressed concern that some members of the intelligence agencies of those former Communist countries might pass restricted goods on to the Soviet Union.
"It's still cheaper to steal stuff than sink money into development," said William N. Rudman, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy.
Nonetheless, Cocom officials say they will give Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary more favorable treatment than other restricted countries, especially regarding telecommunications equipment.
The Cocom members said streamlining the export control system should not undercut individual nations' efforts, outside the Cocom system, to control exports that lead to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

HEADLINE: Corporations Are Deserting Group Battling Rights Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Concerned about the economic impact of publicly opposing a civil rights measure, at least 21 major companies and an organization representing 200 big corporations have pulled away from a group formed last year to lobby against a broad civil rights bill.
Some of these companies, many of them large retailers, have declined to renew their membership in the group, the Fair Employment Coalition. Others have kept their membership, but are trying to distance themselves from the group. 
 Among those companies that have declined to be publicly identified with the coalition or that say they are no longer members are A.T.&T., Bank of America NT&SA, Bellsouth, Eastman Kodak, Hallmark Cards, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Southwestern Bell, Hershey Foods, Nynex, the Pacific Telesis Group, Scott Paper, Sears, Roebuck & Company. and TRW Inc.
In addition, the Business Roundtable, made up of the chief executive officers of the nation's largest corporations, has withdrawn from the coalition.
 
Reluctance to Sign Document
 Another corporation, the Exxon Company, U.S.A., was a member of the coalition last year, but a spokesman said the company would not comment on whether it was still a member.
Some of the companies that have dropped their membership say they still attend the group's meetings, participate in its discussions and back the coalition's goals. But they have declined to sign the group's "mission statement," which is a declaration of the organization's objectives.
"We feel we can represent our position effectively and with the appropriate amount of visibility without signing that statement," said Betsy Ricci, a spokeswoman for Nynex, which has opposed the civil rights bill.
A spokeswoman for a telephone company that has declined to sign this year's mission statement said the divisiveness of the debate over the civil rights bill had caused her company to rethink its membership in the coaltion.
"The issue that the F.E.C. was formed around -- civil rights -- is such a hot potato right now that we've chosen to distance ourselves officially from the coalition," said the spokeswomen, who asked that neither she nor her company be identified.
But several major companies have retained their membership, including Boeing, Chevron U.S.A., Dow Chemical, United Technologies, Caterpillar and 3-M.
 
Bush's Veto Threat
 The legislation, now nearing a vote in the House, is intended to reverse six Supreme Court decisions that civil rights groups say have weakened Federal laws against discrimination in employment. The measure would also increase the amounts that courts can assess against employers who intentionally discriminate against women, religious minorities and the disabled. Last year, President Bush vetoed a similar civil rights bill, contending that it would force employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas to avoid lawsuits. The Senate failed to override the President's veto.
On Thursday, Mr. Bush repeated a threat to veto this year's version of the bill, even though Democrats have eased some of the provisions in an attempt to make the bill more acceptable to the President. Mr. Bush called those changes "strictly cosmetic."
Peter Lunnie, the coalition's executive director, acknowledged that his organization was having a difficult time getting corporations to sign the mission statement this year.
"We're trying to get as many as we can just to provide cover for everybody," Mr. Lunnie said. "The associations are not a problem, but the companies are, because of not very veiled threats of boycotts."
 
Issue of Quotas
 The mission statement says that members of the Fair Employment Coalition "share a deep and common commitment to equality of employment," but that the group is united "in its opposition to legislation that would rewrite employment law in a manner which would encourage costly, unnecessary litigation at the expense of prompt, equitable resolution of disputes and induce employers to use quotas."
Wade Henderson, director of the Washington office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the withdrawal of companies from the group "confirms our belief that these companies were unaware of the cynical campaign undertaken by the coalition's Washington representatives.
"Many of these companies have a long record of support for civil rights efforts," Mr. Henderson said. "They should be commended for their recent actions."
 
No Surprise in Defections
 The defection of A.T.&T. and the Business Roundtable from the coalition is hardly surprising. The giant telecommunications company recently prodded the roundtable into taking part in protracted, but ultimately unsuccessful, negotiations with supporters of the civil rights bill in an attempt to draft compromise legislation. Recent published reports have credited the coalition, which has worked closely with the White House, with scuttling the talks.
Throughout the debate on the civil rights bill, the coalition has declined to make public the names of its members. But a list of members was obtained elsewhere.
The coalition recently began an advertising campaign in the districts of 13 House members it considers swing votes on the civil rights bill, asking voters in those districts to urge their representatives to vote against the bill.
Copies of the print advertisements and transcripts of the radio commercials were circulated to all House members by Representative Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who opposes the measure.
Some supporters of the bill say the coalition is merely an arm of the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization that has opposed the civil rights bill.
Mr. Lunnie, the executive director, denies that his group is an arm of the the association, asserting that the manufacturers' organization is simply the coalition's leader.
Mr. Lunnie is, however, an official with the manufacturers' association, and the coalition's meetings are held at the association's offices. The coalition is not registered as a lobbyist. Instead it is listed on the lobbying report of the manufacturers' association.
Mr. Lunnie also said he knew of only two companies that had withdrawn from the coalition.

HEADLINE: G.M. Chief Urges Higher Gas Prices

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, May 24

 BODY:
The Federal Government should raise gasoline prices to push consumers toward more fuel-efficient cars and trucks, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation said today.
Robert C. Stempel said at the auto maker's annual meeting here that increased sales of such vehicles would help G.M. and other auto makers meet the Government's corporate average fuel economy requirements, which set out minimum miles-per-gallon averages for auto makers' fleets. 
 "As long as gasoline prices remain low, there is little incentive for Americans to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles," Mr. Stempel said. "If the Government undertakes policies to conserve energy, we urge it to focus on harnessing market forces to reduce energy use."
Car producers have complained that regulations mandating fuel efficiency allow Government interference in marketing operations of auto makers and do not take into account buying trends.
The shareholder meeting was held about 35 miles northeast of G.M.'s new Saturn car making plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. It was the first time in 27 years that G.M. has held its annual meeting outside Detroit.
G.M. offered shareholders a tour of part of the Saturn factory that began shipping cars to dealers last October. In a sense, the $3 billion Saturn project holds a large part of G.M.'s future. The cars are intended to compete directly with Japanese vehicles.

HEADLINE: Sign of a Stalled Economy: Fewer Vehicles in Manhattan

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
For the first time in at least a decade, fewer people are driving into Manhattan.
"Without a doubt, there is less traffic," said Joseph Bierman, regional director of operations for Metro Traffic Control Inc., a private company that produces traffic reports for radio and television. 
 As jobs have disappeared in the weakening regional economy, fewer people have driven into the city for work or pleasure. And the business slump has meant fewer trucks making deliveries. As a result, regional transportation agencies have recorded modest declines in the number of vehicles traveling over bridges and through tunnels into Manhattan in the last year.
On a typical weekday, about 881,000 cars and trucks entered Manhattan during 1987, 1988 and 1989. But last year the traffic began to slip, with about 8,800 fewer vehicles coming in on an average day, according to traffic experts. Preliminary figures for the first three months of this year suggest that the numbers have fallen even further.
 
Garages Are Hurt
 Though modest, the decline has been enough to increase the average speed of traffic on many Manhattan avenues and streets, when construction doesn't interfere. And business at Manhattan garages has also fallen sharply as a result.
Driving in Manhattan is a bit better because of the traffic decline, Mr. Bierman said, but because of a record number of construction projects, "It's still very, very silly to drive into the city."
The traffic decline is notable because it provides a barometer of the sagging economy and illustrates yet another example of how an economic slump is reshaping life in the region.
Georgia Perkins, a 45-year-old real-estate broker who drives into Manhattan over the George Washington Bridge from Teaneck, N.J., said that because there are fewer cars on the road, her 30-minute trip each way after the morning and evening rush has been reduced by five minutes. "It's a nice little benefit to this awful recession," she said.
The economic downturn has hurt public transportation: ridership on subways and buses is down by about 4 percent so far this year, and commuter railroads have also suffered. Ridership on the Long Island Rail Road has declined 5.5 percent this year, and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad has seen a 1.1 percent drop in passengers.
Parking garages in Manhattan have been hit hard by the traffic decline. Some garages in the financial district report a 30 percent decline in business since the stock market crash in October 1987. Many garages are offering discounts to attract drivers.
One benefit of fewer vehicles coming into the city is that cars are now going faster. A report released this week by the city's Transportation Department shows that the average combined speed of vehicles on the city's streets and avenues increased to 7.9 miles an hour in the spring of 1991, compared with 7.3 miles an hour in the same period last year.
 
View From the Air
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported this week that 25.9 million vehicles came into Manhattan over its six toll bridges and tunnels in the first quarter of 1991, or about 1.9 percent fewer than in the same period last year.
A traffic engineer for the Automobile Club of New York, Mark Kulewicz, said that in the last six months he has noticed a significant decline in the number of cars and trucks on the city's roads and bridges. And Mr. Biermann of Metro Traffic Control said he and other traffic helicopter reporters had noticed from the air that there were fewer traffic snarls on major roads and bridges.
But because a record level of work is being done on roads and bridges, the declining traffic volume has not substantially eased the city's overall traffic congestion. And with fewer traffic control agents on the job because of budget cuts, motorists could face some of the worst traffic tie-ups in decades this summer.
Timothy Scruggs, who drives a van into Manhattan from Long Island every day to repair air-conditioning and heating units, said he had noticed no change in city traffic. "Things still seem to be pretty congested most of the time," Mr. Scruggs said. "It really depends on how nice a day it is. More people seem to take to their cars when it's sunny."
And a spokesman for the city's Transportation Department, Joseph DePlasco, said, "If you think you are going to be driving quickly through New York City because the number of cars is down slightly, you are going to have a lot of time to think about it while you are stuck in traffic."
 
Falloff in Employment
 The main reason fewer people are driving into the city is that there are fewer jobs, especially in the financial services, insurance and real-estate industries, which have had widespread layoffs, the officials and experts said. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that payroll employment in New York City declined by 2.2 percent, or 80,000 jobs, between March 1990 and March 1991, roughly the period in which traffic has declined.
Another reason for the decline in the number of cars coming into Manhattan is that people who live in the other boroughs and the suburbs are making fewer discretionary trips to shop and entertain -- an indication of consumer frugality, the officials said. At the same time, they report a drop in the number of trucks and commercial vehicles delivering goods and services.
Traffic in the suburbs is declining as well. The number of cars traveling on the New Jersey Turnpike dropped by 7.4 percent from April 1990 to April 1991. Gordon R. Hector, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, said the agency attributed 3 percentage points of the decline to the recession and the remainder to a recent toll increase.
The Port Authority's director for interstate transportation, Richard R. Kelly, said that while there were fewer cars coming into the city, motorists were not likely to experience less traffic during peak commuting hours. "The morning and evening rush hours are still pretty jammed full of cars, but there is noticeably less traffic during the early-morning and late-evening hours when trucks traditionally make their deliveries," Mr. Kelly said.
The Port Authority operates the George Washington, Bayonne and Goethals Bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing, and the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels. Declines in traffic are also being seen by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which operates the Triborough Bridge and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, and the city's Transportation Department, which oversees the other major East River bridges.
The Metropolitan Parking Association, an industry group that represents 600 parking garages, attributes the loss in business to fewer customers whose companies buy monthly parking passes and to fewer transient customers who visit the city for shopping and entertainment.
John Manigault, who manages a 400-space parking garage on Williams Street in the financial district, said business has been off by 60 percent for the last three years, prompting the garage to cut its rates to $16 a day from $21. "We used to have little trouble filling up this place, but the recession came along and wiped out all those jobs and all those cars that people used to drive," Mr. Manigualt said. "We are hurting."

HEADLINE: Fall TV Schedules Go Back to Basics

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Despite all the signs of radical change swirling around them, the three broadcast networks announced fall prime-time schedules this week that seem to demonstrate a common belief: The more things change, the more they should remain the same.
Against a backdrop of sharply curtailed budgets and the likely prospect of fewer dollars from advertisers, the new network television season will be marked by largely conventional programs and thoroughly familiar goals. 
 The networks all want to make as much money as they can and they all want to win the ratings competition. And the best way to achieve those goals, the programmers are saying, is to swim smack in the middle of the mainstream.
Yesterday CBS announced its lineup of fall programs, completing the list of new entries with four comedies, two action-adventure dramas and, for the first time in four years, a variety series. Counting the series added by the Fox Broadcasting Company, 28 new shows will be introduced starting in late summer.
 
Room at the Top
 All three networks went into their planning sessions for the fall television season knowing that the ratings competition had never been closer and that any one could become the No. 1 network in prime time given the right combination of new hits and astute scheduling of old ones.
NBC , the leader for six straight years, made many moves, adding eight new shows and seeking to bring younger viewers back. "We are seeking to re-energize NBC," said Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment.
ABC , which had acquired a reputation as the network of high-quality, experimental drama, like "Twin Peaks" and "Thirtysomething," has now decisively abandoned that mantle -- after canceling both those programs. "A new signature has been written for ABC," said Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment. "We are aggressively pursuing viewers." Or as he later characterized the network's competitive motivation, "We are going for it this year."
Jeff Sagansky, the president of CBS Entertainment, went even further, declaring in a highly unusual boast that his network, a hopeless third only one year ago, will take command as the network prime-time leader. "We have the schedule and the pieces in place to be No. 1, and I'll be disappointed if we're not."
 
Glories of the Past
 Even with audiences drifting to other channels and the prospect of still more competition on cable in the near future, much of the networks' programming this fall seems to be an effort to revive some elements of their more glorious past. No one is stressing the need to stimulate viewers with experimental or innovative programs as the networks did just a year ago.
Instead, the program formats are uniformly traditional, if sometimes involving unusual new characters and relationships. For example, a police show on NBC will have a hearing-impaired character who communicates largely through sign language.
As usual, many of the series will try to create new stars. The names most often mentioned by programmers as possibilities are a young stand-up comedian named Tim Allen on ABC, a teen-age girl named Olivia Burnett on NBC, and a young leading man named D. W. Moffett on CBS.
But the names of many of the stars of the new series, from James Garner on NBC to Suzanne Somers on ABC to Redd Foxx on CBS, are straight from the Television Hall of Fame.
 
Back to 'Simpler Times'
 And three series, one on each network, are actually looking to take viewers back to the late 1940's and early 1950's, a return, Mr. Sagansky said, "to simpler times, when things were different for everybody."
The programmers all emphasized the quality of the writers and producers generating the new series, saying that the shows will be distinguished by excellence of execution, not originality of premise. Thus the singing cops and doughnut-obsessed F.B.I. agents of last season have been replaced by three series featuring prosecutors, four featuring reformed con artists and 10 new comedies about families.
The CBS schedule included two of those new family comedies. CBS bought "Brooklyn Bridge," about two bothers growing up in Brooklyn in 1956, solely on the basis of a script written by Gary David Goldberg of "Family Ties." But Mr. Sagansky still called the series "without a doubt the best new show of the fall season."
The other is the new Redd Foxx series, called "The Royal Family," about a couple in Atlanta whose lives are undone by the arrival of their daughter and her three children. Mr. Sagansky said it was CBS's highest-testing comedy pilot ever and said it had the potential to become a hit on the scale of the "The Cosby Show."
Another new comedy, "Teech," about a young black music teacher who goes to work in an exclusive boarding school, is produced by Norman Steinberg and David Frankel, who also produced "Doctor, Doctor" for CBS.
The fourth CBS comedy is "Princesses," starring the former model Twiggy Lawson and Julie Hagerty as roommates in New York.
CBS, emphasizing the stability of its schedule, kept Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights exactly the same and moved only one series, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," from Monday to Thursday at 9 P.M.
The four CBS comedies mean the total (the three networks and Fox) of half-hour comedies is 49, by far an all-time high. Comedy is more popular than ever largely because television's new economics favor them. For the same reason, the serious ensemble dramas of recent seasons are being phased out by action-adventure and police shows.
 
Bochco Series Postponed
 Steven Bochco, one of television's most successful writers and producers of high-quality drama ("Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law") saw his latest hourlong effort -- "Civil Wars," about divorce lawyers -- put off by ABC. It left him mildly angry and concerned about the future of serious hourlong drama on television. "ABC is putting on an entire night of comedy," he said, referring to the network's revamped Wednesday night. "That's their emphasis now. I don't know how to combat it."
Indeed, Thomas Murphy, the chairman of Capital Cities/ABC, explained the trend toward comedy in bluntly pragmatic terms: "They repeat better," he said.
The tighter economics of the television business has made good rerun performance more important than ever. A network buys two runs of each series episode with its original license fee, usually about $500,000 for a half-hour comedy and about twice that for an hourlong drama.
The tighter money is driving program decisions, especially the move toward comedy and action-adventure drama, because those types of show fare better when repeated than serious drama, which often has serialized plotlines.
 
Literal-Minded Audiences
 But that emphasis dovetails with the network's conclusion that viewers are not disposed to embrace off-center premises for programs. "What we have learned about the audience is that they are very literal," said Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group. "They don't want to be fooled or spoofed. They want to know for sure what they are watching, because it's so easy to turn to another channel."
Some television traditions are not standing up to the changing times. One of the biggest names in television for three decades, Johnny Carson, closed NBC's programming meetings this week with a definitive date for his last appearance as the host of one of television's longest-running series, "The Tonight Show." Mr. Carson said he would leave the series next May 22.
He added one plea: That somewhere in the phalanx of new television channels featuring re-runs of "M*A*S*H" and "Mr. Ed" there should still be a place for a program like "The Tonight show," in order to insure a place on television where talent may be showcased and recognized.
He didn't say it had to be on a network.

HEADLINE: Stores Battle Credit Cards (With Theirs)

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Department and specialty stores have started a campaign of vigorous promotion of their own charge cards. Buffeted by the rising use of "third-party" cards like Visa, Mastercard and American Express , they are pulling out all the stops.
For consumers, the store cards sometimes offer advantages the third-party cards do not: special sales, opportunities for free or reduced-price travel and quicker authorization of credit transactions. For stores, there are other benefits: a source of information that can be used to track consumer purchases, a base of regular customers who spend much more than cash customers, and the opportunity to avoid the fee third parties charge merchants. 
 As one of the lures to attract more use of store cards, some department store chains that operate stores with different names around the country are accepting cards from affiliated stores.
Thus Bergdorf Goodman of New York and Neiman Marcus of Dallas, both of them units of the Neiman Marcus Group, take each other's charge cards. "It's convenient for customers and it works out very well for us," said Ira Neimark, chairman of Bergdorf's.
 
Two Obstacles for Stores
 The department stores face no easy task in winning over customers to their cards. First, more and more shoppers are trying to reduce the number of cards they carry. Second, the saturation of bank and Amex cards is such that virtually all retailers accept at least one of them, even if they have their own card.
"Consumers are looking for ways to simplify their lives and carry fewer cards," said Carl E. Steidtmann, chief economist of Management Horizons, a Columbus, Ohio, retail research company. "The number of plastics most of us have is more than most of us want."
The decline of the store charge card began about 15 years ago, when metropolitan and suburban stores decided to step up acceptance of outside credit cards to stimulate sales and reduce the cost of administering their credit departments. Customers must have liked the idea: Sales through third-party cards have grown to about 15 percent of overall volume from about 2 percent in the late 1970's. At certain stores, that percentage is even higher.
"Retailers gave up a lot of their birthright when they let the regular charge cards in," said Herbert Wittkin, a New York retail consultant.
"Department store cards were the queen of the cards in the days before national bank cards," said James Posner, a retailing consultant in New York. "Now they have lost ground, so companies are putting up fewer barriers to credit than before."
"The buzzword in the retail industry is frequency marketing," said David Robertson, vice president of the Nilson Report, a credit-card newsletter. "You want to personalize the benefits and reward loyal customers with a retail card in order to bring them in the store more often."
For example, Federated-Allied Credit Services, a unit of Federated Department Stores Inc., whose divisions include Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, is phasing in a conversion to magnetic stripes on its charge cards. All the chain's Bon stores in Seattle have converted and the other divisions are expected to by the end of the year.
"This is a tough economy to do business in and the proprietary department store card is becoming more precious," said James Amann, president of Federated-Allied, which has the largest number of credit accounts among department stores.
Neiman Marcus has a system of gift and travel awards to frequent shoppers. Shoppers get a point for every dollar purchase with the store's charge card, with awards beginning at $3,000 a year. Among the gifts are two crystal decanters for exceeding 7,500 points annually and two pieces of silver for exceeding 15,000 points annually.
 Rapid credit at the point of purchase can be a special enticement to customers. Retailers linked by computer to credit bureaus say they can open charge accounts in less than five minutes as long as proper identification is shown. Sometimes there is an extra discount as a bonus.
 
Concern for Saving the Sale
 "Often a retailer will support a credit decision that a third party will not, because most retailers are concerned with saving the sale," said William Bloom, vice president for credit sales and services of Saks Fifth Avenue. "And a proprietary account offers a separate line of credit which does not eat up existing lines of credit on third-party cards."
If these techniques to increase the stores' charge accounts are successful, the retailers may be able to change the behavior of shoppers who now use third-party cards and cash. When that happens, retailers and consultants say, the shoppers are likely to become more loyal to the stores whose cards they use, spend higher amounts on each transaction and enjoy a higher level of service.
 
 
 
THE STRATEGIES IN STORES' BATTLE

Department stores fighting to regain in-house credit sales are using many lures to persuade their customers to use or open store charge accounts. Here are a few of the new programs.
Magnetic stripes, now put onto store charge cards, meaning that the cards can be processed automatically on equipment already in place that is used for third-party cards.
Frequent-shopper programs, similar to the frequent-user programs of airlines and hotels. Points are awarded for purchases and gifts given for specific points.
Systems for opening instant charge accounts within minutes at cash registers as purchases are made.
Incentives for salesclerks who persuade customers to open new charge accounts and running sweepstakes for consumers who do so.

The Enemy Gap

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Listen to this:
 "A Fifth of Nuclear Arms Spending Is Termed Wasteful or Unneeded," says a headline. The story elaborates: Nearly $2 billion per year of the Energy Department's weapons budget is spent on plants, projects and contracts attacked as wasteful by its own inspector general. And so forth. 
 Outrageous, isn't it? Something ought to be done. Most likely, nothing will. Usually nothing is. This sort of story is constantly turning up in the news, people are constantly crying outrage, everyone is constantly saying something ought to be done, and that's the end of it.
 There are dull explanations. For instance: People whose livelihood depends on nothing being done about outrages have more staying power than reporters, newspapers, inspectors general, Congressmen and outraged persons without portfolio.
 By hunkering down, they can make sure nothing is done until another outrage is discovered elsewhere and the heat moves on. What's happening is that laws of cause-and-effect don't work very well anymore.
 Here's something else: The Air Force wants $95 billion to buy a fleet of brand new F-22 fighter planes. Here we have a weird phenomenon: an effect without a cause. In the sensible old days, an effect like this ($95 billion aircraft purchase) would have had a cause (the Soviet threat), and the Air Force wouldn't have let anybody forget it.
 Now, though, with the Soviets on the rocks, in Paper Tigersville as it were, the once reliable old cause is gone. And yet, effect remains as powerful as ever!
 In a world where cause-and-effect was still king, the collapse of powerful antagonists was a cause whose effect was usually a reduced war budget. This happened for a brief moment after World War II.
 Here is a third news item, and it suggests that Americans have become so contemptuous of the laws of cause-and-effect that they don't expect effects to result even from the most dramatic causes:
President Gorbachev says that if the West can spend $100 billion to save Kuwait, it should be able to find enough money to save the collapsing Soviet economy by making perestroika work. Presumably he thinks the West will consider it a good investment to prevent the Soviet Union from falling into chaos.
 Whether Mr. Gorbachev is seeking $100 billion is unclear, but the figure is interestingly close to the Air Force's figure, $95 billion, for a new fighter fleet. If Washington people still thought of the world as a cause-and-effect place, they would leap at the chance to lay $100 billion on Mr. Gorbachev, wouldn't they?
 Look: After 40 years of cold war, Washington had become so indifferent to cause-and-effect that it hadn't occurred to anybody that winning the cold war might cause eerie effects -- for example, not having the good old Soviet threat to justify new requests for $95 billion worth of airplanes.
 Some cynic is eventually bound to say, "If there's no more enemy, what's causing the need for this expensive purchase?"
 Sooner or later, somebody will have to come up with a new enemy to justify building ever-better fighters and harder-to-stop bombers. Probably the Pentagon can find contractors willing to design and build a new enemy, but at what cost!
 Suddenly we have a cheap solution looking at us right off page 1. For a mere $100 billion we can put the Soviet Union back on its feet.
This would give us an excellent, tried-and-true enemy with a great record of exuding menace, moreover an enemy already armed with infinities of H-bombs. And the whole package would cost only $5 billion more than we pay for a batch of fighter planes.
 Yes, they'll probably be pretty good fighter planes, but will they be half as good for the economic health of our military industries as the Soviet Union has been for two generations? Friend, we are talking one of the great military bargains of the modern age.
 It's doubtful Washington will grasp the wisdom of the thing. It never saw that winning the cold war could cause devastating effects like losing a cause to keep the economy on a war footing. It still operates on the feeble theory that you can keep war industries booming without an enemy.
 When it finally concedes that a new enemy is essential, it will doubtless spend a trillion dollars or two having the usual defense contractors build one and end up with something that spends half its time in the repair shop.

HEADLINE: Hispanics' Promised Land's Broken Promises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The recent disturbances in Washington's Mount Pleasant area, a densely populated Hispanic district, focus our attention on the burgeoning Spanish-speaking population nationwide. Approximately 25 million Spanish-speaking people have come to the United States, constituting about one-tenth of our country's population.
There are a variety of reasons for this constant exodus from the countries of Latin America. Among them are grinding poverty on a massive scale; runaway inflation and continual devaluation of already depressed currencies, thus decreasing the purchasing power of meager wages, inflicting intolerable hardship upon the masses of the marginalized; an ongoing process of urbanization attracting large numbers of campesinos to the sprawling, already overcrowded shantytowns and slums of densely populated cities. 
 Immense numbers of people in Latin American countries suffer from malnutrition, with a corresponding soaring incidence of infant mortality. Escalating violence has taken the lives of thousands. Various countries have double-digit unemployment and underemployment figures, even among skilled workers and professionals. Repressive regimes allocate a disproportionate amount of national resources to their military rather than to the basic needs of their people.
The continuing flight of professionals and of capital investment, and payments on huge external debts contribute to a drastic and tragic slowdown in needed domestic investment, in the construction of the basic industrial infrastructure indispensable for steady, broad-based economic development; and dependent economies drastically constrict industrial and agricultural production and expansion.
Fleeing misery and hardship, numerous Hispanics have come to this country with the same high hopes for a better life that attracted many of our ancestors from foreign shores. Unfortunately, these hopes are often blighted since Hispanics as a group are poor, have less education and have greater difficulties finding employment than others.
During the disturbances in Mount Pleasant, Hispanics voiced various grievances: substandard, overcrowded housing; unemployment or monotonous, ill-paid jobs; racial discrimination and stereotyping; police brutality, and long neglect by city government of their needs.
As in other parts of the United States, Hispanics are especially vulnerable to discrimination, abuse and injustice. The events in Mount Pleasant should lead us to a greater con
cern that Hispanics not be victims of inadequate housing, unjust wages, unsafe and unhealthy employment, substandard educational opportunities, insufficient police protection, racial prejudice and stereotyping, or of other discriminating practices.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Phone Sale Is Canceled

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The Governor of Puerto Rico has canceled plans to sell the commonwealth's government-owned telephone system, citing a shortage of potential buyers and the government's apparent inability to obtain its $3 billion asking price.
 Many analysts contended that Puerto Rico's price was unrealistically high, but the cancellation also reflected a number of factors that could hamper other governments around the world as they rush to sell their telephone companies -- the recession in the United States, troubles in the banking industry and greater selectivity by buyers. 
What a year ago was classified as a market with an abundance of buyers has become one in which a great amount of potential sellers are facing a more limited demand," said Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon, in a message to Puerto Rico's Legislature late Thursday.
 
BellSouth Interest Reported
 Government officials confirmed that they had received several offers, including at least one from an American telephone company. The BellSouth Corporation has been reported to be one of the bidders. BellSouth officials declined to comment on the government's decision.
 But some analysts said the action also reflected unduly optimistic government expectations that buyers, like leveraged buyout firms, would be willing to pay relatively high prices. Instead, as banks and other lenders have cut back on capital for highly leveraged transactions, the market has largely been left to American telephone companies.
 "You really don't find the financial buyers out there," said Joel D. Gross, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The telephone companies are the only buyers. They have money, but they're more conservative in their valuation criteria."
 When the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Ameritech Inc. bought New Zealand's state-owned telephone company last year for $2.4 billion, company officials said they had paid roughly 14 times earnings. By contrast, Mr. Gross said, financially driven buyers have argued that investors valuing companies on the basis of their cash flow could pay closer to 20 times earnings.
 The Puerto Rican government has not made public the financial details of its telephone operations. But officials at the commonwealth-owned Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico said that on telephone operations the local telephone company earned $62 million on revenues of $630 million in 1990.
 Those figures do not include results from cellular telephone service, long-distance service or equipment manufacturing, which were also up for sale. But a bank official said the "overwhelming majority" of the $3 billion price tag had been based on the value of local telephone operations. On that basis, the sale price would have constituted a multiple of 50 times earnings.
 
Price Questioned
 "The company wasn't worth $3 billion by any stretch of the imagination," said Arthur H. Solomon, vice president and telecommunications consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. "As far as I know, no company has sold for that price."
 Mr. Solomon noted that the Puerto Rican government was effectively demanding $3,000 for each telephone line. By contrast, he said, the stocks of American telephone companies trade at roughly $2,000 per line, and the New Zealand telephone company sold at $1,700 per line.
 For political reasons, however, Puerto Rican authorities had little opportunity to lower their price. Mr. Hernandez-Colon had campaigned on the pledge that he could obtain $2 billion, after retiring $1 billion in company debt, and the Legislature had written that price into a law authorizing the sale.
 In recent years, governments around the world have either sold or begun plans to sell their state-owned telephone companies.

HEADLINE: Compaq Rolls With the Punches

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Until last week, the Compaq Computer Corporation had racked up nine years of spectacular expansion to become the No. 2 maker of personal computers compatible with I.B.M.'s. Now, the question is whether Compaq has lost its direction or is merely pausing to prepare for resumed growth.
 In recent weeks, Compaq has suffered from a bruising round of industry price cuts. Its own projection of falling profits provoked Wall Street to slice more than $1 billion from its market value in a single day. 
A glut of dealer inventories, lower prices, the recession and a strengthening dollar in Europe will depress income well into the third quarter, Joseph (Rod) Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive, has said. And some who follow the company doubt whether its decision to enter the work-station market will have any payoff for years.
 
Many Analysts Keeping Faith
 But many analysts have kept faith. They say that Compaq's long-term prospects in personal computers remain solid, thanks to popular new products and a strong record.
 Compaq's move in April to sharply pare prices and accept narrower profit margins has raised the company's share of industry sales. Some analysts say that the lower prices might block inroads by smaller companies like Dell Computer, AST Research and Everex Systems that have courted major corporate buyers of computers.
 "This particular price move was bold, pre-emptive and had an instantaneous, positive effect," said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services, a consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. "A couple of dealers had close to record months in April for Compaq unit sales."
 Two products introduced last year have proved to be especially popular among large companies. The new LTE 386/20 has helped Compaq dominate the market for notebook computers, with 37 percent of worldwide sales in 1990, according to Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. Compaq is No. 1 in notebook computer sales in the United States and No. 2 worldwide behind the Toshiba Corporation.
 Sales of a new file server -- a central library for a computer network -- called the Systempro, exceeded $200 million last year, making it one of the most successful new products in Compaq's history.
 Compaq boasts that its equipment is uprooting I.B.M. systems at companies like Dyncorp, a diversified Government contractor in Reston, Va. Dyncorp pared its computer staff from 66 people to 12 and saved $1.5 million a year after shifting many of its computer operations from two I.B.M. mainframes to seven Systempros. And in personal computers, Compaq is gaining ground on I.B.M., the world's largest maker.
 Compaq itself was immensely profitable last year, with after-tax profit margins of 12.6 percent, more than twice the American industry average. Net income rose 36.5 percent, to $454.9 million, or $5.14 a share. Sales rose 24.1 percent, to $3.6 billion.
 Sales and earnings growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter, with sales up by 11 percent, to $971 million, while earnings were up by 24 percent, to $114 million, or $1.26 a share, from the comparable quarter last year. At the end of March, the company's balance sheet was still a manufacturer's dream, with cash reserves of $568.6 million, far exceeding $73.9 million in long-term debt. Two Sets of Problems
 Yet, Compaq has two sets of problems that have investors questioning the company's prospects. First, a weak but viciously competitive market for personal computers has eroded Compaq's ability to charge premium prices and hurt income.
 Mr. Canion said on May 15 that Compaq's second-quarter profits would fall by at least 79 percent, to less than 25 cents a share, from $1.18 in the corresponding quarter last year. Mr. Canion said that he expected an upturn in sales by the end of the year but that the domestic economy had not yet shown any sign of recovery. Compaq's share price tumbled 27 percent, or $13.25 a share, to $36, on the news. [The stock closed Friday at $37 a share, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.]
 The second Compaq challenge is to penetrate the fast-growing work-station market now dominated by Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.
 
Alliance for New Standard
 Instead of trying it alone, Compaq locked arms earlier this year with several allies to create a new industry standard for work stations. Last month, Digital Equipment, Microsoft, Compaq and 18 other companies announced that they would develop work-station systems, compatible with I.B.M. personal computers, that would be available in late 1992 or early 1993.
 If members of this Advanced Computing Environment group, or ACE, succeed, their equipment could be connected to networks of I.B.M.-compatible personal computers.
 "This basic, very simple architecture of desktop computers hooked together with a network, and server computers on the network, is the formula for solving all major problems," Mr. Canion said. "There is enough power there to solve any minicomputer problem, and any mainframe problem."
 
ACE's Skeptics
 The ACE project has many skeptics. Stewart Alsop, editor of the PC Letter, published in Redwood City, Calif., said similar alliances had failed to produce new technology in the past.
 He said: "The ACE standard is really not a standard but a collection of technologies that each of the participants has developed and thrown into the pot. Is this the right way to enter the work-station business?"
 Even if ACE crumbles, chances are that Compaq could recover and win a piece of the work-station business by itself. But many in the industry question how much it would benefit.
 Although sales of work stations are expected to grow more rapidly than those of personal computers through the 1990's, the work-station market is far smaller. Work-station sales amounted to $7.3 billion worldwide in 1990, while PC sales reached $36.7 billion, according to Compaq.
 
Analyst Expects Delayed Impact
 "I don't see it having a material impact on earnings until 1993 and maybe not even then," said Charles R. Wolf, a personal-computer analyst at the First Boston Corporation. In the work-station market, Sun holds a commanding lead, with more than 500,000 machines installed, a figure that could reach one million before Compaq sells its first work station.
 Hedging its bet on ACE, Compaq paid $135 million in April for a 13 percent stake in Silicon Graphics Inc., a maker of work-station software that can generate lifelike three-dimensional images. Mr. Canion said the deal cut Compaq's research timetable for work stations by two years.
 
Information for Dealers
 Compaq has also been improving its distribution and dealer training, although some analysts still criticize the company for relying exclusively on computer dealers instead of its own sales force. It is spending more to educate dealers about its machines. In January, it opened its first toll-free telephone service, a lure that the Dell Computer Corporation had used to help its own sales force take big corporate orders away from Compaq and I.B.M.
 Hitching onto another trend, Compaq will begin selling its lower-priced machines later this year in discount superstores like Bizmart, which agreed to be acquired this month by a large Compaq dealer, Intelligent Electronics Inc.
 Some dealers were angered in April when Compaq narrowed their wholesale discounts from list prices to 30 percent, from 40 percent. Compaq gambled that by also cutting retail prices as much as 34 percent, dealers could improve their profits by selling more Compaq products.
 
A Dealer Sees Sales Increase
 Gregory Enders, president of Multi-Net Inc., a large Houston dealer with dozens of big Compaq and I.B.M. accounts in the energy industry, said the strategy had worked for him. "We were able to make up the lower profit margins through increased sales, and our profits are up significantly on the Compaq line," he said.
 Mr. Wolf said the new marketing and distribution strategies would eventually enable Compaq to revive its sales growth. But the company's era of premium prices and fat profit margins is over, he added. Emerging rivals like Dell and AST have transformed personal computers into virtually interchangeable commodities.
 "Compaq always preached industry standards, but now they are experiencing the other side of the coin," Mr. Wolf said. "When you have standards, you have commodity products. Compaq can grow, but it simply can't be as robust in profits as it was in the past."

HEADLINE: Computers Give Trucker an Edge

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis.

 BODY:
Most trucking company chiefs worry about their trucks, drivers and fuel prices. Donald J. Schneider, head of the nation's largest long-distance trucking company, frets more about a breakdown in the company's computers.
 "It's a real critical issue," said Mr. Schneider, president of Schneider National Inc., as his face grew grave. "I don't know what would happen." 
The computers are part of a vast communications system that keeps Schneider National's 6,700 tractors in constant touch by satellite with the company's headquarters here in Green Bay. If a driver carrying Tide detergent, say, has a breakdown in West Texas, miles away from the nearest telephone, he can punch a message for headquarters into a terminal in his cab. Or a manager here can tell a driver hauling Sony television sets to a New York warehouse to change interstates and head for Chicago.
 
Edge Over Rivals
 Computers may seem an anomaly in an industry that evokes images of burly men wrestling big steering wheels and grinding the gears of huge tractor-trailer rigs. But company executives say the computers have given Schneider major marketing and operating tools that provide a competitive edge over their rivals.
 In the current recession many companies are trying to keep their inventories low but still want to be able to send their clothing, cars or stereos rapidly to areas where there is a surge in demand. For Schneider, the ability to satisfy such last-minute changes for customers can be a major advantage.
 Schneider is the only major full-truckload company with such a communications system, which is marketed by Qualcomm, a private telecommunications company in San Diego. Schneider first adopted the system, called Omnitracs, two and half years ago.
 In 1988 Mr. Schneider went before his board and requested $40 million to install the satellite communications system, which up to that point had not proved itself in the industry.
 Since then, 100 trucking companies have installed similar systems, but most are smaller carriers with fleets of fewer than 500 trucks.
 "They were the first," Tom Bernard, a Qualcomm executive, said of Schneider. "They had the vision to take the step. In many major ways they're ahead of the rest of the industry."
 The system has helped Schneider sustain its rapid revenue growth of an average of 14.5 percent a year since 1980.
 In a room here filled with display terminals, Carl W. Thiem, vice president of customer service, and his staff on a recent morning made such decisions as deploying more trucks into northern Wisconsin, where an unusual number of orders for paper and other manufactured goods were coming in.
 Messages were being sent to scores of drivers giving them detailed instructions on how to reschedule their trips to end up in the right places to handle the surge.
 "Everything is done on the computer," said Mr. Thiem, a former Marine Corps officer. "That's the lifeblood of the organization."
 He is nearing his goal of eliminating paper in his department. In the past, when orders and other information were kept on thin slips, there were many errors. Information from customers was written down and then transmitted to the driver via the phone.
 There are now some major customers who relay their orders directly into the Schneider computers and a growing number are also billed and pay their invoices by the same method.
 "We're just scratching the surface of this capacity," said Ralph Drayer, general mamanger of customer services at the Procter & Gamble Company, a major Schneider customer. "There is much more there."
 Major competitors, like J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., have plans to put in similar systems in their 4,000 tractors by the end of this year. Molly Remes, director of corporate communications for Hunt, said that the carrier had put off installation until I.B.M. had developed a system that met its needs.
 
Frustrating Waits
 Hunt's drivers must now stay in touch by making stops and getting to a phone, a procedure that wastes time and can be frustrating as drivers are often put on hold by their dispatchers who must deal with many calls at once.
 Stories circulate in the industry of frustrated drivers ripping phones off the walls and one running over a phone booth with his truck.
 Putting the terminals in the tractors and installing the computers is the easy part, according to Schneider executives. The most challenging phase is to develop the software that will enable a company to make use of the vast amount of information that continually flows into the system.
 John G. Larkin, a trucking analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, said that "information is not an end in itself," adding, "They have to use the information to make better decisions."
 
Helps Attract Customers
 Schneider, he said, has been able to use the vast amount of new information to reduce its operating costs and attract customers.
 Dann Sherman, manager of traffic and distribution for Sony Video Tec de Mexico, said the ability of Schneider to communicate with its drivers was important in shipping such high-value goods as television sets, which are made in a plant in Tijuana.
 "Their drivers have to make contact every two hours," he said. "That prevents a driver from going off the road somewhere. It keeps our product moving."
 Schneider is continually improving its system. Mr. Thiem said that a distant goal was to give the same information that Schneider got to the computers of shippers and the customers so that they could better plan their production and inventory.
 Such an approach fits in well with Procter & Gamble's goal of creating teams that include a few trucking companies, staff members at P.& G.'s plants and customers who constantly work to improve service and cut costs.
 
Credit to Schneider
 "We used to buy price only," Mr. Drayer of Procter & Gamble said. "You get what you pay for," That was possible when customers kept 30-day inventories of products like Tide. Now most keep a seven-day supply.
 The credit for preparing and pushing the trucking company into the computer age belongs largely to Mr. Schneider, who took over the company in 1961 after he got his master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The company was formed in 1938 by his father, Al J. Schneider, a farmer with a fourth-grade education who built the business into a small hauler with about $900,000 annual revenue by the 1960's.
 To earn money for his education, the younger Mr. Schneider worked as a driver and a mechanic's helper. He has since sought to instill a sense that every employee is important. Thus the best parking spaces nearest the entrance to headquarters are kept open for visiting drivers instead of top executives.
 
Follows Deming Precepts
 Fellow workers are called "associates." Mr. Schneider, a proponent of quality management as espoused by W. Edwards Deming, keeps a modest office where he works at a stand-up desk in shirt-sleeves.
 The slim, 55-year-old executive holds the ideal of Mr. Deming that workers and management must share in the effort to continually improve quality and look for innovations.
 He has recruited some managers whose bearing and clipped speech mark them as former military officers like Mr. Thiem. With his controlling interest, Mr. Schneider has also kept the company in private hands.
 Some of his subordinates say that Mr. Schneider can be relentless in his pursuit of improvement, exhausting them in the process. They also said, however, that he had gained the loyalty of many of his staff, who use snowmobiles, four-wheel-drive vehicles and skis to get to work when snowstorms halt most other businesses in Green Bay. They will stay in nearby hotels to be near work until the snow is cleared.
 
Ready for Deregulation
 "That's what I think you can't duplicate," said Dan Sellers, vice president of information services, of the support that the staff shows for the company.
 By the time the trucking industry was deregulated in 1980, Mr. Schneider, who holds the title of president, had built a management team prepared to take advantage of the new freedoms. The company by then had already grown considerably and had $215 million in annual sales. It has continued its rapid growth of 14.5 percent a year with its sales totaling $832 million in 1990.
 After deregulation, instead of being limited to certain routes, Schneider and other trucking companies could go where they wanted and had much greater freedom in setting prices.
 
Many Ended in Bankruptcy
 But many trucking companies ended up in bankruptcy by either failing to adapt to the new competition or being too aggressive in going after greater market share. Some companies continued to keep track of their trucks and shipments on index cards. Schneider itself was also groping to find the right strategy.
 "We had no assurance that we were going to be one of the surviving carriers," Mr. Schneider recalled.
 One benefit of the new communications system is that it has helped Schneider recruit new drivers and keep its 7,000 drivers happier, the company said. The communications system helps Mr. Thiem's staff plans trips so that a driver ends up near home at the end of the week.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Out in the Proving Grounds, Times Get Tougher

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning

 BODY:
One never knows what to expect at Performance Space 122, though the small experimentalist performing-arts center, on First Avenue in lower Manhattan, has been confounding expectations for 11 years now. And that is the charm of the place and of a handful of theaters like it -- places that have not only allowed but encouraged wild experimentation and have served as proving grounds for artists who have become important figures in theater, dance and music.
For Yvonne Meier's "Pommes Fritz" at P.S. 122 last month, high shelves were stacked with haphazard piles of thick white dishes. The piles loomed tantalizingly throughout the gusty, exuberant dancing and curious tableaux that made up the piece. Suddenly, Ms. Meier yanked at a rope and the shelves lurched free, sending plates, cups and bowls tumbling down in glorious cascades and smashing into a sea of shards. 
 One young audience member saw that culminating moment as a commentary on the Persian Gulf war. An older woman saw it as a waste of crockery. For many, Ms. Meier had capped her reputation as a delightful anarchist of a choreographer, dancer and performance artist and created a vivid metaphor for the protean energy and bursting physicality of a good deal of dance today. And the dance was typical of the kinds of surprises that tend to occur at P.S. 122 and, in usually more serene ways, at the city's four other established experimentalist theaters.
But that crashing china now seems a metaphor of another, sadder sort. P.S. 122 and spaces like it, already struggling to survive in hard economic times, now face not only the diminution of private support but the effects of proposed cuts of 44 percent in the city's arts allocations and 56 percent in the state arts budget. "I haven't seen anything like it in the 16 years I've been at Dance Theater Workshop," said David White, its director.
For the first time P.S. 122 has decided to close down for the summer. And theaters like it are facing similar decisions. As Barbara Tsumagari, the director of the Kitchen on West 19th Street, puts it, a decision must be made to "do fewer shows, do less for shows" or, she adds wryly, "do everything, go broke and hope someone will bail you out." Richard Elovich, director of Movement Research, on Varick Street, suggests that it may be time to go back to "barebones dance."
Belt-tightening is not new for these theaters. "We have all learned to make silk purses out of sows' ears," said Amy Lamphere, director of the Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church on lower Second Avenue.
It was in these theaters that artists like Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Irwin, Eric Bogosian, Paul Zaloom and Mark Morris did early performances. These spaces -- indispensable incubators of new dance, music and performance art that has gone on to Broadway, Lincoln Center and the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- have played an important part in establishing and maintaining New York City's reputation as a cultural center.
They are places where the audience is likely to feel an unusually immediate involvement in the process of creating art, rough-hewn or rude though the work may sometimes be, due in part to the physical closeness of the observer to the performer. The sense that an informed (though not always comprehensible) taste governs the selection of artists -- that imaginative and idealistic curators are at work here -- induces a degree of trust and expectation. At their best, the theaters crackle with an electric feeling of community, perhaps because most also offer a variety of services to artists as well as workshops out of which important new programs and schools of thought have grown.
 Each space has its own success story. And each has a character of its own. The small Dance Theater Workshop stage curves like a hand around productions there, so that artists seem to move into the light from a nurturing, mysterious darkness. The stage can serve as an open field for abstract movement. But it was here, last November, that a woman came to terms so painfully with recurrent death and a friend's silence about having AIDS in the everyday life lived out in Rachel Lampert's "Inventory 900." It was here that fire consumed a bed and was itself consumed by waves in the feverish dreamscape of Power Boothe's recent "Once and Once."
A good deal of dirt and water has spilled out onto the stage in impenetrable rituals at P.S. 122. But this is also the place where Ann Carlson walked calmly into a woman's bleak death and Lauri Nagel single-handedly filled an imaginary park with old people and pigeons. Rakish fantasy processionals spring up in the hard rectangular confines of the stage of the Kitchen, whether they be the punkster hijinks of the women of Dancenoise in a guided tour through hell called "When Women Had Tails" or the extended pastel reverie of John Kelly's "Maybe It's Cold Outside."
Danspace offers lots of luminous open space with odd features that have fueled choreographers' imaginations in surprising ways. Who could forget, for instance, the two women of Sanghi Wagner's haunting "Descent," one engaged in a private duet with her shadow, cast high across the curved ceiling, while the other rocks in her sleep on the floor below, a ladder the bridge between them.
And on one night Movement Research's simple, unadorned studio-style stage at the Ethnic Folk Arts Center became a busy Caribbean village in the hands of Jawole Zollar and her then-unknown Urban Bush Women, and on another night a vast jousting ground for God and devil in dance by Demetrius Klein. There, too, new young choreographers sprawl in a circle to discuss their work with the audiences who have just seen it in workshop performances.
"The laboratory environment of these spaces is in serious jeopardy," Mr. White said. "We take the risks. We make sure artists can continue to work. We're the producers for the first line of audience. For us, 'new' is 'next.' "

Refinancing Troubles
 
Question: I am having extreme difficulty in obtaining refinancing on my Manhattan co-op, which I purchased for $73,000 in September 1989. The sponsor, who has sold only 16 percent of the apartments, financed $65,000 of the purchase price. Now a balloon payment of $52,000 is due next September of this year.
I have never been late with mortgage or maintenance payments, but I did have a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged in January 1989. Is this keeping me from refinancing? . . . Ann Troop, Manhattan
 
Answer: It may not be. According to Bernard Aguinaldo, president of Stamford Capital Corporation, a mortgage brokerage company in Manhattan, a bankruptcy more than two years old should not be a problem if your credit since then has been good.
More important to lenders, Mr. Aguinaldo said, are the number of apartments sold in the building and the corporation's financial health. Because of the decline in the market, banks and mortgage companies are reluctant to extend loans in cooperatives where fewer than 35 percent of the units have been sold. "In today's atmosphere," said Mr. Aguinaldo, "a borrower can be willing to put up a large down payment and still not be able to secure a loan in a new conversion if the building has not sold well."
If you cannot get a mortgage on the open market the best strategy is to try to get the sponsor to refinance your loan as soon as possible.
 
Home Office
 
Question: We own a 10-family, rent-stabilized apartment house in Manhattan. One tenant is using her apartment to do office work for her company. She has a fax machine, computer, answering machine and receives company mail at her home address. Can we raise the rent because of this? . . . Evald Suld, Plandome, L.I.
 
Answer: No. The rent-stabilization rules do not provide for increase based on use of the apartment as a business. If the apartment is her prime residence, she has the right to use part of the space -- 500 square feet or 25 percent, whichever is greater -- for occupational use.
Section 12-10 of the city's zoning code, however, prohibits some occupational uses, among them stock brokeage, public relations, advertising and interior decorating. If your tenant's company is involved in one of these types of business, she could be in violation of the zoning code.
 
Subletting Fee
 
Question: I have owned an apartment in an established co-op for the past 15 years. Subletting has been prohibited in the past. But recently the board of directors passed a rule saying that they would allow it due to economic hardship. There will be a fee of 25 percent of the annual maintenance.
While understanding that the board wants to discourage sublets, can it levy a fee on shareholders ? . . . Ruth Burton, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. The right of co-op boards to impose "reasonable" sublet fees without the approval of a majority of the shareholders has been upheld by the New York State Supreme Court.
Market pressures have forced many boards with strict no-sublet policies to be more flexible but some are setting fees and restricting the amount of time sublets are allowed.
According to Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, your co-op's 25 percent charge is higher than most. A fee of 15 percent is closer to the average.
"But shareholders have right," she said, "through ballot box, to infulence the board when they object to a policy."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Middle-Density Housing;
A Courtyard Finds a Place in Marble Hill

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE courtyard has an honorable history in New York City housing. The question is: Does it have a place in any of the affordable-housing developments that are mushrooming in middle-density locations of the Bronx? So far, the Bronx pipeline provides two-family or three-family town houses almost exclusively.
The courtyard's potential is on view at an infill site in the Marble Hill section of Manhattan -- on the Bronx side of the Harlem River -- at a new garden-apartment condominium development called Marble Hill Gardens. The landscaped courtyard, taking up almost a third of the half-acre site, is one of its most unusual and attractive features. 
 The Marble Hill project was built last year on land with 100 feet of frontage on Adrian Avenue, a winding street thick with old frame houses. The land drops sharply to Terrace View Avenue, 200 feet distant. The house that once stood there burned down and the land became a dumping ground.
The zoning is R-6. A 15-story high-rise could have been built by right. That in fact was the plan of the architect who bought the property. It would have upset the Adrian Avenue streetscape and inflamed the homeowners there, although apartment houses are the norm on Terrace View Avenue.
But the owner's bank considered the plan economically infeasible and introduced him to a potential buyer, the Bluestone Organization, a 60-year-old family-owned building company based in Flushing, Queens.
Now there are 33 new apartments in two strips of three-story brick buildings on the site. They went on the market last October.
The front buildings, wedged between private one-family houses, face Adrian Avenue. The rear buildings, approached by a narrow stone stairway, face an 8,000-square-foot grassy inner courtyard with benches, walkways and lamppost lighting. In that private precinct the city outside seems a world away.
The housing style itself is a world away from the town houses currently being sold as affordable in the Bronx. In most town houses, curb cuts on each plot lead to a pad parking strip in front of the house. In the rear the owner gets a large private yard. The buyer also gets his own plot of land, a strong sales point. To get open space that can be maintained as a courtyard in for-sale housing, the units must be sold as condominiums.
Two-family houses average about 30 or 35 units an acre. Marble Hill's density, about 70 units to an acre, slightly exceeds that of modern three-family houses in middle-density zones. From the outside, these garden apartments resemble three-family homes. But because fireproof construction is used (achieved in this case with planks of precast concrete resting on masonry bearing walls), one stairway can be provided for six units. In three-family town houses a stair is needed for every three units.
The architect is Herbert H. Warman of Great Neck, L.I., a man of long experience in low-rise housing design in New York City, much of it for Bluestone. "A condominium has the advantage of making it possible to make more attractive land uses in the commonly owned space, and to provide passive recreation space," he said.
The courtyard also offers a pleasant front for houses. In Marble Hill, the Terrace View Avenue frontage to the site lies across the street from an upper-level entrance to John F. Kennedy High School.
AT the neighborhood's request, on-site parking was provided along Terrace View Avenue. Cars will be parked perpendicularly to the building behind a chain-link fence at the sidewalk.
From that point, owners walk up a stone stairway to the courtyard entrances. The front entrance to the development is on Adrian Avenue. A secured entrance there opens on a stairway leading to the courtyard.
The Bluestone Organization was able to get a state subsidy of a maximum of $25,000 per apartment from the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation through the New York City Housing Partnership, the nonprofit development intermediary that is an arm of the New York City Partnership, a civic organization. The Housing Partnership is handling the Marble Hill sales, with help from the Marble Hill Improvement Corporation.
Only a handful of Housing Partnership projects have been done on private, as opposed to city-owned, land. But because of the shortage of subsidy money, they are a "thing of the past," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Housing Partnership.
At Marble Hill, the unsubsidized prices of apartments are about $111,000 for the six one-bedrooms; $126,000 for 22 two-bedrooms (or $128,000 for two-bedrooms with one and a half baths), and $141,000 for five three-bedrooms, with one and a half baths.
The subsidy brings down the price in accordance with buyers' incomes. At Marble Hill, the city has allowed the Partnership to sell to households with incomes as high as $60,885 to widen its marketing potential in the area. Most buyers so far have had incomes of $40,000 to $50,000. The usual income limit in Partnership housing is $53,000.
Five of the seven Marble Hill buyers so far are of Hispanic background. Before occupancy can begin, at least 51 percent of the apartments must have found buyers.
A question much in the minds of public officials and home builders is whether New York City buyers in moderate- to middle-income locations will accept condominium housing. For the same annual housing costs as a Marble Hill apartment they might be able to buy an existing two-family house.
Many buyers may also want to keep a car within sight on their own land. This has been noted among some buyers in the Bronx, although clustered parking on large sites has been used in the borough, as at the Shorehaven development at Clason's Point.
BLUESTONE, for its part, has confidence in the condominium form. It sold 98 of them through the Partnership at a development in Fort Greeene, in Brooklyn, that provided no parking at all. And it has built innumerable private houses over the years as well. "You do what is appropriate for the site," said Harold Bluestone, one of hree brothers who run the company.
A few of the land-planning possibilities in middle-density low-rise development were sketched by Mr. Warman. They tend to minimize curb cuts.
The door to variety is opened by varying the treatment of parking on the land. One technique in two-family or three-family urban subdivisions is the common private driveway, about 10 to 12 feet wide and used by all the buyers, leading to one or more parking spaces for each house.
Another solution for deep lots is a landscaped service road for parking in front of low-rise multifamily buildings. It might provide two parking spaces per unit in parking clusters of varying size. When parking is clustered, land is freed for alternative uses and the streetscape can be enhanced.
"We have to take account of the fact that the two-story house sells," said Mario Procida, an architect who is president of Procida Construction Company, one of the major town-house producers of affordable housing in the Bronx. "But from a design standpoint it is critical to start building some context of the city back into the high-density areas."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: TriBeCa West;
A New Historic District Under Landmarks Scrutiny

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THE PAST may have been made relatively secure under the blanket of a new historic district, but it is the future that concerns property and business owners in the western end of TriBeCa.
In an irregular, 17-block wedge between Greenwich Street and West Broadway, some 220 buildings -- commercial, industrial and residential -- are now under the scrutiny of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which has the power to approve or reject alterations, demolition and new construction. 
 Included in the designation are a variety of types. They range from the most pedestrian brick boxes to such stylish local landmarks as the former New York Mercantile Building, at Hudson and Harrison Streets, built from 1884 to 1886 and designed by Thomas R. Jackson, and the Powell Building, at Hudson and Franklin Streets, which was begun in 1890 to designs by Carrere & Hastings.
It also includes the Bazzini Building at Greenwich and Jay Streets, home to the A. L. Bazzini Company, manufacturers, packagers and distributors of nuts and candy. And it includes the former Martinson Coffee warehouse at Greenwich and Franklin Streets, which is now an office condominium known as the TriBeCa Film Center.
While the designation took force immediately this month, the City Council has until September to overturn or modify it.
Meanwhile, members of Community Board 1 are already trying to insure a smooth relationship between local commercial interests and the landmarks commission, which is often depicted as a needless obstruction whose esthetic and cultural criteria exact a high price in time and money.
"If, in fact, there's some impractical regulation, then maybe we can dialogue it and find some rational, practical way that satisfies the landmarks commission and the small and medium-sized businesses," said Rocco Damato, chairman of the business-relations committee of Community Board 1. He is also chief executive officer of the Bazzini company, one of the last operating vestiges of the long-past days of Washington Market, when the lower west side of Manhattan was a hub of wholesale food dealing.
Mr. Damato said a historic-district subcommittee would be formed to serve as a liaison to the landmarks staff. "I was hoping that this could at least eliminate a new level of confrontation between small businesses and the city bureaucracy," he said.
"Wonderful!" said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, when she was told about the community board's initiative. "This is music to my ears. This is a perfect way for us to continue working in the community, so there's less and less misperception."
"MY biggest hope is that people can communicate with us directly," she said. "We're ready, willing and able to provide services to the community. We must make sure we're a partner. I embrace this concept and want to start working with them."
Three other potential historic districts are envisioned in the TriBeCa area, with these approximate boundaries:
* TriBeCa North -- Hubert to Watts Streets, West to Varick Streets.
* TriBeCa South -- Chambers to Thomas Streets, West Broadway to Broadway.
* TriBeCa East -- Worth to Canal Streets, West Broadway to Lafayette Street.
Ms. Beckelman said she hoped to bring one of those districts to final consideration "in the next couple of months," but noted that the city's current fiscal crisis was cutting deeply into her agency, reducing the staff to 58 people, from 79. "I have to evaluate how much mork it's feasible to do," she said.
She said the disposition of these districts was "important to how we are going to plan the future of lower Manhattan, so it's critical that we do not lose momentum."
There are those in the business community who rather wish that the commission would lose some momentum, at least when it comes to districts.
"In many districts -- and TriBeCa is one of them -- there are many buildings that were never particularly noteworthy in the first place," said Dr. Barbara L. Christen, president of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association.
"In a situation where business is so critical," she said, "to constrain these owners from altering buildings to meet the needs of business is both unwise to the community, from an economic point of view, and unfair to the owner of the building. We would much prefer to see landmarking and historic designations done on a building-by-building basis."
One local owner and real-estate broker sees both benefits and disadvantages. "In the short term, I think landmarking is going to depress property values," said Jonathan Chodosh, of Chodosh Realty Services. "To make an application to the Buildings Department is difficult enough itself. When it has to go through the landmarks commission, too, that creates another layer of approval. Sometimes, that's pretty simple, but sometimes, it's pretty expensive."
"That expense, by definition, depresses the market value of the property," he said. "If you had a store and were to make significant changes to accommodate a new use, you could have a delay that approaches several months. That can kill deals. Both as a broker and owner, I have some fears."
Having said that, he continued: "I'm completely in favor of protection for these buildings. In the long term, I'm very positive about the landmarking of the district. Just from a pure economic model of supply and demand, when you limit a supply of a particular product, assuming that demand increases, you'll have an increase in property values."
A key player in the neighborhood these days is the actor Robert De Niro. With other investors, he converted the eight-story Martinson Coffee building into the TriBeCa Film Center, which opened in 1990.
"Bob is very much in favor of the district," said Peter Rosenthal, director of finance at the Film Center, who may also serve as the liaison to the landmarks commission. "He had this thing of having the TriBeCa look. Even the graffiti on the side of the building was never touched, because that's what buildings are like down here. We bent over backwards in everything we did. We didn't even put satellite dishes on the roof."
Mr. De Niro also owns the vacant lot immediately to the north of the Film Center. "Several things" are under consideration for that site, Mr. Rosenthal said, but nothing is likely to happen for a few years.
TWO blocks south, over the sound of sunflower seeds being roasted at the Bazzini plant, Mr. Damato said: "We had, pretty much from the beginning, supported the idea of a district. I think, in the long term, it enhances property values."
But, of course, rising property values play havoc with manufacturing operations. While Bazzini plans to keep its gourmet food store and perhaps even some peanut roasting on Greenwich Street, Mr. Damato said, "our main thrust is out of here."
The company has already leased a plant in Wilson, N.C., to see how successful a remote operation could be. "All the indications we've gotten so far are positive," Mr. Damato said.
At the same time, matters are only growing worse in New York City. "My real-estate taxes have gone up $75,000 to $100,000 a year," Mr. Damato said, "and I think the indications are that we are going to see another increase this year. In a sense, the ability to keep the neighborhood in a historic-district mode is dying because of these increases in taxation."
"You can't impose, on a company of our size, a $100,000 increase, with no additional benefits," he said. "You have to sell a lot -- a lot -- of peanuts to add up to $100,000."

CHASING WINTER AWAY
 The 1991 Mixed Morris Ale is not a thirst quencher but a whirlwind tour of Fairfield County by the Mianus River Morris Dancers today from 10:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. The group of amateurs was formed at Greenwich High School in the mid-1970's, and members continue to dance for fun at art and folk festivals all over New England.
 It is called mixed because it departs from the all-male tradition in England, where Morris dancing originated in the 14th century. Just as they did then, Morris dancers wear lots of tinkling bells and fluttering ribbons; they clash sticks and wave large kerchiefs to wake up the earth and chase winter away. 
 The ale in the title refers to the old English ale-drinking festivals at which the Morris dancers were rewarded with brimming tankards. There seems to be no consensus on the origin of the name Morris. Some people say that it comes from Moorish, and that the dance derived from a dance with castanets, called morys. In any case, it is practiced by dedicated groups in Britain and the United States, and the Mianus dancers will send contingents to be seen at the following times and places today:
 Wilton Center, 10:30 A.M.; Cannondale Village, 12:45 P.M.; West Redding, Green Thumb Garden Center, 10:30 A.M. Ridgefield, Ballard Park, 1 P.M.; Keeler Tavern, 2:15 P.M.; Norwalk, Silvermine Tavern, 1:15 P.M.; Maritime Center, 2:15 P.M.; Stamford, Cove Island Park, 1 P.M.; Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 2:15 P.M.; Greenwich, Roger Sherman Baldwin Park, 2:45 P.M.; Grand Finale, 100 dancers, Greenwich Common soccer field, 4 to 5:30 P.M.
 
OUTDOOR ART SHOW
 The Pinckney Park Outdoor Art Show, in progress today from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. along the Five Mile River in Rowayton, an enclave at the southern tip of Norwalk, is a family affair that attracts people from all of Fairfield County. Paintings, prints, sculpture and crafts will be for sale against a background of boats plying the river or docked alongside. Picnics may be brought from home or bought from an assortment prepared by members of local churches.
 Children's diversions include face painting, origami, wire sculpturing, ceramic-mug decorating and plate designing. For more information, call the Rowayton Arts Center, organizers of the show, at 866-2744.
 
'POISON' CONTROVERSY
 Real Art Ways and Cinestudio of Trinity College will show Todd Haynes highly controversial film "Poison" Wednesday at 7:30 P.M. in the Cinestudio theater at the college in Hartford. Admission to the benefit performance for Real Art Ways will be $10; tickets may be reserved by calling 232-1006.
 The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival in January, and has been seen in art theaters around the country. Due to its limited release it is unrated. It was produced with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and its theme of violence and deviant behavior has generated protest from conservative groups.
 Additional screenings are scheduled Thursday and Friday at 7:30 P.M. for which admission will be $3 at the door.
 
'LEGEND OF JOHN BROWN' <>
 Jacob Lawrence, a pre-eminent black American painter, did a series of 22 gouaches on paper nearly 50 years ago that were acquired by the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1955. The works, "The Legend of John Brown," were in such demand for exhibition by other institutions that by 1974 they were deemed too fragile to travel.
 Signed prints, made in a limited edition by the artist and the design firm of Ives-Sillman of New Haven, are now on view at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford through July 14.
 The 74-year-old Mr. Lawrence grew up in Harlem and devoted much of his time to painting a visual history of freedom fighters, including Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. The John Brown series traces the evolution of Brown's forces, the fierce battles up to and including Harper's Ferry, his trial and conviction, and his lifeless body on the gallows.
 Barbara Hudson, the museum's curator of African-American art, will give a talk about the series at noon on June 13.
 The Atheneum, which opened in 1842, is at 600 Main Street in downtown Hartford. Visiting hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $3.50, $1.50 for students and the elderly, free for children. No admission is charged all day Thursday and from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. Saturday. For more information call 728-2670.
 
TROPICAL FORESTS
 Some 12,000 Indians live in Acre, a section of the Brazilian Amazon Basin where tropical forests survive. An exhibition of photographic portraits, a collection of contemporary crafts, newspaper clippings and elementary school textbooks by Amazonian peoples created for their own children are on display through Jan. 15 at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven.
 The exhibit is called "The Indians of Acre and the Future of the Amazonian Forest," and the curators are two Yale faculty members, Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology, and Charles L. Remington, professor of biology, in collaboration with Filomena Vagueiro, coordinator of health programs for the Indians of Acre. The show focuses on the plight of the Indians in a threatened ecosystem as they attempt to deflect attacks on their existence by powerful economic and political forces.
 A second exhibition at the museum contains examples of Taino zemis sculptures. The images of deities and departed spirits of relatives, carved in wood, stone, bone and shell decorated with gold leaf, were the work of the Taino Indians of what is now Haiti. Columbus encountered them on his voyage to the New World, and commissioned Ramon Pane, a friar, to study them and submit a report on their religion.
 Finally, weather watchers will be interested in "The Connecticut Tornadoes of July 10, 1989," a tracking of the storm that devastated a swath of territory from Millerton, N. Y. to Branford. Hail patterns within a 60,000-foot-high cloud are among the research data assembled.
 The museum, at 170 Whitney Avenue, is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday through Saturday and noon to 5 P.M. on Sunday. Admission is $2, $1.50 for students and the elderly, $1 for children. Call 432-5050 or 432-5799 for more information.

HEADLINE: Jackson Outlines a Plan For Affordable Housing

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: RYE BROOK

 BODY:
THE Rev. Jesse Jackson, accusing the Bush Administration of creating and then ignoring a nationwide homeless problem, called last week for the use of public and private pension funds to build affordable housing.
Mr. Jackson, speaking to 1,100 members of Westchester organizations at the sixth annual "Hope for the Homeless" dinner, said there was "no better use of the workers' money" than to build such housing, "so that people might be able to work their way out of the recession rather than 'welfare' their way into despair and more homelessness." 
 In an hourlong address Tuesday night at the Rye Town Hilton here, Mr. Jackson told church leaders, social workers and others helping the county's homeless that he favored the formation of what he described as an American Investment Bank. It would be, he said, "like a domestic World Bank that could use pension funds the way" such funds were used to "bail out New York City."
Municipal and teacher pension funds invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds in the mid-1970's to help save the city from bankruptcy. It was one of the earliest such social investments by public pension funds.
Mr. Jackson, whose strong showing in the 1988 Presidential primary campaign confirmed his position as a national political figure, devoted a large part of his speech to attacking the Reagan and Bush Administrations. He accused them of slashing Government support for affordable housing and then ignoring what he said was its consequence, the homeless crisis.
"Homelessness is increasing," he said, adding that it would continue to worsen until appropriate housing was built. "We have 900 big American public pension funds and there are $2 trillion in private pension funds. We could take 10 percent of the public funds over 10 years, Government secured -- not a grant or a loan, just secured -- and target it for affordable housing.
"Building affordable housing is profitable and morally right. It's a good use of the workers' money because they need the housing and the jobs. Putting people back to work generates revenue, and when you generate revenue, people are able to pay their taxes."
Kara Benorth, a spokeswoman for County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, an honorary co-sponsor of the dinner, said Mr. O'Rourke had no comment on Mr. Jackson's proposal except to "point out that in Westchester County affordable housing is not a matter of money but where to put it," a reference to community resistance.
Mr. Jackson described his plan only briefly before the enthusiastic audience at the dinner, but he had provided more details at an earlier news conference here, while also dodging questions about his own political plans.
 
The 'Moral Center' of Politics
 He made several references to his speaking for the "moral center" of the nation's political spectrum.
"The political mainstream is 'win and get re-elected at almost all costs,' " he said. "The moral mainstream is assessing right and wrong. The challenge of our society now is to move toward the center, the moral center."
Mr. Jackson was critical of both major political parties, saying "they are beginning to look like one party with two names." Mr. Jackson has quarreled with the Democratic Leadership Council, which did not invite him to speak at its recent meeting in Cleveland.
He has been considered the principal standard-bearer for the party's left, an association he may be seeking to replace by focusing on what he called the moral center. Mr. Jackson has consistently said he would decide sometime this fall whether to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination for a third time.
Speaking in Westchester about homelessness, Mr. Jackson was confronting a county whose homeless population stood at 4,400 in April, down only slightly from 4,500 a year ago. It is the highest per capita rate in the state and, Government experts say, one of the highest in the country.
 
Other Economic Hardships
 The lack of affordable housing in the county has combined with increasing unemployment and other recession-driven economic hardships to add new homeless families to the rolls even as government and private organizations, learning from experience, make inroads into the problem.
Where last year 66 homeless Westchester families were housed in motels in Putnam, Dutchess and other suburban counties, only seven families are outside Westchester today; they are scheduled to be returned to the county this summer, after school ends. The county, in partnership with nonprofit agencies, has created more than 200 emergency apartments for the homeless, reducing the number living in motels to 343 families, compared with 532 a year ago.
One example of the partnership is the Westhab Family Center in Elmsford, formerly the Elmsford Motor Lodge and before that the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge. There, potential entrants are interviewed and tested to determine how much help they will need from Westhab, a nonprofit social agency that is renovating the building so that residents can get hot meals without using hazardous cooking devices in their rooms.
A similar screening process for single homeless men and women at the County Airport shelter in Harrison has sharply reduced the number of applicants since its introduction two years ago.
 
Two Success Stories
 Westhab has hired 30 staff members to help in the transition at the 80-room Elmsford center. One of them is DeLois Haughton, a social worker who was homeless two years ago. Ms. Haughton and Joyce Bizzell, another formerly homeless person, were singled out for their achievements at the Rye Town Hotel dinner.
The dinner, the largest one held so far, was organized by the Rev. Peter Larom, rector of Grace Episcopal Churh in White Plains, with a dozen other nongovernmental agencies devoted to serving the needs of the homeless. It was "more a consensus-raiser than a fund-raiser," said Mr. Larom, adding that 300 had to be turned away this year from the $55-a-plate event.
In its first year, the dinner drew 500 patrons and raised $20,000. It has come to represent one of the best attended functions in the county, last year attracting 1,000 guests and raising $100,000, in dinner tickets and contributions. The contributions at last week's dinner have not yet been totaled.
The audiences represent employees, officials and volunteers from private nonprofit agencies providing a variety of services. One group, a coalition of churches and synagogues, distributes clothing and food to the homeless; others develop housing, through low-cost construction or renovation. Still others provide furniture, counseling or job-placement assistance to the homeless.
"Some good things are happening," Mr. Larom said. "Bringing people back into the county, de-emphasizing motels and hotels and doing more with transitional and emergency facilities.
"What we need now are more advocates for the homeless, people who will take seriously the need for low-income housing," he said, adding that local governments "are not happy about accepting such housing."

HEADLINE: DEER ON YOUR DOORSTEP

 BODY:
Funny, while the recession leaves thin pickings for us bipeds, the Bambi boomers are moving into the kind of suburban neighborhods we can't afford anymore. They're helping themselves to such gourmet delights as sprinkler-fed yews, just as many of the Third Avenue watering holes, where we once grazed, are being shut down. And they don't even have Gold Cards.
While cows and monkeys can practically vote in India, we Americans don't want to share the spoils. Horton's point was well taken: ". . . it will be necessary to come to terms and attempt graceful accommodation with deer and other wildlife that want to share space with an expanding human population."

400 People Stage A Funeral March To Protest Layoffs

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt.

 BODY:
More than 400 people rallied on the Middlebury College campus Friday afternoon to protest recent staff cuts and what faculty members called the "Gestapo-like tactics" used in making them. The rally coincided with the arrival on campus of college trustees for commencement weekend.
The demonstrators started with a funeral march of black-clad figures in white face and ended with a mimed skit depicting the execution of two staff members. In between, speakers paid tribute to those who were dismissed. 
 "We gather to honor the 17 persons who lost their jobs last week," said Pamela McClain, an assistant in the library who organized the rally. "We gather to express concern for the way in which they were fired."
College employees say, and college administrators confirm, that on the morning of May 14, 17 staff members were called from their offices and driven individually across campus by their supervisors to a building where they were told that they were being dismissed, handed a packet of outplacement information and forbidden to return to their offices during working hours.
 
'We Were All Dazed'
 "My supervisor, who was kind about it, told me to get my coat and purse and then he drove me over to the Hadley barn," said one 38-year veteran of Middlebury who asked not to be identified. "When I got there, other people were already there. We were all in a state of shock. They introduced us one by one to the outplacement counselor. Then my boss left. We were all dazed."
Timothy Light, Middlebury's president, said the cuts in "nonessential staff" were required to help address a $2.8 million deficit -- a result, he said, of flat income and rising costs aggravated by the debt service on some newly constructed buildings.
Large tuition increases are no longer an acceptable answer to the deficit in a faltering economy, Mr. Light said, noting that Middlebury's comprehensive fee jumped from $6,900 in 1980 to $20,000 in 1990. "People just won't pay it anymore," he said.
Critics, however, dispute the need to dismiss staff members -- most of whom, they note, are over age 55, women or both -- and the way the dismissals were handled. They charge, for example, that the administration ignored the Staff Council, an 11-member advisory board representing the college's 700 staff members, which offered Mr. Light alternative methods of budget reduction, including early-retirement incentives and shortened work years.
 
'It's Hit This Place Like a Bomb'
 "It's a small community, and it's hit this place like a bomb," said Bruce Peterson, a mathematics professor and former provost and vice president for academic affairs. "We believe there is no real reason that the college has to do this in this harsh a fashion.
"There is a deficit," he added, "but there is no financial crisis. A college doesn't operate the way other businesses do. All they need to do is increase the payout from the endowment by $1 million for a year or two. It's perfectly possible to do that by a simple vote of the board."
Middlebury's endowment exceeds $200 million.
The chairman of the board of trustees, Milton Petersen, who stood on the sidelines throughout the rally on Friday, said the trustees did not intend to comment on the layoffs.
"This is administrative," Mr. Petersen said. "We did the budget. It would not be smart for me or other members of the board to comment."
Mr. Light said the college would continue to pay the workers' salaries and benefits as long as they cooperated with the outplacement service by meeting with a counselor once a week.
 
A Petition Drive
 The handling of the dismissals was defended by the Chicago-based outplacement service, Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
"We wanted to reassure them and give them practical advice about their futures as quickly as possible and to do it in a place where they could have some privacy," said Stanley Kemmerer, the counselor assigned to Middlebury. "We find that especially in a small community, the grapevine goes into action very quickly. Sometimes people's first reaction is not the reaction that will best help them get a new job."
The faculty's reaction was to start a petition denouncing the college's "Gestapo-like tactics." So far, more than 220 students and faculty and staff members have signed the petition, which demands "a full and public apology to the Middlebury community for the reprehensible manner in which our colleagues have been treated."
Mr. Light acknowledged the petitions in a memo to faculty and staff members dated Friday. "Options are now being prepared," he wrote, "so that the individuals affected by the terminations may, if they choose, request an alternative to outplacement. Consideration for the future of the individuals will be paramount in these deliberations."
In an interview, Mr. Light defended his actions, saying: "My experience is that you can't ask a large group to make difficult decisions. Inevitably, the decisions end up being postponed." Instead, he said, the decisions about cuts were made by him on the recommendation of a four-member Budget and Personnel Review Committee, comprising senior administrators.
"The senior staff has the best overview of the institution," Mr. Light said, "and we were the right people to make the decisions."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
From Geo, an Aptly Named Convertible

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
It will come as no surprise that driving in New York is onerous. Defiant pedestrians cross anywhere and anytime. Trucks and taxis own the streets. Bicycle messengers, trying to stave off extinction by the fax machine, seem to seek it in daredevil dashes. Traffic crawls or it races and there is nothing in between.
Well, there is something. There is parking, and that is an endeavor even more difficult than driving, particularly if you don't care to spend $20 or more for an hour in a garage. 
 New York does have a fair number of free spots at the curb, but they are at an understandable premium. And, like drivers in cities everywhere, Manhattan motorists are constantly circling and searching, looking for a place to land.
Unfortunately, when they find one, they are often less than charitable toward their still-cruising neighbors. Indeed, they seem to delight in leaving just slightly less than a car-length's space between their automobile and the next, creating a maddening series of pockets into which only a pocket-size car will fit.
Happily, there is such a vehicle, aptly named the Metro. That is not the news, of course. Metros have been around for a while, a product of Geo, the Chevrolet division that since 1989 has marketed inexpensive and occasionally sporty metal from Isuzu, Toyota and Suzuki.
No, the news is that this half-a-car, this wonderful little LSi model that squeezes into nonspaces, is also a convertible, the least expensive ragtop sold in this country.
It is made by Suzuki in Kosai, Japan, and its presence means that Geo now offers a full line of "entry-level" Metros, ranging downward through the standard sedan to the XFi coupe, whose fuel efficiency is rated at 53 miles per gallon, city, and 58 highway.
The new arrival joins the LSi coupe at the head of Metro's front-wheel-drive line. Neither of the cars gets quite the mileage of the XFi, which is geared specifically for thrift, but then neither is a thoroughly plain-jane econobox, either.
The LSi, like the rest of the Metro line, comes with a standard five-speed stick, but a three-speed automatic is available, as are power brakes, with disks up front and drums in the rear.
The convertible adds a front console to the LSi's standard equipment, and there are new separate headrests for the newly designed front seats. In the rear, headrests are still built into the seatbacks, although any headrests at all seem academic. You wouldn't want to put friends back there, and even hitchhikers deserve better.
In fact, the car is rated to carry less than 400 pounds. With occupants of average size up front, capacity in back diminishes to a couple of bags of weight-watcher groceries.
Still, the little car has its charm. There is, foremost, its convertible top and its cuteness. The drop-tops are available in yellow, red, white and blue, and the body-colored bumpers blend into the rounded nose, which sweeps into the windshield in an aerodynamic exercise that translates into quiet travel as well as economy.
The tester was yellow, and if performance was problematical, it was compensated by the knowledge that a buyer would be breezing along in a rakish bauble costing only $9,700 or so.
With a lot of cars, too, waving festive paint is a good way to attract unwelcome attention from a trooper who is bored stiff. But driving a Metro probably can save even a leadfoot's license.
Power, such as it is, comes from an aluminum engine whose three cylinders add up to a mere liter of displacement. Fuel injection and a single overhead camshaft elicit 55 horsepower which, to put it mildly, makes the LSi something short of a performance vehicle.
Zero-to-60 acceleration takes more than 13 seconds, and while patience can nudge the needle slightly above the 90 mark, that is faster than the car (or you) really want to go.
The manual top works easily with a single handle at the center of the windshield, and the fact that the car works so well as a convertible is no fluke. Suzuki had it in mind all along, and that made it easier to reinforce the body when it was time for the coupe to doff its roof.
All the same, this is not a car without its shakes and quivers, and a buyer probably isn't going to want to use it for long trips or hurl it into curves for the sheer fun of it, either.
 The new Metro is a vehicle that simply fits where others won't and that makes a slow trip enjoyable. If you live or drive in the city, it might be worth considering. And, certainly, it would be perfect for the guy in a story told to me by a friend who swears it's true.
A service station on Manhattan's West Side was running a special sale, so the story goes, charging $12.90 for an oil change. It's a big station, so nobody noticed right away, but finally it became apparent that the same car was in for an oil change every day.
Eventually, the attendants confronted the driver, pointing out that his oil was clean enough.
He just grinned. "I know that," he said, "but there's nowhere else that I can park all day for $12.90."

HEADLINE: Too Many People and Not Enough Places to Go

BYLINE: By PETER C. T. ELSWORTH

 BODY:
As Memorial Day arrives and the children are let out of school, attention turns to the coveted summer getaway. But the hottest travel destinations are swarming with tourists. Getting away from the crowds has become a mission impossible. And that's not the only price society is paying for the explosion in world travel.
There is the sewage backup into the Mediterranean to consider and the desiccation of East African game parks because of heavy tourist traffic. Plan on venturing into the central valley of the Yosemite National Park in July or August? Your experience may be more akin to a stroll down Madison Avenue during lunch hour. 
 The solution is simple, but hardly welcome: restricting access. Some United States national parks have already been forced to close temporarily during the day to allow crowds to thin. And such closures are likely to become more widespread.
"It used to be that if one area was built up, you could always move on to somewhere else," said Martin Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour Operators in London. "But increasingly we are not in a position to escape the mess we've created."
The trend is playing into the hands of theme park owners. Disney World, for one, attracted more people than Britain last year. Last year, 28.5 million visited the park, making it the fourth-largest tourist destination after France, the United States and Spain. Many vacationers figure they can escape pollution, if not the crowds, yet get an enriching experience in Disney's ersatz foreign lands.
The hotel industry has taken some pointers from Disney. To please -- and control -- the dense crowds, hoteliers and resort operators have learned how to simulate cultural experiences. A Calypso band evokes the spirit of the Caribbean, flamenco dancers give guests a taste of Spain. The gimmicks, used perhaps most heavily in the country of origin, lead some to question the authenticity of any travel.
By at least one measure, tourism is the world's largest industry. While it is the third-largest household expenditure after food and housing in most industrial nations, it employs more people than any other single industrial sector, according to figures compiled by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates.
And it is growing fast. The industry, which includes spending on lodging, transportation and restaurants, has an infrastructure worth $3 trillion, estimates WEFA. In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, the industry invested nearly $360 billion in new structures and capital equipment, up from $276 billion in 1987, according to WEFA.
Today, the industry employs 112 million people, or one out of every 15 workers worldwide, and is expected to maintain a healthy 8.7 percent growth rate through 1992. The potential is clearly enormous, considering that only about 10 percent of all Americans hold passports.
The growth is remarkable for an industry that is 40 years old. Before World War II, traveling for pleasure was the province of the rich, a characteristic that is still played up in advertisements. But improved standards of living and the ready availability of flights have enabled more people to indulge. "The growth in tourism is a function of increased disposable income and increased leisure time," said Paul Turk, an analyst at Avmark, an air travel consulting company in Washington.
The trouble is, too many people are converging on too few places. More than 425 million people -- about 10 percent of the world's population -- traveled from one country to another in 1989, according to the World Tourist Organization of the United Nations. Mr. Brackenbury estimates that half the world's population will be traveling by the year 2000.
That kind of traffic has helped defeat an essential purpose of travel. "Once tourists begin to show up, it immediately changes the character of the place and the original experience is gone," said Douglas Frechtling, associate professor of tourism at George Washington University. "From then on, it's just a matter of degree."
For example, the south of France, which millions of tourists visit every summer, has adjusted after a few disastrous years, when its infrastructure sagged under the strain and sewage overflowed into the once-azure sea. Now, the problem is sewage discharged from a growing fleet of pleasure boats, Mr. Brackenbury said.
The east coast of Spain, known affectionately as the Costa Concrete in honor of its tourist sprawl, has also cleaned up its act. Benidorm, long considered the overbuilt nadir of the Spanish tourist industry, has won several awards for the cleanliness of its beaches. Spain derives 25 percent of its export earnings from tourism, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a consulting group in London.
But the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea has never gotten over the publicity surrounding the sudden growth of brown algae in 1989. "It was like swimming in brown mucous, not exactly anyone's idea of holiday pleasure," said Mr. Brackenbury.
The problems of pollution are most noticeable at places whose draw is their supposed pristine condition. The Grand Canyon has banned small planes from flying below the canyon rim, but the local airport is still the third busiest in Arizona, after Phoenix and Tucson. And at the height of the summer, about a quarter of a million people crowd onto the floor of the Yosemite Valley every day. Duncan Morrow of the National Park Service said he sees more parks closing for increased periods, waiting for their parking lots to empty.
Overseas, the garbage tossed out in the foothills of the Himalayas by tourists has become legendary. And some of the East African game parks are being turned into dust bowls by the tourists ferried around in four-wheel drive vehicles. "You think you're seeing the animals in the wild, but by definition you're not because tourists are looking at them," said Dr. Frechtling.
Circumstances like the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest, the depletion of the ozone layer and the oil spill in Alaska have driven home the fragile state of the world, sensitizing many to the adverse cultural, social and physical effects of tourism, he added.
But even those places that have tried to control the growth of tourism, the demand to keep masses of people content in a confined area inevitably leads to an experience that is somewhat manufactured. So why not, the thinking goes, have an entirely manufactured experience. "In a sense, the Montmartre experience is in the eye of the beholder," said Dr. Frechtling.
Disney argues that in offering a small slice of a foreign culture, it will whet people's appetites for travel. Yet spending two weeks in Maui hardly represents a close encounter with traditional Hawaiian culture.
"The difference is that it's not in a compact area and not operated by one company," said Dr. Frechtling. "The trick is to manage large numbers of people while giving them a quality experience that they will treasure when they go home. Disney does that very well."

 
 
AMERICANS ARE STAYING TOO CLOSE TO HOME
 The crowds at Yosemite might be worse than usual this summer. That is the natural conclusion to be drawn from a recent survey of Americans' travel plans.
According to the study, released last week by the United States Travel Data Center, a Washington-based consulting firm, Americans will make almost as many trips this summer as the nearly 326 million trips 100 or more miles from home that they took last summer. The recession -- and, to a lesser extent, safety concerns lingering from the war in the Middle East -- will keep people closer to home this season and force them to cut corners in other ways. More people are driving instead of flying, taking shorter vacations and staying with friends and relatives rather than in hotels, concluded the study, which is based on interviews conducted with 4,500 Americans over three months.
International travel fell during the war, helping push International Leisure Group, a giant British holiday tour company, as well as Eastern Airlines into bankruptcy. While the war victory initially spurred Americans' travel plans, the recession quickly cooled their interest, according to separate surveys by the consulting firm of D. K. Shifflet & Associates in McLean, Va. In March, in the wake of the war, 76 percent of the 300 people interviewed said they planned to take at least one trip in the next six months, up sharply from 51 percent in February. But by April, that figure fell to 58 percent.
"The economy has been, in terms of domestic travel, a far greater factor than the war," said Richard Hebert, a spokesman at the American Automobile Association. "Things got better in April, but the feeling is things didn't get better enough."
In Hawaii, for example, incoming tourist traffic declined by 12 percent in April from a year ago, according to Gene Cotter of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. That is a big deal for a state that earned 40 percent of its gross national product last year from its seven million tourists. "It's recession-related and war-related, but probably more on the recession side," Mr. Cotter said.

Yosemite National Park: On an average day in July and August, nearly a quarter of a million people pour onto the floor of the Yosemite Valley, an area of only about seven square miles. Congestion at the nation's parks has become so severe that several have been forced to close down for limited periods and more closures are predicted in the future. Fearing the worst, the National Park Service is restricting access to the early-morning celebration of the 50th anniversary of Mount Rushmore National Monument. Only the first 2,000 people will be admitted.
 
Adriatic Sea: At the height of the 1989 summer tourist season, a disgusting brown algae, in some places a few feet thick, proliferated across the surface of the Adriatic Sea adjacent to the Italian coast. Pollution was determined to be the cause, and tourism to the area is still only half what it was in 1988. The same year, a number of English tourists contracted typhoid fever from the drinking water at a Spanish resort. None died, but the British press played up the incident, causing droves of tourists to cancel their holidays. Tourism to the area has since recovered.
 
Amboseli National Park: An elephant shambles along in front of camera-toting big game tourists at Amboseli National Park in Kenya. About 200,000 tourists pour into the park every year and most only want the chance to get a quick shot of a lion or an elephant in the wild. But in the spirit of keeping the park wild for tourists, the park management has kept out poachers and allowed nature to take its course. The trouble is, the elephants have proliferated to the point where they are tearing the park apart.

Gorbachev's Latest Plan Leaves Economists Unimpressed
 

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he badly needs credits from the West for his latest reform plan to work. But that request comes at a time when the West is hard pressed for the cash. No matter. To get the money, Mr. Gorbachev wants to take his flip charts to the July economic summit meeting of industrialized countries in London. But the bets are that if he goes, he won't come back with much. Western economists looking at the latest plan are not impressed. "It's anarchic," said Marshall Goldman of Harvard University. "There is no provision for a convertible ruble. And Gorbachev, as late as November, did not support private property." The plan allows state-owned enterprises to sell 10 percent of their goods on the open market. Not good enough. "Since November 1989, I counted eight reform plans," said Mr. Goldman. Most were abandoned. "Too bad the Soviet Union can't produce products the way it produces plans," he said.

A Tower of Power for Sony?
 
Few buildings convey corporate power as convincingly as A.T.& T.'s granite-clad headquarters in Manhattan. It was completed in 1983, weeks before the telephone monopoly was broken up by the government. Trouble is, while the breakup made the American Telegraph and Telephone Company smaller -- it shed the eight "baby bells" -- the size of the building remained the same. Now, A.T.& T. is planning to lease its tower to the Sony Corporation. And Sony will get an option to buy it. While the building may be too expensive for A.T.& T., Sony is flush with cash. Sales were up 25 percent for the year, and profits climbed 13.7 percent, it reported last week.
 
A Trade Pact on the Fast Track
 
It was a big victory for the Administration. The House and Senate approved a renewal of the fast-track legislation Mr. Bush so anxiously sought. The legislation gives the Administration the power to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico and present it to Congress for approval with a simple yea or nay vote. Congress cannot haggle over the fine points. The deal could be completed within a year. "I couldn't be more pleased," Mr. Bush said.
 
Buying Jet Parts from Japan . . .
In times past, Boeing's main suppliers were American. That is changing. The Boeing Commercial Airplane Company signed an agreement last week with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries to help it build major parts of the 777, its newest twinjet. Boeing's new partners will make 20 percent of the plane and shoulder some of the investment risk. But eyebrows are being raised. With commercial aviation targeted for growth by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Investment, is Boeing about to create its newest rivals? No, says Boeing. It will only show its partners plans for the parts they actually build. But what will the partners show each other?
 
. . . and Selling G.M. There
 
Toyota and the General Motors Corporation teamed up once before. Now, if the rumors are true, they will do it again. Toyota is thinking about selling G.M.'s cars in Japan through its dealer outlets. G.M. needs the help, too. Last year, it sold just 8,513 cars in Japan -- not many more than its sells on a good day at home.
 
Trading Criticisms on Trade
 
Japan and the United States have been arguing about trade for decades. Last week, they gave each other report cards, and both received failing grades. Japan's negotiators complained that American companies pay their chief executives too much and that the Federal budget deficit is still too high. Japan begrudgingly gave credit to the United States for getting serious about education. America's negotiators were also upset. Japan is still a closed market, they said, with companies bound to each other through ties of ownership and seats on each other's boards of directors. But the Americans admitted that Japan has changed some of its distribution system. Both opinions have merit. But it is hard to figure out what some of these issues have to do with trade.
 
A Joint Venture by Rivals
 
Last week, when Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Company bought a German drug company, Woelm Pharma G.m.b.H., a subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, for $90 million, it showed that rivals at home can be strategic partners abroad. They bought Woelm in a 50-50 joint venture they call the Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Company. (How will they fit that on the bottle?) The new acquisition will give the two companies access to Europe's $5 billion over-the-counter market. And they will get European manufacturing capacity, too. Woelm also has a distribution network that could help the companies push their way into Europe. But perhaps most important, by acquiring Woelm they now have expertise in getting new drugs past Europe's regulators, a definite advantage. Both companies are planning to sell over-the-counter versions of their prescription drugs there. More European acquisitions by the joint venture may be on the horizon. A spokesman said they are "studying additional opportunities."
 
 
 
COMPANIES


A Fallen Insurer Is on the Block
 
How much is a failed insurance company worth? That is what the regulators in California want to know. Last week, they put the assets of Executive Life Insurance Company on the block. The regulators, who seized the company last month after it defaulted on its portfolio of high-yield "junk bonds," are proposing to divide Executive Life into two units, each to be sold separately. One unit would include the policies along with some of the bonds. The other would get the leftover assets, which the buyer could sell. Altus Finance, the investment arm of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, has stepped forward to examine the books. One problem the regulators still have not solved: Executive Life owes $643 million in back taxes.
 
Basic Research at Microsoft
 
William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, the nation's largest publisher of personal computer software, thinks his company could get by without doing any research at all. Just buy what it needs from innovative software companies and university research labs. Still, it can't take chances. Microsoft announced it will open a basic research center at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., to develop software to manipulate images, understand human speech and -- yes -- help scientists design new software. Where will Microsoft get its scientists? From rivals like I.B.M. The lab is not intended to become huge. Microsoft will spend just $10 million a year.
 
Stocks Around the Clock
 
The Big Board's volume is up, but it has been losing market share to regional and even foreign stock exchanges, some of which trade 24 hours a day. So the Big Board petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to let it stay open later. Last week the S.E.C. agreed. In a phase-in program, the Big Board will take a slow stroll to a 24-hour trading day. Starting June 13, the 9:30 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. trading day will be extended to 5 P.M. for individual stocks and 5:15 P.M. for large baskets of stocks. Within a decade, the Big Board will be open around the clock. The impact of the new rules "will be felt around the world," said Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C.
 
More Paring at Apple
 
For Apple Computer Inc., the future is clear. The company must increase its market share and pare its costs. Apple already cut the prices of the Macintosh. Sales jumped. Now comes the hard part: trimming its work force by 10 percent.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Good News and a Dash of Salt
 
At first glance, more good news. The sale of durable goods -- those big ticket items that are supposed to outlast their warranties -- grew by 2.9 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department. It was the first increase of the year. But sales were down in one crucial category -- nondefense capital goods. Sales of trucks, trains and machine tools fell by 10.3 percent, a signal that the nation's factories are not investing. "That's a bad sign," said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to DRI Inc., an economic consulting firm. "You can't take these numbers as evidence that we've turned the corner."
 
Prepaid Tickets for Speeders?
 
The Texas State Legislature began a debate last week on a novel way to raise revenue. Sell speeding tickets in advance, the proposed bill says. The plan calls for books of five speeding tickets to be sold by the state motor vehicle department for $25. If you get stopped by the police for doing between 55 miles per hour and 70 m.p.h., just give the officer a pre-paid ticket. Nothing goes on your record. But if you get stopped for doing more than 70 m.p.h., the officer gives you the ticket -- the old-fashioned kind. That one goes on your record. The Legislature figures it will raise $100 million a year selling penalties in advance. It could even broaden which penalties are for sale.
 
The Deficit Swells as Taxes Rise
 
Back in 1986, when the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law took effect, the deficit was $221 billion. Much too high. What followed were five years of wrangling and political debate. Then, last fall, Congress and the Administration raised taxes and vowed to cut the deficit. Last week the fruits of their labors were unveiled: a $1.45 trillion budget for 1992 with a 1 percent drop for the military.But the estimated deficit increased to $278.8 billion.

HEADLINE: All About/Automobile Testing;
The Test Track Is King Of the Road No More

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
To the auto makers, a skilled driver sensitive to every nuance of a vehicle's performance is still a valued resource at the proving grounds. But increasingly the leading role in automobile testing is being played by computer experts who generate and interpret data from high-tech wind tunnels, simulators and other stationary testing equipment.
"There's a definite trend toward testing in the laboratory," said Bruce Greene, chief engineer in the Engineering Technology Services group at the Ford Motor Company. "We can have a more controlled environment with more repeatable tests. And it can be done in shorter time." 
 Such gains are increasingly seen as vital competitive advantages. Identifying problems before they are built into full-scale test vehicles, or worse yet, hidden in cars rolling off production lines, can save companies huge sums of money. As a result, auto makers are continuing to invest heavily in testing programs despite the recession that has gripped the industry. Some of the investment is driven by regulation, such as emissions tests and crash testing. Most, however, reflects the closer attention to quality that has been forced on all auto makers by the globalization of their business.
"When any of our plants is launching a new model, the first few vehicles off the line are sent here and run 25,000 miles to check for what we call Category One problems," said Susan M. Cischke, executive engineer at the Chrysler Corporation's proving grounds in Chelsea, Mich. "If we find one, they can't ship any cars until it's corrected. Ten years ago, not starting would be a Category One problem. Now, it's any buzz or squeak."

 
 
The Test Track
Using it Less, Using it Better
 The engineers who run the auto testing programs figure that proving grounds may increasingly be the site for confirming laboratory work rather than doing the bulk of auto testing. Yet no one expects the proving grounds to be replaced completely. It is usually easier and cheaper to add new drivers and even, if necessary, use public roads when needed than to add new laboratory equipment. Ford, for example, has added drivers to keep up with its current mileage and emissions testing needs.
The General Motors Corporation says it has reduced its road testing by about one-third in recent years. "The better that cars get, the harder it is to find defects in road tests," said Fraser Smithson, the engineer in charge of all of the company's proving grounds except the cold-weather testing facility in Kapuskasing, Ontario.
Computers are also being used at some companies to track the actual route of cars on test tracks, providing useful correlations between the subjective observations of drivers and how the car actually performed. Starting last fall, drivers at Ford's desert testing ground in Arizona have been able to communicate directly with engineers in Dearborn, Mich., while running tests on items like brake systems, allowing the remote engineers to ask for adjustments while the test drive is in progress.

 
 
Inside Developments
Wind Tunnels and 'Aeroacoustics'
 The wind tunnel is the single most dramatic and expensive piece of laboratory testing equipment used by auto makers. Today's wind tunnels can re-create climatic conditions ranging from 40 degrees below zero to more than 125 degrees (with floors being made even hotter to simulate desert roads), as well as humidity ranging from 5 to 95 percent.
Aeroacoustics, the study of noises the car's parts make as it travels at various speeds, is another new area for wind tunnel work. State-of-the-art plants, such as the one DSMA International Inc. of Mississauga, Ontario, installed for Honda in Japan last December, can cost upwards of $30 million.
Simulators that replicate durability tests are the most important laboratory technology in the trend to move more track work indoors. Ford, for example, spent $16 million two years ago to install four such systems from MTS Corporation of Minneapolis. Cars that formerly had to be driven for 37 days can now receive a comparable pounding under much more controlled conditions in as little as nine days.
To program the simulator, drivers take the type of vehicle to be tested around the test track, using a battery of sensors attached to various parts of the vehicle to provide a record of the motions the simulator should imitate. Part of the time-saving comes from running the car and truck chassis on the simulators around the clock. But the simulator also saves time by editing out the portions of the test track drive that failed to have a measurable impact on the test vehicle's durability.
Simulators are also used on specific problems. When Chrysler's Jeep Eagle division began two years ago to work on installing airbags in the ZJ model it plans to introduce next spring, one of the first jobs was to develop simulations of the unusual range of jolts and bumps the off-road vehicle might encounter. Jeep needed a new airbag system that would not inflate in a variety of predictable uses, like bouncing over rocky terrain, jerking on straps when pulling another vehicle out of a ditch or hitting a curb while plowing snow. But it did not want to destroy hundreds of vehicles developing it.
One important area of simulator development has been what MTS calls "remote parameter control" -- the ability to use a combination of sensors and software to depict accurately what is happening at the parts of the vehicle under maximum stress, especially when it is inconvenient or impossible to mount sensors directly on those parts.

 
 
Independent Testing
Head-On Crashes, Foreign Investment
 Auto makers do most auto testing, but independent testing facilities have played an important role for decades. One major market for the independents has been performing tests for foreign manufacturers that must prove they are meeting American safety, mileage and emissions standards.
The largest independent site by most measures is the Transportation Research Center in East Liberty, Ohio, 45 miles northwest of Columbus. Built by the state of Ohio in the early 1970's for $30 million, it was sold to Honda in part to encourage that company's expansion in Ohio during the 1980's.
The 7,500-acre site has the world's only facility for performing crash tests by slamming two vehicles into each other. Honda has continued to let the site run independently but plans to convert part of it to private use. Revenues last year topped $15 million, according to Walter McPherson, the center's director.
Other independents include E.G. & G. Automotive Research Inc., which has plants west of San Antonio, MGA Research Corp., which owns the former American Motors proving ground in Burlington, Wis., the Failure Group, which does safety testing at its track in Phoenix, Smithers Transportation Test Center in Pecos, Tex., and Automotive Testing Labs, which uses the old Studebaker proving ground outside South Bend, Ind.
A major growth area for the independents has been work for auto component companies. The Big Three have sought to reduce costs and engage suppliers in their quality programs by making suppliers responsible for testing subsystems -- and certifying that the systems meet the auto maker's specifications. Many of the suppliers use the independents for such work.

 
 
MEET SID, A DUMMY WITH IMPACT
 Anthropomorphic test devices -- better known as dummies -- have been riding automobiles into walls for decades. The General Motors Corporation led the effort to develop an industry standard known as Hybrid One during the 1960's. G.M. then refined "him" (an average-sized man was the model dummy) into Hybrid Two, which in 1973 became the first dummy to be specified by the Federal Government for automotive testing.
The Hybrid clan, which was designed to test the frontal impact of crashes, now includes individuals ranging from infants to "95th percentile males," which weigh more than 210 pounds and stand (if they could) 6 feet 2 inches.
Based on more detailed information from the study of accident victims, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is sponsoring research on Hybrid 3, whose steel chest mimics the body more closely by exhibiting varying stiffness in different regions of its torso, head, neck and limbs.
Meanwhile, the Hybrids have been joined by the Sids, or side-impact dummies. The N.H.T.S.A. spent most of the 1980's designing the first Sid to measure damage caused by collisions from the side and began requiring its use last year.
By then, G.M. and other industry experts had created a cousin known as BioSid, which provides them with information about how such crashes affect not just the rib cage, but also the neck, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis. European auto makers created a slightly less ambitious improvement dubbed EuroSid.
Last year also saw the merger of Humanetics and Alderson Research Laboratories, the only major American dummy manufacturers, with First Technologies Safety Systems Inc. of Plymouth, Mich., a subsidiary of Britain's First Technologies P.L.C..
Each dummy is a blend of steel, aluminum, and rubber with vinyl skin. The company sells about 250 at an average cost of $30,000.
"The whole trick is to make a dummy that survives a crash yet mimics the human who often doesn't," said Michael Beebe, First Technologies' vice president of engineering. Not only are the dummies too expensive to treat as throwaway items, but each typically goes to work dressed in $100,000 worth of instrumentation.

HEADLINE: Blue Cross Finances: Another View

 BODY:
The April 28 article on the financial crisis of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey ("Blue Cross Struggles to Survive") may need clarification for readers to understand what is really going on.
1. The article says the Blues negotiated hospital discounts averaging 30 percent before they were taken away by the state. 
 The fact is these so-called "discounts" were in effect subsidies to Blue Cross paid by higher rates from the policyholders of commercial insurance companies. The State Commissioners of Health repeatedly allowed Blue Cross to underpay the costs of hospital services for its patients so that the patients with policies from commercial insurance companies had to make up difference.
2. Blue Cross complains that "the stripping of our discount was an invitation to all competitors to come on into the state." What's wrong with putting Blue Cross on a level playing field with commercial insurers?
3. The article conveys that Blue Cross is in deep financial trouble, because it lost so much money being the "insurer of last resort."
In fact, Department of Insurance records show that three-quarters of the Blues' huge losses ($278 million from 1985-88) came from their corporate, for-profit policies, not from their community-rated public policies. Moreover, corporate policyholders have been leaving them in droves because of antiquated policies and poor service.
4. The article fails to mention that Blue Cross has deposited over three-quarters of its tax breaks and hospital subsidies in its corporate, for-profit accounts. This makes the losses in its public policies look much larger than they are, while it covers up some of the losses on the corporate, for-profit side. We are talking here of up to $150 million since 1985 that should be paid back to those small groups and individuals who were forced to pay inflated premiums during those years.
5. The article says that the Blues cannot select their risks as commercial health insurance companies can.
In fact, Department of Insurance records show that over 80 percent of the Blues' business comes from their risk-rated, corporate accounts, just like Prudential or Cigna.
Blue Cross has systematically reduced its nonprofit, public role as the insurer of last resort, from about 1.2 million subscribers in 1988 to only 127,000 in 1990. In other words, the Blues are a commercial insurance company in the guise of a public institution, begging for public relief. Prudential must be envious that the Blues can get away with raising an extra $50 million to $100 million at the public trough each year by presenting themselves as a public-service institution that is going bankrupt.
6. The Blues complain that the 3.5 percent subsidy they now get for supposedly being the insurer of last resort is not enough.
Yet under law they can appeal for a larger subsidy any time they want -- if they can prove they need it. In the last 10 years they have not bothered to appeal for a larger subsidy. Apparently they are not confident they can prove their case before the Hospital Rate-Setting Commission.
7. The data in the figures accompanying the article all come from Blue Cross data, rather than from an independent source like the Department of Insurance or academic researchers. These figures do not square with official data in ways that hide or mollify the real situation.
These clarifications paint a rather different and more accurate picture of the New Jersey Blues. It is a once noble institution that has abandoned its public mission and is manipulating the government and the public to get money to cover large losses in its failing commercial business.
New Jersey citizens pay $50 million to $100 million more a year to shore up this badly run business. As if to rub salt in the wound, New Jersey Blue Cross wrote off $150 million for losses last year on bad business ventures, at the very time it is asking the public to pay $200 million out of its hard-earned money.
Citizens and subscribers can do something by making Blue Cross accountable. Our association and affiliated groups led a successful campaign last year to stop the Blues with a court order from discriminating against women and the elderly, and this year we helped keep the premium increase to one-fourth of what Blue Cross claimed it absolutely needed to survive.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Medicine

 BODY:
First of two articles
Nine out of ten Americans believe the nation's health care system should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt. And with good reason. Costs are skyrocketing. Fees appear unfair. And a large segment of the population lacks access to adequate care. 
 The U.S. is the only major industrialized nation where tens of millions go uninsured -- or else cling to unwanted jobs to preserve coverage -- and the elderly sick routinely go bankrupt in order to qualify for public assistance. Even the American Medical Association now admits the system needs overhaul.
Yet the major health insurance proposals now before Congress won't solve these problems because they shrink from the radical reform needed, and there is no certainty that a promised plan from Senate Democratic leaders will do any better.
The major villain in driving up costs is the payment system, which provides no incentive for restraint. Individuals choose their doctors and the doctors choose a course of treatment. But payment is made by an insurance company. Because fees are usually based on services performed, doctors and hospitals win by providing lots of services, needed or not. Because insurance pays most of the bills, patients don't much care what the cost is.
Cost control is also frustrated by the freedom of insurance companies to construct a labyrinth of complicated policies that make comparison shopping virtually impossible. And the policies are carefully tailored to attract only low-risk individuals, leaving others to fend for themselves or else pay exorbitant fees.
The goal of health insurance reform is to provide universal coverage at affordable rates, without driving up costs. But none of the main plans before Congress provide that. All will provide universal access; each provides affordable premiums. But all are unlikely to control costs. Here's why the three main approaches are insufficient:
National Insurance. Under these tax-supported plans, all citizens would be automatically covered. Individuals would choose their own doctors and pay nothing for treatment. Government would pay all the bills, at rates negotiated with doctors and medical institutions, thus controlling costs.
Canada has proved that government-provided health insurance can work -- in Canada. But it's not likely to work as well here. Many experts believe that the discipline of parliamentary government in Canada is better suited to the task of negotiating with medical providers, setting reimbursement rates that carefully balance the needs of patients, taxpayers and providers.
The Canadian system has serious flaws. Canadians can wait months for diagnostic procedures and surgery. Costs are beginning to rise at a rapid clip. And Canadian treatment lags behind the U.S. in technological sophistication.
Employer Mandates. If Congress had to vote today, this option would be the odds-on favorite. Employers, at least big ones, would be required to offer employees comprehensive insurance or else pay a tax based on payrolls. The tax, along with other Government revenues, would be used to open Medicaid to all uninsured individuals, perhaps for a fee based on their income.
The danger of imposing this burden on employers is that it may cause wages to fall and unemployment to rise. The lowest-paid workers would be hardest hit. And employer mandates, alone, don't do anything to control costs.
Refundable Tax Credits. Every American would be required to buy basic coverage from a private insurer and would receive a tax credit to help pay the bill. Individuals too poor to pay much tax would be sent a check.
This plan would achieve universal coverage at equitable fees. And by giving everyone a fixed tax credit, independent of the choice of insurance plan, it would encourage individuals to shop for the best deal. But it would do little to change fee-for-service plans or risk-skimming by insurance companies, thus leaving costs out of control.
Tomorrow: How Congress might achieve it all.

HEADLINE: Who Champions The Working Class?

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is author of "The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st Century Capitalism."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
America must make a vast investment at least $2 trillion in the 1990's -- to prepare our workforce for the next century. If the Democratic Party wants the White House, it should lead the charge. It needs the political equivalent of a warrior like Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf to propose a plan for rebuilding America, as Gen. George Marshall did 44 years ago for rebuilding Western Europe.
American corporations are as competitive as ever. Their share of global exports is about the same as it was 15 years ago, although they're now exporting from factories all over the world. Their foreign operations account for more than $1 trillion in sales annually -- about four times America's total exports. Many of their top executives, engineers, strategists, planners, lawyers and bankers have been reaping a bonanza. 
 But a large portion of the workforce has become less competitive in the last decade and a half. The real wages of nonsupervisory workers (about two-thirds of all wage earners) have plummeted 12 percent, putting them back where they were in the late 1950's, adjusted for inflation.
These disparate trends give the Democrats a natural advantage and should put Republicans on the defensive. After all, Republican economics has been premised on the idea that the fruits of American investment inevitably "trickle down" to enrich the average worker. Thus have low taxes on the wealthy been justified as in the interest of the less affluent; thus has discretionary Federal spending on job training, education and infrastructure been deemed superfluous and cut accordingly.
But within the new global economy, American investments are as likely to "trickle out" to wherever around the globe they can earn the best return. In this respect, there is coming to be no difference between our capital and the capital of any other nation.
The same trends should give Democrats a strong argument for rebuilding the workforce. Global capital will create high-wage jobs in the U.S. only if we can offer skilled workers and a first-class infrastructure. But in the nation's recent misguided efforts to advance U.S. corporations and U.S. investors, we have disinvested in human capital and infrastructure.
We still underfinance Head Start, child nutrition and other pre-school programs; our per pupil spending on kindergarten through grade 12 lags behind that of five other industrialized nations; Federal outlays for worker training have been slashed by 50 percent since 1980, and Federal grants and loans for college students have been cut 13 percent over the decade.
Meanwhile, our spending on infrastructure has fallen by almost a third, resulting in collapsing bridges, crumbling highways, dilapidated subways, overflowing sewers and rush-hour traffic jams extending for miles. Hard-pressed states and localities can't begin to make up the difference.
Where would we find $2 trillion for rebuilding America in the 1990's? A 15 percent a year cut in current and planned military expenditures would yield $450 billion over the decade. A Federal income tax as progressive as it was in 1978 would require the top 10 percent of income earners to pay about $950 billion more than they'll otherwise pay in the 1990's. And by removing the $54,000 cap on income subject to the pension and disability portions of Social Security payroll taxes and treating all Social Security benefits as taxable income (while exempting the poorest fifth of workers and retirees from both taxes), an additional $600 billion could be generated over the decade.
So why are the Democrats so silent? Perhaps because they're cowed by George Bush's approval ratings, fearful of antagonizing corporate fund-raisers, scared of even suggesting that taxes be raised on the wealthy, shackled by new budget rules barring transfers of money from military to domestic needs, afraid of touching sacred cows like Social Security or intimidated by years of Republican harangues against government.
Some Democrats unveil tepid plans to make tiny, symbolic shifts in Mr. Bush's proposed budget. Others fulminate about "protecting American jobs." What do the Democrats stand for? What is Democratic economics? It must be more than budget trivialities and retrograde protectionism.
As the Republicans continue their traditional role of advancing the interests of American corporations and investors, the Democrats must revive their traditional role of representing the little guy.
Even at the very height of the President's popularity, the Democrats have an extraordinary opportunity.

HEADLINE: Saudi Clergy and Scholars Petition for Change

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24

 BODY:
A group of religious scholars and members of the Muslim clergy have presented King Fahd with a petition demanding the creation of an often-promised consultative council through which Saudis who are not members of the royal family could participate in governing.
A copy of the petition bears the signatures of scores of men who appear to come largely from the religious and academic establishment, which is profoundly fundamentalist. The petitioners say the document was signed by hundreds of university professors and religious scholars. 
 Several Saudis noted that religious leaders have always enjoyed an easy access to the King and the rest of the Saudi royal family. They said what was notable in the petition was the call for wider representation, an end to corruption and the protection of human rights. Such demands are usually associated with Saudi liberals.
The petitioners call upon the King to install a consultative council of "completely independent" advisers known for their integrity and expertise, who should "not be subjected to any pressure" as they perform their functions.
Although they address the King as the nation's father or guardian, the petitioners used the word "demand" to understate their requests.
The petition calls for a revision of all laws to insure that they conform with the Koran and Islamic jurisprudence and to cleanse banks of interest rates and other practices the Koran forbids.
In what appeared to be an answer to the demands, the King's brother, Prince Salman, who is the Governor of Riyadh, said in a statement to visiting military dignitaries on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had emerged stronger from the gulf crisis because of the sound leadership of the present Government and the King, whom he described as a man "who appreciates responsibility and knows how to use it."
 
Stronger Army Asked
 At various points the petition stresses the need to rid the Government of corrupt officials and show "seriousness in the pursuit of all officials without exception, especially high officials, to cleanse the Government of whoever is convicted."
The petitioners also call for "justice" in the distribution of wealth in Saudi Arabia and for the creation of a powerful, well-equipped army to defend the country. This demand appeared to reflect veiled criticism of the King's decision to invite hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to defend Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
Finally, the petition calls for the protection of human rights and warns against behavior that tends to "wound the individual's dignity."
A Saudi businessman commented on the petition, which Arab officials say was delivered on May 18, by saying that it was not in itself "an earth-shaking event here." But the fact that the normally conservative religious establishment showed an inclination to give Saudis a greater say in their governing, he said, is "part of the reactive evolution brought about by the gulf crisis everywhere in the area."
In Kuwait, various political forces have been waging a long battle for democratization against the Sabah family. They have become more insistent with the end of the Iraqi occupation, having succeeded in bringing down one government and placing the new government under heavy criticism.

HEADLINE: Recession Strains Unemployment Funds in Region

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The layoffs of tens of thousands of workers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut during the recession has strained the trust funds maintained by each state to provide unemployment insurance benefits.
Connecticut's fund ran out of money early in January, and the state has borrowed $189 million from the Federal Government to maintain benefits to people who have lost their jobs. Connecticut was the first state to deplete its fund and borrow from the Government during the current recession, Federal officials said, but it may not be the last. 
 New York and New Jersey still have billions of dollars in their unemployment insurance trust funds. But if the recession continues at present levels for a prolonged time, or if it gets worse, then both states might also use up the money in their funds.
During previous national recessions, many states borrowed from a Federal trust fund created to cover deficits. The unemployment insurance system is structured for flexibility. In good times, states are supposed to build up the amount of money in their trust funds, through payroll taxes paid by employers. In bad times, states draw on the funds to handle the increased load of unemployed workers.
 
'A Feature of Our System'
 And when unemployment soars, as it did in the early 1980's, the funds in many states run out of money and state officials turn to the Federal Government for help.
"Borrowing has been a feature of our system since the 1950's," said Mary Ann Wyrsch, director of the Unemployment Insurance Service, which is part of the United States Department of Labor. "There is a recognition that unemployment can go so high that you can't handle it with your tax structure."
By turning to the Federal Government, states are able to avoid significant tax increases to employers in the middle of a recession. Such increases could prolong economic downturns.
In theory, states could raise payroll taxes so high during boom times that the trust funds could withstand virtually any recession. But several experts said the tax rates that would be needed to make the funds impregnable would have been prohibitively high, in the range of 12 to 14 percent, or more than double the current rates.
 
Not for Every Contingency
 "The trust fund is not supposed to be available for every contingency," said Dominic M. Rotondi, director of unemployment insurance in the New York State Department of Labor. "The conservative approach is to avoid raising taxes in bad times, and so borrowing is available."
Each state sets its own payroll-tax rates and unemployment insurance benefit levels. In New York, employers pay a tax on the first $7,000 of each employee's wages. The tax rate varies for each employer, depending on the business's history of layoffs and the potential it has for additional layoffs in the coming year. The rate in New York right now can be as low as .3 percent, or $21 per employee, and as high as 5.7 percent, or $399.
Employers also pay an additional tax on the first $7,000 in wages to the Federal Government. This tax is generally .8 percent, or $56, and it is used for the administration of the entire unemployment insurance system and for the Federal trust fund.
Nationally, the state of the unemployment insurance system "is essentially quite good," Ms. Wyrsch said. There was a total of about $40 billion in the states' trust funds at the end of last year, she said, and that represented about 2 percent of total annual wages in the United States.
 
Repaying the Money
 "That is not to say that some states are not fragile," Ms. Wyrsch added.
Connecticut requested a loan of $227 million last December for the first quarter of this year, and it asked for an additional $210 million loan for the second quarter, said C. Richard Ficks, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Labor.
So far, Connecticut has used $189 million of the Federal loans. State officials said on Thursday that they had already repaid $107 million of the money.
Connecticut's unemployment insurance trust fund ran dry, in part, because the state had long had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, Mr. Ficks said. That meant that, based on their previous history of layoffs, Connecticut employers paid a relatively low payroll tax, and the state trust fund was relatively small.
 
Fund Was Quickly Depleted
 When Connecticut's unemployment rate shot up rapidly in the last two years, the fund was quickly depleted. "It wasn't capable of meeting the demands in a downturn," Mr. Ficks said.
Connecticut's payroll-tax rates and payroll-tax structure are proportionately lower than those in many states, and that also contributed to the fund's depletion, said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
Connecticut's unemployment rate in March was 5.7 percent, Mr. Ficks said. In March 1989, the state's unemployment rate was 3.2 percent. The impact of the growing number of layoffs on the state's unemployment insurance system can be gauged by the growing demand for benefits. In January 1988, an average of 33,340 people received unemployment benefits each week. In January 1991, an average of 83,000 people received benefits.
In New York and New Jersey, the unemployment rates are higher than in Connecticut. But the trust funds in those states are in far better condition, in part because unemployment climbed more steeply in Connecticut.
 
$11 Million a Day
 New York is paying more than $11 million a day in benefits to unemployed people (the top rate for an individual is $280 a week). For the week ending April 26, about 224,000 people sought unemployment insurance benefits in New York. During the same week last year, 167,000 people claimed benefits, and for the same week in 1989, 126,000 people sought benefits.
Despite the surge in demand, New York still has $1.8 billion in its trust fund, said Mr. Rotondi, the state's director of unemployment insurance. The fund hit a high of $3.4 billion in January 1989.
If unemployment in New York were to remain for a long time at its current high rate -- 7.3 percent -- the fund could run out of money early in 1993, Mr. Rotondi said. But he added, "We don't expect that." The state's unemployment rate a year ago was 4.8 percent.
If unemployment were to drop by as little as .1 percent or .2 percent, New York's fund could avoid being depleted, Mr. Rotondi said. If unemployment were to grow worse, the state would run out of money before 1993, he said.
 
Filed New Claims
 New Jersey has also seen a substantial increase in demand for unemployment insurance, but its payroll taxes have kept pace with the additional benefits it is now paying. The state had $2.8 billion in its trust fund a year ago, and it has virtually the same amount today, said George M. Krause, comptroller of the New Jersey Department of Labor.
The state's unemployment rate was 6.5 percent last month, and in April 1990 the rate was 4.9 percent. About 11,100 people filed new claims for insurance benefits for the week ending May 11, said Gene Herman, a spokesman for the New Jersey Labor Department. For the same week in 1990, about 8,925 new claims were filed.
One guideline used to measure the fiscal well-being of an unemployment insurance trust fund is to calculate how long it could keep paying benefits, at current levels, if it received no additional income. In New Jersey, there is enough money to pay unemployment insurance benefits for about two years, at the current level, if the state were to stop collecting payroll taxes, Mr. Krause said. Of course, New Jersey will continue to collect the taxes.
"The fund is really in good shape," Mr. Krause said.

HEADLINE: Nonpartisan Groups Finding Fault With Senators' Traditional Strategy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 25

 BODY:
As New York's state budget delay moves into its eighth exasperating week, state officials, lobbyists and business leaders are increasingly attributing the deadlock to the traditional legislative strategy of the Republican-led Senate.
As in previous years, the senators have been proclaiming the need to limit spending while fighting hard to receive their share, the critics say. They have positioned themselves as a bulwark against new taxes while failing to come up with alternative means to pay for the spending they want. And officials in the Cuomo administration and the Democratic-led Assembly predict that the Republicans will ultimately vote for tax increases after the Democrats provide them with political cover. 
 The gulf between the Senate's public politics and its private negotiating stance was clearly shown last week. At a breakfast forum on Tuesday, the day after the Legislature set a record for delay in settling on a budget, the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, attributed the delay to the need to rein in the big-spending Democrats.
"You wonder why it takes us so long," said Mr. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I.. "The problem is that we have in the past decade embarked on a spending spree in New York State, and it's time that we cut back."
 
'Bring Home the Bacon'

But only days before Mr. Marino's speech, negotiators for the Republican majority in the Senate concluded a tentative deal with the Assembly to restore more than half of the $891 million in school aid cuts proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The school-aid restoration is the primary reason that the legislators' spending plan exceeds the Governor's by about $200 million.
"The Senate Republicans want to bring home the bacon," Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine said. "They want their members' items. They want their school districts held harmless from the pain. But they don't want to support difficult revenue measures."
The Republicans dismiss such criticism as the screech of partisan politics, turned up a notch to reflect the pain of recessionary restraint.
But similar comments have been made by business leaders normally sympathetic to the Republican cause.
"You will sit with them and they will say 'Spending is outrageous,' " said a leading business lobbyist who insisted on anonymity. "But the people who would have you believe they would cut spending 'ain't so good at doing it. And they don't want to pay for it, either."
While they accept some responsibility for the delay, the Senate Republicans say Mr. Cuomo bears most of the blame for proposing a budget that neither the Assembly nor the Senate could accept and that Assembly Speaker Mel Miller has contributed by insisting on an increase in the personal income tax.
But from the beginning of the budget process, when Mr. Marino said it was more important to pass a responsible budget than a timely one, it has been clear that the Senate would be willing to wait for the best deal it could get.
"I'm not trying to say that we've been innocent and they've been guilty," Mr. Marino said last week. "But as goals for this budget, we've said we're not going to spend more than the Governor, and we're not. We said we would restore and equalize educational aid, and we will. We said we would try to effectuate more reductions in spending, and we will. We said there would be no increases in broad-based taxes, and I don't believe there will be."
As the budget has grown later and later, the state's Democratic leaders, including Mr. Cuomo, have criticized the Republicans for not adjusting their strategy to the dire conditions of the times. The eight-week delay in filling the state's $6 billion budget gap has caused fiscal misery around the state and pushed New York City to the brink of a cash-flow crisis.
But because only six of the 35 Republican senators are from New York City, as compared with 56 of the 95 members of the Assembly's Democratic majority, the Senate has felt less pressure than the Assembly to respond to the city's doomsday deadlines.
 
Position Is Vague
 "They have learned that their best negotiating posture is to slow the process down," said the Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, a Manhattan Democrat. "They get more of what they want because in the end they have to be bought off."
It was not until April 4, four days after the start of the fiscal year, that the 35 Republicans in the 61-member Senate published their first response to Mr. Cuomo's budget. Even after that, budget negotiators and participants in meetings between the Governor and the legislative leaders said, the Senate's position on financing the budget has been vague, defined more by what is unacceptable than by tangible proposals. The only revenue proposal made by the Senate Republicans -- a menu of nonrecurring revenue measures like a tax amnesty and sale of state assets -- was quickly rejected by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Miller.
Wall Street has warned that excessive use of such measures could cause a downgrading of the state's credit rating. Mr. Marino believes such a downgrading would not be made because the $1 billion in nonrecurring revenues would be used to offset a $1 billion short-term note repayment, a nonrecurring expenditure.
 
Apparent Tax Agreement

With Mr. Miller and Mr. Marino in virtual agreement on how much they want to spend, and with Mr. Cuomo ruling out the Assembly's income tax increase and the Senate's one-shot approach, the current impasse involves an inability to agree on alternative revenue measures.
A week ago, Mr. Miller and Mr. Marino seemed to have an understanding, if not an airtight agreement, on two taxes that would fill most of the budget hole -- one a tax on corporate gross receipts, the other a tax on petroleum products.
But at a lengthy meeting of the Republican conference on Thursday, senators made it clear to Mr. Marino that they had strong objections to both taxes. Many of the senators campaigned aggressively against new taxes in last year's election, even though the Senate joined the Assembly and the Governor in approving $3 billion in new taxes in the last two years. Mr. Marino emerged from the private session to say he would try to replace the taxes with further cuts in the Medicaid and welfare programs.
The session raised short-lived questions about whether Mr. Marino could deliver the votes of his members on the two taxes if a budget deal ultimately includes them, as it is expected to.
In a highly unusual move, the Republican senators released a statement on Friday affirming their support for Mr. Marino's position, helping to quell rumors of disharmony.
"The bottom line is that Ralph could deliver the conference on whatever he wants," said Senator Serphin R. Maltese of Queens.
To break the budget deadlock, Mr. Cuomo has been encouraging Mr. Miller and Mr. Marino to devise a plan between themselves.
But the senators are concerned that they would be forced to vote for the petroleum and business taxes, only to have Mr. Cuomo veto many of their spending priorities, the worst of both worlds for the Republicans.

HEADLINE: Federal Aid Cutbacks in '80's Hurt New York City

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
While New York City's fiscal problems have prompted Mayor David N. Dinkins to lay a big piece of the blame on New York State, he has also measured out a little bit for the Federal Government.
In Washington recently with several other big-city mayors, Mr. Dinkins told Congressional leaders, "No matter how hard we work, no matter how creative we are, we are desperately in need of more resources to complete the job that we're doing." The decline in Federal spending during the 1980's, he said, is partly responsible for the city's current trouble. 
 While that argument may do little to deflect attention at a time when Mr. Dinkins's administration is being criticized for its financial management, there is no denying that the level of Federal spending has declined, or that it has contributed to the city's problems:
*In the 1980's, New York City received about $270 million a year from general revenue-sharing, money which was not earmarked for any specific purpose and which the city generally plowed into schools. In 1986, that program was eliminated.
*In 1981, the city got about $334 million for job training, which supported jobs for about 15,000 people. Today that program has been replaced by a much smaller version and the city receives just $69 million.
*In 1981, New York received about $134 million in mass-transit aid for the subway system; today, that amount has been scaled back to $79 million.
*In 1981, the Federal Government directed about $3 billion a year to the city's capital program and nonprofit groups to finance public housing. Today it contributes less than $1 billion.
 
Big Decline With Inflation
 Of course, some Federal programs have increased. Medicaid payments to New York City, for instance, have risen substantially as the number of recipients has grown. And money for remedial education has also increased in recent years.
But when all the Federal programs are added together and the effect of inflation is factored in, it is clear that New York City suffered a significant decline in Federal aid during the 1980's. The city's Office of Management and Budget has estimated that if Government assistance to New York had continued at the same level as in 1981, the city would have received an additional $7 billion during the 1980's.
The decline in Federal aid is only part of the problem. At the same time that traditional antipoverty programs were being cut back in Washington, new social problems were emerging in many cities. "No one even considered homelessness to be an issue in 1981," said Howard Leibowitz, director of the Mayor of Boston's office of Federal relations. "AIDS had not been discovered, nor had crack cocaine."
Although the cuts in Federal spending on urban problems are often attributed to the Reagan Administration, the trend began under President Jimmy Carter, when the economy stalled and the Federal budget deficit became more of an issue. But the decline in Federal spending accelerated drastically during the 1980's, as the Government's deficit ballooned and the Reagan Administration shifted more of the burden for social welfare to the states.
During the 1980's, "the Government decided to get out of the aid business, and states did not step in to fill the gap," said John Yinger, a professor of economics and public administration at Syracuse University and author of "America's Ailing Cities."
By the end of the 1980's, Federal aid to states and cities, adjusted for inflation, had been cut in half, said Richard S. Williamson, who was in charge of intergovernmental affairs under President Reagan. "There is no question that it happened, or that it accelerated during the Republican presidencies."
To some extent, this decline in Federal spending has hit New York harder than other cities. New York received about one-tenth of the money that Capitol Hill spent on low-income housing, in part because the city's older housing stock made it eligible for more funds under the Government's formula. And since many cities do not have large mass-transit systems, it was not surprising that New York absorbed slightly more than one-quarter of the nation's spending on mass transit.
In addition to being a heavy user of traditional Federal programs, New York has also suffered more than its share of new urban problems. It is home to more AIDS patients and homeless people than any other city.
 
Holtzman Assails Federal Drop
 But if New York has been hurt more by Federal cuts and increased social problems, is it fair to conclude that Washington is to blame for some of New York's current fiscal trouble, as Mayor Dinkins and even the fiscally conservative City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, have said in recent weeks?
Ms. Holtzman likes to point out that Federal aid provided about 19 percent of the city's budget in 1980 and 11 percent today. "If New York still received the 1980 level of aid, we would have an additional $2.48 billion for fiscal year 1992, and the city's deficit would be completely eliminated," a report from her office recently concluded.
Critics of this argument point out that New York City had a choice: When the Federal spigot was shut off, it did not have to replace those funds with its own to the extent that it did. The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that of the $7 billion the city lost in Federal aid, about $4 billion was replaced with the city's own money.
Others argue that even if Washington had continued its 1981 level of spending, the city might still have racked up a deficit because of its seeming ability to find new ways to spend whatever comes under its purview -- and more.
 
Few Expect Washington to Help
 Almost everyone agrees that the city can expect little help from Washington any time soon. The recent visit to Capitol Hill by mayors from New York, Chicago, Newark and elsewhere was well attended by Congressional leaders, who criticized the Bush Administration for being able to find money to finance the gulf war and the savings and loan industry's rescue, but not programs for America's cities.
But there seems to be a consensus in Washington that taxpayers have little appetite for more open-ended commitments to solving society's problems. There may be money for surface transportation or pollution-control programs, some Congressional leaders said. But "urban agenda is a term that politically is just not going to succeed in the 90's," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, who has also been spending time in Washington lobbying on the city's behalf.

HEADLINE: A Historic District in South Carolina Struggles to Preserve Black History

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. HELENA ISLAND, S. C.

 BODY:
In 1862, the second year of the bloody campaigns of the Civil War, Quakers from Philadelphia financed an experiment in education beneath the live oaks and Spanish moss here: South Carolina's first school for freed slaves.
With a curriculum that stressed chemistry and carpentry, history and home economics, the Penn School sent freed slaves and three generations of their descendants out to become doctors, teachers, farmers, seamstresses and harness makers. Now the pine and cypress buildings have become a sodden collection of moldering wood. 
 The school, now called the Penn Center, is one of three national historic landmark districts in South Carolina, and the only one that is black. But its 18 buildings deteriorated while the state's two other such districts, downtown Beaufort and Charleston, have been restored with private and public funds and tax breaks no longer in effect.
 
A Lack of Donations
 "It's symbolic of the inequities that still exist between the races in this nation," said Emory Campbell, the director of the Penn Center. "Black people, by and large, are still not capable of donating the kind of money necessary to their institutions as whites are able to do. We have made efforts to raise money from both sides, and we haven't been able to get it from either."
St. Helena Island, 30 miles northeast of Savannah, Ga., is about 15 miles long and three to five miles wide, making it one of the largest of the Sea Islands off South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The island was named and first settled by the Spanish, who were eventually replaced by the English, and its economy depended on slaves who grew indigo and cotton.
The cotton plantations were abandoned by their white owners in the face of a Union invasion early in the Civil War. The Federal Government seized the property, then sold or deeded it to the former slaves.
In 1862 Yankee volunteers, financed by Quaker societies in Philadelphia, established a school consisting of 47 students and teachers, and the school quickly became the center of St. Helena's community of 7,000 blacks.
"This is, in and of itself, an important part of American history that must be preserved," Mr. Campbell said during a tour of the 50-acre historic district. "What happened here changed our nation. It was the first school in the South to set out to prove slaves could be taught to be self-sufficient. It also helped to establish the predominantly black community on St. Helena Island, a community that is still intact."
Penn School survived poverty, two major hurricanes (in 1893 and 1911) and the Depression. School records show that in 1936 it had a staff of 31 people who taught 606 students, including 33 in high school. One of its graduates, Dr. York W. Bailey, practiced medicine on St. Helena Island for 50 years before his death in 1971 at the age of 90.
But World War II proved to be a difficult period, from which the school never recovered. Students who were eligible for the military enlisted and black families migrated to cities in the North, Enrollment fell, and in the early 1950's Penn School was briefly operated by the the Beaufort County authorities before the school was closed and renamed the Penn Center.
Work on health programs for the poor replaced teaching as a reason for the center's existence. So did legal programs, religious work and other community work. One intriguing projects under way is to translate the Bible into Gullah, the traditional language spoken by the island's blacks.
Penn Center's leaders began to earn money by using the school buildings for conferences. The lighting and bathrooms are now too old for most groups, although the Peace Corps remains a client. Every summer it trains volunteers here for work in Africa.
 
Ignored by Developers
 Three years ago Mr. Campbell, who is 49 years old, started a $3.2 million campaign to refurbish the buildings and establish an endowment for the center's library, museum and community programs. So far he has raised $130,000, some of it from black families on the island who say they have contributed as much as they can.
"Foundations have given a little," the director said. "The developers have almost ignored us totally."
One reason that developers, who spend tens of millions of dollars annually on South Carolina's Sea Islands, have shunned the Penn Center is Mr. Campbell's strident opposition to many of them. Mr. Campbell says the Sea Islands' resorts have raised land values and property taxes, driving black families off land they have controlled since the Civil War.
St. Helena Island has not yet succumbed to the developer's bulldozers, Mr. Campbell said, because Penn Center has provided residents with legal advice to prevent their land from being seized through tax sales or bought at undervalued prices by developers.
Developers are not the only ones who have ignored Penn Center's appeals for help. "When we went to the state," Mr. Campbell said, "they told us that since we were a private group, public monies could not be used for a cultural project of this type."
But earlier this year Penn Center's fund-raising campaign received an inadvertent lift from the wealthy white leaders of neighboring Hilton Head Island who want to raise $13 million for a new cultural center. State Senator James M. Waddell, a Democrat who represents Hilton Head and the rest of Beaufort County, offered to help by providing $4 million through South Carolina's annual bond bill for new construction, which must be approved by the Legislature.
When Mr. Campbell heard about the offer he complained to several sympathetic political leaders, among them State Representative Harriet Keyserling, a Democrat from Beaufort whose son is helping the center's campaign through his public relations firm.
 
Hilton Head Funds Dropped
 Mrs. Keyserling proposed adding $900,000 to the bond bill for refurbishing the Penn Center. The $4 million for Hilton Head was dropped from the bill after other lawmakers said Hilton Head residents were wealthy enough to build the cultural center without state support. The bill is still pending in the Legislature.
Another third of the capital campaign could come from Congress. Last summer the National Trust For Historic Preservation identified the Penn Center, along with Walden Woods in Concord, Mass., as one of the 10 most threatened historic places in America.
The list prompted more attention to Penn Center's plight from South Carolina's newspapers. And a few months ago Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, visited Penn Center and pledged to acquire $1 million in Federal grants.
That leaves $1.3 million still to raise.
"If we had the money we could have workshops to pay the island's craftsmen to pass what they learned here on to our children," said Vanessa Thaxton, 29, the curator of Penn Center's museum. "These crafts are a direct link to our African ancestry. It's important for the kids to know their ancestors weren't brought here without skills."

HEADLINE: U. of Massachusetts Is Losing Money and Morale

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMHERST, Mass.

 BODY:
The seniors of the class of 1991 are not the only people who will be leaving the University of Massachusetts after commencement on May 26. The chancellor, Joseph Duffey, two vice chancellors, three deans and a number of highly respected professors have resigned.
They are part of an exodus from what had been one of the nation's most rapidly improving universities until it was battered by a slumping state economy, a prolonged state budget crisis and widespread animosity toward government employees, which in Massachusetts includes professors. 
 As word about the university's troubles has spread, the number of applicants has plummeted in a trend furthered by a decline in the number of high school graduates. Applicants for next fall's freshman class dropped to 14,500 from 24,000 in 1988, university officials say. The university, the state's main institution of public higher education, has a total enrollment of 25,000, 2,000 less than its peak three years ago, when the state's economy began to slide.
"People are very depressed," said Richard Edwards, the chairman of the economics department, who is leaving to become Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Kentucky after 17 years here. "I see the dismantling of a university that was on the verge of being one of the better research universities in the country. We were not yet Berkeley or Michigan, but we were on our way."
 
Falling Budget, Falling Morale
 Kristen Kuliga, a senior from Assonet in the southeastern corner of the state, said: "I'm just glad to be graduating. When I was accepted here it was the place to go. Now the morale is really low."
Cutbacks in financial support by the Governor and Legislature tell much of the story. In the past three years, state appropriations for the university have been cut 22 percent, to $131 million this past academic year from $167 million in 1988.
Those reductions, plus similar cuts at the state's 28 other public colleges and universities, put Massachusetts 50th in the nation in state support for public higher education per capita, according to the Center for Higher Education at Illinois State University.
Next fall, the situation will worsen: the budget proposed by Gov. William F. Weld for the 1992 fiscal year, beginning July 1, calls for further cuts of roughly $20 million.
 
Hard Up for Postage Stamps
 Because of the budget cuts, professors have not had a raise in three years, the faculty has been reduced to 1,185 from 1,450 and spending for research, teaching assistants, travel and even postage has dried up. This spring all professors were forced to forgo two weeks pay while continuing to teach, as part of a furlough ordered for all state employees.
With the number of professors down, some popular courses are no longer being offered, and the size of some other classes has sharply increased, prompting complaints by students.
Daniel T. McDaid, a 24-year-old senior from Philadelphia majoring in communications, said he had trouble getting into the classes he needed to graduate. "I needed four courses to graduate." he said. "I ended up only getting one," he said. In the end, Mr. McDaid had to take three courses he was not interested in to get the credits.
"I just want to graduate and get out of here," he said.
Student discontent has been magnified because the university has increased its tuition and fees by more than 50 percent in the past three years to try to offset some of the reductions in state support. Tuition and fees for Massachusetts students rose to $3,860 last year from $2,048 in 1988, while out-of-state students are charged $9,000, up from $5,000 three years ago.
 
Students Feel Shortchanged
 The big increases have made the University of Massachusetts the second-most expensive state school in the country, after the University of Vermont. "A lot of us feel like we are paying more and getting less," said Jeffrey Toomey, a 21 year-old junior from Springfield.
Under the budget being debated at the State House in Boston, the university would be further squeezed because it would no longer be allowed to raise its fees and would have to give the state some money raised by the tuition increases of the past few years.
Other state universities in the Northeast have also been hit by budget cuts as recession took hold. But officials here say their troubles have been intensified because public higher education in Massachusetts has long been a poor stepchild in a state with a plethora of good private colleges and universities, including Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston College, Boston University, Tufts, Holy Cross, Wellesley, Smith and Mount Holyoke.
 
Keeping Talent Pool Filled
 "There has always been a very halting commitment to public higher education in Massachusetts," said Mr. Duffey, the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts. Mr. Duffey, who is also president of the statewide university system, is leaving to become president of American University in Washington.
Mr. Duffey said this attitude toward public higher education has produced a dangerous situation in Massachusetts, a state whose main employers are universities, hospitals and high technology firms. "Massachusetts doesn't have anything else going for it except its talent," Mr. Duffey said, asserting that it needs a highly educated work force to attract new investment to pull itself out of recession.
Mr. Duffey said Governor Weld, a Republican who has pledged not to raise taxes, may have belatedly begun to recognize this problem. Mr. Weld recently dropped plans to close up to five state colleges and strip the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester of virtually its entire state appropriation as ways to save money. Earlier this month Mr. Weld said he now believes spending for public education may be an "investment" rather than a "debit."
Timm Rinehart, the director of admissions at the University of Massachusetts, asserted that the troubles besetting the university "are a problem, not a crisis," adding, "The bottom hasn't fallen out."
 
Enhanced by Its Neighbors
 As evidence, he pointed out that while applications by out-of-state students fell 20 percent this year, there was actually an increase of 1 percent from students within Massachusetts.
One reason for the university's continued drawing power, Mr. Rinehart said, is its location in Amherst, in western Massachusetts, where students can take courses at the other colleges in the area: Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire.
But Professor Edwards, the departing chairman of the economics department, foresees further trouble. At first, he noted, many professors were angry at the budget cuts but were committed to riding out the hard times. But after three bad years, he said, "We're seeing people deciding their future lies elsewhere."
The problem is particularly acute for junior, untenured professors who face the likelihood of layoffs, Professor Edwards said.
 
Holes in Roof and in Morale
 Professor Edwards' wife, Carolyn Edwards, a highly respected professor of education, is also leaving, he said, because of concern that the whole School of Education may be eliminated. Like her husband, she has accepted a new job at the University of Kentucky.
For academics it is not so much a matter of money, Mr. Edwards said, as it is of morale. "This was a wonderful place to come to because it really supported research," he said. But now the building housing his economics department has a leaking roof, and rain and snow have caused a stain to spread over the ceiling, with moisture dropping onto the furniture below. Virtually all maintenance has been curtailed.
"It's not the leak itself that matters but the statement that no one cares enough to fix it," Professor Edwards said. "It tells professors they are not valued."

GRAPHIC: Photos: With the Massachusetts economy in a slump, appropriations for the University of Massachusetts have been sharply cut. "I'm just glad to be graduating," said Kristen Kuliga, a senior at the university; Professors at the University of Massachusetts have not had a pay increase in three years, and the faculty has been reduced to 1,185 from 1,450. This spring professors were forced to forgo two weeks' pay. As a result of the hard times some have taken new jobs. Richard Edwards and his wife, Carolyn, are now at the University of Kentucky.

HEADLINE: U.S., in Switch, Plans to Keep Out People Infected With AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from conservatives, the Government has halted a plan to allow people infected with the AIDS virus to enter the United States, Bush Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The proposed regulation, which would have gone into effect on June 1, would have reversed a 4-year-old immigration policy that lists infection with the human immunodeficiency virus as among the conditions that bar a person from entering the United States. 
 The existing policy has been denounced as discriminatory and medically unjustified by public health groups and advocates for people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed eliminating the HIV infection from the list of diseases barring people from the country and published the proposal in the Federal Register for public comment.
 
40,000 Opposing Letters
 Conservatives voiced strong opposition, and the Government received 40,000 letters opposing the proposal, leading the health department to table it for the foreseeable future. Government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they would have to go back to the drawing board on the policy.
Opponents of the proposed regulation argue that since AIDS is a major public health problem in the United States, people from abroad who are infected with the virus that causes the disease should be excluded.
"I'm very pleased that H.H.S. woke up to the absurdity of this proposal, and I hope it stays buried in the bottom of a circular file in the deepest innards of the bureaucracy," said Representative William E. Dannemeyer, a California Republican who opposed the rule. "It was ludicrous what they were saying. On the one hand they say AIDS is a major problem; on the other hand they say that we should take in HIV carriers with impunity."
But some backers of the proposal were outraged.
"This is a perfect example of political cowardice," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been pressuring the Administration to drop the HIV restriction. "This is just some raw meat that George Bush can throw to Republican primitives so he can get on with what he's really interested in: foreign policy."
The decision to maintain the status quo was first reported today in The Washington Post.
In February 1990, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that AIDS and all other contagious diseases except tuberculosis, which can be spread through casual contact, be removed from the list of diseases used to bar people from entering the United States. The change followed protests of the immigration regulation by numerous organizations, including the National Commission on AIDS, the World Health Organization and the International Societies of the Red Cross.
At the time, Dr. James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services, asked the centers to review the list of diseases that the Immigration and Naturalization Service uses to deny visas. Among those were diseases like syphilis, gonorrhea, leprosy, tuberculosis and fully active AIDS, as well as HIV infection.
 
Helms Sought Restriction
 The centers determined that only tuberculosis posed a public health threat because in its active stage it is highly contagious until treated. AIDS is not contagious in the same way that tuberculosis is because it is not passed by casual contact.
How those infected with HIV should be treated by the immigration authorities has been an issue only since 1987, when Congress approved an amendment sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, that added HIV infection to the list of communicable and dangerous diseases that could be used to exclude a person from the United States. Those infected with diseases on the list are required to declare so upon entry.
In November, Congress passed legislation that asked the health department to make a determination on the infectiousness of diseases that were used by immigration to exclude people.
In January, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, determined that only tuberculosis was ground for exclusion.
A health department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the letters opposing the change argued that if people with AIDS were allowed to immigrate to the United States the medical system would be inundated with their care and taxpayers with the cost of that care.
 
Evangelical Influence Seen
 "The letters were negative in the sense that they argued that the medical system could be overwhelmed," he said. "There apparently was an evangelical broadcaster who made an issue of this, and certainly, there was a similarity about the letters that implies that many were generated by that argument."
Because the care of AIDS patients can be expensive, organizations like the American Medical Association have pushed for limiting the entry of long-term visitors or immigrants who have tested positive for HIV. But health experts say the cost of care for AIDS patients varies so widely it would be impossible to estimate what the economic impact of public care of HIV-infected people would be.
Administration officials say the Centers for Disease Control and the Health and Human Services Department still support the change but expect the old list of exclusionary diseases to remain while additional arguments are made.
"The deadline, of course, is June 1, and H.H.S. and the public health service have until that time to make an announcement," said Bill Grigg, director of the public health service news division of the health department.

HEADLINE: Only 12, but Old Enough to Feed a City's Violence

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., May 25

 BODY:
A 12-year-old boy who imitated the swagger of the neighborhood drug dealers and boasted about his prowess with a gun is confined in Juvenile Hall here these days, tearful and frightened as he awaits a trial for murder.
The boy is charged with homicide in the May 10 shooting death of 29-year-old Mike Ward, known on the streets as Beeper Mike, who sold and rented the electronic paging devices that are tools of the drug trade in inner city neighborhoods. 
 The boy is the youngest person charged with murder in Oakland in more than a decade. But it is his situation, more than his age, that has stirred the citizenry in this city, which is beleaguered by crack and crime and painfully aware that it is losing its black male children to the lure of the streets.
 
'A War for These Kids'
 While the crime he is charged with is extraordinary, the 12-year-old is in many ways typical of the children of America's inner cities: reared by a single mother, searching for male role models and living in neighborhoods where drugs and guns are everywhere and economic and educational opportunities are scarce.
"We are definitely in a war for these kids," said Don Sutton, the program coordinator for the Oakland Crack Task Force, a local drug prevention organization. "For some of them, people who sell drugs are the only male images they see."
"The system is set up to create youngsters like the one we're talking about here," continued Mr. Sutton, who does not know this child. "The school system is cut back. The recreation programs? They're mostly gone. The extended family doesn't hardly exist anymore. Churches don't open their door 'til Sunday morning.
"What's left for them? Sure, you don't expect 12-year-olds to kill people. That still surprises all of us. But if we know they're hanging out in the street, what do we think they're getting involved with?"
 
Mischief, Then Drug Dealing
 The child's identity is protected by law. But some details of his life were pieced together in interviews with a homicide investigator, a defense lawyer hired by the boy's family and a few neighbors who asked that they not be identified because they feared retaliation from local drug dealers.
According to many of those interviewed, the boy had been engaged in routine mischief until recent months. Then he began hanging around with a group of much older teen-agers and young adults, his brother among them, who dealt drugs from a shabby apartment building on Webster Street, about a mile north of downtown Oakland.
A seventh grader at Westlake Junior High School, the boy had an unexceptional school record, the lawyer, William P. Cole, said. The recreation director at nearby Mosswood Park, Perri Walker, said he was more respectful of adults than many children she encountered.
 
Bragging to Older Boys
 The boy's previous encounters with the police included arrests for battery, possession of a switchblade and driving a car without a license. Sgt. Bill Wallace of the Oakland Police Department characterized it as "not a big deal record, compared to the records we see."
But in recent months, the boy's behavior deteriorated. Mr. Cole and Sergeant Wallace said his mother, a secretary in a school here, had split up with a man who had been living with the family. The child liked and admired the man and responded badly to the break-up.
The boy developed colitis, a stress-related stomach ailment, Mr. Cole said, and was briefly in the care of a counselor. He began spending time with the older group on the street. With his mother at work all day, the boy was unsupervised. His older brother, for a time, was in prison on a drug charge.
The boy's life in the street was captured recently on film by an amateur documentary-maker working for the Black Home Owners' Association of Oakland. The film was shown on television last week, with the boy's face distorted to conform with state law, after the local station confirmed his identity with the police. In the film, the boy brags about his skill with a gun, pats his pocket where he indicates one is hidden and tosses money in the air.
The boy's swaggering behavior was a way to earn respect from his streetwise friends. "He tried to be bad like the other guys," one neighbor said.
Sergeant Wallace said he had been unable to trace the .22-caliber revolver, and Mr. Cole said he could offer no information about how the boy had obtained the gun or how long he had it. Mr. Cole's clients are primarily teen-age boys charged with drug-related offenses, and the lawyer noted that he often tries, without success, to "talk them out of carrying guns."
 
A Shooting With Many Witnesses
 "Most young black kids dealing dope think it's a necessity," Mr. Cole said. "It's not that they're hellbent on killing somebody. They consider it a deterrent, so they're less likely to get pushed around or robbed. They think I don't know much about it, which is true, so my opinion isn't worth much to them."
On the evening of the shooting, Sergeant Wallace said, the 12-year-old was with half a dozen of his older friends, who had been stalking the neighborhood for weeks in search of Mr. Ward. The beeper salesman had not turned over their deposits to the electronics company, and their pagers had therefore been shut off.
Mr. Ward turned up shortly after 6 P.M., and the group began cursing and pummelling him, accusing him of stealing their money. When Mr. Ward tried to flee, the older youths chased him down the street. As they approached the corner, in broad daylight and with more than a dozen witnesses, the child shot Mr. Ward in the back with a .22-caliber revolver.
The boy went into hiding, Mr. Cole said, keeping in touch by telephone with his family. Three days after the shooting he turned himself in to the police.
If the boy is convicted of the killing at a non-jury trial, the judge can order him to the California Youth Authority until his 25th birthday. A range of lesser penalties is also possible.
Mr. Cole said the boy was very distraught when he first met him, literally tearing out his hair, weeping hysterically and threatening suicide. His first 10 days in detention were spent in solitary confinement, in a small room monitored by a closed-circuit camera.
"This has stripped him of whatever pretense he has of being older than his years," Mr. Cole said. He added that this boy seems less self-centered and more remorseful than most of his clients. "He has expressed the emotion of feeling badly," he said.
Mr. Cole said the boy was moved to the general dormitory area in Juvenile Hall once his agitation lessened. He won a Snickers candy bar for his performance in his first basketball game with the other youngsters, the lawyer said, and this improved his mood.
The boy has made two court appearances at the Alameda County Probation Department regarding his continued detention until trial. At the first hearing last week, wearing short pants that made him look younger than his years, he wept copiously.
At the second hearing on Thursday, dressed in long pants and a Georgetown University basketball jersey, the 5-foot-2-inch, 125-pound youngster was subdued, his face blank.
The boy's mother shielded her face from view with a newspaper at the first hearing and hid from reporters in the restroom before the second. Reporters, but not cameras, are allowed at juvenile court proceedings in California for certain very serious crimes.
 
Quiet at the Family Home
 Mr. Cole, Sergeant Wallace and several neighbors said the boy's situation was especially tragic because his mother had struggled to provide a good home. She has always had a job, they said, and owns the tan bungalow where the family lives, which is tidy although sorely in need of paint.
"She's been very cooperative, a nice lady," Sergeant Wallace said. "But she can't run the show herself, at least not in Oakland. She doesn't have the time or the ability to counter the influences."
Near the scene of the crime on Webster Street, where most of the houses have "Home Alert Neighborhood" decals in the windows, residents said that the customary drug bazaar across from the boy's house, with its attendant noise and menace, had fallen silent lately.
"The only time it's been quiet here at night is since the killing," one resident said.
"I was going to move but now I'm not," said another. "The neighborhood has bonded together for now, knock on wood."

HEADLINE: Fund Guides Jobless Soviet Immigrants

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
After a century of helping Jewish immigrants make new lives in America, the Baron De Hirsch Fund faces a bigger challenge: helping find jobs and offering emotional support for the thousands of Soviet immigrants who arrived in New York City after Moscow eased its emigration policy.
Last year, about 40,000 Soviet immigrants came to the United States. Half of them settled in the New York area, putting new pressure on Jewish aid organizations, including the Baron De Hirsch Fund. As a result, the philanthropy has developed new strategies to help unemployed adult immigrants find work and troubled adolescents receive counseling. 
 "We have taken a fresh look at our program and we're determined our people will not become an economic burden," said Francis F. Rosenbaum Jr., an investment broker who is the philanthropy's president.
The fund was created in 1891 by Baron Maurice De Hirsch, a prosperous German Jewish financier who wanted to help Jewish families fleeing Czarist Russia make a fresh start by becoming farmers. Thousands came to the United States at the turn of the century and became poultry farmers, mainly in southern New Jersey.
Today, the fund has about $6 million in assets and spends about $500,000 a year. It is also one of the oldest and most experienced charities supporting resettlement programs in Israel.
Now the fund is arranging for hundreds of immigrants to receive skills assessments, English instruction and training in areas where labor shortages exist, like nursing, child care and construction.
Forty Soviet nurses who lack licenses to practice in this country, for example, are attending English classes and training at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan under a program developed with the help of the New York Association for New Americans.
Nelli Pulatova, 21 years old, said that before coming to this country, she attended medical school, worked in a hospital and dreamed about becoming a pediatrician. When she completes her yearlong training at Beth Israel, she will receive a license as a practical nurse and a staff position. "This hospital is teaching me to become a real American," she said.
Many Soviet immigrants have job titles or classifications for which there are no American equivalents. The fund works with the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, a 57-year-old nonprofit group sponsored by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, to retrain them.
 
Retraining for Engineers
 "Immigrants arrive with engineering titles who are not engineers by American standards, but after an assessment and training, they can find good-paying jobs in the building and construction and related trades," said Al Miller, executive vice president of the employment and guidance service.
To help adolescents, who sometimes have trouble adjusting to their new home, the fund turned to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, which provides mental health services. The organization finances and develops cultural and therapeutic activities to help the teen-agers become integrated into their communities, said Jonathan Katz, director of the board's community education programs.
One of the most successful is a theatrical production of the teen-agers, called "Immigranti!", which uses songs and dances to describe their experiences in moving from their homeland through immigration. It has been performed in schools and at conferences in New York, New Jersey and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Voters Struggle to Find The Strength in Their Numbers

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
WHAT do a Puerto Rican single mother in the South Bronx, a Cuban-American businessman in Miami and a Mexican-American social worker from East Los Angeles have in common? The question is a real one to Hispanic politicians and community organizers grappling with the difficulty of translating population gains into increased political power.
The 1980's, touted by demographers as the "Decade of the Hispanics," produced no national political figure, never mind commensurate representation, and left many Hispanic citizens wondering if the catch phrase was only a device to tap into a growing and lucrative consumer market. 
 The numbers were certainly there. According to the 1990 Census, the nation's Hispanic population numbered 22.4 million, a leap of 53 percent over the 1980 count.
The strength in the numbers has been harder to find. In past years, turf battles over limited foundation and government funds combined with a not-so-healthy dose of nationalism often left the various Hispanic groups squabbling, unable to find common ground for action.
But last week, advocates saw an encouraging sign, when a cross section of Hispanic officials announced their support for President Bush's proposed free trade agreement with Mexico. Increasingly, Hispanic organizations have broadened their constituencies, bringing in and consulting with other like-minded groups on policy. Earlier this year, two organizations concerned with developing a national Hispanic political agenda for the 1992 Presidential election merged, folding in representatives from the Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic-American communities.
"There's a recognition that we're 22 million people, but we only have the power of 22 million people when we act together," said Henry G. Cisneros, the former San Antonio mayor who recently helped forge the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, which aims to assemble a platform for 1992. "If not, then we will be warring and barely speaking tribes. Today there is a good deal more interaction than ever."
Community leaders acknowledge that some of the factors fueling the Hispanic growth also suggest the challenges ahead. The growth comes from immigration and higher birth rates, so that the people who make up the increase are for now excluded from the polling place. Time will change that, but it also will add more Central and South Americans to the mix. Community and political advocates are trying to position themselves now to capitalize on the numbers, hoping to avoid the familiar internecine bickering.
 
The Myth of Unity
 The term Hispanic can be misleading, giving a picture of a behemoth with a single mind. In reality, the term encompasses Mexican Americans in the Southwest, conservative Cuban exiles in the Southeast, liberal Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, and increasing numbers of Dominicans and newer arrivals from Central America.
Friction among these groups often flares. For example, Dominicans in New York recently complained that Puerto Ricans were unfairly dominating city government jobs. On a larger level, some Puerto Ricans gripe that Mexican-American organizations have the franchise on the term Hispanic, and have used it to attract the lion's share of funding. In the 1980's, Cuban Americans backed United States policy in Central America, often at odds with traditionally liberal Hispanic groups.
Despite that, many leaders say there are more areas for agreement than discord, and the disagreements that do crop up are more regional than ethnic in origin. "All the polls we see show that on the big issues -- bilingual education, immigration, and civil rights -- there is almost total unanimity," said Raul Yzaguirre, president and chief executive officer of the National Council of La Raza, a leading policy and advocacy research group. Those issues, combined with employment, housing and government contracts, can form a basis for agreement.
But organizers and activists have their work cut out for them. In cities like New York and Los Angeles, robust population figures obscure the fact that many are either illegal residents or not yet naturalized citizens. Organizers will need to seek out the 2 million Hispanic immigrants who took advantage of the amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, and who in the 1990's will become eligible for citizenship and the vote.
Harry Pachon, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, said that in the 1988 Presidential election there were more Hispanic residents who were ineligible to vote than those who were registered. -- 4.9 million to 4.8 million.
Hispanics comprise the nation's youngest population group and such youth leads to lower voter participation. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President and chairman of the Democratic National Committee's Hispanic Caucus, also blames voter registration laws: "We have these archaic laws in some states that are barriers." He would like to see a liberalizing of registration requirements, with more states adopting same-day registration.
 
Issues Over Candidates
 With most of the 4,000 Hispanic elected officials nationwide serving in local posts, there is an expectation that a national figure will emerge to focus the broader electorate's attention on the group's concerns. But common issues may be a better and more immediate rallying point.
"I don't see our community following the traditional model that Martin Luther King or Jesse Jackson set for the black communtiy," said Mr. Cisneros. "We're just too different regionally, national origins and politically. What we will see is the rise of issues that focus the Hispanic community."
The reference to the black community reflects Hispanic wariness at being lost in the larger society's tendency to view minority communities as having the same concerns as blacks. As the recent rioting in Washington D.C. showed, black-Hispanic relations can be tense, particularly when political and economic power are the issue.
While Hispanic leaders' oft-stated goal is a more unified front in the long term, not everyone agrees that the process will turn a heretofore disenfranchised group into a political colossus with one political mind. Linda Chavez, former director of the Civil Rights Commission, said that as a greater number of Hispanic citizens move up the economic ladder there will be a corresponding rise in political activity, with a twist.
"The sleeping brown giant is going to awaken," she said, "and find himself in a Los Angeles suburb living next to Anglos -- in the mainstream."

What Role For the West In Russia's Revolution?

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
WHAT should you do if you come across a ragged giant slumped in the street? Do you leave him there, grateful that he's powerless, and hope he stays that way? Or do you clean and feed him and try to make him into a friendly and productive neighbor?
To put it another way: What should the West do about the Soviet Union? 
 That question has welled up anew before the industrialized democracies as the Soviet giant lumbers to the end of what is coming to be known here as the first phase of perestroika, battered but apparently wiser and a bit more receptive to the bitter medicine of real change.
In its first six years, the epic process launched by Mikhail S. Gorbachev went from giddy euphoria to dark gloom, and for several months last winter the future of the entire process seemed to totter as the embattled President tried one last fling with the Old Guard Communists. But following the old Marxist scheme, the "thesis" of excitement and the "antithesis" of reaction finally seemed to produce something of a synthesis. In a series of conciliatory actions and signals, Mr. Gorbachev has let it be known that he may be ready to return to the path of reform and to approach the West for help in reviving his bedraggled giant.
The strongest signal has been Mr. Gorbachev's renewed readiness to listen to Grigory Yavlinsky, a young economist who has teamed up with scholars at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government to draft a joint action program that could guide the Soviet Union in the transition to a real democracy and free market.
This is the moment, the authors of the program argued, for those who want a truly renewed Soviet Union to take action: Mr. Gorbachev has made peace with the republics and agreed to hold new elections under a new Constitution, the Old Guard has been beaten back, Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov has demonstrated through a series of half-baked reforms that half-measures are futile, the giant Russian Federation is about to hold the first truly democratic presidential election in Russian history. And beyond all that, the argument goes, the Soviet economy is on the verge of collapse, and only Western intervention can pull it out.
So far, most in the West would probably agree. The next question, however, is: What compelling reasons do Western governments or industry have to plunge into the Soviet mess, especially after what they have seen in the first years of perestroika? Why not let the giant slumber? The first signal from the West is expected at the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, at which Mr. Gorbachev has aimed his lobbying. So far, the West has not displayed great enthusiasm. The industrial powers have their own problems, the bills from the Persian Gulf war are coming in, and the Soviet Union is not as formidable a threat as it once was.
Besides, reluctant officials argued privately, sending money to the Soviet Union as it exists would be like throwing cash down a bottomless well: the old nomenklatura is still clogging the wheels of reform, and the basic conditions for a free market have yet to be created.
To this, Mr. Yavlinsky and like-minded Western analysts answer that it is in the deepest national interest of the Western world to bring the Soviet giant into the fold of civilized nations. Its sheer bulk and vast natural resources are reason enough, they declare, even if the Soviet Union was not a nuclear superpower still capable of considerable mischief. Economic collapse in the Soviet Union would send considerable shocks throughout the world, while a stable democracy and eventual prosperity would strengthen security throughout the world.
The transition to genuine democracy and free enterprise, the advocates continue, would open a market of 270 million souls in a land of rich resources, relatively skilled laborers and low wages. "The Soviet Union is a gigantic field for investment," said Aleksei Zhdanov of the Moscow Finance Institute. "Its development would set off a chain reaction through the entire world economy."
To many Russians, the very notion that there is some question about Western involvement comes as a rude shock. It was a stock presumption among liberals in the dark ages of Communism that the East need only open its doors a crack, and the capitalists would come flooding in.
They did, sort of. The first blush of perestroika brought swarms of Western horse-dealers who rushed to set up "joint ventures." Most of these, however, proved to be no more than short-term gimmicks to make quick profit, often with a corrupt Soviet official as the partner.
The Klondike phase of perestroika, however, at least served to demonstrate to the Soviets that a lot more goes into a free market than wheeling and dealing, and to identify the obstacles in their path. They make an impressive list: primitive infrastructure, gross corruption, massive red tape, shortage of trained personnel, a non-convertible currency, a huge foreign debt, resistance to privatization, absence of a legal structure, popular distrust of business and the free market, political instability, ethnic and social conflicts, run-down agriculture, rampant shortages, erratic supplies, underdeveloped banking, a massive military-industrial complex -- to name only a few.
The overriding problem, argued Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor and advisor to Poland who is currently working with Mr. Yavlinsky, is the Communist monopoly on power. "I do not believe in the feasibility of reforms undertaken exclusively by Communist power," he said. "It's only with democratization that comprehensive and truly radical reform could get started."
Ultimately, the advocates of Western assistance argue, the issue is not where the Soviet Union is headed. The collapse of Communist economies has shown there is no alternative model to democracy and the free market, and East Europe has proven there are no partial reforms. The only question is when.
"I work from the premise that sooner or later the Soviet Union must return to the global community," said Mr. Yavlinsky, "and that it is better done sooner than by force. We cannot achieve this on our own. The West has the huge experience of its own transformation, and now is the moment when it must be used."

Can NASA Make Space Seem Worth The Price?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
SINCE President John F. Kennedy's call to put Americans on the moon, the space program has received strong financial and moral support from a country eager to share in the excitement. Although NASA's image has been on one long slide since the Challenger disaster in 1986, the agency's budget has continued to rise.
It came as a surprise when, on May 15, the House Appropriations subcommittee that controls NASA's budget voted to abandon the space station, the centerpiece of the agency's ambitions for this decade and the next century. Last week, the agency launched a counterattack, flooding Capitol Hill with promotional packets warning that the station's demise would not only impede the advance of knowledge but would hurt Congressional districts. 
 "Businesses Getting Buck$," said the label over a map of the United States. "Space station dollars are spent on the ground!" Noting that the outpost had a "procurement constituency" of more than 2,000 businesses in 40 states, NASA warned that for the Houston area alone, killing the project would mean a loss of 11,100 jobs.
"Cancellation of Space Station Freedom signals THE END of future U.S. manned exploration of space," proclaimed a summary page, which overlooked the fact that the shuttles would still be flying.
With the economy in a slump and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's reputation for technical competence at an all-time low, some aerospace experts say the project may indeed be in danger of cancellation.
"What we're seeing is the most fundamental change in the space program since Sputnik," said William E. Burrows, director of New York University's science reporting program and author of "Exploring Space: Voyages in the Solar System and Beyond." "People are less in a mood to support what they consider to be frivolous projects when they are out of work and being taxed very heavily."
Some NASA supporters say the public is bored with the space program and frustrated that after two decades man still hasn't reached beyond the moon. Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA's administrator during the moon landings, said that by limiting manned missions to the earth's lower orbit, the agency's officials are "setting their sights too low."
Representative Bob Traxler, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House subcommittee that voted to abandon the space station, said the move was necessary because of increased costs for housing, veterans' medical benefits and environmental programs. Nearly $5 billion has already been spent on the station, which is supposed to be launched piecemeal in the mid to late 1990's. Estimates of its total cost over 30 years, including operating expenses, range from $84 billion to more than $180 billion.
The end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet economy have removed much of the impetus for space exploration. After the Soviets launched the first man into orbit, the United States vied to demonstrate technical superiority. The giant space station was to be yet another round in the competition.
But a string of problems has undermined confidence in NASA's ability to carry out large projects. A flawed mirror in the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, fuel leaks in the $25 billion space shuttle fleet, troubles in a new $1.7 billion series of weather satellites and malfunctions in planetary probes have contributed to the notion that the glory days of the space agency are over.
And there is the question of whether the station, the most expensive venture ever undertaken by NASA, is worth the money. At first NASA had planned to use the station to observe the heavens and the earth, to create wonder drugs and miracle metals, to fuel and service spacecraft, and to stage voyages to other planets. But over the years plans for the outpost have been repeatedly scaled back to reduce its sprawling complexity and to try to control its ever-rising costs. Now its modest ambitions include only the study of weightlessness on living things and the creation of new materials.
Many scientific groups, like the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, composed of the heads of 57 science groups, have attacked the project, fearful that its growing appetite for funds will hurt budgets for basic research. Supporters of the station have argued that this position is shortsighted. "We didn't do Apollo for science, but a lot of good science came out of it," said Dr. Jerry Grey, head of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
Despite the outpost's troubles, analysts say that the negative subcommittee vote came so early in the budget cycle that there are many months left for a reversal. President Bush, having suffered repeated setbacks in plans for manned voyages to Mars and the Star Wars anti-missile system, may feel compelled to save the station. Vice President Dan Quayle, who heads the National Space Council, which sets administration space policy, is eager for an issue to call his own. Moreover, tens of thousands of station contractors are ready to fight the cut.
But NASA's biggest problem will be to restore the excitement that once gripped the country, as people rose before dawn and switched on their televisions to watch the first manned voyages. Dr. Hans Mark, a former deputy director of NASA, said, "The country has to have a space station, because we are going to send people around the solar system."

Helmut Kohl, A Bit Smaller Than Larger Than Life

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
WHEN the two parts of Germany reunited last October, the 6-foot-5-inch West German Chancellor appeared to dominate the event, physically and politically. These days, the question frequently asked as Germans struggle to make unity work is: Who let the steam out of Helmut Kohl?
In the east of the nation, his popularity has plummeted, amid wrenching economic dislocation. Addressing a crowd in Halle earlier this month he was pelted with eggs. In the old West Germany, his Christian Democratic Party has lost a string of local elections, as disgruntled Germans punished him for breaking a pledge that they could read his lips -- no higher taxes to pay for unity. There is wrangling in his Government and restlessness among the Free Democrats, his coalition Cabinet's junior partner. 
 The decline is evident in foreign policy. The Persian Gulf weighed on the Chancellor last week when he was in Washington, trying to reassure the Bush Administration about his country's actions, and his own leadership. But Germany's limited gulf role may have been symptomatic of a larger problem for Mr. Kohl. He and his Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a dove during the war, often appear at loggerheads, and political handicaps make it questionable whether the Chancellor can honor pledges to take on greater responsibility in world affairs.
Even while the Kohl Government presses to unite Europe economically and politically, the United States and other German allies wonder whether it can see beyond its internal reunification concerns. Members of his own party lament the leadership's lack of foreign policy acumen. And inside and outside the party, the subject of German unity often runs tandem with doubts that Mr. Kohl has the vision to know where to take it.
People who know the Chancellor, a skillful politician, say that the task of unity and last December's national elections left him exhausted, physically and mentally. Mr. Kohl came to power shortly after Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan did, as Germany, like Britain and the United States, took a lurch to the right in the 1980's. With President Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher gone from the scene, some ask, can Mr. Kohl's exit be far behind?
Mr. Kohl's recent displays of assertiveness show that he won't go down without a fight. Despite internal contentiousness over gulf involvement, he pushed last month to deploy German soldiers to Iran for relief work among the Kurds. Taking on another controversy, he came out forcefully for making Berlin, the heart of the east, the seat of Government and the ministries, and not just Germany's capital in name alone. In a junket through the eastern lands, he terrified his own bodyguards by chasing after the hecklers who hurled eggs at him.
Massaging Parliament, he pushed through large tax hikes and deficit increases in February to finance increased spending in the east. To avoid the inflation that could hollow out the effort, he planted himself firmly in front of the Bundesbank, which has raised interest rates, much to the chagrin of leaders in London, Paris and Washington, whose economies are buffeted by recession.
While he is not compelled to call an election until 1994, there are several possible triggers to a no-confidence measure in the Parliament, among them the mounting unemployment in the east and unrest in the Soviet Union and in central Europe that could spark another wave of burdensome immigration. More bad defeats in local elections, as in the northern city-state of Hamburg in June, could unsettle backbench legislators within Mr. Kohl's own party and among his Free Democratic allies. Another possible route to ouster, being replaced as leader of his party, seems unlikely because there appears to be no challenger in the wings.
His opponents, meanwhile, are emboldened. A recent survey by the weekly Der Spiegel found that if elections were held now, 38 percent of voters would favor the Social Democrats to only 28 percent for the Christian Democrats. And 52 percent of those surveyed said they preferred Bjorn Engholm, the fresh young leader of the Social Democrats, to 46 percent for Mr. Kohl.
It was his miscalculation of how difficult it would be to unite Germany that has most weakened Mr. Kohl. In recent conversations, the German leader has confided to friends that he never believed it possible that the numbers about East Germany's economy could be so wrong. Moreover, Mr. Kohl, a classical politician with gut instincts about his constituency, has had to struggle to grasp eastern Germans, whose values and expectations have been altered through 45 years of Communism.
Mr. Kohl knows that his political future hinges on his ability to rebuild eastern Germany, and to leave western Germany intact in the process. "This is not only checkbook politics, it's genuine reconstruction work," said Michael Sturmer, a historian and confidant of the Chancellor. "And if it doesn't succeed in eastern Germany, it won't succeed anywhere in Eastern Europe."

In Collapse, Ethiopia Calls On Washington

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia

 BODY:
WITH the Army collapsing, the guerrillas descending on the capital, and the fallen dictator in flight from the country, Prime Minister Tesfaye Dinka last week exercised an old Ethiopian reflex: he telephoned the United States Embassy.
Mr. Tesfaye pleaded with the charge d'affaires, Robert G. Houdeck, to communicate to the ethnically based rebels his desire to establish an immediate cease-fire and a coalition government. Mr. Houdeck said he would see what he could do. 
 Washington got in touch with the rebels and worked out arrangements for an emergency evacuation to Israel of thousands of Ethiopian Jews who feared they might be caught in a crossfire in a battle for the capital. But the Americans were not successful in trying to arrange a cease-fire, guaranteeing at least several more days of fighting as the rebels advanced on the capital.
Ethiopia and the United States make an odd couple. Few countries in the world have less in common in terms of culture, relative wealth and political systems. Still, for much of the last five decades, Washington has played a prominent role in this east African country. Once a cold war flash point, as the United States and the Soviet Union vied for influence on the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is no longer of vital interest to Washington. Even so, the American presence here promises to grow ever larger in the weeks ahead as the Bush Administration moves to make peace in order to avert another disastrous famine.
In Ethiopia, as in so much of the third world, the ties of dependency that attached poor countries to either Washington or Moscow were easier to establish than they are now to untie.
While the Government and the rebel groups -- the principal ones are Eritrean separatists and Tigrean-led rebels -- appeared over the weekend to be engaged in a fight to the finish, all sides have agreed for months now that only the United States might have a chance of achieving a mediated solution. With that in mind, Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, was to travel to London as chairman of a peace conference to begin early this week.
President Bush played a decisive role in helping to arrange the airlift last week of 16,000 Ethiopian Jews. But the failure to win a cease-fire underlined the limits of Washington's power. And even achieving a cease-fire would be simple compared with achieving long-term stability in Ethiopia.
The United States would like to see Ethiopia remain unified, but the most powerful guerrilla group demands nothing less than independence for the Red Sea province of Eritrea. Moreover, even a settlement of the current conflict does not guarantee peaceful power-sharing between the rebel groups, which diverge in religion and ethnicity.
"I am concerned about this unrealistic reliance on the United States' capability or will to intervene in this country to resolve the conflict," said Mesfin Wolden Mariam, a retired Ethiopian geography professor who is the foremost expert on famine in the country. Mr. Mesfin said that it was one thing for the United States to engage in a geopolitical struggle, and another to feed Ethiopia's hungry. "There will not be the will to make the huge investment needed," he said. "Many in the United States political system will want to forget us."
The United States showed virtually no interest in Ethiopia until Mussolini invaded in 1935, but after that Emperor Haile Selassie came to be seen by many Americans as a hero in the anti-fascist struggle. After World War II, faced with new competition with the Soviet Union and growing tensions in the Middle East, American policy-makers viewed Ethiopia as a crucial piece of real estate.
 
Charming and Antiquated
 In an effort to gain a stable foothold on the Red Sea, a potential choke point for oil tankers and naval vessels between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, Washington overlooked Haile Selassie's feudal authoritarianism, built up his army, dispatched hundreds of Peace Corps workers, and supported his claims over the rebellious province of Eritrea. Haile Selassie allowed the United States to build a military communications center in Asmara that served as one of Washington's major listening posts in the region through the 1950's and 1960's. American support for the charming but antiquated dictator retarded the kind of political and economic development that Ethiopia needed.
The ties that bound Washington to the Emperor unraveled in the revolutionary currents that swept Africa in the 1970's. Young army officers, many trained in the United States, overthrew the Emperor in 1974. Blaming "American imperialism" for the country's poverty, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam turned to a new sponsor, the Soviet Union.
In time, though, a new wave of change spread first across Eastern Europe, and then into the Soviet Union itself. The Soviets cut their support to Ethiopia over the last two years, leaving Mr. Mengistu a dictator without a patron. Without outside support, his regime was doomed. Today, Ethiopian officials who only a few years ago wore hammer-and-sickle pins on their lapels are now going to the same quarters for advice that Emperor Haile Selassie did before the ill-fated revolution.

HEADLINE: Yes, but Can She Make Them Swoon?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, women assumed that when they became a force in the workplace, they would be judged on their merits rather than their appearance.
But three decades after the dawn of liberation, things have not exactly worked out that way. Indeed, the more successful women have become in infiltrating the male-dominated sphere, the more their looks, clothing and grooming have inspired discussion, litigation and even obsession. 
 There is a stormy debate right now among American women writers and academics about the connection between looks and economic progress, about whether it is all right for feminists to enjoy wearing lipstick and shopping for sensual clothes, about whether women have victimized themselves by inculcating an artificial MTV-Madison Avenue-Vogue standard of youth and beauty that sabotages their ascension in the marketplace.
In her controversial new polemic, "The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women" (William Morrow & Company), Naomi Wolf argues that women have taken on a third shift in their lives: Now they work, they take care of the home, and they try to live up to "the dream language of meritocracy" put forward in women's magazines. ("A gorgeous figure doesn't come without effort," "You can totally reshape your body," "Your facial lines are now within your control.")
Ms. Wolf, a Rhodes scholar and recent Yale graduate, writes about the exploitation and obsession fed by a $20 billion-a-year cosmetics industry, a $33 billion diet industry, a $300 million cosmetic-surgery industry and a $7 billion pornography industry.
Historically, a woman's worth in society has been defined by her youth and beauty. Now, Ms. Wolf and others argue, that standard has been applied to the work place, so that women must compete both romantically and professionally in terms of appearance.
Gloria Steinem, who took a job in the early 1960's as a Playboy Bunny to write an article, came to the conclusion that "All women are Bunnies." Ms. Wolf says that greater success in the office has done nothing to change that equation.
"The working woman was told she had to think about 'beauty' in a way that undermined, step for step, the way she had begun to think as a result of the successes of the women's movement," Ms. Wolf writes. "The closer women come to power, the more physical self-consciousness and sacrifice are asked of them."
 
Darned If You Don't
 Ms. Wolf's premise, considered naive and wrongheaded by some feminists and ground-breaking and brilliant by others, was underscored by a couple of events in the news recently.
In the first, Continental Airlines fired Teresa Fischette from her part-time job at the ticket counter at Boston's Logan International Airport after she refused to comply with the company directive on wearing makeup. After a furor ensued, Continental hired back Ms. Fischette and said that from now on, compliance with the 45-page appearance code would be suggested rather than mandatory.
And The Wall Street Journal reported last week that United States District Judge E. B. Haltom dismissed a suit by a woman who said she lost her job after spurning her boss. The judge sided with the defendant after considering the evidence, which included a picture of the boss's wife to contrast with the plaintiff. His opinion noted that the former employee "wore little or no makeup and her hair was not colored in any way" and therefore, she "was not attractive" to the boss.
In Judge Haltom's view, a woman does not merit sexual harassment if she has not devoted enough time and attention to adorning herself. Of course, if she has, she is vulnerable to the argument that she "asked for" indecent attention from the men in her office or men on the street.
If women are penalized for not looking feminine enough, they are also penalized for looking too feminine. In her book, Ms. Wolf cites several legal cases, including that of a San Francisco policewoman, Nancy Fahdl, who was dismissed because she looked "too much like a lady," and Diaz v. Coleman, in which a dress code of short skirts was set by an employer who allegedly sexually harassed his female employees.
It is, to say the least, a confusing time for professional women.
In the late 1970's, when women were beginning to be assimilated into corporations in large numbers, their bible was John T. Molloy's "Dress for Success." Mr. Molloy believed that women should adopt a masculine uniform, like navy blue suits, little bow ties and oxford shirts, as a way of suppressing distracting sexuality and gaining an equal footing with respect to image.
But as women grew more confident, they stopped emulating men in dress.
 
A Double-Edged Sword
 Many professional women say that dressing with a hint of flirtatiousness, in softly cut silks and satins and cashmeres, has made them feel more powerful, because they can express themselves as individuals rather than camouflaging themselves to look like men. But it is a double-edged sword since studies find that most women who are harassed feel guilty and blame themselves for provoking the comments by dressing "inappropriately."
Ms. Wolf asserts that the fashion industry helped scuttle Mr. Malloy's movement, to the detriment of women. "The consequence of men wearing uniforms where women do not has simply meant that women take on the full penalties as well as the pleasures of physical charm in the workplace, and can legally be punished or promoted, insulted or even raped accordingly," she writes.
Camille Paglia, a professor of humanities at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and the author of "Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson," calls Ms. Wolf's book "a shabby mess" that reinforces American puritanical tendencies.
"Women enjoy color and fabric and fashion and we should not have to apologize for that," Ms. Paglia said. "American feminism has gotten itself in a corner, because it is unable to explain the attraction of women to beauty and pleasure and sexuality."
Ms. Paglia said that it was an ironic surprise to feminists who felt that they were "going to make a perfect world where people would no longer be judged by beauty or talent" to find that "maybe the problems between the sexes can not be solved by passing more regulations."
In a recent issue of Allure magazine, Betty Friedan argues that it is not wrong for feminists to want to be beautiful. "Women could all stop wearing lipstick and blusher, eye shadow and moisturizing cream tomorrow, and I doubt it would help them break through the glass ceiling or get child care or parental leave within the structures of the workplace," she said, adding: "If feminism really meant a war against men -- a repudiation of love and beauty and home and children -- most women would not want it."
In an interview, Ms. Wolf said that her aim is not to tell women how to look; her aim is simply to get rid of the double standard and make sure that women are not demoted or harassed because of their appearance.
"Only women are told 'You've got a choice: you can either be sexual or serious,' " she said. "With men, their seriousness enhances their sexuality. When you tell a woman she must choose, you disempower her. Because it is human to be both sexual and serious."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Richer Rich, Poorer Poor, And a Fatter Green Book

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is spring in Washington. The cherry trees blossom, and a fat Congressional document called the Green Book thumps across the desks of the city's policy wonks. Its itsy-bitsy type whispers of such alluring topics as "Table 3: Poverty by Region, 1989." The wonks call each other and whistle over the revelations.
But this year there's a twist. 
 Calling the volume "a data base for demagogues," Representative Richard Armey, a Texas Republican, is waging a war against the book and its Democratic authors. Having failed in an attempt to stop its publication, he is now distributing warning labels that proclaim it "hazardous to economic health." Among the congressman's complaints is that Table 19 on page 1,306 should at the very least have included an asterisk.
What unfolds is the story of how an obscure Washington institution has matured, and how Democrats in Congress have found a political issue that stings.
For the last 11 years, the Green Book -- its official name -- has enjoyed expanding prominence as the standard reference on a wide range of social programs. In recent volumes, aides on the House Ways and Means Committee, who compile the data, have included tables that outline increasing inequality in the distribution of income. That is the "fairness issue" used so effectively by Democrats in last year's budget debates.
But Mr. Armey contends that the Democratic staff members are cooking the books -- using contrived data about inequality to justify the twin goals of big government and high taxes.
"The Green Book is a demagogic gantry for the whole fairness debate that the left wing of American politics tries to use," he said. And as university scholars increasingly consult its "Marxist, class-conflict" views, he added, "we're building a lot of misinformation into our young people's understanding of our nation."
That's preposterous, said Thomas J. Downey, an influential Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. He calls the book "the bible of social statistics."
Sorting through Mr. Armey's technical critique requires an understanding of the computer models used by the Congressional Budget Office and a grip on such terms as "nominal realized capital gains." But Mr. Armey's attack on the Green Book's intellectual integrity has not attracted a large following.
"I think most analysts would agree that there's an increase in inequality," said Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that is not known for fomenting class conflict. "There is, however, widespread disagreement about the extent of the inequality and about what the policy implications should be."
Since its first volume in 1981, the Green Book has grown from 158 pages to its current 1,641-page, 3.25 pound heft. It is the creation of Wendell Primus, a little-known but influential economist on the Ways and Means staff, who played a prominent role in last year's budget battles but virtually never speaks for the record.
Read it not as an endless succession of footnotes and bar charts but as a novel, and what you have is "Les Miserables" -- a story of the rich getting richer and the poor falling victim to all manner of woes.
The Green Book shows incomes rising fast at the top of the economic spectrum but stagnating or falling at the bottom. And tax policies, by its calculation, have made matters worse. On page 1,306 are the figures Mr. Armey finds particularly irksome. They show that from 1977 to 1988 the incomes of the bottom fifth of American families sank by 13 percent. By contrast, the top fifth of American families earned 27 percent more, while the top 1 percent saw their incomes nearly double.
As for changes in tax policy, they had little effect on the lowest fifth of American families -- their net and gross incomes fell by the same rate of 13 percent. But tax changes brought a boon to those at the very top, stretching their 96 percent pre-tax income gain into a 123 percent after-tax gain. The missing footnote, in Mr. Armey's view, would explain that the Congressional Budget Office, which supplied the figures, failed to adjust capital gains for inflation, and therefore exaggerated the incomes of the wealthiest Americans.
But Robert Reischauer, the budget office director, said he used data from the Internal Revenue Service, and noted its flaws in an accompanying text. No matter how the data are adjusted, he said, the trend would be the same.
But there is fodder in the Green Book for conservatives as well. Worried about sexual mores? The book discloses that the percentage of white 15-year-old girls who have had sexual intercourse jumped from 18 percent in 1982 to 29 percent in 1988. (For blacks the figure dropped from 28 percent to 26 percent.) Troubled by welfare dependency? The Green Book says that 65 percent of those on welfare at any time will stay for eight or more years.
Is it on balance a liberal document? Yes, says Lawrence Mead, a conservative poverty expert at New York University, but more because of what it asks than because of its answers. Mr. Mead said he would like more discussion of family breakdown, and less on the declining impact of Government programs.
"But I'm not saying the numbers are wrong," he said. "It's a very important source."

Caught Between A Rock and The Future

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THE once-thriving Connecticut economy, which pushed per capita income to the highest rungs in the nation in the 1980's, is sputtering on the verge of dramatic change, business leaders and economists say. Few agree on what the future holds, with both optimists and naysayers finding ample statistics to support their positions.
But surprisingly, many agree on the questions that will determine the outcome, and on the belief that the early 1990's will probably be remembered as a watershed for the economy and the vaunted upper-middle-class suburban life style that has become the state's enduring yet fragile symbol. 
 Some of the questions reflect a race against the clock: Can the hundreds of companies dependent on Federal defense contracts and subcontracts -- or about 1 out of every 10 jobs in the state -- diversify fast enough to keep pace with a receding defense budget? How much can the state help, and in which direction should it push with its limited resources? Tourism? Casino gambling? Biotechnology?
Other questions represent unknowns and factors outside Connecticut's control: Will the big banks and insurance companies with their headquarters or technical support operations here expand inside the state or out as the recession ends? Can Fairfield County, home to the largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies outside New York City and Chicago, continue to woo businesses from New York as costs and traffic congestion there rise?
All those questions pale, however, beside the issue that almost every business leader and economist says will establish Connecticut's business environment for the next few years: How will the state come to grips with one of the nation's worst fiscal crises? Connecticut faces a revenue shortfall of more than $2.7 billion in a preliminary budget of about $8.6 billion, and the Legislature is wrestling with drastic solutions -- from an income tax to a huge expansion of the sales tax.
If lawmakers break the state's long tradition and impose an income tax, some business leaders say the allure for highly paid executives and their companies will be lost. Others argue than an income tax is now imperative because it offers the only way to lower business taxes and costs.
"A lot of things have come together," said Kenneth O. Decko, the president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business organization, which favors the income tax. "The economic engines of the state all have real problems. This is a time when we have to look to new answers and new types of industries."
Declines in defense spending were not unexpected, but it has still been a dizzying fall. Total defense expenditures in Connecticut were $4.9 billion in 1990 from $6.7 billion in 1989.
Companies like Data Products New England Inc., a mid-sized electronics manufacturer in Wallingford, are paddling desperately in the turning tide. The company, which depends on the military for every dollar of its $35 million in annual sales, laid off 40 of its 300 employees last year as contracts issued in the 1980's began to play out. This summer, Data Products will make its first foray into the world where people don't salute. Its new product is an adapted military data transmission device.
"There's a changing culture, and we're in great danger of losing what we have if don't get aggressive," said David C. Driver, the executive director of Connecticut Innovations Inc., a quasi-public agency that uses state bond money to invest and encourage diversification in companies like Data Products.
For the white-collar industries that also prospered in the 1980's -- banks, insurance companies, law firms, consultants and the real-estate industry -- economists say the go-go days of the 1980's will never return. The companies that sliced away their middle-management paunch will most likely make do with a reduced work force.
Most business leaders say that efforts to find new niches and wean defense contractors are not enough by themselves. Connecticut now has the highest corporate tax rate in the nation, at 13.8 percent, and the highest statewide sales tax rate, at 8 percent, and about 43 percent of the sales tax is paid by businesses buying products from each other. On Friday the Senate passed a budget that would vastly expand the sales tax, and raise nearly $1 billion.
To many businesses, those numbers dictate a choice. By implementing an income tax to resolve its budget crisis, Connecticut could cut those business taxes and stimulate the economy, according to the Business and Industry Association.
Income-tax opponents say that taxing wages would simply shift the burden to the middle class. They argue that business in Connecticut has always been pulled out of recession when people feel like they have money to spend, and that taking money directly out of people's paychecks will make them feel poorer. The companies clamoring for tax cuts, they say, will simply take the money and run, without creating new jobs in the state.

HEADLINE: Salinas Is Riding a Winning Streak in Mexico

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 25

 BODY:
When word came this week that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had won an international prize for environmental conservation, his opponents here, in the most polluted city in the world, could only shake their heads in awe. Whatever else can be said about him, Mexico's President is on a roll.
Two and a half years after winning office in a bitterly disputed election, Mr. Salinas still carries the checkered legacy of his political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has monopolized Mexican public life for six decades, mixing machine politics with fraud and intimidation as needed. 
 But in his economic policies and nonstop countrywide campaigning, Mr. Salinas has redeemed his image with a string of conspicuous political victories that have left his opponents in disarray.
This week, Mr. Salinas's high-stakes gamble on closer relations with the United States moved toward a historic payoff as the United States Congress granted President Bush expedited authority to negotiate a continent-wide free trade agreement -- one of the keystones in Mr. Salinas's economic plans.
Progress on the crucial free trade issue, moreover, has been matched by other good news, from the Government's windfall oil revenue during the Persian Gulf war to falling inflation to the enormously successful sale of the national telephone monopoly. And for many Mexicans, the President's luck has seemed to spill over into other walks of life.
 
Good Luck Spreads
 "In December, Mexico wins a Nobel Prize, in May, we win the Miss Universe contest," said one senior Government official. "For us, this is all really too good to be true."
As the pieces of Mr. Salinas's aggressive agenda have fallen into place, they have been used to reclaim the popular support his party had forfeited during three generations of pervasive influence on Mexican public life, including continued charges of fraud in recent local elections that ended in lopsided victories for the party, known by its initials in Spanish as the PRI.
The Government's technocratic zeal has been paired with intense, sustained efforts to win back the allegiance of poor and left-wing voters whose defection nearly cost Mr. Salinas and his party their hold on power in the 1988 presidential election.
Since that disputed vote, Mr. Salinas has maintained a grueling schedule of personal appearances, devoting at least two days every week to campaign-style visits to outlying cities and rural towns. He has also established a program of direct Government aid that this year will permit him to distribute nearly $2 billion for politically important local projects outside the framework of the torpid federal bureaucracy.
 
Critics Still Find Fault
 To Government opponents, the aid program, which is often advertised on the radio, television and billboards throughout the country, is little more than a giant Government pork-barrel program intended to improve Mr. Salinas's image with public money. But the President defends the program as an integral part of his economic plans.
"We know that economic recovery is indispensable, but it takes a long time for its benefits to become apparent, especially for the poor," Mr. Salinas said in an interview. "So along with the recovery we needed a program that attends directly to social needs, as an indispensable complement to our orthodox economic policies."
Together with his opening to the United States, which polls show has the support of a large majority of Mexicans, Mr. Salinas's policies have won him a kind of broad public approval that once seemed unthinkable.
But even Mr. Salinas's close advisers admit that fundamental questions remain about whether personal popularity will translate easily into long-term gains for other PRI candidates, either in national midterm elections scheduled for August or in elections that will decide who will succeed him in 1994. Those elections, they say, will be the most important test for a man whose winning streak, for the moment at least, seems to have taken on a life of its own.

HEADLINE: Jacob Clayman, Former Lobbyist and AFL-CIO Official, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Jacob Clayman, a former president of the Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO and retired president of the National Council of Senior Citizens, died Friday at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 86 years old.
He died of a heart attack, said his daughter, Miriam Yale of Silver Spring. 
 At the time of his death, Mr. Clayman was president emeritus of the National Council of Senior Citizens. His last years had been spent lobbying on behalf of the aging and his organization had won major legislative gains in defense of the Social Security System and played an important role in the 1981 White House Conference on Aging.
As a longtime senior official at the AFL-CIO, Mr. Clayman took the lead in its reorganization in the 1970's. He sought ways to coordinate with international unions in dealing with multinational companies.
 
Protest Organizer
 In 1975, as executive director of the Industrial Union Department, he organized the large job rally in Washington to protest high unemployment and press for a nationwide public works program.
Born in Boston, he moved to Niles, Ohio, and worked his way through Oberlin College as a steel worker. He went on to the University of Michigan, receiving a law degree in 1930.
He began practicing law in Detroit, then returned to Niles, where he practiced labor law. In 1941, he was elected to the Ohio Legislature.
In 1943, he became general counsel to the Ohio State Congress of Industrial Organizations and was elected full-time secretary treasurer of the organization in 1948. He served in that post until the organization merged with the American Federation of Labor in 1955. After the merger, he was named special assistant to the president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in New York.
He returned to Ohio in 1958 to take part in labor's successful fight against a proposed anti-union law. He then served the Ohio State AFL-CIO as its representative at the State Legislature and practiced law with his bother, David, in Columbus.
Mr. Clayman was appointed the administrative director of the Industrial Union Department in 1960.
A founder of the Consumer Federation of America, he was named the first president of the advocacy group in 1968. He also served on the board of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, president of the National Civil Liberties Clearing House and vice president of the American Immigration and Citizenship Conference.
He is survived by his wife, Helen, of Silver Spring; two daughter, Miriam and Cece Kurtz of Denver; two brothers, Philip of Columbia, Md., and David of Columbus; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Heir to Tragedy;
India Confronts Gandhi's Death And Flawed Legacy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
WHEN Rajiv Gandhi reached out to meet the people on a tropical night last week in southern India, and was instead killed by a bomb, he was nearing the end of an intense political campaign built on the theme of stability. Only the Congress Party, he had said over and over again, could bring the country unity and peace.
Kashmir in revolt, Punjab in distress, an economy in peril, violence in the streets -- all these, Mr. Gandhi told election rallies from the Himalayas to the Kerala shore, had been caused by non-Congress Governments in just the 18 months since the voters turned him out of the Prime Minister's office. 
 When the history of the Rajiv Gandhi years is written, the story may well be very different. Half a century of politics dominated by a dynasty founded by Motilal Nehru, a revolutionary whose son Jawaharlal became India's first Prime Minister, has left India with a troubling agenda for the future. Whoever comes to power this year will face problems that go beyond even the violence Mr. Gandhi pointed to. These have been building like monsoon clouds through four decades of essentially one-party, one-family rule. Since 1947, there have been only four years in which the Government was not held by the Congress Party, and only five brief periods when someone outside the Nehru-Gandhi family ran India.
 
Inefficiency and Mistrust
 The dynasty has left a political culture shaped to its own requirements. The nation is over-centralized; there is an urgent need to restore fiscal and administrative responsibilties to the states if further separatism is to be avoided. What Indians call "the Congress culture" has also meant corruption and criminality in politics. Both lowly clerks and members of Parliament are bought and sold with the help of money from industrial houses seeking privileges and immunities. Public confidence in the democratic system is absent, as are accountability and a modicum of ethical standards among public officials.
India also needs a comprehensive review of its economy and clear guidelines for development. Years of trying to balance the need for economic liberalization with traditional state planning and protectionism have created monsters of inefficiency in public and private sectors. Mr. Gandhi and his successor as Prime Minister, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, began the review process, but much more needs to be done if India is to sell to the world -- or communicate well with it.
New Delhi still clings to a vaguely defined nonalignment that now teeters on the edge of extinction. It awaits a foreign policy review that will take into account the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the emergence of a new power alignment led by the United States, Japan and Europe.
And the world's second most populous nation is still growing too fast for its resources. Half of its 844 million people barely survive, condemned to inadequate housing, illiteracy and malnutrition. The rising aspirations of the lower castes and outcastes cry out to be addressed. So do the tensions created by a resurgent Hinduism. In an interview minutes before he died, Mr. Gandhi spoke of the urgent need to improve the quality of life in India, the source of so much political frustration and violence.
 Mr. Gandhi came to power in 1984, hours after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the election that followed, a wave of sympathy swept him into office in his own right. He promised change, modernization, new ideas in education for the disadvantaged, and no more political power brokers. Critics and supporters alike credit him with good instincts about what India needed, but they add that he often lacked the will to see the changes through.
Meanwhile, rural development and alleviating urban poverty moved from high-priority tasks to matters of crisis. Since Mr. Gandhi took office in 1984, more than 100 million new Indians have been born, and most live near or below subsistence.
Mr. Gandhi's "general initiatives were good," said Nikhil Chakravarty, editor of the left-wing journal Mainstream, in an interview. "But he did not have the tenacity of a great political leader. He started without having any great interest in politics. Later, he developed a flamboyant way of looking at problems superficially, suggesting solutions that were not followed through."
The roots of the present standoff in Kashmir can be found in decisions by Mrs. Gandhi in 1983 and by her son in 1987 to tamper with state politics for the short-term advantage of the Congress Party. A rigged election in 1987 drove flocks of young people into the arms of separatism, and the discontent in Kashmir is now the most serious threat to India's national integrity.
 
Missteps Abroad
 In international affairs, the 1980's were also years of missed opportunities or missteps. Indians have come to be considered the gringos of South Asia, a reputation that has outlived even the promises by Mr. Gandhi's successor as Prime Minister, Mr. Singh, that there will be no more dirty tricks. Mr. Chakravarty said Mr. Gandhi went wrong in deciding to send an Indian peace-keeping force to Sri Lanka in 1987 to disarm a Tamil separatist army, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. That group was put high on the list of suspects in Mr. Gandhi's assassination.
India's initial support for the Tamil guerrillas, an intelligence operation begun by Indira Gandhi, still rankles in Colombo. Bangladesh got the brushoff over attempts to organize an international meeting on flooding of the Himalayan rivers, Nepal was bludgeoned by a trade embargo, andIndian troops landed in the little nation of Maldives to put down a coup without involving or in some cases informing their regional neighbors.
On the other hand, Ramesh Chandran, foreign editor of The Times of India, said an achievement often overlooked was Mr. Gandhi's rapproachment with China, which set in motion a series of meetings between the two nations. "With the United States, there has been all this talk about how he got along with George Bush, but the U.S. is still a problem area for us," Mr. Chandran said.
A bright spot in the legacy of Rajiv Gandhi, for many Indians, is that he created an impulse to look outward from a nation that had always found it hard to shake the myths of its romantic and mystical past. Not ashamed to wear jeans and drive a fast car, he appealed to the imagination of a new generation of Indians impatient with the asceticism, puritanism and zealous self-reliance enshrined in the legacy of Mohandas K. Gandhi.
Today, with Rajiv Gahdi's death, this new evolving urban middle class has its own forebodings. "On that field in Tamil Nadu," says Rajiv Desai, the American-educated head of a public affairs company, "the dream of a generation that was open to the world died. With him gone, I see a black hole. The rest are so inward looking that I'm afraid India is going to become another Burma."

HEADLINE: France Places Its Bets On High Technology

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
WITH its 180-mile-an-hour Train a Grande Vitesse, France is the world leader in high-speed trains, and the Concorde makes it, with Britain, the leader in supersonic passenger planes. Obtaining two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power, France is arguably No. 1 in reactor technology. The Ariane satellite-launching program that it leads and Airbus, the Toulouse-based aircraft consortium, are strong competitors for American aerospace companies, while the Mirage 2000 fighter and Exocet missile are among the most sophisticated and sought-after wares in the world's arms bazaar.
 This land of medieval chateaus and musty champagne cellars, recognizing that it cannot live on the glories of yesteryear, has developed a mania for high-technology projects. While skeptics mock these projects as expensive status symbols, French officials say they are indispensable for keeping their nation competitive with the United States and Japan. Indeed, despite its modest size and population, this nation of 56 million has often kept up with the Americans and Japanese on the forefront of technology. 
Now France's tough-talking new Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, has promised to redouble the nation's high-tech efforts, especially in electronics. She has repeatedly said that for France to remain a political and military power, it must increase its industrial might. "Safeguarding and promoting industry will be my priority," Mrs. Cresson said last week.
 Long before she came to power, French officials were doing their utmost to promote technologies of the future, unabashedly using industrial policy and heavy subsidies to help such industries as aerospace and computers. They also used protectionism, placing quotas on Japanese cars and televisions, for example. "Industry does not grow spontaneously like a mushroom in autumn," Roger Fauroux, a former Industry Minister, said recently. It needs, he said, "a favorable environment and intelligent help from the state."
 And Mrs. Cresson has promised to do far more than her predecessor, Michel Rocard. Last October, she resigned her post in Mr. Rocard's Government, saying his approach toward industry was far too laissez-faire, although by American standards he would be considered a heavy-handed dirigiste. Last month, his Government announced plans to pump $1 billion into Groupe Bull, France's No. 1 computer maker. Similarly, it sank more than $500 million into Thomson, the nation's leading consumer and military electronics group, to help it develop high definition television. Japanese electronics companies, like American aerospace concerns, say these subsidies give companies like Bull and Airbus an unfair advantage.
 Mrs. Cresson is now promising to help establish a European Electronics Community that would tie manufacturers closer together so they could battle the Japanese more effectively. She has long crusaded against Japan, saying its manufacturers "don't play by the rules" and have "a desire to conquer the world." She is particularly concerned that if the Japanese knock the Europeans out of the semiconductor and computer fields, it will imperil crucial industries that depend on electronics, like aerospace and automobiles. "France is one of the few countries that recognizes the strategic stakes for industry and, in particular, the stakes involved in electronics," said Alain Gomez, Thomson's chairman.
 Mrs. Cresson is such an advocate of protection that some people call her a prime minister for producers rather than consumers. Her critics say quotas on Japanese goods hurt consumers by reducing competition. She replies that when Japanese companies capture a market and wipe out local jobs, they then jack up prices, and the consumer is worse off. Many experts say Japanese semiconductor makers are doing just that.
 France's heroic efforts at state intervention have often fallen flat, however. While the Concorde is a technological wonder, it has been a commercial disaster, with only 14 of the aircraft sold. And France has won just one contract to export the T.G.V., to neighboring Spain. For decades, the Government has maneuvered to create a formidable computer producer, by pumping in money and merging manufacturers, but the state-owned Bull company is in parlous shape.
 
Few Protests
 Still, few Frenchmen seem to protest dirigisme. "Without the Government's help, Bull would have disappeared from the scene years ago," said Jean-Louis Perrault, a technology professor at the University of Rennes. French officials say state intervention is needed to offset longstanding competitive handicaps. The United States has a much bigger domestic market, they say, giving American corporations a larger base over which to spread research and development costs; Japanese companies, they add, get a huge advantage from low interest rates and the cozy relationships between banks, manufacturers and government.
 Recognizing that France is too small to do everything on its own, Government officials have spearheaded efforts to create European-wide projects, for example Airbus, a four-nation consortium that is the world's No. 2 passenger-aircraft manufacturer after Boeing. France is also the dominant force behind Ariane, the 11-nation satellite-launching venture. To shield Thomson's small semiconductor operations from the Japanese, the Government pushed state-owned Thomson to link up with Italy's largest chip maker, S.G.S. "One of my major priorities will be to promote a European industrial policy," says Mrs. Cresson.
 Many experts say high-tech dirigisme has inherent limitations. "The French are very good at long-term projects, like Airbus and the T.G.V., that require state-of-the-art technology, where competition is not too strong and where there are well-defined challengers," said Arnoud De Meyer, a technology professor at INSEAD business school outside Paris. But he said France, like America, has done poorly in translating high-tech advances into consumer product successes.
 State intervention, says Michel Fouquin, a French economist, "isn't very efficient in hypercompetitive markets with standard products, like televisions."

HEADLINE: Companies Furlough Thousands of Employees

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AT the Stanley Works in New Britain, production got ahead of orders late last year, leading the company to give all its employees a furlough -- time off without pay -- during the week before Christmas.
"Furloughs allow us to maintain benefits for the employees while adjusting the work force to the level of orders coming in," said Patricia R. McLean, a spokeswoman for Stanley, which employs 2,300 people in five divisions in Connecticut. "We can adjust the inventory by not having workers in the factory, and maintaining an inventory is expensive to any company." 
 The furloughs worked so well, she said, that the company has used them several times since, for smaller numbers of workers.
An increasing number of employers in Connecticut are using furloughs, rather than layoffs, when business slows down.
 
Action by State Averted
 The Delco Moraine division of General Motors, in Bristol, furloughed one-fourth its 800 workers for a week four months ago. O. Z. Gedney Company, a foundry in Plymouth, furloughed more than 70 percent of its 530 workers about the same time. And Wescorp Inc. in East Lyme, which manufactures machinery for the computer industry, has furloughed about two-thirds of its 76 employees until production needs climb, perhaps as long as six weeks, the company said.
Hamilton Standard, aircraft-repair company in Windsor Locks became the latest employer to use furloughs as a way of getting through a slow period, when it announced in mid-May that it would furlough as many as 150 employees over the next three months. The company said reduced air travel meant less work, so it reached an agreement with its machinists union to furlough 50 employees for as long as 30 days beginning on May 24. Another 100 employees will be told when their furloughs will start within the next few months.
The state government briefly considered, furloughs for its employees, until their unions agreed to a wage freeze, changes in health benefits and $190 million in savings on their pension plan.
"We had been talking about closing state offices two days a month," said Avice A. Meehan, a spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. "But with the agreement in place, there is no need to shut down."
Advocates of furloughs cite their benefits for employer and employee. The employer cuts payroll expenses to get through a slow period, controls inventory and has a trained work force ready to recall when business picks up. The employees' health and pension benefits continue, and they can collect unemployment compensation.
C. Richard Ficks, a spokesman for the state Labor Department, said people who are furloughed are eligible for immediate benefits. "They are available and willing to work but unable to do so, so they meet the requirements," he said.
 
'Some Degree of Security'
 Unemployment benefits equal 50 percent of a person's regular pay, up to $270 a week, and because the records are now computerized, there is almost no lag in payments, state officials said. If someone is furloughed on a Friday and comes in on Monday to apply for benefits, the first check would arrive in the mail the following week, they said.
"Also, furloughs are by definition temporary in nature, so they allow the employee some degree of security for the immediate future," said Robert D. Noonan, an employment consultant for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
"Employers need to adopt different strategies to accommodate the ebbs and flows in business demand," Mr. Noonan said. "Each employment decision made is costly. Particularly as jobs become more specialized, the recruiting process becomes more expensive, and employers are looking for ways to avoid the 'hire and layoff' cycle."
Paul R. Kumar, a spokesman for the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said unions have not taken a formal stand on the concept of furloughs. "But if they're done in a way that's fair, that has some respect for seniority and for the contract, I have no problem with them," he said.
Some employers, however, use furloughs "as hidden givebacks," Mr. Kumar said. "It seems easy to say, 'Take one day off a month.' And it seems kind of light. But for some people, that means almost 5 percent of their pay."
 
No Simple Approach
 Mr. Kumar noted that furloughs may allow a company to accommodate the often-conflicting demands of seniority with relatively new affirmative-action programs. Under most union contracts, the last in would be the first out in the event of a layoff, he said, but that could wipe out years of minority recruiting.
"There is no simple, one-shot approach to the issue of furloughs," Mr. Kumar said. "These things depend on the specific contract in force and the long-term goals of the bargaining unit."
Furloughs are not a new concept. Heublein Inc., the spirits manufacturer with headquarters in Farmington, has long used furloughs just after Christmas, said a spokesman, Jack Shea.
"In our business, there's always a big push before the holidays," he said. "Then things slow down for a while after that. Furloughs are something we have done for years."
The most recent furloughs affected about 50 Heublein employees at the company's Hartford plant for several weeks, he said, but they have been recalled.
"The slow period doesn't last very long," Mr. Shea said. "We're not in a situation now where we need to be considering either furloughs or layoffs."
 
'We Might Try Again'
 Michael J. Cheshire, president of O. Z. Gedney in Plymouth, said he was looking at the calendar last year when he realized thatChristmas week would be a good time to shut down the factory and bring inventory under control.
He had already given his employees Christmas and Christmas Eve off, he said, so that left three days in the work week. Some senior employees used vacation time, he said.
"It worked well, so well that furloughs are something we might try again," Mr. Cheshire said. "Christmas is on a Wednesday this year, so we could do the same thing."
Mr. Cheshire said he has not heard criticism of the furloughs, in part because such a short time was involved, and because people got enough notice to plan for it.
"You have to be creative today to keep a company going," Mr. Cheshire said. "It's not in anyone's interest to lock into the old rules."

HEADLINE: Towns Seeking Cuts In Wages and Benefits

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
STAMFORD is one of the few towns in the state where residents' trash is still collected from their backyards. But that could change as a result of contract concessions accepted by municipal workers. Last month the employees, represented by the teamsters union, agreed to curbside pickup along with the elimination of up to 25 of the city's 85 sanitation jobs.
Stamford's assistant personnel director, Steven A. Harman, said the union accepted the reduced work force rather than risk a decision by the city to hire a private contractor to collect household garbage. Other concessions by public employees are being discussed in Stamford and in dozens of other communities in Connecticut, following the recent agreement of state employees to a package of reductions in wages and benefits that would save an estimated $328 million and thousands of jobs. Municipal governments are seeking to re-open contracts that were negotiated in better times and adjust them to reflect the tight economy. 
 A spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, Kevin Maloney, said that more than 50 towns sent representatives to a recent seminar on "Negotiating Givebacks in Municipal Collective Bargaining."
 
Expensive Clauses
 John A. Sabanosh, a lawyer in Bridgeport, said that the number of municipalities that have retained him to represent them in bargaining has increased almost 20 percent in the past year.
"More towns are hiring attorneys to do their negotiating, because they realize the wording of their contracts can cost them real money," Mr. Sabanosh said. "Towns have never been quite as well prepared to negotiate a contract as the unions have been. Unions have been very well prepared, and it's reflected in the provisions they have won."
In Hartford, where demands for givebacks are reportedly part of the contract talks with firefighters and supervisory employees, the personnel administrator, Gordon R. Distin, said, "Most unions recognize the budget constraints this year."
But Thomas P. Mondani, executive director of the Connecticut Education Association, one of the largest teachers' unions in the state, said he will not recommend givebacks under any circumstance.
"Our general advice to affiliates is that there should not be any renegotiation," Mr. Mondani said. "Many contracts were agreed to years ago on the agreement that teachers would get less in the early years in exchange for more later. To go back on those contracts now would place all those gains in jeopardy." Even though municipal budgets are largely in place, most towns continue to seek givebacks, officials said, because if they cannot negotiate concessions, layoffs may be necessary.
In Stamford, for instance, the budget approved by the Board of Finance would cut 150 of 1,500 municipal positions, and those employees have already been notified, said Mr. Harman. "If we're able to achieve some givebacks, obviously we can rescind some of those layoff notices," he said. "But until that happens, we are proceeding on the basis that those layoffs will take place at the end of this fiscal year, June 30."
In several large towns, concessions have been won on some contract provisions that increase costs. In several towns, sanitation workers have agreed to changes in job descriptions that will reduce their numbers, while police officers and firefighters in many communities are considering reducing the number of people on a shift. In Hartford, the city won the right to close 2 of the 20 fire stations. In many instances, Mr. Distin said, towns are now trying to change contract language that was written years ago, often under dramatically different circumstances. For instance, Hartford long had a contract clause that gave full pay in addition to workers' compensation benefits to employees who are injured on the job.
"Historically, city employees earned a lot less than their counterparts in private industry, so benefits like that were developed to attract them to municipal jobs," Mr. Distin said. "But of course, that's no longer the case. Municipal employees are paid fairly competitively now."
 
Towns Look for Savings
 Mr. Sabanosh said the same applied to "past practice" clauses, which guaranteed that workers could block money-saving changes like reducing the size of a road crew.
Many towns that have been paying the full cost of employees' health coverage are now trying to get the workers to pay part of the premiums or accept a larger deductible, Mr. Sabanosh said.
"Towns are not out to get employees," he said. "But what they are trying to do is, through legitimate means, reduce their budgets."
Waterbury's chief labor negotiator, Jack R. Giacomi, said, "We're conducting informal discussions with the unions right now with regard to -- I hate to use the term givebacks or concessions -- let's say deferrals whereby the city and the employees could benefit." He said the city is considering furloughs, early retirements and wage deferrals.
"Most of the unions seem willing to work with the city, Mr. Giacomi said. "But at the same time, they're looking to protect their membership."
Sanitation workers in Waterbury have already agreed to some givebacks estimated to save almost $1 million a year, Mr. Giacomi said. "This fiscal crisis has brought the unions and the cities closer together in many instances," he said. "It's in everyone's interest to try to work things out."
The state's labor relations director, Peter W. Allen, said, "What we've seen is, you have to convince the unions that you have no choice, that if the givebacks are not approved, there will be layoffs."
 
Unions 'Might Reconsider'
 Small towns, too, are trying to win some contract concessions, said the executive director of the Council of Small Towns, Charles J. Duffy. In his member municipalities, the largest bargaining unit is usually the teachers, he said, "and so far the requests to the teachers' unions have been universally rebuffed."
But when the legislature passes a budget that cuts aid to education, and teachers' unions are faced with layoffs, the situation might change, he said.
"Under those circumstances, I think you'd see virtually every school board going back to the unions to negotiate givebacks," Mr. Duffy said. "If a small town is looking at the loss of a million dollars in state aid, it's got no choice but to cut staff, if they can't get concessions, and the bargaining units might reconsider their position."
But Mr. Mondani of the teachers' union said that even if the legislature cuts local education grants, he has urged his local affiliates to respond cautiously to any suggestions of givebacks.
"Reopening contracts does not remove the threat of layoffs," he said. "You could reopen the contract, give back the money, and positions and programs could still be cut."
Mr. Mondani said he would prefer to see solutions like the early-retirement program that was created to save money in the school district that includes Deep River, Essex and Chester.
"It's very easy to say, 'Everybody take a pay cut, and there won't be any layoffs,' " he said. "But what happens next year, and the next?
"We understand times are tough. But the solutions being offered are too simple. If everyone takes a cut in pay, that's not going to help the economy get better or improve education. We need more long-term solutions."

HEADLINE: A la Carte: Quality on Weekdays at Low Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD SCHOLEM

 BODY:
LONG ISLAND restaurants have always been good buys compared with their cousins in Manhattan. The recession seems to have further widened the gap between the Big Apple and the Island.
Most bargain-basement possibilities occur on weekdays and appear on menus as special meals of one sort or another. Although there are many such offerings, a few are at extraordinary restaurants and therefore mean unusual quality and low prices. 
 One such place is the Bellport at 159 South Country Road in Bellport. It has received a rating of excellent in a review in The New York Times. Each Monday their three-course recession special for $10.50 is an outstanding value. It includes the usual soup or salad, entree and dessert, but the choices available are not commonly found in economy meals.
One week the soups were rabbit or black bean. The entree was seafood croquets, and the dessert strawberry shortcake.
Although waterfront dining on Long Island is usually an expensive experience, Co Co's Water Cafe, at 117 New York Avenue on Huntington Harbor, offers a sensational nautical setting at a modest price. A lightning lunch of soup, salad and a pita sandwich costs only $5.95. It is served in 10 minutes, though most diners will want to linger for much longer, to take in the agreeable marine atmosphere. Daily Monday-through-Thursday specials are also a boon.
Mondays mean unlimited pasta and salad for $7.95, and on Tuesdays a healthy portion of baby back ribs with cole slaw and fried onions are served for that price. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, the price advances $2, to $9.95, but so does the level of the ingredients. Wednesday is surf-and-turf time at Co Co's. Two topflight choices are available, either a one-pound lobster with sirloin steak or shrimp Francais and steak. A 12-ounce prime-rib dinner, complete with soup or salad and mashed or baked potatoes, is the Thursday fare.
What was a rundown neighborhood bar on the water in Centerport, is now a nifty new restaurant, Rock Hoppers Pub. Early bird specials cost $9.95 or $10.95 and include soup, salad and potato. Two recent listings were penne primavera and mesquite or teriyaki grilled chicken.
Rock Hoppers is a modern amalgam of paneling, polished brass, fresh flowers and frosted glass. Picture windows facing Centerport Harbor let diners watch gulls soar as ducks and swans swim by. Rock Hoppers has aspirations well beyond pub grub. Often, though not always, it achieves them. When Rock Hoppers succeeds, it is because it has a sense of adventure that results in interesting dishes, and there is a commitment to using the finest, freshest ingredients available.
Among the other successes at are zesty peppy chicken fingers with a soothing creamy dipping sauce; lamb persielle, three tender chops from a rack of lamb with parsley and truffle sauce, and seafood-stuffed filet of sole in a white lemon-cream sauce. Pastas are rich and bountiful, but somewhat bland.
At lunch, an adventurous spirited spot like this more than does justice to straightforward standards like burgers and fries. Regular dinner prices range from $13 to $19.95. Unfortunately, Rock Hoppers takes reservations only on holidays. Long waits, especially on weekends, can result. It is at 99 Center Shore Road in Centerport.
Fun, rather than frugality will be the watchword at the second Long Island Barrel Tasting and Barbecue at Bedell on Main Road in Cutchogue on Aug. 17. From 5 to 7 P.M., 13 Island vineyards will conduct a tasting, accompanied by hors d'oeuvres from leading restaurants. At 7 P.M. there will be a sit-down dinner catered by the exceptional Starr Boggs Restaurant in Westhampton Beach. The ingredients used in the meal will all be grown or produced on Long Island.
Dancing under the stars is included in the $100-a-person tab. The event is co-sponsored by the Long Island Wine Council and the Wine Spectator Magazine. Proceeds go to the Stony Brook Foundation for Lyme Disease.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Why the 'Hudson Hawk' Budget Soared So High

BYLINE: By JAMES GREENBERG; James Greenberg writes about the entertainment industry for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"Hudson Hawk," a $51 million action comedy starring Bruce Willis, produced by Joel Silver and filmed on locations ranging from the Brooklyn Bridge to Budapest, is either an example of free-spending folly or the kind of grand entertainment that will always be a part of Hollywood. It depends on whom you ask.
Even at that lofty price, "Hudson Hawk," which opened Friday to some unenthusiastic reviews, is not the costliest film of the summer. That honor belongs to the forthcoming "Terminator 2," which, at $85 million, may well be the most expensive film ever made. That movies cost too much to make is an old story. But with budgets becoming alarmingly expensive, productions are being scrutinized as never before, both by industry executives and the public. 
 From the start, "Hudson Hawk," with its assortment of strange mechanical devices and global locations, resembled a Jules Verne novel more than a movie, says Daniel Waters, who shares the screenwriting credit with Steven E. de Souza. Plans called for filming in Rome, Budapest, London, New York and Los Angeles. The sheer logistics of transporting a film company around two continents, constructing elaborate props and executing exacting stunts and action sequences, including a chase on the Brooklyn Bridge and a flight in a Renaissance glider, dictated a costly undertaking.
Add a script that was constantly being rewritten, an inexperienced director who has said on record that he was often challenged by his high-priced star, and a producer with a reputation for extravagance, and the formula seems written for a film destined to exceed its budget.
Mr. Willis and Mr. Silver had teamed up twice before, to make "Die Hard" (1988) and the sequel, "Die Hard 2" (1990), which also ran over budget and wound up costing a reported $70 million. "If you put Joel Silver at the helm of a movie, you know you're going to get a film made the Joel Silver way," says Michael Dryhurst, the co-producer of "Hudson Hawk." "And that's a large way."
Film making is neither an exact science nor a precise art. Rather, it is a process of assembling hundreds of elements in the hope that somehow they all fit together. But things invariably go wrong: actors leave, locations change, scripts are rewritten and budgets soar. In some ways, "Hudson Hawk" was no different from any other production, except that it came at a time when cost-consciousness was a major concern in the film industry.
Although Mr. Dryhurst believes that the budget and schedule assigned by Tri-Star Pictures were realistic, he notes that there is no reason why a film budgeted at, say, $30 million must cost $30 million. "A budget is a projection that reflects the cost of putting the written word up on the screen," he says, "and it is as accurate as one can ever get it. But you don't actually know the cost of a movie until it's been delivered."
"Hudson Hawk" was budgeted at about $42 million. The final cost varies according to who is talking. Within the film industry, speculation has put the figure as high as $70 million, but individuals who worked on the production say it is closer to $51 million. "We didn't go much over," says Mr. Silver. "I don't know where these numbers come from. It's like the lottery; they just get a number and say that's what it cost."
According to Mr. Silver, the production barely went beyond the 81-day shooting schedule. But others who worked on the film insist that shooting dragged on for 106 days, a delay that contributed to excess costs. "It was union heaven," says one crew member, who would speak only on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Willis says: "These backstage things seem to be very interesting to people. I've read five reviews of the budget of this film. What you have to understand is we're not out there spending other people's money hand over fist. We're trying as hard as we can to make an entertaining film."
If Mr. Willis sounds a bit protective of the film, it may be because it's based on an idea he nurtured for 12 years. The character of Hudson Hawk, a wisecracking cat burgler from New Jersey, originated in a song Mr. Willis wrote with his friend Robert Kraft when they were living in New York. The plot involves a scheme to reconstruct a machine supposedly designed by Leonardo da Vinci to transform lead into gold. (In reality, Leonardo hated alchemy).
 
Getting Started
A Willis Song, And Off to Europe
 "He had this fantasy of going to Europe and traveling around the continent and making this picture in kind of a hip James Bond style," says Mr. Silver of Mr. Willis. "So we all got together and did it."
Adds Mr. Dryhurst: " 'Hudson Hawk' was conceived on a very broad canvas. The moment you put people into airplanes and hotel rooms, you're into money. We were supporting a cast and crew of 100 people in Italy for 12 weeks and Budapest for 4 weeks. You're paying for hotel rooms, location, food and per diems. And support costs in Europe are much higher."
Heavy expenses, including hotel rooms at $200 a night, weren't the only problems in Italy. Mr. Silver brought a priest to the set to bless the start of production, but even that didn't make things go smoothly. Someone had to be hired solely to get work permits from the police, and unofficial payments had to be made to untangle the bureaucracy. The Italian crew also had their own idea about what constituted a workday.
"This thing was set and scheduled according to a regular Hollywood 13-hour shooting day, and it just doesn't happen there," says Mr. Willis. "In retrospect, we never should have gone there."
By comparison, production in Budapest was easy, although the exterior scenes originally scheduled to be shot there were cut from the script. Filming took place in Hungary only because three months had been spent constructing an enormous set there for the finale, involving the gold machine. That prop, built in England for about $1 million, was so large, with all kinds of flywheels, gears and chutes attached, that it had to be transported using five 20-foot-long trucks. Shooting in Budapest was regarded as an economy measure since renting an English stage large enough to house the gold machine would have been prohibitive.
Once in Budapest, the production encountered a transportation strike that slowed work one weekend. Accustomed to much more modest productions, the Hungarian industry had trouble accommodating the film's needs. "It's another place we ran into extra costs because we had to bring in materials from Germany or the U.K. because they just didn't exist in Hungary," says Mr. Dryhurst. "Even pigment for paint had to come from England."
 
The Turmoil
New Personnel, and That Script
 Unexpected personnel changes also caused the production to lose time. Six weeks into the shooting, Mr. Silver, hoping to speed a production that was already two weeks behind schedule, replaced the Dutch cinematographer Jost Vacano with the Italian Dante Spinotti. More time was lost when the lead actress, Maruschka Detmers, was stricken with fainting spells and was replaced by Andie MacDowell. When Ms. MacDowell arrived in Rome, however, she sat around for three weeks waiting to shoot her relatively small role, due to poor scheduling.
But perhaps the biggest drain on the production was a screenplay that never seemed to be completed. Although Mr. Silver insists that "we pretty much shot the script we started with," others saw the matter differently.
"One of the problems we had was the script, which had a number of changes as we went along." says Mr. Dryhurst. "That's always a recipe for difficulty, because you can't plan. The script was being adjusted right up until the middle of November, when we were within three weeks of completion. It's basically extra cost, because the script wasn't locked in. Unfortunately, that's quite common today."
Mr. Waters says: "We always had an idea of what the final film would be and were playing around with disparate elements. A normal movie, of course, would have taken care of the ending and then started shooting. On that count we're guilty of irresponsibility, but in the end the movie we got is the movie we set out to make."
 
The Big Question
Who'd Appreciate the Humor?
 "Hudson Hawk" was never intended to be a pure action film. Instead, it attempted to use conventions of the genre, such as menacing villains and elaborate chases, in a more self-consciously playful fashion. Michael Lehmann, who had directed two low-budget films, including "Heathers," the black comedy about teen-age suicide, was recruited, along with Mr. Waters, to integrate a hip, irreverent sensibility into the framework of a large-scale action picture.
Mr. Waters recalls watching footage after each day's work and hearing Mr. Silver call out, "It's like a Hope-Crosby picture," and the next day, "It's like 'The Pink Panther' " or "It's a 90's James Bond movie." No one really knew what the finished film would be like or whether anyone else would appreciate its iconoclasm and humor. "It's unheard of doing a big-budget film without a specific hook, and that's where we ran into weirdness," says Mr. Waters. "A lot of things were shot, and that probably didn't help from a budgetary standpoint."
Like a maniacal clown, says Mr. Waters, Mr. Willis would come to the set with a bag of tricks, new ways of playing a scene and bits of business for his character to try out. While that may have been a fine idea creatively, two high-ranking members of the production staff acknowledged that it delayed production and seemed to erode Mr. Lehmann's authority. The director admits that "Hudson Hawk" was his first venture with a major and powerful producer. "I think I had to find my way in the process," he says, but looking at the completed picture, Mr. Lehmann says he believes he was given the support to do it the way he wanted to, especially in the editing room. Others involved in the production differ.
"I think everyone knew that Bruce was in charge," says one crew member who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "There was no mistaking it. Michael might suggest a dolly shot, for instance, and Bruce would say, 'That's no good; let's do this.' And we'd have to make the adjustment and do it Bruce's way. In the beginning, Michael fought it very heavily."
Mr. Dryhurst notes, "The mere fact that you're doing something to satisfy two points of view added to the cost."
 
Winding Down
Did the Budget Fly Too High?
 In Mr. Willis's view, whatever was said in the heat of battle was part of the process and was intended to benefit the finished product. "All films are made by intense collaboration, and this wasn't anything different," he says. "Everyone thinks there's a hidden dark story about how this film was shot, but there weren't any incredible screaming matches. There really isn't a story there."
In the spirit of presenting a unified front for the film's release, or perhaps as a result of having come to terms with the realities of big-time Hollywood film making, Mr. Lehmann has retreated from earlier published remarks that indicated frustration with the dynamics on the set. While on location, he told Premiere magazine that "what I say doesn't necessarily go. . . . I found that to be confrontational and extremely unproductive."
He now suggests that those statements were taken out of context and were meant only to reflect the differences he was experiencing in shifting from a low-budget independent feature to a large-scale mainstream production.
Now that "Hudson Hawk" is in theaters, all parties are at peace, at least publicly. "Michael and I set out to make a big, goofy, entertaining movie and so did Joel and Bruce," says Mr. Waters. "As long as we had the same goals, it almost makes irrelevant the battles we had along the way. They were plentiful but never mean-spirited.
"Of course there should have been more fiscal control, but I'm really adamant in saying that the movie cost exactly what it would have cost anyway. If you would have planned it better and had the finished script and a realistic shooting schedule, it would be virtually what it came in at."
Despite considerable discusssion about cutting costs, Hollywood studios are primarily concerned with producing hits, and it seems that they will pay almost anything to buy one. "Budgets go up and up, and because they become commonplace, they become accepted as the norm," argues Mr. Dryhurst. "There is a sort of merry-go-round where certain figures are accepted for talent and no one ever questions them. And everyone keeps digging deeper in their pockets."
In a sense, the studios have no choice but to pay the asking price because competition is fiercer than ever. "When you shoot one of these films, you try to keep the money down," says Mr. Willis, "but when you have to compete with five other films that are spending as much, if not more than you, you've got to get really interesting stuff up on the screen. The people who run the studios aren't really involved in the day-to-day. All they want to know is if it's going to make them a lot of money."
 
The Bottom Line
How Much Is Too Much?
 Rising budgets became the topic of the moment in Hollywood in January, when an internal memo written by Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, that called for greater cost consciousness became public. Everyone agreed in theory, but little has changed. Big-budget action films are a staple of summer and are still too popular and too profitable to be curtailed.
"There are always going to be expensive pictures," says a marketing executive for a major studio who would speak only if his name was withheld. The Katzenberg memo is pablum put out for Wall Street. It's the great lie of Hollywood in 1991."
Business in Hollywood goes on as usual. Mr. Silver is currently shooting another big-budget action film, "The Last Boy Scout," based on a script that sold for a then-record price of $1,750,000 in a deal that included a $1 million fee for the producer. Mr. Willis is again starring and will receive his customary salary, estimated at more than $12 million, although he took considerably less for "Hudson Hawk" under an old deal.
Clearly, Mr. Silver isn't about to stop doing the action spectacles that have earned him his reputation. "I've made 39 movies," he boasts. "Some of them have made an enormous amount of money; together they've made well over $1 billion in revenue. I like to make big pictures, and I seem to have no problem getting them made."

AMERICAN STEEL
Hot Metal Men and the Resurrection of the Rust Belt.
By Richard Preston.
278 pp. New York:
Prentice Hall Press. $19.95. 
 Ever since Andrew Carnegie put the steel industry together in a breathless series of adventures between the end of the Civil War and the turn of the century, the business has been invested with a special romance. That Carnegie and others became enormously wealthy was the least of it. The steel business, after all, has been central to the modern world -- and so complicated, so sprawling, so dangerous. Men died inside those huge dusty sheds along the water, and they died outside them, too, when steelworkers were organizing against the bosses.
Carnegie built his business the same way Rockefeller and Ford built theirs: with enormous plants, the newest technology, long production runs. But after he sold out to J. P. Morgan in 1901, financiers and lawyers turned the steel business into a well-behaved cartel, the most smugly bureaucratic in the country. Complacency did not matter much during the decades when American producers had little competition. But once the pincer movement of low-cost foreign producers and lower-cost American minimills started in the 1960's, Big Steel's country-club culture made it as vulnerable to invasion and conquest as had been the native Americans.
F. Kenneth Iverson, an aspiring latter-day Carnegie, is chief among the many heroes of "American Steel," which describes a crossroads in the economic life of one of the minimills. The chairman of the Nucor Corporation, Mr. Iverson is the most prominent of the steel company innovators who have used superior technology and nonunion labor to go into competition with the established steel giants. The mills these men run are called "melt shops," because they recycle scrap steel in electric furnaces rather than cook up iron ore and coke in giant ovens, and they are doing to steel just what People Express and Texas Air did to the airlines, what Federal Express and United Parcel did to the Post Office, what M.C.I. did to Ma Bell. They are shaking old-line producers to their very foundations, challenging the foreign manufacturers and making the industry new.
As a big-time innovator, Ken Iverson is a familiar figure to readers of the business magazines. He is the very model of a post-modern chief executive. He works out of a rented office next to a shopping center in Charlotte, N.C.; the corporate dining room is Phil's Deli, across the street. He has a slim corporate staff of 20, and fields questions from the press himself. Some years he takes home the smallest paycheck of any Fortune 500 chief executive.
As the book begins, Mr. Iverson is hoping to take another bite out of Big Steel. The steel he has been making is all right for less demanding applications; Nucor has become the ninth-largest steel company in the United States. Now Mr. Iverson wants to learn to make sheet steel that he can sell to automobile companies and appliance makers -- the biggest and most lucrative market in the industry. To that end, he and his fellow executives have decided to buy an extraordinarily efficient but somewhat untested German steel-making machine that is as long as an aircraft carrier. And they have decided to plunk it down in the middle of a cornfield in Crawfordsville, Ind. These decisions are, as the book's author, Richard Preston, says, a gamble by a company "trapped in the borderland, between bar steel and greatness."
Mr. Preston is from the New Yorker school of fine writing, and excerpts of his book have indeed appeared in that magazine. In an earlier book, "First Light," he wrote about the astronomers who serve and are served by the giant telescope on Mount Palomar. His approach calls to mind his Princeton neighbor, John McPhee. Here, he relates with striking skill the lives of a dozen hot-metal men, all eccentric in varying degrees, over the 18 months that the mill is being built. There are the men who put up the buildings (termed "Run-a-Muckers"), the prissy German technicians who invented the revolutionary machine, the Nucor executives who oversee the whole operation.
Mr. Preston also gives us great set pieces -- one on the way Mr. Iverson rescues the company in 1965 from a smooth-talking conglomerateur who prefers reading restaurant menus to production plans; another on the moment when the machine is turned on for the first time. Throughout, he underlines Nucor's running battle with the disdained Big Steel -- though, when the company needs a computer system, it is Big Steel, in the person of a sympathetic executive, that supplies it. And when an otherwise anonymous iron worker named John Young falls 85 feet to his death from a crane, Mr. Preston recounts it in a way that just about breaks your heart. Eleven Nucor workers and five construction workers have died in accidents since 1980; Mr. Preston thinks this is excessive, but in ignoring Nucor's Carnegie-like transformation of the industry -- its revolution in production and technology -- he doesn't really make the case.
This formula for tracing the intricate relationship between a machine and the men who build their careers around it has other shortcomings. There are a good many questions about where the steel industry is headed that this book does not answer. (I suppose that is what business magazines are for.) But as a meditation on how high-tech business is done these days, as a window on the American response to foreign competition, as an initiation into the romance of heavy industry, as an exuberant celebration of the way that everyday people talk while they do important things, "American Steel" is very hard to beat.
 
 
BOSSES GET IN THE WAY
 "We don't need any group vice-presidents!" says [Kenneth] Iverson. "All they do is get in the way! Because you have to include them in decisions!" Iverson is getting steamed. . . . "We could at least double our size before we really even need to think about a new layer of management. . . ."
Iverson has been saying this for years. For years he has been telling financial analysts and business professors and his own managers that Nucor could double its sales without putting a strain on the corporate staff. In the meantime Nucor has doubled its sales, and doubled them again, and doubled them again, and doubled them again, and doubled them again -- five doublings, all told, exponential growth -- and Iverson is still telling the analysts and professors that Nucor could double its sales without putting a strain on the corporate staff. -- From "American Steel."

HEADLINE: Auction Fails In Panama

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 24

 BODY:
A public auction for Panama's state-owned fruit producer and exporter, Citricos de Chiriqui, failed to attract any bidders and a new auction date will be set, a Government official said.
"No bids were presented," Yanov Rettally, head of sales at Panama's Finance Ministry, said on Thursday. "A new date for a second auction will be announced later." 
 Citricos de Chiriqui, scheduled to become the first major state company to be placed under private control since the military invasion by the United States in 1989, had a minimum asking price of $13.9 million.
If a second auction fails to attract any bidders, the Finance Ministry will negotiate individually with interested companies, Mr. Rettally said.
The fruit company has 562 employees and grows oranges, pineapples and lemons in Chiriqui province in northwestern Panama.
In 1990 the company made a profit of $1 million, but the authorities lack the money to maintain and improve the company, officials say.
Citricos de Chiriqui is one of 29 state-owned companies scheduled to be fully or partly placed under private control.

Newspapers Try, Carefully, To Investigate Subscribers

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
As many newspapers rush toward the brave new world of building extensive data banks about their readers' interests and buying habits to help sell advertising, the issue of privacy looms as a potential land mine.
Americans are only beginning to realize that when they call a newspaper's sports line to get a score or send for a free brochure about car maintenance, they are probably also entering a data bank as a prospect for advertising about golf clubs or tires. 
 While credit-card companies have long used records of purchases to create consumer profiles, some newspaper executives said that for a paper to build a detailed file on its customers without their permission could be viewed as overly intrusive or as an abuse of the paper's role as a news organization.
"People will accept this from institutions that are highly commercial, like American Express, but not from an institution built on the First Amendment right to be informed," said Peter M. Winter, the senior vice president of product and market development at the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, an industry organization that is in the forefront of pushing newspapers to build such data bases, but with great care.
The newspaper industry is suffering through the worst advertising climate in decades and is rapidly embracing the concept that the hometown daily's future prosperity depends on evolving into sophisticated marketing organizations capable of reaching smaller and smaller target audiences, as advertisers increasingly demand.
Many view the cornerstone to that future to be assembling of computer files that not only list every name and address in the market, but identify where the sports fans live, who are the new parents and what households enter contests to win free pizza.
Experts in privacy law say that there is no requirement for newspapers to notify those involved that their names might be used for such commercial purposes as narrowly aimed ad campaigns.
But Mr. Winter and other newspaper executives are increasingly concerned that newspapers have a special obligation to make their intentions clear and give respondents the option of staying out of a paper's data bank if it is to be used for promotions or rented to outsiders.
Though giving readers such an option makes the data banks less complete, there is mounting worry that anything short of full disclosure might eventually make subscribers feel manipulated or even betrayed by newspapers, which they view as quasi-public utilities similar to the post office or electric company.
"Confidentiality is going to be an issue," said Howard Griffin, advertising director of The Orange County Register in Southern California, which is in the vanguard of the industry's effort to build data bases. "As a consumer myself, I wouldn't want certain information in the hands of people who might mishandle it."
The anxiety particularly applies when the data being gathered are then rented to others who use them to tailor their own promotions.
Jennifer L. MacLean, vice president for marketing at Direct Marketing Technology Inc., a builder of data bases, said newspapers thus far only used the data they cnal purposes. For instance, The Houston Chronicle, The New York Times, The Orange County Register and The Atlanta Journal and Constituion are all aggressively accumulating data, but use it only internally.
But Mr. Winter and other industry executives said renting the data to outsiders was a business that many papers were seriously considering.
Renting subscriber lists is a profitable side business at some magazines. Still, concerns about misusing that data have created some anxieties for magazine publishers, similar to those that have begun to trouble newspaper executives.
For instance, The Economist, a Britain-based weekly that costs American subscribers $110 a year and frequently rents its subscriber list, includes notification in a booklet sent all new subscribers that they have the right not to have their name rented. A similar notice, with instruction on how to keep a subscriber's name off such lists, also appears from time to time on the letters page of the magazine.
"The last thing you want if you have people paying $110 is to make them feel you are taking advantage of them," said Marjorie Scardino, the president of the magazine's North American operation.
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution has one of the most sophisticated newspaper data banks and has used a number of promotions to gather data while selling advertising.
For instance, around the New Year's holiday, Pizza Hut sponsored a "Football Fortune" contest in which people were encouraged to call a special phone line at the paper with their prediction of who would win the various bowl games. Each hundredth person received a free pizza, and there were up to 20,000 calls a week during the contest period.
Cathy Coffey, the paper's vice president of advertising, said Pizza Hut had bought advertising in The Journal and Constitution to promote the contest. In addition, the paper now has lists of thousands of "mainly young males interested in sports on TV," Ms. Coffey said.
She added that the list itself belonged to the paper, and that so far Pizza Hut had not tried to use it for other promotions, like direct-mail campaigns. But she said that sort of follow-up would be logical.
"It's a part of the future of the newspaper business," she said.

HEADLINE: Weak Sales Put a Damper On an Annual Book Party

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
People in the book business are about to suffer a twin indignity: they will hold the annual American Booksellers Association convention in the midst of an industry recession and in a place so far over on the West Side of Manhattan that finding what they consider to be a decent place for lunch will be a problem.
In the United States, book sales have slumped. "You can hear it from anybody who wants to be half honest," said Alberto Vitale, the chief executive of Random House, the largest American publisher of trade, or general-interest, books. "People are not buying books. It's been slow for several months, and the gulf war brought things virtually to a standstill." 
Overseas, the situation is similar. In Britain, for example, a total of more than 200 people were laid off at HarperCollins, Random Century and Hodder & Stoughton as a result of falling book sales, especially of hardbacks, because of the recession. This "caused a great deal of shock," said Alan Gordon Walker, the managing director of the British publisher Pan MacMillan.
Starting Saturday, representatives of more than 1,600 publishing companies will gather at the four-day American Booksellers Association convention in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, on 11th Avenue and 34th Street. But many are likely to miss an important institution in the book world: the publishing lunch, where many of the industry's deals are clinched.
Many participants are much more used to comfortable dining in the center of midtown Manhattan, where their favorite restaurants are located, than on the windswept edge of the Hudson River.
"It's way the hell to New Jersey," said Bernie Rath, the executive director of the American Booksellers Association. And Susan DiSesa, the publicity director of Pantheon Books, lamented, "We'll have to travel from sea to shining sea just to get lunch!"
Many publishers are traveling from Europe and Japan just to get to the Javits Center, a sign of the growth of the booksellers' gathering. The convention was once a domestic trade show for booksellers to see what publishers had to offer on their fall lists, but in recent years it has developed into a miniature Frankfurt Book Fair, offering what Mr. Rath called "a smorgasbord of attractions."
Prominent among these is the possibility for foreign publishers to acquire rights to American books. "For me, it's mainly a rights fair," said Ivan Nabokov, a director of Presses de la Cite, a Paris-based publisher. "But it's also useful to see and study the new marketing ideas U.S. publishers are introducing."
 
Mood of Caution
 This year, though, a mood of caution is likely to mark the international deal-making because of the recession. As ever, there will be countless parties; but sobriety will characterize whatever business gets done.
"Europeans are buying much more cautiously than a couple of years ago," said Maria B. Campbell, a scout who looks for American books that may be attractive in foreign markets. "It's much tougher."
In France, for example, Mr. Nabokov said, "things have been very depressed since last fall."
Even in Germany, where book sales have been buoyed by unification, there is wariness. "Rights prices will go down because we realized a year ago we cannot get our money back," said Karl Blessing, the editorial director of Droemer Knaur Kindler, a Munich-based publisher.
And Mr. Gordon Walker of Pan MacMillan said, "The sort of book you might have paid $300,000 for two years ago, you'd certainly pay no more than $100,000 today."
 
A Myth Is Undermined

Business is also tough in the United States. The myth of the book market's resistance to recession has been undermined. Sales have been disappointing, although publishers say they have picked up somewhat since the end of the Persian Gulf war. Sales have been particularly hard hit in shopping malls -- where the two largest chains, Barnes & Noble and Waldenbooks, are heavily represented.
"With the recession and the war, sales have been off considerably," said Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble, "although we were not off as much as other retailers in the malls." He said that instead of his company's expected 5 or 6 percent growth, sales so far this year were off 1 or 2 percent. "We're not looking at any boom period in the near future," he added.
Charles R. Cumello, the president of Waldenbooks, said that traffic in the company's mall stores was down 5 to 10 percent, but added that overall sales in the first quarter had held up reasonably well. "When the war started, it was terrible," he said, "but things have settled down since then." Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble account for more than 25 percent of the nation's annual bookstore sales of $7.3 billion.
The downturn in the publishing industry is not uniform. Barry Lippmann, the president of Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publisher, said his company's fiscal year that ended March 31 was the strongest ever, and sales in April and May remained good. But he added that a sober mood was evident.
 
More Careful Spenders

Because books are often an impulse buy, sales have suffered because people are thinking more carefully about what they spend. Moreover, the gulf war led many people to stay at home and watch television. "February to April was singularly bleak," said Mr. Vitale, who predicted that the last four months of the year would be stronger, but without any "sharp, violent upsurge in business."
The American Booksellers Association is predicting that overall book sales this year may rise as much as 8.2 percent, considerably less than the 12.3 percent rise last year. Still, that means book sales will be just slightly better than flat when adjusted for inflation.
As a result of the slump, publishers are coming under some pressure from booksellers to stop raising prices on their books.
"I'm telling publishers that prices are getting dangerously high," Mr. Cumello said. "Twenty-five dollars is a danger mark, and $22 for a midlist book is too much."
But publishers are also feeling the pressure of rising production costs, and many believe that prices must inch toward $30.
 
No Hot Book Yet

Unlike last year, when the convention was held in Las Vegas, Nev., and Donald J. Trump's book, infelicitously titled "Surviving at the Top," was widely billed as the hot book (only to have cool sales), no single title has yet emerged as the focus of this year's gathering. European publishers say it is increasingly hard to predict which American books -- outside the brand names like Stephen King, Danielle Steel and Jean Auel -- will sell in their markets.
Movies help create a world market for a book. "Dances With Wolves" (Fawcett) by Michael Blake, "The Silence of the Lambs" (St. Martin's Press) by Thomas Harris and "Not Without My Daughter" (St. Martin's) by Betty Mahmoody have all done very well in Europe, helped by successful films. In Germany, a novel, "Every Woman Loves a Russian Poet," by Elizabeth Dunkel emerged as a best seller after selling poorly in the United States.
In Italy, one of the most successful recent foreign titles has been "The Secret Diaries of Laura Palmer" (Pocket Books), inspired by the television series "Twin Peaks," which has been canceled by ABC. The book did not do so well elsewhere. And in France, a 1968 John Irving novel, "Setting Free the Bears" (Random House), has suddenly raced to No. 1.
 
 Europe's Peculiarities
 "Europe is a very diverse market," said Peter S. Fritz of the Zurich literary agency Paul & Peter Fritz A.G., "and sometimes I have trouble explaining this to American clients."
In Germany, Mr. Blessing of Droemer Knaur Kindler said, fewer American books were automatically becoming best sellers.
And in France, Mr. Nabokov said, "there have been many weeks recently with hardly a single translated book on the best-seller list."
Will the Hell's Kitchen convention, sans restaurants, change any of this? "Nothing is going to be earth-shattering in its effectiveness," Mr. Riggio said. "Put it this way: if you were in Europe vacationing, I'd say don't bother to come to the Javits Center."

HEADLINE: Tax-Relief Prospects Called Dim

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Varied proposals for reducing taxes have been floated on Capitol Hill, but despite the recession and the search by Democrats for a campaign issue, there is little likelihood that the tax burden will be eased.
One major obstacle to tax relief is the opposition of Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the most influential tax writer in the House. 
 "The American taxpayer needs a rest," the Illinois Democrat told a recent meeting of accountants here. "The practice of annually rewriting the tax code imposes a tremendous burden and creates tremendous uncertainty. We should not engage in political tax wars lightly."
 
 Noncontroversial Changes

Mr. Rostenkowski fears that any effort to modify taxes this year could get out of control. Yet he does plan to introduce a bill in June that would simplify the tax code. It is expected to make modest and noncontroversial changes and to be revenue neutral.
Another damper on tax initiatives is the requirement in last autumn's budget package that each change in the tax code costing the Government money be paid for with new revenues raised someplace else.
Despite Mr. Rostenkowski's opposition, there is some talk in Congress of tax changes. Recently, for example, an anti-recession "action plan" proposed by Congressional Democrats contained, albeit vaguely, a proposal that taxes be cut for "working Americans."
 
Expiring at End of Year
 Among the possibilities for legislation are the so-called extenders, a dozen or so unrelated credits and other tax incentives due to expire at the end of the year. These include breaks for corporate research, low-income housing, employers who hire the poor and employee education benefits.
The extenders, which cost the Treasury $21 billion a year, may well be approved. The various individual items command an assortment of business and other support, although the new pay-as-you-go rules mean that they can only survive if sponsors find offsetting revenue, an exercise in fratricide. To minimize the apparent cost -- and to give members a chance to claim repeated credit for voting a tax break -- extenders are typically renewed for a single year.
There is also much talk in the House about attaching another increase in gasoline taxes to the bill that is to renew $105 billion of highway and mass transit programs for another five years.
 
Inevitable Technical Corrections

And there is the inevitable bill to make technical corrections to the tax handiwork of preceding years.
When combined with assorted other ideas from various wish lists, including President Bush's interest in restoring the tax preference for capital gains and the interest of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, in a new, more flexible form of individual retirement account, there is no telling what might emerge.
"These sorts of issues just evolve," said one Congressional tax aide who said he had little idea whether taxes would become a front-burner issue this year.
But even if a tax vehicle does emerge, it will face Mr. Rostenkowski's lack of enthusiasm. He professes horror not only at the ever-increasing complexity of the tax code, which he said often results from efforts to make it fairer, but at the frequent wholesale changes.
Can he be swayed by fellow Democrats? That is not certain. But some Democrats may insist on resurrecting last year's campaign for greater tax equity, perhaps pushing a higher alternative minimum tax or a surcharge on high incomes to help pay for a cut for the middle class or for broadening or extending jobless benefits if the economy fails to soon pull out of the recession. One Democratic proposal includes higher exemptions for children and an expansion of the earned-income credit that particularly benefits the poor.
Another possibility, pressed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, would be to simplify the earned income credit, the beneficiaries of which generally cannot afford the professional help needed to claim it. Another initiative might be to require those who make annuity payments to calculate on Form 1099 how much is subject to tax and how much is not.
 
Very Long Odds

Mr. Bentsen has put his Senate Finance Committee staff to work searching for ways to raise the $25 billion his new I.R.A.'s would require over five years. Under his plan, the investor could choose between initial deductibility or tax-free withdrawal, but the measure seems to face very long odds. So does a cut in the capital gains rate.
The financial problem -- magnified by indexation of the tax code -- of how to pay for breaks is compounded by a political process in which any bill, at least in Mr. Rostenkowski's eyes, becomes a potential disaster. The Senate permits almost anything to be attached to the simplest of measures; a leadership agreement was necessary earlier this year before Congress could even provide filing extensions for military personnel stationed in the Persian Gulf.
"I don't have very much faith in the rules of the Senate," Mr. Rostenkowski said.
Some specialists believe his strategy will be to try to limit this year's effort to modest simplification -- and to move later rather than sooner.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Declined 32.7% in April

BYLINE: By JAN ROSEN

 BODY:
Orders for machine tools fell 32.7 percent in April from a year earlier, an industry trade group says in its monthly report. Orders were 5.3 percent lower than in March.
In the report, which was prepared for release today, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said orders fell last month to $194.7 million. They totaled $205.5 million in March, and $289.3 million in April 1990. 
 For the first four months of the year, orders declined 11.1 percent from the comparable period in 1990, to $845.1 million.
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in all sorts of products, from appliances and automobiles to aircraft and construction materials. Because of the widespread use of machine tools, orders and shipments for them are considered indicative of the general state of industry.
Despite the overall weakness, the trade association expressed optimism for the machine tool industry, largely because foreign orders, which set a record last year, had risen to $200.9 million through the first four months of this year. That is up 11.4 percent from the $180.4 million in foreign orders in the similar period last year. Foreign shipments have risen 37.1 percent so far this year, to $52.2 million.
Albert W. Moore, the president of the group, said, "Although the current domestic market is weak, foreign orders for machine tools continue to run ahead of last year, again demonstrating the competitiveness of the U.S. machine tool industry."
He said that American tool makers lead the world in productivity and that both the value of the dollar and American wage levels put the domestic industry in a competitive position around the world. "Just a few years ago, pundits were writing off heavy U.S. industries as dinosaurs unable to adapt," Mr. Moore said. "But I think they missed a fundamental lesson of the value of competition."
He said the machine tool industry had restructured and would grow still more competitive, helping "in the revitalization of U.S. industry."
 
Shipments Fell 20.1%

Actual shipments of machine tools fell 20.1 percent in April from the April 1990 level, to $206.3 million. Shipments were 25.5 percent below the March level of $276.9 million. Shipments for the first four months of the year reached $867.9 million in April, 16.5 percent below the $1.04 billion level for the first four months of 1990.
Orders for metal-cutting tools like boring mills and lathes fell 33.8 percent in April from April 1990, to $136.8 million; that was 10.9 percent below the March level. The level for the first four months of the year fell 8.4 percent, to $606.6 million.
Shipments for metal-cutting tools fell 14.1 percent from the April 1990 level, to $145.1 million; that was down 16.6 percent from the March level of $173.9 million. The year-to-date shipments fell 21.3 percent, to $562.9 million.
Orders for metal-forming tools fell 29.9 percent in April from the April 1990 level, to $57.9 million. But April orders were 11.6 percent ahead of the previous month's level of $51.9 million. The total for the first four months was down 17.4 percent, to $238.5 million.
Shipments of metal-forming tools fell 31.4 percent in April, to $61.2 million; that was a 40.6 percent drop from the March level of $103 million. Shipments in the first four months fell 6.6 percent, to $305 million.
The association said the machine tool backlog in April had slipped to $1.45 billion, from $1.46 billion the month before and $1.71 billion in April 1990.

HEADLINE: Iran Plans More Oil Output

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: NICOSIA, Cyprus, May 26

 BODY:
Iran will raise its oil output to 5 million barrels a day by 1993, from 3.5 million, its oil minister says.
In an interview published Saturday in the Middle East Economic Survey, Gholam Reza Aqhazadeh said plans were under way to modernize oil terminals and offshore platforms damaged in the 1980-88 war with Iraq. 
 "Before the war our production capacity was more than 5 million barrels a day," he said. "Considerable damage was inflicted on our oil production and export facilities. Also during the war we were not able to carry out the necessary drilling in the fields."
He said he had the Iranian Parliament's approval to seek foreign money and expertise to restore crude output to what it was before the war. Large-scale drilling and gas injection projects are needed to raise capacity.
"The Iranian Parliament has already approved these plans and allocated the necessary funds, both in terms of foreign exchange and local expenditure," Mr. Aqazadeh said. "So, there is no problem about that."
He said Iran had put into operation 18 new drilling rigs in the southern fields, bringing the number of active rigs to 30. The country was leasing some rigs from Canada, "but we are doing the rest of the drilling ourselves," he said.
Mr. Aqazadeh said Iran was talking to American oil companies about the direct sale of crude to the United States after a recent decision by Washington to lift a ban on such imports from Iran.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders Challenging Dinkins After a 'Honeymoon'

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
New York City's business leaders, increasingly concerned about the city's financial future and the prospect of higher taxes, have begun to aggressively challenge Mayor David N. Dinkins's handling of his budget.
In contrast to their reluctance to play a visible role during his first year in office, the new assertiveness underscores the business community's deep fears about the city's recurring deficits and its even deeper uncertainty about the city's economic recovery. 
 "We came to the conclusion we would give the Mayor a honeymoon period and we believe we have," said Preston Robert Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, who is chairman of the New York Chamber of Commerce and the New York City Partnership.
"He was entitled to the year of 1990 to put his house in order," Mr. Tisch said. "We don't think it was put in order enough. We don't think enough has been accomplished and we see dark clouds on the horizon."
Asked to comment on such concerns, the Mayor replied through his chief spokesman, Leland T. Jones, that the business leaders were certainly "more aggressive" with him.
The Mayor confers periodically with business executives and with his Council of Economic Advisers, whose members' concerns seem to ebb and flow, Mr. Jones said.
"Last year it seemed to be quality of life," Mr. Jones said. "This year it seems to be taxes. One of the ironies is to have a conversation with them in a group setting about taxes and then they put on another hat as they're leaving and say, 'Oh, what can you do for the libraries or the museum or this charity or that one' of which they or their spouses are board members."
The honeymoon Mr. Tisch referred to followed a shotgun wedding in which many business leaders, wary about the cost of Mr. Dinkins's loyalties to organized labor and his commitments to improve social services, begrudgingly embraced him as a healer after the 1989 Democratic primary. Publicly, the honeymoon was prolonged by the reticence of some executives to be viewed as imposing their largely self-serving agenda on a government that is cutting programs for the poor -- particularly when most of the executives are white and the Mayor is black.
"Some of them are copping out," said Howard J. Rubenstein, the public-relations executive and lobbyist who represents many businesses and developers. "They're afraid to ignite the sparks of a racial conflict because anything they do will be interpreted by many as anti-black, anti-Hispanic and anti-poor."
"It's a factor," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the Partnership, a business group formed to lend its expertise to government after the city's 1975 fiscal crisis.
Whatever its impact, that factor has been overcome by frustration, civic pride and fierce concerns about the enduring recession and the city's capacity to respond. The Partnership and other business groups view the latest crisis as a time to shrink the scope and cost of government.
"In no way are we holding off because we have a black mayor and a predominantly white business community," said Mr. Tisch, whom Mr. Dinkins has named his "ambassador" to Washington.
 
'A Money Issue'

"I don't think it's a racial issue," said Vincent Tese, the State Economic Development Commissioner. "This is strictly a money issue. I think the business community is very nervous."
So nervous, Mr. Rubenstein said, that "a fairly large number of businesses are evaluating whether to leave New York or not."
"The businesses that have a major stake in New York feel that if they're not heard now, something will happen to undermine their business for a decade to come," he said. "They're willing to do battle. They're being aggressive to try to save their businesses. They want to see if they can make the city a bearable place economically."
Lewis Rudin, a building owner and developer, who is chairman of the Association for a Better New York, a business coalition formed during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, said that "the myth is that New York is a sinking ship and you'd better get out." But, he said, this perception is grossly exaggerated. He and others stressed that business was seeking a constructive role in the budget process and not necessarily an adversarial one.
"They want the Mayor to succeed," Mr. Tese said.
 
A Cap on Property Taxes

Mr. Rudin said of Mr. Dinkins: "I can't help him in cutting -- he was elected to do that. I can help him by suggesting incentives for businesses to stay in the city."
One such incentive suggested by the real-estate industry was to cap property taxes after this year. A similar freeze was imposed for several years after the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's to reassure a business community that craved stability.
Mostly through a management advisory task force formed by the Mayor, business executives have pressed the city to improve its procurement and contracting processes; to consolidate city agencies; to pursue long-term solutions to the built-in deficit rather than making crippling cuts in essential services like education, bridge repair and some housing programs, and to reduce labor costs by making the city's work force more efficient.
Separately, the Real Estate Board of New York has formed a loose alliance with owners of small properties and others to wage a vigorous public-relations and lobbying campaign against the Mayor's proposed $776 million increase in real-estate taxes.
Mr. Dinkins has expressed a willingness to work with the business community and to discuss its agenda, but he has been less amenable about agreeing to requests for specific amendments to his budget. He has also largely declined to use the lobbying of the business community as a tactical weapon against the unions.
Mr. Tisch, representing the Partnership, said he and other business executives close to the Mayor had sought to attend the fiscal "summit" conference Mr. Dinkins convened on May 4 at Gracie Mansion, but were rebuffed.
Instead, the Mayor's economic advisers, including representatives from the Partnership and from the real-estate industry, were briefed on the budget later that afternoon, although some businessmen, in their other capacities, had participated in the conference.
Representatives of business have been credited, by the Mayor among others, with helping to shape a proposed early retirement program for teachers, an experimental project in Brooklyn to contain Medicaid costs and the consolidation of the city's economic development agencies.
Lobbying largely behind the scenes, the business community fended off Mr. Dinkins's proposal to pay for part of his anti-crime plan -- a plan generally supported by business leaders -- by imposing a payroll tax. About the same time, in a largely symbolic gesture to the commercial real-estate industry and its tenants, Mr. Dinkins proposed a modest reduction in the tax on commercial rents last fall.
Yet some impatient executives say the Mayor appears to be only begrudgingly making the most of the bad situation he inherited.
"If you really believe there's a structural deficit, you have a window of opportunity," Mr. Shelp of the Partnership said, echoing others. "But David Dinkins did not run for mayor to restructure New York City government."
During the mayoral campaign, one supporter, Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier, said business perceived Mr. Dinkins, then the Manhattan Borough President, as one of several officials with a "strongly liberal background" and "with whom labor unions have significant influence."
Mr. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, said Mr. Dinkins once told him: "I'm more comfortable with my friends in labor than with financial geniuses like you."
Some executives expressed hope, though, that the Mayor's liberal views and his relationship with labor, coupled with his race, would give him greater credibility to preach sacrifice in austere times.
But the Mayor may have been misreading what the business community was seeking from him, Mr. Shelp said. "Business people have a tendency to be polite, so quite possibly he gets a mixed message -- 'that the course I'm pursuing is O.K.,' " Mr. Shelp said.
Indeed, the Mayor apparently emerged from the May 4 meeting with the impression that business might tolerate his proposals to close the immediate deficit when what executives appear to fear most is a future that promises more taxes and more uncertainty.
"I spend most of my time going to breakfasts soothing business people and real-estate people," the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said about alarm over some of the Mayor's budget pronouncements and proposed taxes.
Nonetheless, the Partnership and other business groups, abetted by some officials in the Dinkins administration, are pressing their case.
"I live in fear that they will come back with labor concessions that are too small and with wage deferrals," Mr. Shelp said.
 
More Flexible Work Rules

Among other things, the Partnership urged the city to press for more flexible work rules and reductions in paid time off for municipal employees -- most are entitled to 14 holidays a year, while the Partnership's own employees get 10.
The Partnership, for example, complained to the Mayor when an underused Parks Department marionette program was restored with funds taken from elsewhere because work rules "effectively prevented canceling" the program.
Mr. Tisch and Mr. Shelp, recalling an earlier meeting with the Mayor, wrote him this month, reminding him that they had urged that he make cuts that would "lead to recurring savings that the city can tolerate over the long term."
"As you know," they wrote, "these savings must be carefully targeted to protect as much as possible those New Yorkers who are most at risk and those services that are most needed."
The suggestions of Mr. Tisch and Mr. Shelp recall the role business played in the fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's, when leading bankers, including David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan and Walter B. Wriston of Citicorp, wielded considerable political and economic influence in the city's behalf. The bankers were able to form a short-lived but constructive alliance with labor.
The Partnership and the Association for a Better New York are legacies of the 1975 fiscal crisis. But this time, the business community is more diffuse and diverted by its own financial woes, although, Mr. Rubenstein said, "they have rekindled a spirit of the 70's, when it was Lew Rudin standing alone with a fig leaf."

HEADLINE: Banks Raise Scrutiny of Credit Cards

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The bankers' adage "know your customer" is taking on new meaning in the credit card business, as banks increasingly rely on computers to guide their relationships with millions of customers they will never meet.
Using statistical measures, or scores, for each customer, banks are learning how to avoid bad risks when soliciting millions of new accounts, provide better service to existing accounts and collect more on delinquent loans. 
 No longer relying just on information provided on applications about income, employment history and money in savings accounts, banks now compile a score for each customer as they use the card. Robert D. Dutton, senior vice president at First Data Resources Inc., a credit card processing company, notes that there are 48 different characteristics by which a credit card account is measured.
 
 Very Profitable Business

These include the extent to which monthly payments are for the full amount owned, the mimimum payment or some in-between amount; promptness of payment; whether the card is used for purchases or cash advances, and frequency of use. Some banks are now experimenting with scores that consider the size of purchases and the kinds of merchants where the card is used, Mr. Dutton said.
The computer's ability to make sense of the myriad bits of customer data quickly and cheaply is a key reason for the extraordinary profitability of the credit card business. At Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards with more than 22 million accounts, specialized credit card banks in South Dakota and Nevada earned more than $600 million in 1990 (as a whole, Citicorp earned only $458 million because of losses in other parts of its business).
Even when banks are not burdened with unusually heavy losses from their traditional lending, credit cards are three times as profitable as the rest of their business.
"When you deal with millions of accounts, the computer allows consistent judgments that are just not possible if each account was analyzed by a person," said Thomas C. Lynch, head of the credit card business at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "The more experience and the more customers you have, the better you get at interpreting the data to identify which customers are most likely to become a credit problem or which are most likely to be interested in a new product."
 
Appeal to Smaller Banks

The use of behavior scores is not limited to large banks. Small and medium-sized banks can buy models of what they would like their ideal customer's credit record to look like from companies including American Management Systems of Arlington, Va.; Fair, Isaac & Company, San Rafael, Calif., and Management Decision Systems in Atlanta.
Credit Card Management magazine reported that more than 51 percent of the country's more than 200 million credit card accounts were evaluated by some kind of behavior score by mid-1990, compared with only 14 percent a year earlier. With that increased use, the price of a behavior score has fallen to less than 10 cents a name.
"In the past, bankers treated their card customers like a portfolio to be managed," said Robert Heller, president of Visa U.S.A. But now, using behavior scores, "they are focusing more and more on individual account management," he said.
The incentive to scrutinize credit card accounts has become greater as delinquencies and defaults have increased during the recession.
 
Reducing the Bad Accounts

Peter F. DiGiammarino, a vice president at American Management Systems, said scoring of new applications could cut the number of bad accounts considerably and at the same time allow banks to approve a greater percentage of new applicants. For existing accounts, he said, scores for each customer can reduce delinquencies by 30 percent.
Faced with rising losses and delinquencies, bankers have begun using credit bureau reports as a cross reference to spot new or existing customers who might be in financial trouble, but have tried to conceal it from their credit card bank by keeping their payments current. A recent study by Visa U.S.A. found that 70 percent of consumers filing for bankruptcy were having considerable difficulties paying their debts in the two years before they declared themselves bankrupt, but survived by borrowing on their credit cards.
Behavior scores can improve customer service by helping banks quickly decide whether to approve a purchase that would put a customer over the credit line, or to grant their best customers increases in credit lines before they are needed.
James Bailey, the head of the credit card business at Citicorp, noted that properly developed scores, which recognize regional differences in incomes and demographics, "help us approve more people and extend more credit than if we used a single score for the entire country."
 
Value of Home Ownership

Analysts noted, for example, that in New York City home ownership might be a more important indicator of credit quality than in Kansas, where home ownership is the norm. Job turnover tends to be more rapid in Washington than in other parts of the country, meaning that behavior scores need to be adjusted.
Eventually, bankers say, as competition heats up, fees and interest rates on cards may be fine-tuned to each customer, with discounts to the most valued customers.
That practice is widespread in business lending but not in credit cards. The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and Chase Manhattan, for example, increased interest rates for their least-profitable card customers in 1989, while maintaining their lower rates for their best customers.
Because computers allow scores to be frequently updated, bankers are coming to rely on the scores as a low-cost way of making many day-to-day decisions. Allowing a customer to make a purchase that puts his debt above the credit limit can be done quickly and consistently, bankers say. When planning mail solicitations for products like insurance or brokerage accounts, bankers consult their credit card records to identify the most likely customers.
 
Decisions on Delinquencies

And when loans become delinquent, bankers rely on behavior scores to decide which accounts should receive the most intensive collection efforts.
"Some delinquent accounts are so low-risk that you are better off ignoring them for a while and concentrating your efforts on other accounts," Mr. Lynch of Chase Manhattan said. "You save money on postage, you save staff time and you avoid offending a customer who might get upset at a demand for payment."
The Bank of America last year began using a behavior-scoring system developed by American Management Systems for delinquent installment loan accounts. It expects the system to reduce its collection costs by $2 million a year.
The banks' increased reliance on behavior scores was illustrated last year when the First National Bank of Chicago reviewed its accounts in nine economically depressed states in New England and the mid-Atlantic region. Using the same credit standards as in the past but reviewing the accounts sooner than normal, it canceled 7,800 accounts and cut the credit lines of another 1,200 accounts by $4.5 million -- including some customers who were current on their credit card payments but who showed other signs of being risky accounts.
 
Reviews Were Accelerated

Scott P. Marks, head of First Chicago's card business, told the House Banking Committee at a recent hearing that the company would have canceled or cut back the accounts under the normal review it conducts a year after accounts are opened or every two years thereafter.
But the reviews were accelerated, he said, because bankruptcy filings among its customers in New England increased 77 percent in the first nine months of 1990 from 1989 levels. In New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, personal bankruptcies among First Chicago's customers rose 39 percent, or more than twice the 15 percent increase among all consumers nationwide.
But there are risks of monitoring accounts too closely.
Thomas E. Roach, a Brooklyn distributor of book publishing paper, canceled his American Express membership earlier this year when the company asked too many questions after his purchase of a $5,000 computer, he said.
Mr. Roach said he was dismayed when American Express asked his bank if money was available and was upset when the use of the card was blocked, without asking what other funds he might have available, before he had been presented with his monthly bill.
 
Unusual Account Activity

American Express said watching for unusual account activity was one of the ways it reduced fraudulent use of its cards. The definition of "unusual," of course, depends on the past activity in an account.
As behavior scoring becomes more sophisticated, it is evolving into a field that bankers call "psychographics," in which the collection of consumer data can do more than just help the bank avoid losses. Some banks, including Chase Manhattan, have learned enough about some consumers to sell merchants lists of customers whose incomes and card use suggests that they would be receptive to special advertising.
Some bankers look ahead to a time when merchants will itemize purchases on the card slip in exchange for a reduction in the bank fee, and banks will have better knowledge of their customers' buying habits.
"Without question, as banks collect more information and make more use of it, privacy questions are going to arise," said Richard Fischer, a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster in Washington. He said he expected the debate about who owns information about shopping habits would eventually lead to a new laws.

HEADLINE: Anger in New Jersey Grows Over Teachers' Raises

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 26

 BODY:
After a decade of steady salary increases and an improving image, public school teachers here are falling under attack from politicians who are suggesting that they are overpaid.
Gov. Jim Florio, trained as a teacher, is assailing "the education establishment" for unrestrained spending, and the President of the State Senate, John A. Lynch, says teachers and administrators are "lining their pockets." 
 At a time when recession has made residents more sensitive to already high property taxes, and when teacher contracts continue to award annual pay increases of 9 percent to 10 percent, critics suggest that the state's efforts to improve education have succeeded mainly in raising salaries.
Mr. Lynch led a successful move this spring to shift $360 million from school aid to local property-tax relief, arguing that much of a $1.4 billion increase in aid would "go into the pockets of teachers and administrators rather than improving the education of children."
Since then, he and Daniel J. Dalton of Turnersville, the Senate majority leader, have assailed teachers, administrators and school boards for spending money on salaries and benefits while complaining of inadequate programs, supplies and buildings for children.
"They are just holding the kids hostage," Mr. Lynch said in an interview. "While everybody else's salary is flat, they are negotiating these 9 and 10 percent increases. If this continues, there will never be any money for program enhancement."
In New Jersey, teacher salaries have doubled in the last decade and now average more than $38,000; teachers at the top of the pay scale in some districts are paid more than $50,000. Salaries and other costs raised the per-pupil cost to $8,439 in 1989-90, the highest in the nation, according to the National Education Association. Nationally, per-pupil spending averaged $4,890, while New York and Connecticut, second and third in the nation, spent $8,094 and $7,934 per pupil, respectively.
But educational performance in New Jersey remains below the national norm.
Salary increases were intended in part to attract better teachers. Instead, a decline in enrollment has meant fewer new teachers, and teaching staffs have had little turnover, with the average age of public teachers rising to 43.8 years, from 39.6, in the last three years.
 
New-Teacher Programs Backfire
 Programs intended to attract new teachers, in fact, have backfired, because their graduates have been unable to find teaching jobs.
Although voters approved 56 percent of school budgets in the annual round of school elections in April, there is some evidence that Mr. Lynch has some allies, as evidenced by the rejection of 44 percent of the budgets, even though the votes are nonbinding.
Indeed, in Mr. Lynch's hometown of New Brunswick, The Home News, the daily newspaper, fumed in a recent editorial, "For sheer damn-the-taxpayers arrogance, it's hard to beat the North Brunswick Board of Education's ratification of an expensive three-year contract just days after the biggest-ever turnout of voters rejected the budget."
 
Democrats Assailing Old Allies
 The new three-year contract approved by the board included teachers' raises of about 8 1/2 percent a year for the next three years. All five members of the board were endorsed for election by the North Brunswick Township Education Association, the teachers' bargaining agent.
Most of the official criticism has come from the Democrats, traditionally a strong ally of teachers and their major union, the New Jersey Education Association. The Governor majored in education at Trenton State College, and ran as a strong advocate of good education.
But three weeks ago, Mr. Florio delivered a tough speech to the New Jersey Conference of Mayors in Atlantic City.
In it, he said parents were intimidated by what he referred to as "experts" in education, who he said "resist change and ignore calls for accountability."
 
Lynch Would Cap Raises
 Mr. Lynch said that teacher salary increases in "these hard economic times" should be limited to 1 percent more than the cost-of-living increase.
Betty Kraemer, the president of the New Jersey Education Association, which represents most of the state's 79,886 public school teachers, said in an interview that salary increases in new contracts had been "averaging about 9 percent." But she maintained that that figure would probably go down to "about 8 percent" for those currently being negotiated.
"Governor Kean began to promote teaching as a respected profession" and raising salaries as a result, Ms. Kraemer said. "That seems to be going away."
She said teachers were still underpaid compared with many other professionals, like accountants or engineers, who command starting salaries of $27,000 and $32,000, compared with $22,000 for teachers.
 
Raises Outpaced Population's
 But salary increases for teachers have recently outpaced the general population's. The average annual private wage in New Jersey increased by only 3.7 percent from 1988 to 1989, the latest comparison available, while teachers' salaries went up by 8.0 percent from 1988 to 1989, and by another 7.7 percent from 1989 to 1990.
State by state, New Jersey's teachers are currently the fifth highest paid in the country, averaging $38,411, behind teachers in Alaska ($43,861), Connecticut ($43,847), New York ($41,600) and Maryland ($38,806). If the District of Columbia were included ($42,288), New Jersey would rank sixth.
But salaries have increased here significantly since 1985, when Gov. Thomas H. Kean instituted a minimum salary of $18,500 for beginning teachers in all districts. While not drastic itself, it created a ripple effect in higher classifications that pushed salaries upward in succeeding years. While beginning teachers now average about $22,000, teachers with advanced degrees and seniority in some districts are paid more than $60,000.
Herbert Green, director of the Public Education Institute, a nonprofit study group in New Brunswick, said the increases of recent years helped generate taxpayer discontent.
"A lot of what's going on is that even people who were uncomfortable with the low salaries of teachers in the later 70's and early 80's are now saying teachers have caught up and are making competitive salaries," Mr. Green said. "So three-year settlements of 9 to 10 percent a year makes people ask, 'How much is too much?' when it is way ahead of inflation."
The criticism is likely to grow nationally, he added.
"A majority of the states are in fiscal crisis," Mr. Green said, "and that translates to finger-pointing. Schools are a good target."

HEADLINE: COMMENCEMENTS;
Brandeis Graduates Told, 'Stay Involved'

 BODY:
Brandeis University awarded 752 undergraduate and 160 graduate degrees in its 40th commencement exercises, held yesterday at the school's campus in Waltham, Mass.
Daniel Bell, a sociologist and a scholar in residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, delivered the keynote address. "Wisdom is the tears of experience," he told the graduates, "the bridge of experience and imagination over time. It is the listening heart, the melancholy sigh, the distillation of despair to provide a realistic, if often despondent, view of the world." 
 Mr. Bell, an author, educator and philosopher, was one of nine recipients of honorary degrees. Others were: the entertainer Harry Belafonte; the writers Philip Roth and Maxine Hong Kingston; the physicist Marvin Goldberger; Oluwatope A. Mabogunje, a clinician and researcher at the King Fahd specialist hospital in Saudi Arabia; Milton Babbitt, a composer; Michael Roux, chief executive of Carillon Importers, Ltd., and Stuart H. Altman, interim president of Brandeis and dean of the University's Florence Heller graduate school.
Mr. Altman told graduates: "Get involved. Stay involved. Don't give up. Society has given you a lot. Now it is your turn to give something back."
 
 Amherst College
 Amherst College awarded 450 bachelor of arts degrees at the 170th commencement exercises yesterday on the steps of the Frost Library on campus in Amherst, Mass.
The Amherst president, Peter R. Pouncey, and a graduating senior, John E. Cariani, a history major from Presque Isle, Me., addressed the graduates.
Honorary degrees were awarded to: Edward N. Ney, United States Ambassador to Canada; Dianne H. Pilgrim, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum; Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; Koichiro Fujikura, professor of law, University of Tokyo; Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker who created the widely acclaimed Civil War television series; James P. Comer, M.D., Maurice Falk Professor of Child Psychiatry at Yale University and an innovator in child education; F. Otto Hass, former chairman of the board of Rohm and Haas; Gregory S. Prince Jr., president of Hampshire College, and Theodore Rosengarten, author and historian.
 
 Mount Holyoke College
 Evelyn Fox Keller, a scientist and philosopher, addressed the 526 graduates at Mount Holyoke College's 154th commencement ceremony yesterday in South Hadley, Mass.
Ms. Keller, who is best-known for her research into the effect of gender on science, spoke of the progress that has been made by women's colleges into the male-dominated sciences. She told the graduates of the women's institution, "We have learned that women attending women's colleges develop measurably higher levels of self-esteem, score higher on standarized tests, are more likely to enter traditionally male professions and are generally more successful in their careers."
Ms. Keller, who wrote "A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock (W.H. Freeman & Co. 1983)," was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters.
Also honored were: Mary Moore, a British author and playwright; Dr. Jay Tepperman and Dr. Helen Tepperman, physicians whose work has been widely published in scientific journals; Anna C. Roosevelt, an anthropologist who has studied human ecology and cultural evolution in the Amazon basin; and Sheila E. Widnall, a scientist who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
 Clark University
 Marian Wright Edelman, a prominent advocate for children's rights and welfare, delivered the main address to 753 graduates yesterday at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
This year's class was the largest in the school's 104-year history.
Ms. Edelman, president of the Washington-based Children's Defense Fund, received an honorary doctor of laws degree. Also receiving honorary degrees were Gerhart Friedlander, senior chemist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York; Seymour Wapner, a psychology professor emeritus of Clark; and Peter Willauer, former president of the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Maine.
 
 SUNY, Binghamton
 The State University of New York at Binghamton awarded 2,960 degrees at two commencements yesterday in the Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena. The ceremony for Harpur College undergraduates featured Dr. Niara Sudarkasa, the president of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, who spoke to the graduates and received an honorary degree. The graduate and professional schools' commencement speaker, Dr. Jerome Frank, a professor of psychology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, also received an honorary degree.
 
 University of Albany
 More than 4,500 students at the University at Albany received degrees yesterday at the Knickerbocker Arena during the university's 147th commencement.
The commencement was the first at the college for the new president, H. Patrick Swygert, who took office in August.
The main address was given by Houston Baker, an author and a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to Mr. Baker, receipents of honorary degrees were Robert M.

 Vassar College
 Despite the increasing number of deaths from AIDS in the United States, most people refuse to recognize the risks that the disease poses, Dr. Mathilde Krim, a leading AIDS researcher, told the graduates of Vassar College yesterday. "AIDS teaches us all over again the high price we pay for prejudice, irrationality and callousness," Dr. Krim, the founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research in Manhattan, said in her address to the 630 graduates at the college's 127th commencement. The ceremony, held outdoors on the school's campus in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., included the traditional procession of the Daisy Chain, a 150-foot chain of daisies and laurel presented to the senior class.
 
 Cornell University
 Frank H. T. Rhodes, the president of Cornell University, told 5,800 graduates at the university's 123d commencement in Ithaca, N.Y. yesterday that college campuses are microcosms of the larger world where heated debate takes place. But that debate, he said, does not "paint a picture of hostility and intolerance."
He said that while students and faculty members do not always agree on issues of race, affirmative action and multiculturalism, it does not mean that colleges are splintered into dozens of separate groups.
"We have had our demonstrations, but that is not the whole story," he said. "There is a belief that by participating in discussions of even the most sensitive issues, we can develop an understanding of our differences."
Mr. Rhodes said that he hoped graduates continued to live in an "atmosphere of tolerance," which would enable them to celebrate less familiar cultures and traditions.
 
 Trinity College
 Charles Osgood, the CBS news correspondent and commentator, treated graduates of Trinity College to a taste of his poetry in his address at the school's 165th commencement yesterday.
Speaking at the college's campus in Hartford, Mr. Osgood assured the students that they could succeed despite a flagging economy. "Armed with identity and purpose and determination, everything you need you already know," Mr. Osgood said. But he capped off his address with a more whimsical piece of advice: " 'To dream,' Mr. Shakespeare wrote, 'To dream, ay there's the rub.' And if at first you don't succeed, well welcome to the club."
Trinity awarded almost 450 bachelor's degrees and 38 master's. The school presented eight honorary doctorates.
Those honored, besides Mr. Osgood, were Jerome T. Friedman, 1990 Nobel Prize laureate in physics; Clara McBride Hale, founder of Hale House in Harlem; the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister of Riverside Church in Manhattan; Rosamond Bernier, art lecturer and editor; Henry D. Kisor, journalist and author; M. Kathleen McGrory, president emeritus of Hartford College for Women, and Synn Ilhi, president of Keimyung University in Korea.
 
 College of New Rochelle
 The College of New Rochelle held its 84th commencement ceremony yesterday on its campus in Westchester County. Sister Dorothy Ann Kelly, the college's president, awarded degrees to about 900 students. Dr. Johnnetta B. Cole, the president of Spelman College, addressed the graduates and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. Honorary degrees were also conferred on Sister Mary Rose McGeady, the president of Covenant House, and James J. Nicholson, who is leaving his position as chairman of the board of trustees at the College of New Rochelle. An honorary Doctor of Laws degree was awarded to John D. Feerick, the dean of Fordham Law School.
 
 University of Rochester
 Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, in an address yesterday at the 141st commencement of the University of Rochester, urged the graduates to continue their educations and to work on local levels to improve public education.
"Way to go, especially to you, for taking those steps necessary to reach your own potential," Mr. Alexander told the 2,409 graduates at the college's campus in Rochester. "That is the only way that America itself will reach its potential."
While conceding that "more and more people are uneasy about our educational results in America," Mr. Alexander assured the graduates of the value of their educations. "We already have the finest system of colleges and universities in the world," he said. "They are the surest way in America to move from the back to the front of the line."
Besides Mr. Alexander, recipients of honorary doctorates were Philippa Marrack and John W. Kappler, immunologists, and Sol M. Linowitz, a former United States diplomat.
 
 Touro College
 Professor Derrick A. Bell, who took an unpaid leave this academic year from Harvard Law School to protest the fact that the school has no black women as tenured professors, was the commencement speaker yesterday at the graduation ceremonies for the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center, Touro College in New York. Mr. Bell, the author of several books on race relations, once worked for the Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice, as well as other civil rights organizations. The commencement, Touro's ninth, graduated 220 students, its largest class yet.

HEADLINE: Half of Egypt's $20.2 Billion Debt Being Forgiven by U.S. and Allies

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 26

 BODY:
The United States and its allies have decided to forgive half the $20.2 billion that Egypt owes them, partly in thanks for the support it gave the anti-Iraq coalition during the Persian Gulf war, Egyptian officials said today.
The Bush Administration had lobbied hard for large-scale debt relief, and the package approved is one of the most generous the creditor nations have granted. 
 With the United States working behind the scenes to help Egypt's troubled economy, negotiators from the 17 creditor nations, including Japan, approved the plan in a meeting that ended here on Saturday.
During the gulf crisis, Egypt experienced billions of dollars in losses because of a drop in tourist spending, a fall in revenue from the Suez Canal and a loss of money sent home by the two million Egyptians who had worked in Kuwait and Iraq. Economists estimate those remittances at $2 billion to $10 billion annually.
In recent months, the Japanese have been bitterly critical of plans by the United States to forgive billions of dollars of Egyptian and Polish debt.
The Bush Administration wanted to reward President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for his pivotal role in lining up Arab nations to oppose Iraq and to reimburse Egypt for heavy financial losses in the gulf war. Egypt also sent armed forces to the war.
"This plan means that Egypt's friends in the West have taken their foot off Egypt's trachea," said Yahya Sadowski, a scholar on Egypt at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "It's very clearly a reward for having stood by the anti-Iraq coalition in the gulf crisis."
Economists estimated that the decision by the creditor nations, meeting in a group known as the Paris Club, should reduce Egypt's annual debt payments by about $1 billion a year. Last year Washington decided to wipe out $7.1 billion in Egypt's military debts and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have forgiven $6 billion that Egypt owed them.
As a result of these measures, Egypt's debt burden will shrink to about $25 billion from almost $50 billion in 1989, which made it the fourth-largest debtor among the world's developing nations. In addition to its $20.2 billion in government-to-government debt, Egypt owes $14 billion, including $8.7 billion to Western commercial banks and other private institutions and several billion dollars to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European nations.
In March, the Paris Club nations agreed to wipe out at least 50 percent of Poland's $33 billion in Government debt to help ease its painful pioneering efforts to transform its Communist economy into a capitalist one.
The large debtor nations of Latin America are expected to demand generous debt relief on a par with what Poland and Egypt have received. But David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, has asserted that Poland and Egypt are "unique politically and economically."
Japanese officials have said that in using debt forgiveness to reward certain nations, the United States is encouraging financial irresponsibility and making it difficult to say no to other countries with similar problems.
"An attempt has been made to single out Egypt and Poland as special cases, so I think there will be resistance to granting the same terms to other countries," said Sharif Ghalib, director of the Africa and Middle East Department at the Institute of International Finance in Washington.
This weekend's plan was approved only after Egypt pledged last month, in an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, to make sweeping changes aimed at bolstering its economy.
According to officials involved in the Paris Club talks, 15 percent of the $20.2 billion in government-to-government debt would be forgiven by July 1 and another 15 percent by Jan. 1, 1993. An additional 20 percent will be forgiven on July 1, 1994.
Egypt's national news agency, MENA, reported that the Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs, Atef Obeid, said the Paris Club agreement called for extending over 25 years the repayment of that part of the $20.2 billion that is not forgiven.
These conditions are less generous than those accorded Poland, whose creditors pledged to erase 30 percent of its debt immediately and another 20 percent after three years. One possible reason for the slower rate of debt forgiveness is to increase pressure on Egypt to follow the austerity plan that it signed with the monetary fund.
In the past, Egypt has not had a stellar record in complying with I.M.F. plans, which usually seek to bolster economies by reducing state subsidies, budget deficits and government intervention in the economy. Under the plan signed in April, Egypt is to enforce a 10 percent sales tax, increase its domestic energy prices and raise its customs duties. The plan also calls for reducing subsidies on bread and meat.
Ten years ago, Egypt, under President Anwar al-Sadat, failed to meet an I.M.F. austerity plan after rioting erupted when the Government reduced subsidies on food, as the fund had demanded. In 1987, Cairo failed to meet budgetary and pricing goals it had agreed to in accepting a $250 million loan from the fund.
"More clearly than ever before, there seems a commitment to make this type of reform," said Mr. Ghalib of the Institute of International Finance. "The fact that debt has been forgiven should make it easier to follow the reform process."
Mr. Sadowski, the Brookings economist, said that under an optimistic scenario, Egypt's economy would shrink for the next two years as a result of the monetary fund's austerity plan, then resume modest growth.
To help assist Egypt during its 18-month austerity plan, the fund is making a $372 million loan to Cairo.
Egypt's economy is expected to suffer the next few years because of the cut-off of remittances from the Egyptian workers who had been in Iraq and Kuwait. In addition, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are not hiring nearly as many Egyptians as had been expected.
But the debt forgiveness and the I.M.F. loans should help the Mubarak Government through its economic crisis.

Varsity Sports in Recession

 BODY:
The other sneaker has dropped on many of the money-strapped college athletic departments.
U.C.L.A., despite a $21 million budget for sports, had to cut its $3 million deficit. Three sports were drowned: water polo and men's and women's crew. In fact, other schools throughout the vast California educational system also were forced to pare down. A U.C.L.A. official said that over the last decade, every school in the Pacific-10, with the exception of Arizona State, has cut back in the number of varsity teams. 
 Previously, the University of Wisconsin and Yale reduced varsity sports.
And what happens to the athletes at these schools? For those on athletic scholarships, the schools say they will maintain the award for the full four years. But student-athletes who find themselves without a team are permitted by N.C.A.A. rules to be immediately eligible if they transfer to another school.

HEADLINE: Where New York's Finest Should Live

 BODY:
New York City's plan to hire thousands of police officers adds urgency to an old proposal: Require police recruits to live in the city. Deployment strategies for the expanded force make the case stronger than ever.
Other cities, notably Chicago, require police officers to live inside the city limits. There are sound practical arguments for the policy. In emergencies, resident officers can be called up more rapidly. Law enforcement can benefit from the presence of police on subways and streets as they go to work and back. A residency rule would likely increase minority representation on the force. And it would insure that officers living in the city, and those who choose to retire here, would spend their pay and retirement benefits in New York. 
 There's a more important, less tangible argument, however. Police officers who live in suburbs experience the city mainly as a place of violence and trouble -- and some learn to loathe the communities they are sworn to protect. There's a good chance those who live in the city, sharing a commitment to it, won't be so demoralized.
That concern is more important given Police Commissioner Lee Brown's plans to deploy newly hired officers on community patrol. Beyond simply responding to calls for help, such officers are expected to involve themselves with neighborhoods, assess crime problems and lead efforts to address them. Daily retreat to the suburbs seems inconsistent with that job description.
Opponents of the requirement, which needs Albany's approval, worry that recruits might not be able to afford the city, especially as their families grow older. These concerns may become less germane as real estate prices fall. In any case, recruiters are likely to find plenty of willing candidates during the current recession. Mr. Brown plans an aggressive search among men and women leaving military service. And the city recently raised the age limit for applicants from 29 to 35.
The arguments for a residency requirement outweigh the arguments against. The issue deserves a place on Albany's agenda.

HEADLINE: Silver Lining in Argentina's Cloud

 BODY:
Argentina's President, Carlos Menem, wants the world to invest in Argentina. His Government, he proclaims, is committed to turning around a 60-year legacy of coups, hyperinflation and Government favoritism. Mr. Menem's performance at first undermined his ambitions. But now a revised administration has begun to earn credibility.
As 1991 began, Argentina's fortunes seemed near rock bottom. Mr. Menem's efforts to win Army loyalty by pardoning human rights crimes failed to prevent a bloody, unsuccessful military revolt. Despite seven emergency economic programs in 20 months, inflation remained untamed and the currency remained vulnerable to damaging runs. 
 U.S. Ambassador Terence Todman denounced official extortion of bribes from American businesses. President Menem exchanged noisy corruption charges with his estranged in-laws, and he flaunted a red Ferrari given to him by Italian investors considering a hotel project.
In January, however, Mr. Menem shifted Domingo Cavallo, an independent economist, from Foreign Minister to economic policy chief. Mr. Cavallo committed the Government to live within its fiscal means. Budgets would be kept in surplus, tax laws strictly enforced, printing of unbacked money prohibited and the currency tied to the dollar.
So far, it has worked brilliantly. Inflation has dropped from triple to double digits and continues to fall. Interest rates have fallen from 200 percent to 10. Confidence and production have revived. But to sustain these gains, the Menem Government will have to accomplish what its predecessors could not: cut spending and raise tax collections sharply.
True, scandals still erupt: Wealthy Argentinians sneak luxury cars into the country; the Air Force pursues an out-of-control missile project once funded by Iraq. But for a welcome change, these scandals are no longer laughed off.
The car importers are being prosecuted, along with some notorious Menem in-laws. And the President is struggling to rein in the renegade missile program.
Argentine governments are notoriously fickle about tough economic plans. But if Mr. Cavallo's efforts persist, Washington can consider more substantial forms of encouragement.

HEADLINE: New York's Buses Need a Better Soot-Trap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There are serious problems with the trap oxidizers to curb diesel bus emissions that were not reflected in your news article on bus pollution ("U.S. Will Cite Manhattan for Soot Level," May 11). 
 While the Transit Authority claims that trap oxidizers are the best and most economical technology available to control soot, a recent study by my office found significant problems with the oxidizer technology. The study found that they broke down repeatedly during the test period; had to be redesigned twice, and were found to release emissions linked to acid rain and global warming.
In addition, maintenance costs were higher than the Transit Authority projected. Because the traps break down more often, the buses equipped with the devices could be out of service for long periods of time. While the T.A. says it is exploring other alternatives to deal with the high soot level in Manhattan, the only action it took was to purchase 400 trap oxidizers.
Trap oxidizers are a short-term solution for a long-term problem. The Transit Authority should be aggressively pursuing other alternatives to curb bus pollution in New York City, such as buses that run on alternative fuels. Including other types of pollution-control mechanisms in a comprehensive pollution control program would in the long run be more practical and environmentally safe for New York City.

HEADLINE: King Coffee Bean vs. King Coffee

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Colombia

 BODY:
In the cool Andean air of this mountain village, Juan Francisco Gomez shook rainwater from a coffee bush and displayed its glistening, ripening red berries. When dried and roasted, those beans will feed the river of arabica coffee that has swept Colombia to the top of the world coffee business.
Last year, in a historic upset, Colombia displaced Brazil as the world's top coffee exporter, in terms of income. 
 It earned $1.4 billion in 1990 from the sale of 13.9 million 60-kilo (132 pounds) bags of coffee. Brazil sold more coffee, at 16.9 million bags, but earned only $1.3 billion.
 
 Edge Expected to Grow

While Colombia's sales edge is now slim, many coffee experts expect it to grow, citing this nation's aggressive marketing efforts and Brazil's continuing internal problems that have hurt exports there.
Colombia's feat is all the more impressive given the stagnating demand and a collapse of coffee prices worldwide.
The United States remains the world's largest coffee consumer, but soft drinks displaced coffee in the 1980's as the nation's favorite drink. More ominous for producers, the portion of Americans in their 20's who regularly drink coffee dropped to 31 percent in 1990, from 82 percent in 1962. That shift leaves little hope that demand will rise soon in the country that consumes a third of the world's coffee.
Colombia's success in creating a market for higher-priced gourmet coffee featuring its beans is a result of more than just the clever $140 million advertising campaign featuring the mythical Juan Valdez and his patient burro.
Colombia's arabica beans are considered higher quality and better tasting than those from Brazil and the robusta variety from African countries like Kenya. Brazil also exports a sizable amount of the cheaper robusta coffee beans, which are often mixed with arabica.
In its January issue, Consumer Reports, which accepts no advertising, ranked 29 ground coffees sold in the United States by flavor and aroma. The top five all used Colombian beans, a fact they display prominently on their labels. They were Yuban 100% Colombian, MJB 100% Colombian, Maxwell House Colombian Supreme, Brown Gold 100% Colombian and Hills Brothers 100% Colombian. Yuban and Maxwell House are Kraft General Foods products, while MJB and Hills Brothers are brands of the Nestle Foods Corporation. Brown Gold is a product of Tetley Inc., which is owned by Allied-Lyons P.L.C.
These companies have also discovered that they can charge much more for coffee labeled Colombian, even though, as Consumer Reports noted, Colombian beans do not guarantee a great cup of coffee.
"The American consumer is saying: 'I no longer want a coffee full of Brazilian robusta,' " said Gustavo Gaviria Angel, a major exporter in Bogota. "People will pay more for a better cup of coffee."
 
 Breakup of Coffee Pact

The main blow to coffee producer prices came from the breakup of the International Coffee Agreement in July 1989. After that, prices fell to their lowest real levels since the turn of the century, according to a new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Brazilian growers were particularly hard hit because coffee long ago lost its allure and support in government circles there.
"The Brazilians are pulling out their coffee bushes with both hands," Mr. Gomez said as he relaxed on his veranda here and offered a fresh cup of his product. "In Colombia, we never felt the crisis. The price never dropped a peso."
Indeed, Colombia's strategy for dethroning Brazil can be summed up in three points: quality of beans, reliability of supply and long-term support to growers.
Noting that Colombia also overtook Brazil last year in tons of exported arabica beans, the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters conceded in a recent report, "The results indicate that one (Brazil) is the residual supplier, while the other (Colombia) is the preferred supplier."
 
 35% of Foreign Exchange

Colombia earns about 35 percent of its foreign exchange from coffee sales, and this economic importance translates into a national concern for quality. This small farm here in San Francisco, about 70 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital, is one of 300,000 in Colombia. Beans are picked by hand and washed the same day. On Brazilian farms, often large estates, coffee is often picked by machines and sold unwashed.
"We have quality-control inspectors every step of the way to the port," said Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez president of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, a semiofficial body that also maintains a network of agricultural services. "We have banned the sale for export of inferior grades of coffee; we sort out broken beans, black beans."
Seeking to maintain and to modernize production over the long term, the federation recently drew heavily on a price stabilization fund to support prices paid to growers.
"International prices dropped 50 percent, but producer prices dropped only 7 percent" in dollars, said Roberto Junguito Bonnet, president of the Coffee Exporters Association, a private group.
 
 Only 7% of Brazil's Exports

Coffee's percentage of Brazil's overall export earnings dropped from 70 percent at the turn of the century to 7 percent today.
As recently as the 1950's, Brazil produced half of the world's coffee crop. Because of a freeze in 1975, a drought in 1985, and Government mismanagement in recent years, Brazil has slid to about 22 percent of the world crop.
The International Coffee Agreement fell apart in 1989 because Brazil refused to lower its quota from 30 percent of world production in tons. If Brazil decided to resume cooperating, it would be lucky to get 25 percent as its new quota. Colombia now has an 18 percent world market share -- well above the 15 percent quota it was allotted in the pact.
In 1990, Brazil's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, abolished the Brazilian Coffee Institute, a Government agency that coordinated exports and promotion. Afterward, Brazilian and Colombian coffee experts say, Brazil's coffee policy fell by default into the hands of amateurs.
Last March 21, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, then Brazil's Economy Minister, said Brazil was simultaneously suspending coffee exports and seeking a new agreement on coffee quotas. Denouncing the move, Brazilian coffee exporters argued that Brazil should sell as much coffee as possible to justify a large quota. After two weeks of debate, the minister backtracked and resumed coffee exports.
On the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, a scandal arose over unseasonably large volumes of coffee contracts made just before the export suspension. So, Brazilian officials canceled all export registrations made on March 21 and announced an investigation with cooperation from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States.
The following month, the International Coffee Organization in London suspended Brazil's voting rights because the country had not paid $280,000 in dues. Brazil paid in late April, but at a May 3 meeting of the group's executive committee, Brazil changed its position yet again. It was the only country to vote against resuming talks for a new coffee agreement.
 
 Making Colombia Look Good
 In Colombia, coffee officials avoid criticizing Brazil's missteps. But they acknowledge that Brazil has helped Colombia build an image as a reliable supplier. "Colombia has never left the market," said a trading official with the National Federation. "Reliability of supply is one of the major pillars of our strategy."
To promote Colombian coffee and to discourage blending with lesser-grade robustas, the federation offers a sales discount of 2.5 cents a pound to roasters who market their product as "100% Colombian."
Even in this village, two hours northwest of Bogota, growers are aware of the gourmet market in the United States and of the growing market in Japan, where coffee consumption now rivals that of tea.

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on May 27 titled "Two Major Coffee Producers," about the exports of Brazil and Colombia, misstated the unit of measurement and incorrectly labeled the scale. The chart showed the countries' exports in billions of pounds, not trillions, and the scale should have been labeled from 0.0 to 3.0 billion, not from 0 to 30 trillion. In addition, the article misstated Brazil's 1990 coffee exports. Brazil sold 16.6 million 60- kilo bags (each equaling 132 pounds), not 16.9 million.

HEADLINE: The Right Medicine

SERIES: Second of two articles

 BODY:
The cost of American medical care -- already the most expensive in the world -- is escalating 20 percent a year. Yet nearly one in every seven Americans lacks insurance. The system frustrates taxpayers, physicians, patients and insurers. That's why nine out of ten Americans want fundamental change. 
 But what kind of change? The most promising remedy is managed care, proposed most articulately by Prof. Alain Enthoven of Stanford University. The plan would guarantee universal coverage at rates that don't discriminate against the seriously ill. And it would control costs for everyone else. The idea is complex. But so is the problem.
Managed care would replace the prevalent out-of-control payment system. Doctors are now typically paid according to services rendered, which encourages them to render needless, expensive services. Patients choose their doctors, so the insurer has no opportunity to negotiate fees and treatment practices. Because patients pay only a small part of the bill, they have little incentive to monitor costs. And insurance companies are free to skim off low-risk individuals and avoid people they can identify as potentially needy.
Under managed care, individuals would be grouped independently of their health needs; that way the needy wouldn't be excluded or charged ruinous fees. Mr. Enthoven would retain employers as the primary basis for grouping and would cover other individuals through a geographically based public pool. Prof. Peter Diamond of M.I.T. would scrap the need for employer-based insurance and place everyone who lives in the same area into large groups ranging from 10,000 to 100,000.
The next step would be to create a sponsor -- typically a large employer or a public agency -- for each group to organize insurance for its members. Mr. Enthoven would have the sponsor limit the doctors and hospitals that can be used, thereby gaining the upper hand in negotiating treatment practices and payments. The sponsor would also standardize the packages that insurance companies offer members of the group, making comparison shopping simple. It would also monitor quality.
Limiting choice becomes the key to guaranteeing affordable, quality care to everyone. Individuals would be welcome to buy additional coverage outside the plan from any doctor they chose, but at their own expense. A good managed-care program would make patients conscious of costs by limiting tax subsidies to basic coverage; anything more would come out of the individual's pocket.
The Rand Corporation, the California research concern, found that a managed-care program in Puget Sound lowered costs by almost 30 percent with virtually no loss of patient satisfaction. The idea isn't simple. But to a Congress and country desperate to contain the exploding cost of health care, it's a ray of hope.

HEADLINE: King Coffee Bean vs. King Coffee

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Colombia

 BODY:
In the cool Andean air of this mountain village, Juan Francisco Gomez shook rainwater from a coffee bush and displayed its glistening, ripening red berries. When dried and roasted, those beans will feed the river of arabica coffee that has swept Colombia to the top of the world coffee business.
Last year, in a historic upset, Colombia displaced Brazil as the world's top coffee exporter, in terms of income. 
 It earned $1.4 billion in 1990 from the sale of 13.9 million 60-kilo (132 pounds) bags of coffee. Brazil sold more coffee, at 16.9 million bags, but earned only $1.3 billion.
 
 Edge Expected to Grow

While Colombia's sales edge is now slim, many coffee experts expect it to grow, citing this nation's aggressive marketing efforts and Brazil's continuing internal problems that have hurt exports there.
Colombia's feat is all the more impressive given the stagnating demand and a collapse of coffee prices worldwide.
The United States remains the world's largest coffee consumer, but soft drinks displaced coffee in the 1980's as the nation's favorite drink. More ominous for producers, the portion of Americans in their 20's who regularly drink coffee dropped to 31 percent in 1990, from 82 percent in 1962. That shift leaves little hope that demand will rise soon in the country that consumes a third of the world's coffee.
Colombia's success in creating a market for higher-priced gourmet coffee featuring its beans is a result of more than just the clever $140 million advertising campaign featuring the mythical Juan Valdez and his patient burro.
Colombia's arabica beans are considered higher quality and better tasting than those from Brazil and the robusta variety from African countries like Kenya. Brazil also exports a sizable amount of the cheaper robusta coffee beans, which are often mixed with arabica.
In its January issue, Consumer Reports, which accepts no advertising, ranked 29 ground coffees sold in the United States by flavor and aroma. The top five all used Colombian beans, a fact they display prominently on their labels. They were Yuban 100% Colombian, MJB 100% Colombian, Maxwell House Colombian Supreme, Brown Gold 100% Colombian and Hills Brothers 100% Colombian. Yuban and Maxwell House are Kraft General Foods products, while MJB and Hills Brothers are brands of the Nestle Foods Corporation. Brown Gold is a product of Tetley Inc., which is owned by Allied-Lyons P.L.C.
These companies have also discovered that they can charge much more for coffee labeled Colombian, even though, as Consumer Reports noted, Colombian beans do not guarantee a great cup of coffee.
"The American consumer is saying: 'I no longer want a coffee full of Brazilian robusta,' " said Gustavo Gaviria Angel, a major exporter in Bogota. "People will pay more for a better cup of coffee."
 
 Breakup of Coffee Pact

The main blow to coffee producer prices came from the breakup of the International Coffee Agreement in July 1989. After that, prices fell to their lowest real levels since the turn of the century, according to a new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Brazilian growers were particularly hard hit because coffee long ago lost its allure and support in government circles there.
"The Brazilians are pulling out their coffee bushes with both hands," Mr. Gomez said as he relaxed on his veranda here and offered a fresh cup of his product. "In Colombia, we never felt the crisis. The price never dropped a peso."
Indeed, Colombia's strategy for dethroning Brazil can be summed up in three points: quality of beans, reliability of supply and long-term support to growers.
Noting that Colombia also overtook Brazil last year in tons of exported arabica beans, the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters conceded in a recent report, "The results indicate that one (Brazil) is the residual supplier, while the other (Colombia) is the preferred supplier."
 
 35% of Foreign Exchange

Colombia earns about 35 percent of its foreign exchange from coffee sales, and this economic importance translates into a national concern for quality. This small farm here in San Francisco, about 70 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital, is one of 300,000 in Colombia. Beans are picked by hand and washed the same day. On Brazilian farms, often large estates, coffee is often picked by machines and sold unwashed.
"We have quality-control inspectors every step of the way to the port," said Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez president of the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, a semiofficial body that also maintains a network of agricultural services. "We have banned the sale for export of inferior grades of coffee; we sort out broken beans, black beans."
Seeking to maintain and to modernize production over the long term, the federation recently drew heavily on a price stabilization fund to support prices paid to growers.
"International prices dropped 50 percent, but producer prices dropped only 7 percent" in dollars, said Roberto Junguito Bonnet, president of the Coffee Exporters Association, a private group.
 
 Only 7% of Brazil's Exports

Coffee's percentage of Brazil's overall export earnings dropped from 70 percent at the turn of the century to 7 percent today.
As recently as the 1950's, Brazil produced half of the world's coffee crop. Because of a freeze in 1975, a drought in 1985, and Government mismanagement in recent years, Brazil has slid to about 22 percent of the world crop.
The International Coffee Agreement fell apart in 1989 because Brazil refused to lower its quota from 30 percent of world production in tons. If Brazil decided to resume cooperating, it would be lucky to get 25 percent as its new quota. Colombia now has an 18 percent world market share -- well above the 15 percent quota it was allotted in the pact.
In 1990, Brazil's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello, abolished the Brazilian Coffee Institute, a Government agency that coordinated exports and promotion. Afterward, Brazilian and Colombian coffee experts say, Brazil's coffee policy fell by default into the hands of amateurs.
Last March 21, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, then Brazil's Economy Minister, said Brazil was simultaneously suspending coffee exports and seeking a new agreement on coffee quotas. Denouncing the move, Brazilian coffee exporters argued that Brazil should sell as much coffee as possible to justify a large quota. After two weeks of debate, the minister backtracked and resumed coffee exports.

So, Brazilian officials canceled all export registrations made on March 21 and announced an investigation with cooperation from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the United States.

HEADLINE: Jacob Clayman, Former Lobbyist and Union Official, Is Dead at 86

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Jacob Clayman, a former president of the Industrial Union Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and retired president of the National Council of Senior Citizens, died Friday at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 86 years old.
He died of a heart attack, said his daughter, Miriam Yale of Silver Spring. 
 At the time of his death, Mr. Clayman was president emeritus of the National Council of Senior Citizens. His last years had been spent lobbying on behalf of the aging and his organization had won major legislative gains in defense of the Social Security System and played an important role in the 1981 White House Conference on Aging.
As a longtime senior official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Clayman took the lead in its reorganization in the 1970's. He sought ways to coordinate with international unions in dealing with multinational companies.
 
Protest Organizer

In 1975, as executive director of the Industrial Union Department, he organized the large job rally in Washington to protest high unemployment and press for a nationwide public works program.
Born in Boston, he moved to Niles, Ohio, and paid his way through Oberlin College as a steel worker. He went on to the University of Michigan, receiving a law degree in 1930.
He began practicing law in Detroit, then returned to Niles, where he practiced labor law. In 1941, he was elected to the Ohio Legislature.
In 1943, he became general counsel to the Ohio State Congress of Industrial Organizations and was elected full-time secretary treasurer of the organization in 1948. He served in that post until the organization merged with the American Federation of Labor in 1955. After the merger, he was named special assistant to the president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in New York.
He returned to Ohio in 1958 to take part in labor's successful fight against a proposed anti-union law. He then served the Ohio State A.F.L.-C.I.O. as its representative at the State Legislature and practiced law with his bother, David, in Columbus.
Mr. Clayman was appointed the administrative director of the Industrial Union Department in 1960.
A founder of the Consumer Federation of America, he was named the first president of the advocacy group in 1968. He also served on the board of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, president of the National Civil Liberties Clearing House and vice president of the American Immigration and Citizenship Conference.
He is survived by his wife, Helen, of Silver Spring; two daughter, Miriam and Cece Kurtz of Denver; two brothers, Philip of Columbia, Md., and David of Columbus; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
An Envoy Balances Old Image In New Era

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
Rinaldo Petrignani is one of those rare am bassadors who a real and perhaps lasting effect on their countries' relations with another nation.
The 63-year-old Italian, who resigned this month, effective July 31, has spent 10 years as Rome's envoy to Washington, tirelessly promoting the Atlantic alliance at a time when it has been under severe stress, and fighting the stereotypical vision of Italy as a land of opera singers, red wine, spaghetti and dusty relics. 
 "We consider ourselves a great modern nation," Mr. Petrignani said the other day, "and I think we are legitimately entitled to be recognized as such by the other world powers."
After the terror-racked 1970's -- the Italians call them the "anni di piombo," or years of lead -- came a tremendous boom that transformed the region north of the Po River into one of the most dynamic economic zones in the world. Eventually the transformation won Italy a seat at the meetings of the world's most powerful finance ministers, joining Britain, Germany, France, Japan, the United States and Canada.
With Mr. Petrignani cast in a major role, Italy also involved itself more deeply in the Western military alliance. It played a significant part in the multi-national efforts in Lebanon and in the Persian Gulf, contributed troops to the peace-keeping force in the Sinai and, perhaps most important, accepted cruise missiles at bases in Sicily.
"That was a turning point in the history of our times, because it helped to convince the Soviet Union that Europe and the United States were prepared to stand fast for as long as it took to face them down," the ambassador said. "For its part, Italy showed that it could and would accept responsibility."
At the time, the deployment of the missiles was highly controversial in Europe, with antiwar rallies across the continent. Germany, whose sites were deemed crucial, said it would accept no cruise units unless some other European power, in addition to insular Britain, was willing to do so at the same time.
Italy, in the face of heavy domestic criticism, decided to go along.
Although politicians in some countries, like Germany and Britain, have sometimes argued that Europe must choose between ties to the United States and closer internal links, Mr. Petrignani insists that one reinforces the other.
"An American presence, diminished but still substantial, is essential to keeping the various European countries in balance with each other," he said. "And a more unified Europe will be able to play a larger role in the alliance than in the past, thus relieving the United States of some of its burdens."
Now he sees the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Italy's role in it, as becoming more important with the diminution of the Soviet threat.
The ambassador, a writer and intellectual as well as a diplomat, sees the United States as a country basically different from European nations, notably in the kind of nationalism it embraces. Nineteenth-century romantic nationalism like Germany's or Italy's, he believes, is unlike the 18th-century rationalism underlying American patriotism.
"This is the universal nation," he said, "the nation that contains the world within herself, whose nationalism therefore excludes nobody."
Mr. Petrignani, who spent 11 years as a junior officer in the Italian embassy here between 1957 and 1968, knows Washington and the United States better than most diplomats. In retirement, he will try to build on that, working in a way he has not yet defined to foster business relationships between the two countries, and living here and in Rome.
But he acknowledges with a wistful smile that he will never again live as grandly as he has in the last decade. As Italian ambassador, he is the master of one of the capital's grandest houses, Villa Firenze, which sits in the midst of a spectacular 21-acre park in far northwest Washington.
Built by a descendant of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, it was owned by the Guggenheim family until bought by the Italian Government in 1976.
"The next house won't be much like this," Mr. Petrignani said as he strolled among the roses, peonies, rhododendron and begonias in the embassy gardens. "But it will be mine."

HEADLINE: Brasilia Journal;
To Get It Off His Chest, Chief Puts It on T-Shirt

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRASILIA, May 26

 BODY:
It was late on a Saturday afternoon when President Fernando Collor de Mello was noisily deserted by a close political ally. But the President had a novel way to quickly control the damage.
The next morning, Mr. Collor emerged from his compound here for a Sunday jog. Stretched over his chest was a freshly minted T-shirt, the paint barely dry. Above a stylized hourglass, an inscription read, "Time and the Lord will judge." 
 In a youthful nation where a surfer's physique leaves a more lasting impression than a news conference, the chest of President Collor has emerged as a major medium for political marketing of his Government.
Every Sunday that he spends in the capital, the 41-year-old President sets off for a jog with a new message stamped on his chest.
 
A Chance Discovery
 Firmly enthroned in the folklore of the one-year-old Collor Government, the Sunday T-shirt reaches a wide audience in this nation of 155 million people. Not only is Sunday a slow news day, but Brazil's low literacy rate makes the electorate highly susceptible to images. Access to television is virtually universal across this vast nation, and glossy photo magazines have audiences comparable to those of Life and Look in the United States of the 1940's.
"Like most good ideas, the T-shirt was a chance discovery," the President's spokesman, Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva, said, pensively rolling a cigar between his fingers at the steel and glass presidential palace here. "Now, it gets good media play."
David Fleischer, an American political science professor here, said: "It's Brazil's equivalent of Reagan chopping wood or mending fences on the ranch. It builds up Collor's macho image."
For example, one Sunday last December, when criticism thickened over Mr. Collor's economic austerity program, the President was photographed jogging in pouring rain in a T-shirt printed, in Latin, "Through adversity to success."
During the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Collor sported a series of shirts that seemed to say more about the conflict than he did in public. Before the allied attack began, he jogged with a shirt printed with a dove of peace and the Arabic word for peace, "Salaam." Early in February, at the height of the fighting, his shirt asked, "Who will pay for this?" After the cease-fire, in early March, his shirt asked again, "Peace?"
 
'Enviable Physique'
 Seeking to promote regional causes, he has jogged with shirts promoting a rock festival in Rio de Janeiro, tourism in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, next year's United Nations environmental conference in Rio, and a campaign to hold the 2000 Olympics in Brasilia. He was worn four different anti-drug T-shirts, one for Indians, one for children, one for May Day, and one for Mother's Day.
"Collor's chest has become today the most sought after billboard in the nation," Jornal do Brasil, a Rio daily, wrote recently.
A photo newsmagazine recently gushed about the President's "enviable physique." Brazil's political opposition, tired of opening Monday newspapers to see a trim Mr. Collor jogging in a new shirt, are now trying to debunk his athletic prowess.
Late in April, Isto E, a Sao Paulo newsmagazine, wrote glowingly of the jogging abilities of Orestes Quercia, former Governor of Sao Paulo State and a leading contender for the 1994 presidential elections.
Praising Mr. Quercia as "a well-prepared runner," the magazine said the flat-stomached, 51-year-old politician jogs 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) in 40 minutes -- supposedly a better time than the President, 10 years his junior.
In a counterattack, President Collor told reporters that Mr. Quercia "jogs on asphalt" while he runs cross-country, over hill and dale. Mr. Rosa e Silva, the spokesman, fired off a letter to the magazine, affirming that early in April Mr. Collor was officially clocked running 5,000 meters (3.1 miles) in 24 minutes.
With Brazil's President distributing T-shirts as souvenirs to political followers and as peace offerings to political adversaries, his spokesman has also used them to defuse potentially embarrassing situations.
 
A Regional Expression
 Last month, the President traveled to Juazeiro do Norte, an interior town in Brazil's impoverished northeast. During his speech to a crowd of 30,000, a small group started chanting anti-Government slogans.
Sleeves rolled up, Mr. Collor, a fellow northeasterner, bellowed back into the microphones: "My father always told me that I was born with the purple thing. And I really have it to confront all those people who conspire against the democratic process."
Reporters from southern Brazil stared at each other, mystified by the expression. Their northeastern colleagues explained that the President had used a regional expression referring to the biological fact that some boys are born with inflamed, oversized genitalia.
The political left gleefully seized on the phrase. At Mr. Collor's next stop, in the Amazon, protesters painted their faces purple.
Sensing a public relations crisis, the presidential spokesman made a desperate, late Saturday night call to an advertising agency here.
On Sunday morning, Mr. Collor stepped out for his jog. Tinted lilac, his new shirt proclaimed: "Purple Passion in Brazil!"

HEADLINE: School for Japan's Executives in U.S.

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
The international world of Japanese business requires English-speaking executives -- and a businesswoman from Tokyo is doing all she can to provide the lessons.
Hiroko Minami, 43 years old, is the founder, sole owner and force behind the Bi-Lingual Corporation, a multimillion-dollar chain of more than 20 language schools in Japan and New York. Though Bi-Lingual initially sought to teach English to secretaries when it opened in 1973, its emphasis on speaking skills and American business and cultural values attracted a corporate clientele that has helped to make it one of the largest language schools in Japan. 
 "These days Japanese people think they should become a more international people in their minds and culture," Ms. Minami said recently at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y., where she spends about half the year. "So, I'm interested not only in language instruction, but communication itself."
 
 Manners and Mannerisms Studied

By conducting classes as friendly interpersonal exchanges, and using teaching materials that focus on American manners as well as mannerisms, Bi-Lingual promises a cross-cultural fluency that has drawn clients from big Japanese corporations, including Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Toyota Motor and the Bank of Japan. Nearly 40,000 students -- from schoolchildren to executives -- study at Bi-Lingual in Japan each year, providing the company with revenues of about $50 million.
In 1987, Ms. Minami decided to tap the growing market of Japanese executives working abroad and opened her first New York school at the World Trade Center. Though well-established schools like Berlitz and Cambridge draw thousands of students to study English in the United States, Ms. Minami's teaching style, which she designed especially for Japanese students, attracted enough business that she opened a second school in midtown Manhattan in 1989. She plans to open schools in South Korea and Europe as well. Classes for students learning Japanese are also offered.
At Bi-Lingual's school on the 81st floor in the World Trade Center, where students pay about $100 for a 90-minute lesson, there is a traditional tatami room, with a low table and matted floor, as well as overstuffed brocade sofas and Victorian knickknacks. Instructors offer clients a choice of coffee or green tea, and lessons are taught either in small groups or one-on-one.
Since the Japanese study English for six years in secondary school, most of them can easily read a facsimile document. But few can telephone to make an appointment in English, so Ms. Minami designed her curriculum to increase students' oral skills.
Atsushi Miyanoya, a 32-year-old representative with the Bank of Japan, has been studying at Bi-Lingual three times a week since he arrived from Tokyo in November. With his feet propped on the legs of his chair and his head bent over a pad, Mr. Miyanoya listened to his instructor, Duane Tragis, read a passage on West African commodities. He then answered a series of questions using business terms; for example, "In the pits of the coffee, sugar and cocoa exchanges . . ."
Because 150 of the 250 students in New York are Japanese men of the business world, the school here focuses on corporate needs. Some younger men attend a program that helps them prepare for the exam they must take to enter American M.B.A. programs.
After reading the business text, Mr. Tragis practiced dialogue with Mr. Miyanoya, using idioms -- like "over coffee" and "are you free Friday?" -- that can cause puzzlement among newcomers to the United States.
"Bi-Lingual's method is more useful in the business world," said Mr. Miyanoya, who studied briefly at another school in Tokyo. "Since I have no experience living and working abroad, it even helps with basic things like telephone conversations."
Koji Matsuo, the head instructor of Bi-Lingual in New York, said: "The Japanese are shy. It's a cultural thing. We are not taught to express ourselves. You know how you have 'show and tell' in kindergarten? The Japanese have nothing like that."
The Bi-Lingual approach requires students to assume a more assertive American demeanor and gives the Japanese a chance to show and tell and even ham it up a little through playing roles in simulated situations, like calling the doctor or bringing the car to a mechanic.
The instructors for the most part are Americans with some background in business and Japanese culture. One aspect of the classes is discussion of the differences between Japanese and American values.
 
 Exception in Patriarchal Culture

For many Japanese, part of Bi-Lingual's appeal is its feminine mystique. Ms. Minami, who is divorced, is a petite woman with an air that is somehow both fragile and indomitable. She far outdistanced the expectations for women in Japan when, in 1973 at the age of 26, she opened her first school outside Kyoto. Because the bank would not give a loan to a single woman, Ms. Minami borrowed $15,000 from her father.
"It was unusual, but my father supported me," she said. Ms. Minami never faced the resistance so many Japanese women experience when they try careers in larger companies. "I created my own company, and I lived within the world I created," she continued. "My company is run by my own values."
Ms. Minami's management practices -- having mostly women on her staff, being willing to keep women on the job after they marry, and basing promotions on merit -- are detailed in a book whose title can be translated as, "A Sensitive, Open Approach to Management," written by Yasuo Turumaki. Published in November 1990 in Japan, this slim volume caused some members of the business community there, already besieged by changing cultural expectations among women, to reconsider their own expectations.
"Ms. Minami is a women's success story in Japan," Mr. Miyanoya said, adding that a growing number of women are successfully starting their own businesses in Japan.
"Women's ideas are new, and very customer oriented," he said.
 
 Expanding Into Politics

Ms. Minami says she is now focusing on Japan in the 21st century and expanding Bi-Lingual's focus to include politics.
"During the gulf war Japan was criticized by the world because we did not have any policy," she said. "And I was very, very sorry about that. So, I have developed an international politics program for students who are very fluent."
In addition to the gulf war, Bi-Lingual's program will cover perestroika and relations between North and South Korea. Students will read one- or two-page summaries of political issues and then discuss the various views on the subject.
"The younger generation has to be more responsible to the international order," she said. "Not only in terms of language; language is only one element. We should know more about the world, and this way we can improve communication. This is my concept."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Modest Summer Upturn Forecast

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some analysts say the prospects of a modest summer upturn in the economy seem to be improving.
If the forecast is correct and a "soft takeoff" is achieved, a resumption of growth will probably not be met by rising interest rates. But the suggestion of a more potent recovery will not be well received in the credit markets, and any rise in interest rates will probably push the economy back into recession. 
 To a large extent, analysts base their more optimistic outlook on the fact that for the last month or so, conditions have not gotten any worse.
To buttress their argument, economists point to housing, which is showing some growth, to signs that manufacturing is improving and to employment, where the rapid pace of layoffs in the first quarter seems to have slowed.
 
'Bottoming Phase'
 "We think we are in the bottoming phase right now," said Adrian Dillon, chief economist at the Eaton Corporation. "Things are still terrible, but they are a lot less terrible than they were three months ago. There is an even chance we could see positive growth in the second quarter, and a very good chance we will see it in the third."
Not only has the decline in key indicators slowed, but the shortage of credit, a condition that has made this recession much different from others in the postwar era, has also begun to fade, analysts say.
"It wasn't that long ago that we had reason to believe that the credit system in the United States could implode," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. "There is still a chronic problem, but the passing away of the acute condition is another pretty solid indication that the recovery can be contemplated."
Mr. Soss and others point to the record volume of investment-grade debt that was issued in the first quarter, securities which in many instances were used to refinance higher-priced debt.
 
Confidence Seen Returning
 Last week's offering of $200 million worth of high-yield securities for Chiquita Brands International, a sale that was increased in size from $175 million because of strong investor demand, suggests that confidence is returning to the "junk bond" market as well, the analysts say.
"Compared to how people felt in the autumn of 1990, there is more confidence that we are going to pull through this downturn with most corporate balance sheets in fairly good condition," said John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service, the bond ratings agency.
In addition to lower interest rates, Mr. Lonski said corporate balance sheets had been helped by the fact that the slide in profits thus far has not been as severe as it was in 1982, when the economy felt the full weight of the 1981-1982 recession.
Considerable risks remain. Consumers are still cautious. Incomes, which have risen a bit in the last two months because of a slowdown in inflation, will probably get pinched again as state and local governments deal with their fiscal problems by raising taxes. Huge inventories of vacant office buildings mean that commercial construction activity will remain moribund. And with a great deal of idle capacity, manufacturers are not likely to increase capital spending.
"The risk to the forecast is not that the economy starts accelerating rapidly," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "The risk is that the downturn will last longer than people think."
In virtually every recession of any duration, Mr. Fine pointed out, "there has been at least one quarter of positive growth." He added, "It may be that the third quarter will be that quarter."
The sense that the economy has reached its trough and may be beginning to stir is likely to be reinforced this week, analysts say.
On the negative side, a report expected today from the Conference Board will probably show that consumer confidence eroded for a second consecutive month in May, after the rise in March that followed the success in the war in the Persian Gulf.
But, if forecasters are correct, reports scheduled to be released Thursday will show that in April personal income rose and sales of new single-family homes increased for the second straight month.
On Friday a monthly survey of purchasing managers from the Chicago area will probably show that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved slightly in May. The Chicago poll is widely seen as a telling precursor of the national survey, which is released on the first business day of each month.
"In general, the data this week will reinforce the impression the economy is bottoming," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.

HEADLINE: Careers;
First Class To Graduate In Toy Design

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
THE FASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY graduates its first class of toy designers on Friday, with 17 students receiving Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees.
Despite the recession, which has hurt the toy industry, Judy Ellis, associate professor in the toy design department and placement director for its students, said that as of last Friday, 9 of the 17 had already found jobs. 
 Salaries of those who have found jobs range from $21,000 to $26,000.
"Everything is difficult now, but small companies are interested in our graduates, because this is an opportunity for them to work with young people who understand trends and the environmental and safety features required for toys," she said.
Professor Ellis says the institute's program is the only one of its kind in the country, although other colleges offer a specialty in toy design consisting of a few targeted courses. Next year's graduating class at the institute, in New York City, will have 13 members, and 19 applicants have been accepted for the third class.
Last summer, she said, she could not supply enough students for internships offered at toy companies like Mattel, Tyco, North American Bear, Hasbro, Buddy L and others.
Entry to the program requires two years of college with an associate degree, preferably in design or an art-related area. The program itself takes two years of full-time study. About half of the applicants come from outside the institute, and half have completed their first two years there.
One unusual required course is titled "Probability and Geometry." "It helps the students with game play and to understand logic," Professor Ellis explained, adding that students use mathematics to calculate the working measurements needed for production machinery. Other course subjects include the history of industrial design, toy marketing and child psychology.
Jobs for the more experienced designers are much harder to find, except for those at the department-head level, said RitaSue Siegel, who heads RitaSue Siegel Associates, a consulting and recruiting firm that specializes in finding midlevel and highly paid designers.
"The majority of our searches these days are at the higher levels," she said last week. She explained that at department-head levels top designers often earn a base salary of $125,000, plus bonuses. "Vice presidents of marketing would get more," she added.
"Marketers are now an essential part of most senior management teams," she said. "Today, design is where marketing was 30 years ago." She urges top management to integrate design strategies more effectively with other management planning.
Miss Siegel contends that often "designers are isolated from the people who collect information, analyze it, develop products and marketing concepts and make decisions."
She said she thought that part of the problem "lies in the designers' inability to communicate effectively in a language that business understands." She advises designers to take speaking and writing courses, and she urges them "to learn to operate as team players."
She also urges companies to do more to keep design teams content, by encouraging them to publish articles in design magazines, for instance, or to enter design contests, attend conferences and take study trips.
Art and design "are very different creative disciplines," she said, explaining that designers "work on projects that the real world brings to them and pays them to do." In college most design students specialize in one of four areas: architecture or graphic, industrial or interior design.
"Design is an essential business function," Miss Siegel continued, "and art is not."
She added, "I believe that designers are every bit as important to strategic business planning as marketers, financial types and engineers."

HEADLINE: Making Disposal Easier, by Design

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Environmental concerns are moving onto industrial designers' drawing boards. Designers of autos and home appliances have traditionally worried about appearance, durability and manufacturing efficiency. Now, with more emphasis on conservation and recycling, they are being asked to anticipate what will happen once a product's useful life is over.
Several industries have begun designing products easy to disassemble into parts that are readily recycled. In 1988, BMW introduced the limited production model Z1, a two-seat roadster, whose plastic body panels were designed to come off easily with the removal of a few fasteners. 
 And the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company plans to bring out later this year a plastic desk organizer that is designed for recycling. "It snaps together," said Glenn Wallace, 3M's director of resource recovery. "So it can be disassembled by snapping it apart." Each part is marked with the recycling symbol -- three arrows in a circle -- and a number indicating the type of plastic resin.
Although recycling efforts have focused on items in household trash, including newspapers and aluminum cans, many in the industry expect large durable goods to become the target of waste-disposal regulation. "Durables are the next frontier," said Michael Fisher, an official of the Council for Solid Waste Solutions, a plastics trade group.
More and more laws promote recycling and tighten restrictions on what can be dumped in landfills.
Eight states now have laws banning appliances from landfills, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Appliances must be taken apart to recover useful materials; whatever cannot be sold and is not hazardous then goes to the landfill.
Last year more than 350 bills were introduced in 36 states to restrict the use of plastics, and 54 laws were enacted, according to Waste Management Inc. Hundreds of other measures were considered by local governments. The New York Court of Appeals recently upheld Suffolk County's ban on polystyrene and polyvinyl-chloride packaging.
 
Tougher Rules Abroad
 Regulations abroad are often much tougher. In Germany, the environmental minister has proposed making automobile companies responsible for ultimate disposal. Germany is also considering taxes on packaging and products to reflect the cost of disposal.
Designing for recycling means that disposal is considered from the beginning. The resulting products should be easy to take apart, with each piece made from a distinct, easily recycled material.
"We generated the idea about 10 years ago but had trouble getting people to look at it until about a year and a half ago," said Herschel Cutler, executive director of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. "Now it is really taking off."
Several major corporations have pledged to develop products that can be more easily recycled. "It is our belief that in the years to come it will become impossible to develop major markets such as transportation, appliances or building and construction without a clear understanding not only of material use, but re-use as well," said Michael G. DeCata, an executive of the General Electric Company's plastics division.
Julius Grau, an engineer with the Whirlpool Corporation, said that the company was rethinking some methods used for decades to assemble household appliances. "There is no question that we have to design for future disposability," he said. "For instance, we are looking into fasteners and will probably use fewer screws in the future because disassemblers do not like them."
The German regulations have encouraged several innovations. Opel, the General Motors subsidiary in Germany, has made some of the parts on its Calabria models from recycled plastic battery cases, and designed these parts for easy removal. BMW officials say that when the company's new series of smaller automobiles is introduced in this country in June, all the plastic parts will be stamped so they can be grouped by type for recycling.
The increasing use of plastics has complicated the task of recycling cars or appliances. When cars were mostly metal, they were ground up and sold as scrap to be made into new steel. The entire steel mini-mill industry is based on reclaimed scrap, much of it from automobiles.
But as auto makers have improved fuel economy by reducing the weight of cars, they have turned to plastics as substitutes for metal. Twenty years ago, a typical American car weighed close to 4,000 pounds, with virtually no plastic.
Now, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, a typical 2,400-pound car contains about 180 pounds of plastic, and the proportion is rising. Since there may be as many as 60 different types of plastic in a new car, they are almost never sorted for re-use.
 
Fear of Legislation
 The association, the trade group for the nation's domestic auto industry, has a recycling study under way. The group's officials say that the auto companies are putting more effort into disposal. "There is a raised consciousness in our member companies," said Larry Slimak, the association's health, industrial and planning director. "They have gotten environmental questions on design engineers' log sheets."
The fear of legislation mandating percentages of product content that must be recycled are much on auto makers' minds. "There are several bills in Congress looking at recycling schemes," Mr. Slimak said.
The increasing use of plastic has been squeezing the profit margins of automobile recyclers, Mr. Cutler said. After valuable components, such as catalytic converters containing precious metals, have been removed, car hulks are shredded and the steel and iron are separated for sale to mills.
The remainder, known as automotive shredder residue, or fluff, is sent to a landfill. "Automotive recyclers have to pay for the disposal of the residue," Mr. Cutler said. "As the ratio of valuable materials versus nonrecyclable and therefore costly materials changes, it alters the economics. In some parts of the country our members are faced with $100-a-ton disposal costs."
But auto industry officials say their use of plastics is necessary to meet federally mandated fuel economy goals. Fuel economy "is a big-ticket issue," Mr. Slimak said. "Plastics and aluminum are a way to get there."
Other worthy goals also collide. The windshields of cars are made of two layers of glass with sticky plastic in the middle. The plastic prevents the glass from shattering in a collision, protecting motorists. But the combination is not practically recyclable.
 
A Matter of Purity
 Both automotive and appliance industry executives agree that designing for recycling will prompt the marking of plastics by type, and probably a reduction in the kinds of plastics they use. Although there are some uses for plastics made from several different compounds, they are generally considered inferior materials. If plastics can be sorted, they are likely to have more uses and command higher prices.
"The companies that recycle plastics only want pure resins," said Mr. Grau of Whirlpool. "As a result you are going to see more homogeneous materials and carefully identified materials." He said the goal was to design an appliance, like a refrigerator, that would last for 20 years and then come apart easily.
"Using fewer resins is a relatively easy design concept," Mr. Cutler observed. He said product designers could also assist recyclers by avoiding the use of toxic metals, like cadmium, that render large masses of waste hazardous. Hazardous waste is considerably more expensive to dispose of than ordinary waste.
Some types of plastics, known as thermoplastics, can easily be melted and re-used. But others, known as thermosets, cannot be melted and are far more difficult to recycle. More difficult yet are the composites, like fiberglass, that are favored by the auto industry for their light weight, strength and corrosion resistance. Since they are blends of materials, few are recycled.
Designing products that can be easily assembled or serviced often results in products that can easily be taken apart, Mr. Grau said. "Good design is robust," he said. "If you design for assembly and service, it helps with disassembly."

Continued Weakness Forces Further Layoffs

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The continuing weakness of the national economy is bringing additional staff reductions at advertising agencies around the country.
For the first time, Young & Rubicam, New York, has offered early-retirement packages, targeting 100 employees. Lintas Campbell-Ewald, Warren, Mich., recently laid off 71 people -- 11 percent of its staff. And in the last three months, Backer Spielvogel Bates, New York, and Della Femina McNamee, Los Angeles, have let go 68 and 45 employees, respectively.
"This is the first time I can remember that the industry has stopped cutting through fat and is cutting through muscle," said Jerry Della Femina, chairman of Della Femina McNamee. "I'm seeing portfolios now from people who years back everyone was desperate to hire. Now they can't find work."

HEADLINE: Dollar Is Little Changed in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, May 27

 BODY:
European currency markets were becalmed today with the United States and British markets closed for holidays. The dollar closed little changed in quiet trading.
Share prices in Frankfurt and Zurich finished higher, but in quiet Paris trading they drifted downward. 
 Gold ended at $356.65 an ounce in Zurich, up from $356.00 on Friday. Crude oil prices were unchanged.
The dollar ended the trading day at 1.7045 marks and 138.25 yen, compared with the European close on Friday of 1.7080 marks and 138.15 yen. The dollar ended in New York on Friday at 1.7035 marks and 138.27 yen.
Dealers said the dollar appeared to be locked in a broad range between 1.68 and 1.72 marks. "Both the U.S. and Germany can live with a dollar around 1.70 marks," one trader in Frankfurt said.
On stock markets, the Zurich bourse closed at a high for the year, with the all-share Swiss Performance Index rising 7.9 points, to 1,111.1. The shares of banks and insurers were bolstered by hopes of lower interest rates.
In Frankfurt, the 30-share Dax index climbed 9.58 points, to 1,681.45. Some dealers linked the dollar's weakness against the mark to the rally in German shares, which climbed 4.7 percent last week on strong foreign demand. But in Paris the 40-share CAC index ended 3.31 points lower at 1,801.52 after drifting in subdued trading, marked by a lack of liquidity because of the London and New York holidays. "There was practically no foreign interest today," one trader said.
Oil prices were unchanged from Friday with the international benchmark, North Sea Brent Blend, quoted at $18.98 a barrel for June delivery.

Whole or Split Four Ways, Sears Looks Good to Some

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 27

 BODY:
Many retailing analysts and consultants say they think Sears's stores will remain mired in a sales slump for many quarters. Nonetheless, some of these experts say the stock may be a good investment. Either Sears's results will improve, they say, or shareholders will benefit from drastic changes that may be forced on the company.
Assuming that sales stay depressed, they predict that disgruntled shareholders will eventually force Sears, Roebuck & Company to split into its component parts: the Sears Merchandise Group retail operation, Dean Witter financial services, Allstate insurance and Coldwell Banker real estate. 
 Since the collective value of Sears's components is widely thought to be much higher than the company's current stock price, they say stockholders could eventually see a windfall.
"Either the Merchandise Group will be turned around or the entire operation will be spun off," said Kurt Barnard, a retailing consultant based in New York, who asserts that the current management is "not up to the task."
"The results speak for themselves," he added.
Indeed, since Sears executives began to revamp the retailing operation in early 1989 -- a plan that included lowering prices, streamlining behind-the-scene operations at the stores, and introducing more brand names -- they have failed to deliver much encouraging news, though there have been scattered successes.
For example, Brand Central, comprising the new home electronics and appliance departments, has regained market share Sears had lost. And Sears executives say women's clothing and lawn and garden equipment have been selling well.
But overall sales at Sears stores open for at least a year have been flat or lower for quarter after quarter. While results improved significantly in the first quarter of this year, based on a large reduction in overhead expense, the Merchandise Group still lost $14 million, compared with a $37 million loss for the period a year earlier.
The net result is that many retail analysts have still not issued "buy" recommendations for Sears stock. Rather, they have issued "hold" opinions on the belief that the chances are not good that Sears stores will achieve significant sales increases over the next year. Barring further evidence of improvement, these analysts say, Sears will probably have to reassess its strategy.
"I don't think they are currently in the midst of breaking up the company," said L. Wayne Hood, who follows Sears for the Prudential Securities Corporation. "But they only have about 12 months to keep the current game plan in place. As the economy improves, if their sales do not show an improving trend as well, they will have to re-address the overall strategy."
Mr. Hood is among the analysts who have a "hold" on Sears, contending that there is less than a 50 percent chance that the stock will soon appreciate 20 percent or more.
Another analyst who recommends holding Sears stock, rather than accumulating it, is Philip Abbenhaus of A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. "As a retail stock, I wouldn't buy Sears," he said. "I don't see much top-line growth, and they still have a lot of work to do on the expense side."
For investors interested in retailing, Mr. Abbnenhaus prefers the Melville Corporation, a Harrison, N.Y., concern that owns Marshall's, the clothing discounter; Chess King, a specialty clothing store for men, and Linens & Things, which operates bath-and-bedroom boutiques.
Of course, some analysts do think Sears is on the road to recovery, including Dan Barry of Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York. "There is a double turnaround taking place this year," Mr. Barry said.
He said Sears's financial-services operations -- the Sears and Discover credit cards -- are benefiting from the lower interest rates the company is paying, while Dean Witter is enjoying a surge in investor interest in stocks. And as the economy picks up steam, Mr. Barry said, sales at the Sears retail stores will almost assuredly recover.
"They have in all past economic rebounds," Mr. Barry said. "It's only since the recession that comparative-store sales have turned negative."
Indeed, as a group, analysts have lately turned slightly more positive on Sears. According to Zacks Investment Research, a Chicago firm that monitors Wall Street analysts, a group of 15 analysts who follow Sears is expecting the company to earn $3.75 a share this year, up from its prediction of $3.60 a month ago.
For 1992 the group is expecting earnings of $4.30 a share, up from $4.25 a month ago. Last year, Sears earned $2.63 a share. But while earnings estimates are up, the analysts polled by Zacks still do not rate Sears a "buy." Only one has a "buy" recommendation, seven have "holds" on the stock, and four are recommending the sale of Sears shares.
As a consequence, many analysts say, Sears could still be broken up. And while they are not framing it in those terms, a breakup would imply a windfall for shareholders. Mr. Hood of Prudential estimates that shareholders would receive a 40 percent premium if Sears were split up.
Goldman, Sachs & Company, Sears's longtime investment adviser, said in a confidential analysis prepared for the company in 1987 that the premium could reach 60 percent. And some analysts have said the breakup value of Sears is closer to $80 a share. The stock closed Friday at $38.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
There is yet another reason to buy Sears stock: the $2 annual dividend. At Sears's current price, that works out to a yield of 5.4 percent. So even if a breakup does not take place for years, investors will receive something.
"You're getting paid to wait," said Richard Nelson, an analyst who follows Sears for Duff & Phelps and who thinks the company will come back before being forced to dissolve.

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: MADISON, Conn.

 BODY:
It all started 15 months ago in a meeting of the powerful Finance Committee of the Madison Soccer Booster Club at Ed Dowling's house. These are the type of sessions, conducted in seeming suburban secrecy across the country, where it is determined, in effect, how many no-name candy bars, flower-seed packs, Christmas wreathes, crates of oranges, tins of nuts and paper plates of someone else's favorite-recipe brownies must be purchased by every child athletes' parents, the parents' parents, the parents' neighbors and the parents' co-workers to finance the year's youth programs.
With so many youngsters in so many increasingly expensive activities, the number of fund-raising appeals has proliferated in recent years just as the recession's tentacles crept into many families' finances. 
 Madison's challenge was to offer a prize that would elevate its annual drive above competitors. There are, after all, only so many all-u-can-eat pancake breakfasts and car washes that a parent can patronize on a given Saturday (rain date: Sunday).
Jim Mokriski's mind may not have been completely on the fund-raising deliberations. As the club's vice president, he knew the car-wash proposal had passed; that might be good for $2,000 on a sunny day, if too many water fights didn't erupt while the minivans lined up in the bank parking lot.
The can-collection idea died when someone calculated that 1,000 soccer players needed to collect something like 600,000 aluminum cans. And Jim knew candy sales were an evergreen, always useful for sucking into the treasury about $2,500 of the community's discretionary income.
But all that would provide barely 15 percent of the year's funds. Being a salesman, Mr. Mokriski wondered what was on the minds of suburbanites that might prompt them to part with a real good chunk of change?
Jim knew what was on his mind: his son's $1,100 second-semester college payment.
That's when the mother of all soccer booster club fund-raising schemes hit Jim. "I've got it!" he cried out. "We'll raffle off a college tuition payment."
The idea of raffling a $10,000 college payment had everything: the lure of big bucks for the gambler and the sponsor. And it struck at a gnawing visceral fear of many modern, middle-class moms and dads, the ironic inability to finance their children's college education because the parents earn too much money.
But the prize-winning prize idea had one minor drawback: it was illegal.
Connecticut's state lottery frowns on competition. You could raffle anything, even every Lamborghini ever made. But you couldn't raffle off money.
So the Madison Soccer Booster Club did the only thing that seemed logical to a finance committee needing $25,500 by July; it had the law changed.
That simply required getting 187 Democratic and Republican state legislators to work together, quickly. As parents or neighbors who themselves had been hit up countless times to buy tickets for a prize they didn't really want, legislators supported a charitable raffle that might produce big bucks.
Joseph Raia, a Democrat, and Norma Gyle, a Republican, who each earn $16,900 a year as state representatives, drafted a bill allowing churches, youth groups, Lions Clubs and the like to offer significant prizes like gold coins or payments to a third party for a service like college education. With this raffle lobby united, the bill sailed through.
Unfortunately for Madison Soccer Booster Club members, even speedy legislation hurt ticket sales. They peddled barely half of the 400 tickets at $100 apiece. Which was fortunate for Jim Shanley, the Madison lawyer (not the local roofer).
Mr. Shanley was watching television at home one July evening last year when Chuck Sweetman, who had sneaked up behind him at a soccer game and forced him to buy a ticket, phoned to say that Jim's name had just been drawn as the Grand Prize winner. "Yeah, right," said Mr. Shanley, who has never won anything.
However, being a lawyer, he did not hang up. And so it was that Clark University in Worcester, Mass., got a hefty tuition payment this year credited to Jim Shanley Jr.'s account.
Sales for this July 6 drawing are brisk -- 130 of the 400 tickets are already gone, thanks to early organization by David S. Brown, the ticket committee chairman, whose telephone number is not unlisted. Proceeds will finance a team trip to a European soccer tournament.
Raffle tickets have been sold as far away as Arkansas and as near as Jim Mokriski's house over on Flintlock Road. Mr. Mokriski, who rode his idea into the club presidency, admits that winning his own $10,000 prize idea would create a publicity nightmare. "But that," said the father of four, "is a burden I believe I could shoulder."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Slump or No, Short Fridays Remain a Right of Summer

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
"SUMER is icumen in," a 13th- century poet wrote. And so are summer hours.
The Memorial Day weekend is not only the unofficial start of summer but the official start of what advertising people call summer hours. The term refers to schedules designed to let employees take advantage of those lazy, hazy days ahead. 
 Chances are, most advertising executives say, their clients won't notice the difference.
Typically, summer hours extend from the Memorial Day weekend through the Labor Day weekend. Though specifics vary from shop to shop, in most cases staff members can leave work at noon or 1 p.m. on Friday in exchange for coming in earlier, and perhaps shortening their lunch time, Monday through Thursday. But some agencies divide their staffs in half and give each group every other Friday off; others offer two to four full Fridays off during the summer.
Though the advertising business is suffering through the third year of an economic slump, summer hours do not seem to be falling victim to the tougher times.
"The recession is not having an impact on our schedule," said Kathie McKirdy, senior vice president and director of account management administration at DDB Needham Worldwide, Chicago.
"If we can allow employees to enjoy longer weekends during the summer," she added, "they will feel better about the agency and their work."
At Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, New York, this year's schedule is proceeding as planned, said Michael Keeshan, president and chief operating officer. "We regard it as a very important statement to our employees of our appreciation for their work," he said.
In an industry in which, as one wag put it, history goes as far back as lunch yesterday, the origin of summer hours is difficult to trace. Several senior executives said they believed that summer hours were first introduced in New York in the late 1960's or early 70's. The idea, as these executives recalled, was that letting people out early on Fridays allowed them to get a head start on their traffic-clogged treks to the Hamptons, Fire Island or other summer weekend resorts in the New York metropolitan area.
A roundabout confirmation of that theory came in phone calls to agencies in Chicago and Seattle that do not offer summer hours because, employees said, their local weekend getaway sites take less time to reach than those around New York City.
Executives at agencies with summer hours stressed that their policies depended upon employees' recognizing that client needs come before an early start to the weekend.
"We expect that whenever a client issue comes up, there always will be someone to respond to it," Mr. Keeshan said.
"A good example is Northwest Airlines, where there's an expectation of service requirements almost every day of the week, given the fare wars," he said. "As a result, at least half of every group that works on Northwest is here" on summer Fridays, he said.
Indeed, some agencies without summer hours cite client service as the reason. For the Leo Burnett Company, dealing with clients on both the East Coast and West Coast from its sole office in Chicago makes summer hours impractical, said a spokesman, Wally Petersen.
In recent years, summer hours have been spreading beyond advertising agencies. Since mid-1988, the Time Inc. Magazine Company has offered summer hours to publishing-side employees, said Susan Geisenheimer, vice president of human resources. Before that, "what used to happen was that golf games with clients were mysteriously scheduled on Friday afternoons in the summer," she said.

HEADLINE: Bush's Banking Plan Still Faces Obstacles

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Despite a significant political victory last week, the Bush Administration's ambitious plan to reorganize the banking industry still faces a long and bumpy road in Congress.
On Thursday, the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Financial Institutions agreed to move the bill to the full committee, providing the White House its first legislative victory on this front. 
 The bill would reshape the banking industry for the first time in almost 60 years -- providing banks with broad powers to enter new businesses, like securities, and allowing them unrestrained access to customers across state lines. The measure would also permit banks to be owned by industrial enterprises.
The Banking Committee is expected to take up the measure in June. The going may be rough because the committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, feels he has been snubbed by the Administration after expressing doubts about most of the legislation.
After consideration by the Banking Committee, the bill faces obstacles in two other House committees -- Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means. Neither seems likely to take the favorable view of the banking industry and the Administration's proposal that was evident in the Banking subcommittee.
"The subcommittee vote is a small step, one in which the industry and the Administration did quite well," said Karen D. Shaw of the Institute for Strategy Development, a Washington consulting firm that monitors the agencies and Congress for business interests. "Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are going to be tougher."
Administration officials say they are also concerned about the effect on the legislation of the Treasury's request, coming in June, to continue financing of the bailout of the savings and loan industry. After rejections last year and again this year, Congress begrudgingly approved another $30 billion in March to continue to finance the rescue effort, which is widely considered the least popular program in Washington.
The Administration says that money will run out in September and has not disclosed what it will seek for the new fiscal year, which begins in October. Some lawmakers and the General Accounting Office say the financing request may be for as much as $50 billion.
Treasury officials are concerned that the savings and loan request will discourage lawmakers who fear that the banking legislation would deregulate that industry in a way similar to the deregulation of the savings industry in the 1980's.
The Administration succeeded before the House Banking subcommittee primarily because it had a lot more to lose than to gain. Had the subcommittee rejected or substantially altered the legislation, it could have been politically fatal. In the subcommittee, debate on scores of amendments to reshape the legislation was postponed in the interest of moving the bill to the full committee and because those seeking the amendments lacked the votes among the subcommittee members.
"The full committee is going to examine most of the legislation, including things that the subcommittee passed on," said Robert R. Glauber, Under Secretary of the Treasury, who has played the leading role in shaping the Administration's proposal. "What was important about the subcommittee vote is that it was the first time Congress addressed the issues, and this group of Congress said it wanted comprehensive reform. I think a lot of people were surprised by that. We're just going one step at a time."
Thirty-six of the Banking Committee's 52 members also serve on the subcommittee, but votes on many crucial issues remained close enough that the legislation emerging from the Banking Committee is not likely to resemble the subcommittee measure. The Administration lost, for instance, by only one vote on a measure that would basically leave deposit insurance at its current level rather than impose modest limitations. That amendment, sponsored by Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr., Democrat of Kentucky, is one of dozens that are likely to be debated again.
A significant difference in the next round of debate is the views of Mr. Gonzalez. In a lengthy interview shortly after the subcommittee vote, the Banking Committee chairman expressed reservations about the Administration's proposal and bitterness about being excluded from a meeting this month between eight other Democrats on his committee and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to discuss the legislation and explore areas of difficulty and compromise.
"What they did violates a very fundamental Washington law," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Everyone is against a conspiracy of which they are not a part."
"Things are going to get much hotter in the full committee," he added. "They always do."
But while Mr. Gonzalez is expected to exert some influence, even he acknowledges that he does not control the committee in the autocratic style of his predecessor, Fernand J. St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat who was defeated in the 1988 election. So far, the Administration has been quick to seize on the highly fractured committee to its advantage.
"The Brady strategy has been brilliant in breaking the Democrats away from the subcommittee and committee chairmen while whipping the Republicans in line," said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. "It's a strategy that just won't work in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Can you imagine a meeting with Democrats on that committee that doesn't include John Dingell?"
Mr. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the powerful chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has been a longstanding opponent of repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, which prevents investment banks from merging with commercial banks. He could be the first formidable obstacle to the Administration's legislation. In recent weeks, he has also complained that the Treasury Department has left him out of the legislative process.
In the Senate, which earlier this year had been expected to act before the House, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, has been watching the House debate before deciding how to proceed.

HEADLINE: Trade Focus Has Changed

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
As the United States and Mexico discuss environmental cooperation under arrangements to lower trade barriers at the Rio Grande, they are demonstrating how profoundly the nature of trade policy has changed over the last two decades.
At one time, tariffs were the primary concern -- something external, remote and without high political visibility. 
 But now, trade touches not only pollution control but other sensitive issues like human rights, farm and industrial subsidies, patents and trademarks, government purchasing, industrial standards, investment policies.
These areas are close to the bone of national economic policy making. Cutting a Vermonter's dairy or a Georgian's peanut subsidies or giving up some "Buy American" preferences in Pentagon purchasing involves political risks.
As such issues have become the substance of trade talks, the intensity -- and the decibel levels -- of the trade debate have grown year by year.
There is a striking contrast between the ire and emotionalism of lawmakers debating the trade accords with Mexico and the rest of the world and the placid near-unanimity of those who approved the last major global trade agreement in 1979.
"In the old days," noted Robert Z. Lawrence, an analyst with the Brookings Institution, "you had a few specialists participating in trade policy, and you knocked a few heads together. But as economies become more globalized, we're moving from shallow to deeper integration, which inevitably involves some pain."
An illustration of what may lie ahead is the work of the 12 nations of the European Community, which are trying to create a single market by the end of next year.
The community discovered that even though it had long ago eliminated internal tariffs, its members still had widely differing standards, regulations and rules of competition that were having almost as much of an effect as tariffs in skewing commerce and slowing economic growth.
 
Restrictions in Canada
 The story is similar in Canada, whose provinces have not applied internal tariffs since 1867. Yet there are any number of other provincial barriers, including quotas, subsidies, discriminatory pricing and import bans that often make it easier for a province to trade with the United States than with its provincial neighbor.
Americans, for example, can buy beer, bricks and paint from Ontario easier than Quebecers can.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, setting out in part to get rid of the provincial barriers, initiated talks with the United States in the mid-1980's that led to a free-trade pact. It took effect in 1989, and the results have been so encouraging that both nations have agreed to accelerate tariff cutting under the agreement.
Mr. Mulroney now seeks to eliminate 500 provincial trade barriers by the mid-1990's. If the program is successful, he says, Canada will reap a reward of billions of dollars of added output and thousands of new jobs.
With a focus chiefly on cutting tariffs since World War II, global trade liberalization has been remarkably successful. Tariffs today are at sharply reduced levels in all countries and world trade has surged. Trade has now become the engine for American growth.
But while tariffs have dropped, other less-obvious forms of protection, through direct and indirect subsidies and other aids to industry and agriculture, have increased.
For instance, the steel industry, a leading employer in many countries, receives hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies through labyrinthine webs of grants and low-cost loans.
The free-market-oriented American industry has long complained about the foreign subsidies that undermine its ability to compete throughout the world. Many experts say subsidized industries, often heavy-duty manufacturers, are also damaging the environment.
"Government-owned or -supported smokestack industries of Japan, Korea, or even Hungary are helping to widen the already gaping hole in the ozone layer that protects us from potentially harmful effects of the sun's unfiltered ultraviolet rays," said William J. Gill in a new book, "Trade Wars Against America."
While the 1979 international talks to reduce tariffs were a resounding success, the code that spelled out what were acceptable subsidies and what were not has been a big disappointment. Because of its limited coverage and the absence of any backup of international discipline, the code has had practically no effect.
C. Michael Aho of the Council on Foreign Relations and Jonathan David Aronson of the University of Southern California in their book, "Trade Talks -- America Better Listen!" likened the effort to "trying to put out a forest fire with a handkerchief."
In effect, while governments were engaging in trade disarmament at the tariff level, they were still quietly responding to the politics of protectionism by re-arming with more sophisticated weaponry.
President Jimmy Carter's trade chief, Robert S. Strauss, who led the anti-subsidies effort, still believes it was an icebreaker.
But others fret that it may have been counterproductive, having raised hopes that were not fulfilled and damaging the credibility of the international trading system.
A new attack on subsidies is being led by Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, in the current round of global talks known as the Uruguay Round, after the country in which the first talks were held in 1986.
 
The Pollution Issue
 While subsidies load the dice, differing standards for cleaning up air and water are another, and growing, source of trade distortion. Industries in countries with lesser standards obtain competitive advantages they are loath to give up.
Legislation was recently introduced by Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, that would authorize President Bush to impose duties on imports from countries found to have environmental standards less rigorous than those imposed on American industry.
Growing concern about environmental problems has also spurred demands for trade sanctions. A 1987 agreement in Montreal to curb global use of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield, envisions trade reprisals against countries that do not abide by the new standards. The chronic offenders have been China, Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
At the same time, environmental regulations themselves may be used to restrain trade. Mexico has pending in Geneva a trade case against the United States under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world agreement on trade. Mexico contends that an American ban on imports of tuna caught with nets that also kill dolphins is unfair trade, aimed chiefly at protecting the American tuna industry.
Improved protection for intellectual property is another of the objectives of the new global trade talks. American officials say India, Thailand and Brazil are among the countries where the flourishing piracy of pharmaceuticals, books and films, designer jeans, computer softwear and videocassettes costs American industry more than $50 billion a year.
The United States has long sought what American officials and business leaders like to call a "level playing field." Yet the remaining trade barriers are so close to economic and industrial policy making and sovereignty that it may become more like the search for the Holy Grail.

HEADLINE: Almost New Is Good Enough, Much to Detroit's Annoyance

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 27

 BODY:
Two gray Ford Taurus sedans, seemingly identical, sit in a car dealer's showroom. One, fresh from the factory, has a sticker price of about $16,900. The second is almost but not quite new: shiny and still under warranty, it began life as a Hertz rental car, logged 8,000 miles over four months and is priced at $12,500.
To the annoyance of American car makers, more and more shoppers are deciding that at today's new-car prices, "almost new" is good enough. This year some two million almost-new cars, or about 25 percent of the depressed new-car market, are cycling back from rental car companies and other big car fleets and winding up in American driveways. 
 Detroit created this market in an effort to address the slump in new-car sales a few years ago, but the idea backfired. The Big Three auto makers were trying to keep sales up by enticing rental-car companies -- several of which are controlled by auto makers -- into buying more new cars and trading-in used cars sooner.
 
Idea Worked Too Well
 Their intention was to keep assembly lines humming, avoid layoffs, hold down stocks of unsold cars and put more new cars on the road. The idea worked only too well.
No one then envisioned how budding enthusiasm for almost-new cars would boomerang amid one of the worst sales droughts in years. Detroit has in effect created a car market in which it loses money twice -- when it sells the cars at deep discounts to the rental companies, and when it sells the used cars through auctions to dealers.
Other than the bosses in Detroit, every one is happy, even the new-car dealers who, after wresting from the auto makers the right to resell rental cars, say they make more money selling an almost-new car than they do selling a brand new one.
For an industry that seems chronically under siege from outside forces, Detroit admits it has only itself to blame for this headache. "It's a monster we let out of the box," said Robert Lutz, president of the Chrysler Corporation.
Detroit's Japanese rivals do not have a problem with rental cars since they have enjoyed stronger retail demand for their cars than domestic auto makers and have sold proportionally fewer cars to rental companies. The Honda Motor Company has never sold cars to rental companies.
Maryann N. Keller, an automotive stock analyst for Furman Selz Inc. in New York, said: "Car companies thought this would be a no-brainer. The flaw in their logic was they sold too many cars to the rental fleets."
Worst of all, American car makers may be undermining a made-in-Detroit myth that was fundamental to their success until recent years. In their marketing, auto makers have relentlessly fed the notion that a brand-new and more luxurious car is a natural part of the American dream. But if a Lincoln, which can be rented for only $29 a day, can be bought at a deep discount, buying a brand-new one would seem to have fading symbolic value.
As concerns mount in Detroit over the scarcity of new-car buyers, the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler are searching for a way to shrink the almost-new car market. The ideas range from telling rental fleets to keep cars longer and put more miles on them to, in G.M.'s case, shipping some small almost-new cars to Poland to avoid more money-losing sales to Americans. Chrysler has not come up with a solution, but "we have to find one," Mr. Lutz said with a sigh.
"Today you've got to be crazy to buy a new car," said Jim Goss, a manager of Brown Pontiac in Toledo, Ohio. New-car customers are often stunned when they try to sell within a year or two of purchase, he added, because the values drop so much.
That is because the rising flood of almost-new cars is depressing resale values of other used cars, dealers say, and blurring the distinction between almost-new and much more expensive brand-new vehicles.
Mr. Goss crisscrosses the Midwest visiting as many as three auctions a week. Early in May, he and scores of other G.M. dealers attended "G.M. Day" at the Aptco Auto Auction in Taylor, Mich., near Detroit. In a carnival-like atmosphere, about 500 1991 G.M. cars, light trucks and mini-vans were arranged on a stadium-size parking lot. Aptco workers had spent several days making repairs; each car was scrubbed and buffed to look like new.
About every 30 seconds, the auctioneer slapped a piece of garden hose on the edge of a table to seal the deal for a former rental car to a new-car dealer. By the end of the day, almost all the cars were on their way to the dealers for buyers like Dvere Hollis. A few weeks ago, Ms. Hollis bought an almost-new Buick Skylark with 7,000 miles, air-conditioning and power windows for $8,900 from Fox Buick in Baltimore. The base price of a new 1991 Skylark, without the extras, is $10,725.
"I looked at new cars," Ms. Hollis said, "and the prices were outrageous. When it comes time to buy again, I'll look for something that's almost new." Indeed, Ms. Hollis bought her daughter an almost-new Geo Prizm for $8,500. A new model ranges from $9,640 to about $12,000, depending on the options.
Of course, Big Three executives would be much happier if people like Ms. Hollis would buy brand-new cars. Sales statistics show that the Big Three still have about 70 percent of the new-car market; but after excluding sales to rental and car-leasing fleets, Detroit's share is about 50 percent.
 
Sales Kept Plants Operating
 The rental business "wasn't always so bad for Detroit," Ms. Keller, the auto stock analyst, said. When retail sales of certain models were soft, a large sale to a rental company, even at a discount, allowed an auto maker to sidestep the costly process of idling a factory for a week or two.
Rental fleets, though eager for new models at favorable prices, had to grapple with disposing of used cars. For a while, they sold them on their own lots to bargain-hunters or back to new-car dealers who sold them as used cars. But used-car lots operated by rental companies put them in competition with new-car dealers.
Car dealers complained that auto makers sold new cars to rental fleets at unfairly low prices. The conflict simmered until about three years ago when the financial incentives offered to rental-car companies resulted in millions of cars being sold to rental fleets each year. The National Automobile Dealers Association threatened legal action, asserting that the deals between the factory and the fleets were hurting dealer franchise agreements.
Bowing to pressure, the auto makers, starting in 1989, agreed to buy back all or most rental cars and resell them through dealers. G.M. and Ford agreed to buy back all of their cars, and Chrysler, 75 percent. Franchised dealers would be able to buy them from the auto makers at dozens of auctions and then resell them.
"Then we said, hey, if we're going to guarantee to buy all these cars back, we want them to be bought with equipment on them," said Terrence P. Sullivan, a G.M. spokesman. To make the cars even more attractive, car makers agreed to honor manufacturer warranties and even extend them, for a small fee, so that many buyers would have the same protection as new-car buyers. Most domestic new cars have a one-year warranty without a deductible and five years or more with a deductible of $100 or more.
The result: well-equipped low-mileage cars turned into this recession's big bargains. Cadillac Sevilles, Lincoln Town Cars and Chrysler Imperials, were available for as much as $10,000 off the sticker price.
"We're trying to slow it down now," Mr. Sullivan said. "It probably looks worse than it is because of the retail portion of the business falling off."
 
'Problem Will Solve Itself'
 Now, as more dealers discover auctions and almost-new cars, prices have been climbing. "If this keeps up the problem will solve itself, since there will be less and less difference from new cars, and people shouldn't mind paying just a little more for brand-new," said a G.M. sales executive who insisted on anonymity.
Ford, to create a greater difference between new and almost-new cars, decreed last month that it would no longer buy back cars from rental fleets with fewer than 15,000 miles on the odometer. Starting this fall, G.M. will repurchase cars from rental fleets only after they have been used for six months. Previously, no conditions had been set on returns. Rental companies will be assessed a penalty for cars showing fewer than 6,000 miles on the odometer, G.M. said.
G.M. and Ford would like to sidestep auctions and channel cars directly to dealers. Shipping cars to auctions is expensive, they say. Moreover, auto makers wish to exercise more control over prices.
Still, Ford is experimenting with three lots, two in Albuquerque, N.M., and one near Boston, where it has allowed dealers to sell almost-new cars at locations apart from new-car showrooms. G.M. is trying a program in Florida called "Satisfaction Plus," in which almost-new cars, sold by its dealers at prices set by the factory, will have stickers, resembling a new-car sticker in a window, that show the savings over the new-car price.

HEADLINE: Accountants' Group to Move From New York to Jersey City

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
In what is basically a bottom-line decision -- to obtain lower rent -- the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants plans to relocate most of its employees from its headquarters in Rockefeller Center to Jersey City next year.
The move of 600 of 750 employees of the professional society, which represents more than 300,000 accountants nationwide, was announced yesterday by a spokesman for the Harborside Financial Center, the relocation site on the Jersey City waterfront. 
 The institute's vice president for communications, Geoffrey Pickard, confirmed the move yesterday, saying that the insititute's executive headquarters would still operate at 1211 Avenue of the Americas. The society has leased several floors there for the last 20 years. The move will not take place until July 1992 when the institute's lease expires.
 
Cost Would Probably Double
 The primary factor for leaving the city was the cost of space, Mr. Pickard said.
"Even though the real-estate market is soft today, we found the cost of renting adequate space would probably double when our current lease expires," Mr. Pickard said. "And so we began looking around and were able to negotiate a 20-year lease at the Harborside facility."
Harborside is in a former Pennsylvania Railroad warehouse that has been converted for office use in the Exchange Place commercial district across the Hudson River from the World Trade Center.
Last November, five commodities exchanges that generate $1.3 billion a year in goods, services and salaries considered leaving New York City for the Harborside Financial Center and taking 11,700 jobs with them.
But the leaders of the exchanges chose to stay when New York City and New York State offered an array of incentives, including a construction grant of $82 million, tax and rent subsidies worth $56 million and energy savings of nearly $7 million.
The institute told New York City officials about six to eight months ago of its intention to find new space, Mr. Pickard said.
Aaron Biller, a spokesman for Jones Lang Wooten, the developer of Harborside, said a date -- June 24 -- was already set for a special ceremony at Harborside at which Gov. Jim Florio and Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City would officially welcome the accounting organization.
 
Comparative Costs for Space
 Efforts to reach the New York City economic development officials who would have been acquainted with the details of the planned move were unsuccessful yesterday.
Mr. Pickard would not discuss details of the comparative costs for space. Mr. Biller said the institute had acquired 182,000 square feet at Harborside in a 20-year lease that allows for expansion to 300,000 square feet.
He quoted Joseph Costa, executive vice president of Baker Harris, CPC, N.Y.C., who negotiated the lease for the institute, as saying the organization would save $125 million over the 20-year lease term. Mr. Pickard said he was unaware of the details of the arrangement.
"One of the reasons for choosing Harborside is the accessibility for the employees," Mr. Pickard said. No new jobs are expected to be added for New Jersey residents, he said.
 
A Tug of War
 The move is another development in a tug-of-war between Jersey City and New York over companies and jobs. In 1989, Merrill Lynch announced plans to relocate about 2,000 people to Jersey City.
Harborside, a 1.9 million square foot office complex currently has about 50 tenants, including Bankers Trust of New York.
In recent months, four other companies have announced plans to leave Manhattan for Harborside. They consist of Sumitomo Bank, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (America), Sea-Land and Port of Charleston, Mr. Biller said.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Find No Home Here in Their Fathers' Land

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTMINSTER, Calif., May 26

 BODY:
After two years of heavy migration to the United States, more and more abandoned Vietnamese children of American servicemen have retreated here to the refugee community called Little Saigon, the final stop in a sad journey in which they have discovered that they are neither truly Vietnamese nor truly American.
With the blue eyes or the black skin of their fathers but with the language and upbringing of the land of their mothers, many of these new immigrants, who are now young adults, have been unable to find a niche in the cities and towns of America. Now, some are finding from the Vietnamese in this city, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, the same rejection that first drove them from Vietnam. 
 "This is their last hope, and nobody has welcomed them here, either," said Dr. Jean Carlin, a psychiatrist who has found a high level of depression among these Amerasian offspring of servicemen. "In the end it seems they really don't belong anywhere."
Officials involved in the resettlement process point out that there are many success stories among the Amerasians. But their larger story is one of rejection and disillusionment. Though many of them guardedly deny it, Dr. Carlin said, almost all the Amerasians have come to the United States not only in search of a fatherland but also of their fathers.
Some bring with them only a first name or a photograph, others an address and a history of unanswered letters. But resettlement workers say almost none now succeed in their search.
It was not until most of the Amerasians were already young adults that the United States set up a mechanism to welcome its Vietnamese children. Since the Amerasian Homecoming Act took effect in March 1989, more than 12,000 Amerasians have entered the country, three times as many as had arrived over the previous 14 years since the fall of Saigon in 1975.
Pam Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Refugee Programs in the State Department, said about 10,000 Amerasians and their Vietnamese relatives were being interviewed each month in Vietnam under the program.
Ms. Lewis said that the interviews might be completed by next summer and that as many as 60,000 to 80,000 people could enter the United States under the Homecoming Act by the end of next year. Of these, she said, about one in four would be Amerasian and the others would be relatives accompanying them.
As the years have passed, the average age of the Amerasians has risen to 20, about the age of many of their fathers at the time of their birth. Some now have their own children, and under immigration rules that until recently forced them to choose between bringing a mother or a spouse, some also left behind their own Amerasian offspring, the grandchildren of Americans who served in Vietnam.
"These children are doubly orphaned," said Dr. Mark C. Johnson, a psychologist at Dartmouth who participated in the most complete study of the Amerasians. "Not only did their fathers not want them, but until now the country of their fathers didn't either."
Mary Payne Nguyen, who directs a Government-financed social services center here for Amerasians, said: "They grew up in Vietnam thinking that they were Americans and that all their problems were because of that. They get here believing that they are Americans and everything is going to be O.K. and then -- surprise -- they don't even speak the language."
One recent arrival at the center, Nguyen The My, 19 years old, said that he had always been confused about his identity but that now he was more uncertain than ever.
"In Vietnam, when they shouted behind my back or when they taunted me -- half-breed, half-breed -- I began to think that maybe I am not really Vietnamese. Maybe I am more American," he said. "I thought that some parts of me must be American, though I don't know what that means."
He said he felt more comfortable in the United States, where he could lose himself in the racial mix, but he said, "I'm not sure whether I am becoming more American or more Vietnamese."
Amerasians who arrive under the Homecoming Act are sent to scores of sites, selected cities and towns around the country. Although no count has been made, officials in the program say a growing number have begun to migrate to the Vietnamese community here.
Mrs. Nguyen said about 600 Amerasians had registered for programs at her center. About 40 percent of them had recently arrived from other parts of the country, she said.
 
Again, Ostracism
 Le Kim Dinh, a writer who lives here, said Vietnamese residents in this country often ostracized the Amerasian arrivals just as they did in Vietnam.
"The other day in a Vietnamese supermarket I saw a Vietnamese woman who looked like a peasant with an Amerasian daughter who looked strikingly Caucasian," he said. "Everyone in the supermarket, the customers, the manager, the cashiers, all stopped and stared at her. They were staring -- it was horrible -- at the poor girl. And she kept looking at the ground, like looking for a place to hide, but there was no place to hide."
Lam Minh Hung, an unemployed 23-year-old Amerasian who has been here for two years, said: "We have experienced the same isolation here that we experienced in Vietnam. Among Vietnamese-Americans, if the discrimination in Vietnam was 100, the discrimination here is about 50."
Resettlement workers say that here, as in Vietnam, it is the children of black servicemen who suffer the worst discrimination.
Nguyen Thi Phuong and Ton Nu Minh Phung, both 19, whose fathers were black men, were given up by their families when they were small girls to be cared for by a Buddhist nun.
They were raised with the knowledge that there was no place for them in Vietnamese society. And with litle schooling, few skills and almost no understanding of English, they have found themselves bewildered by an even more alien culture in America.
 
Selling a Living Passport
 In a very direct brand of rejection, some Amerasian children were sold in Vietnam to other families as a form of living passport to the United States. Once here, the counterfeit family, having obtained entry to the country, sometimes compounded the rejection by abandoning its Amerasian child.
One of these is Nguyen Dinh Dai, 19, who now lives with the faint hope that his true mother might join him from Vietnam, or that he might find his American father, whose name he thinks is Bill.
Like others who have dealt with Amerasians, Mrs. Nguyen said that while some were energetic and creative, their hardships had often resulted in troubled behavior that contributes to their rejection.
"I have to say that Amerasians in general are a difficult bunch," said Mrs. Nguyen, who has adopted 12 Amerasian children herself. "They're impolite. They're impatient. They're impetuous. They're demanding. They're pushy. They're easily angered. They're defensive. They get into fights easily. They haven't really had any good sense of moral values taught to them."
Telling a similar story in more academic language, a 1989 study by Dr. Johnson and Dr. J. Kirk Felsman of the psychiatry department at Dartmouth Medical School found Amerasians to be "at high risk for serious problems in long-term adaptation," given backgrounds that commonly included the loss of one or both parents, poverty, discrimination and little education.
 
Problems of New Arrivals
 "The majority are virtually illiterate in Vietnamese and arrive with no transferable job skills," the study found. Among its sample of 259 Amerasians, 13 percent had no formal education, as against 2 percent of full-blooded Vietnamese refugees. Eighty-five percent had less than nine years of schooling.
One of these is Bang Truc Giang, 23, who until her arrival here two years ago was one of the toughened Amerasians who gathered on the former Tu Do Street in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, selling peanuts and besieging foreign visitors with pleas for visas to the United States.
Now living with relatives in the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte, she works at a garment factory while she studies to be a beautician. But she still speaks almost no English, and her life remains focused within a Vietnamese community.
Miss Giang said she did not know who her American father was, and she seemed to have limited knowledge about the country that is her new home. Still she said firmly, "This is the land of my father, so it is my land."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush's Remarks on China

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech today at Yale University, as recorded by Federal News Service, a transcription company:
 Some argue that a nation as moral and just as ours should not taint itself by dealing with nations less moral, less just. But this counsel offers up self-righteousness draped in a false morality. You do not reform a world by ignoring it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	 
 This same approach guides our policy towards the People's Republic of China, home to fully one-fifth of the world's people. China can -- easily can affect the stability of the Asian-Pacfic region, and therefore affect the entire world's peace and prosperity. The Chinese play a central role in working to resolve the conflict in Cambodia, to relax tensions on the Korean peninsula.
China has a voice now in the multinational organizations, and its votes in the United Nations Security Council against Iraq's brutal aggression helped us forge the broad coalition that brought us victory in the gulf.
And so when we find opportunities to cooperate with China, we will explore them. When problems arise with China's behavior, we will take appropriate action.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Unfair trade is also high on our agenda. Just last month, we cited China . . . for pirating U.S. copyrights and patents. And for the sake of national security, we will ban technology and equipment to any Chinese company found to violate rules outlawing transfer of missile technology.
We will continue to advance our interests and ideals for free and fair trade, for broader democratization, for respect, for human rights throughout China.

 	 	 		. . .	 	This week, I will employ another, by proposing formally that M.F.N. trade status continue for China. This policy has generated considerable controversy. Some critics have said revoke M.F.N., or endanger it with sweeping conditions -- to censure China, cut our ties and isolate them. We are told this is a principled policy, a moral thing to do. This advice is not new, it's not wise, it is not in the best interest of our country, the United States, and in the end, in spite of noble and best intentions, it is not moral.
First, M.F.N. is special. It's not a favor. It is the ordinary basis of trade worldwide. Second, M.F.N. is a means to bring the influence of the outside world to bear on China. Critics who attack M.F.N. today act as if the point is to punish China, as if hurting China's economy will somehow help the cause of privatization and human rights.
The real point is to pursue a policy that has the best chance of changing Chinese behavior.

HEADLINE: IRAN'S LEADERS ASK WIDE COOPERATION AND TIES TO WEST

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISFAHAN, Iran, May 27

 BODY:
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and three other senior officials called today for vastly increased economic and political cooperation with the West and for closer ties with Iran's Persian Gulf neighbors.
Addressing 250 Western, Asian and Arab oil officials in the largest international conference held in Iran since the Islamic revolution of 1979, these Iranian leaders left little doubt that they were reorienting their diplomacy away from the confrontational policies of the last decade. 
 The officials -- President Rafsanjani, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, Oil Minister Gholamreza Agazadeh and Finance Minister Mohsen Noorbakhsh -- appeared to confirm that they have the upper hand in the conflict with religious fundamentalists. The hard-liners want Iran to remain rigidly faithful to the doctrines of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. They include Ayatollah Ali Khameini, spiritual heir to Ayatollah Khomeini, and other Islamic clerics.
 
Interest in Washington
 In Washington, a State Department official expressed interest in the Iranian statements and said: "It indicates they do want to rejoin the community of nations. We will await the next steps."
The debate focuses on issues like whether Iran should again look to world financial markets for economic-development funds, and whether it can resume normal relations with governments in the region that it viewed in the 1980's as enemies.
"From a global perspective, a new order is gradually superseding in which economic considerations overshadow political priorities," Mr. Velayati told those attending, including scores of American, British, French and other Western oil-company officials, as well as several Arab oil ministers.
Addressing the inaugural session of the conference being held in this ancient and beautiful city, the Iranian leaders went further than ever in saying they now believe that the economic well-being of Iran and of other oil-producing countries is tied to stable and moderate oil prices and broad cooperation between consumers and producers of oil.
The Iranian officials said that in the aftermath of the crushing defeat of Iraq by American-led forces in the gulf war, they felt that Iran had many interests in common with the Arab monarchies and sheikdoms that took pat in the war. Iraq had no representative here.
 
Leadership Confidence Seen

 President Rafsanjani, who is viewed as the principal architect of Iran's new diplomacy, reinforced that idea in a message read by representatives on the first day of the three-day meeting.
"The concluding years of the 20th century are marked by world events that have replaced the previous bipolar system by a new order," he said. "If this order is to persist, cooperation should replace confrontation."
The highly publicized advocacy of these pragmatic views in the presence of Westerners and other foreign officials, including the Prime Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, strongly suggests that President Rafsanjani and his allies no longer fear the internal opposition of hard-liners. These fundamentalists still advocate confrontation with the West and oppose any borrowing by Iran to develop its economy.
Mr. Noorbakhsh, the Finance Minister, said in an interview that Iran would raise $27 billion for its five-year economic plan, which began last year. He said Iran would seek loans of $17 billion from foreign banks and raise the balance from joint ventures with foreign companies, most of which were expelled from Iran after the 1979 revolution.
"It shows the intention of the Islamic Republic of Iran to have a dialogue with the industrialized countries and countries of the region, and to insure a stable price for oil that will promote world economic growth and the development of Iran," Mr. Noorbakhsh said.
Referring to Iran's fierce opposition to the West in the last decade and its weak ties with its Arab neighbors, Mr. Noorbakhsh said, "We were busy with the war imposed on us by Iraq" -- a reference to the eight-year conflict between the nations, which ended with an armistice in 1988. "But now, we are interested in economic cooperation in the region and with the world instead of military confrontation," he added.
 
Hostage Issue Raised
 The Iranian officials were asked if cooperation with the United States could grow despite the plight of American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim militias in Lebanon. They essentially restated their view that the release of the hostages must be part of a general agreement that includes settling debts that Iran says it is owed by the United States.
Iranian officials say the United States may owe Iran as much as $10 billion in assets that have been frozen since 1979. The American position has been that improved relations with Iran cannot go ahead without the release of the hostages.
A number of Iranian officials expressed optimism that improved relations with the West would eventually lead to better ties with the United States. An official who asked not to be identified said he believed that the hostage issue was in its final phase and might soon be resolved.
American oil-industry officials who have come to Iran for the first time since the Iranian revolution said they were warmly greeted and found a readiness by Iranian officials to discuss business deals ranging from the purchase of crude oil to helping Iran develop its petro-chemical and refining industries.
The United States lifted its ban on the purchase of oil from Iran earlier this year, and at least two American companies, the Coastal Corporation of Houston and Mobil Oil, have contracted to buy significant quantities of Iranian oil.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Israeli Cautious on Hostages
 JERUSALEM, May 27 (Special to The New York Times) -- A senior Defense Ministry adviser today tempered reports that Israel and Muslim fundamentalists in Lebanon were close to a prisoner exchange by saying that his country would not negotiate a trade until it had evidence that its missing soldiers were alive.
But later tonight, some progress toward that end was made when the leader of the Iranian-backed Party of God acknowledged that his group was holding two unidentified Israeli prisoners. It was the first time since 1988 that the Party of God acknowledged holding the Israelis.
"We have two Israeli prisoners and a few soldiers," Sheik Abbas Musawi said in a broadcast monitored here, The soldiers he referred to belong to the South Lebanon Army, a pro-Israeli militia.

HEADLINE: Bush Renewing Trade Privileges For China, but Adds Missile Curbs

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 27

 BODY:
Declaring that he is "trying to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils," President Bush said today that he would continue China's trading privileges for another year. But he sought to lessen the political effect of his decision by imposing new restrictions on missile technology exports to China.
"We want to promote positive change in the world through the force of our example, not simply profess our purity," Mr. Bush said in a speech to the graduating class at his alma mater, Yale University, that embodied his most detailed explanation to date of a China policy that has put him in regular conflict with Congress. 
 "We want to advance the cause of freedom, not just snub nations that aren't yet wholly free," he said. [Excerpts, page A8.]
Mr. Bush said he would inform Congress this week that China's trading privileges -- known as "most favored nation" status -- are to be continued for another year. The move had been expected since the President said two weeks ago that he wanted to renew China's favorable tariff treatment.
Many lawmakers have called for the privileges to be revoked to punish Beijing for its crackdown on political activity in 1989, an approach that Mr. Bush strongly rejected today in a move that is sure to lead to a confrontation with Congress.
The White House announced that Mr. Bush was imposing three new sanctions on China, including blocking the sale to China of high-speed computers used for missile testing. He did not detail those actions in his speech and the White House went out of its way to say that they were not related to the extension of China's trading status. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had already proposed them in a recent memo to Mr. Bush as a way of countering Congressional opposition to the trade decision.
 
Senate Leader Is Critical
 China's trading privileges, guaranteeing the lowest available tariff rates on Chinese goods, expire on July 3. Mr. Bush's action will take effect immediately unless both houses of Congress approve measures to reverse it or attach conditions. At least five measures that would do so are pending.
A measure of the Congressional displeasure likely to develop was quickly evident. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, attending a parade in Maine, his home state, called the proposed sanctions a "joke," and pledged to "make every effort to reverse this mistaken policy put forward by the Administration."
Most-favored-nation status is not normally granted to Communist countries considered in violation of human rights. Mr. Bush said his approach toward China was intended to promote the spread of democracy by remaining economically and politically engaged with the Chinese leadership, although he acknowledged that he still has strong concerns about China's human rights record and that he was following a path with "enormous potential for error and embarrassment."
Mr. Bush flew here from his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., under a cloak of secrecy imposed to comply with Yale's tradition of not announcing commencement speakers in advance.
Students and guests protesting Mr. Bush's policies on civil rights, abortion and other issues were thickly scattered in the audience on the Yale Quadrangle and periodically heckled the President as he spoke. His announcement on trade with China drew hisses and boos, as well as some applause.
Keenly aware of the growing political opposition, Mr. Bush sought to present his policy on China as a measured mixture of engagement and sanctions. Trying to draw a historic line between his policy and past American actions like the defiance of the Berlin blockade and the institution of the Marshall Plan, he said:
"This nation's foreign policy has always been more than simply an expression of American interests. It is an extension of American ideals. This moral dimension of American policy requires us to remain active, engaged in the world. Many times, that means trying to chart a moral course through a world of lesser evils. That's the real world, not black and white. Very few moral absolutes."
Addressing his critics, Mr. Bush said he would hold China to the strictest human rights standards and spoke of sanctions that he imposed against China after the violence in Tiananmen Square and the nationwide crackdown on political activity in 1989.
The White House said Mr. Bush ordered three measures to limit the export of missile and satellite technology to China:
*Licenses will be refused to companies that have applied to sell China 20 high-speed computers, valued at $30 million, that can be used for missile flight testing.
*As long as the United States is not satisfied that China is abiding by inernational regulations restricting the flow of ballistic missile and nuclear technology, licenses will not be granted to American companies seeking to take part in seven proposed satellite launches by China. No such licenses have been requested.
*American companies will be barred from selling any missile technology or equipment to the Government-run Chinese Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation. The White House said this action was ordered in response to the Chinese corporation's sale of missile technology and equipment to Pakistan.
 
Steps Outlined by Baker
 The White House sought to play down any connection between these three actions and Mr. Bush's decision to extend China's trading status. "One is not being done to sell the other," said a senior Administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
All three steps were outlined by Secretary of State Baker in a recent memo to Mr. Bush that proposed a strategy for selling his decision on Chinese trade to a reluctant Congress, officials said.
The memo also talked about which members of Congress should be lobbied to help Mr. Bush's cause and proposed arguments for defending the decision on trade, some of which were included in Mr. Bush's speech today.
Mr. Bush made it clear that he was firmly opposed to attaching any conditions to the Chinese trading privileges.
"Some critics have urged us to revoke M.F.N., or endanger it with sweeping conditions, to censure China, cut our ties and isolate it," Mr. Bush said. "We are told this is a principled policy, a moral thing to do."
Mr. Bush said continued trade with China was a "means to bring the influence of the outside world to bear" and rejected arguments that a threat to cut the trading rights is a useful lever to improve Chinese human rights policy.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Opposition in Congress
 WASHINGTON, May 27 (Special to The New York Times) -- In offering what critics called decidedly modest restrictions on technology exports to China, President Bush appeared today to have put his Administration on a collision course with Congress over renewing Chinese trade benefits.
"The issue is joined," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who, citing human rights and other abuses, has introduced a measure to revoke most-favored-nation status that China has enjoyed since 1979.
Without the benefits, soaring imports of Chinese goods could be subjected to an extra $6 billion a year in tariffs, according to the United States-China Business Council, making a significant proportion of them unmarketable here. China this year is expected to have the second biggest trading surplus with the United States after Japan.
The disagreement on the issue, which does not closely follow party lines, covers views ranging from the tactical argument of carrot and stick to the moral argument of whether China should receive a benefit denied the Soviet Union, which is liberalizing human rights policies.
The most-favored-nation designation needs to be renewed each year, a process requiring that the President certify that China is in compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a measure denying favored-nation status to countries denying free emigration.
The President's contention that China can be induced by trade and other contacts to make accommodations on human rights, weapons proliferation and religious freedom is disputed by many Democrats and some Republicans. The critics find no appreciable shift so far and say it is also morally wrong for China to enjoy privileges denied the Soviet Union.
"We don't want to reward them for behavior we find evil" and which may be getting worse, Senator Moynihan declared.

Designer Discounts
It's not the fashion doldrums, but it's not high season either. After a long week of parties and benefits, designers are planning to hang around their shops a bit, dividing their time between New York and the East End of Long Island, or go off researching fabrics for their next collections. 
 Nobody seemed to be especially thrilled with spring business. As a random indicator, at Century 21 , an off-price outlet in the financial district, the racks were jammed last week with designer merchandise, both European and American, including a fair selection of Jean-Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana, Thierry Mugler, Charlotte Neuville, Rebecca Moses and Gordon Henderson. Paying full price is one thing that really seems to be out of style.
Women's Wear Daily introduced a new weekly feature last Wednesday, called On Target, to counteract all "the gloom and doom," as the text put it. It contained two full pages of success stories -- from baseball caps to A-line dresses to Swatch watches. Tune in tomorrow to see if they have enough to sustain two weeks in a row.
 
A New Sharper Image
The Sharper Image , a retailer that specializes in high-tech electronics, is starting to sell women's clothes for the first time. Richard Thalheimer, the president and founder of the 75-store chain, said his three Manhattan stores sold out of a full-length lace body-stocking for women that was tested a couple of weeks ago.
It's a major change for a store that sold video products, massage chairs and gadgets that kill roaches with music (well, maybe not New York roaches). The chain was a success in the mid-80's, but since the stock market crash of 1987, many Wall Street types who bought its toys for grown-up boys are unemployed.
"We needed to move in a different direction," Mr. Thalheimer said. "I wanted to shift the focus somewhat from hard goods to soft goods like apparel and luggage."
There are plans to add leather and suede outerwear, silk shirts and sweaters. Batteries not included.
 
Recession for Men
A sign, or scent, of the times: the introduction of Recession, an "owe de cologne, poor hombre." This Recession is made by Topical Products. The box says, "The economy stinks. You shouldn't have to." It will be at Bloomingdale's next week as part of the industry's Fragrance Week. At $15.95, two weeks before Father's Day, this is more than a joke.
 
French Spoken Here
Galeries Lafayette , the French retailer, is gearing up for its September opening in the former Bonwit Teller site, now being renovated at 10 East 57th Street. The retailer recently asked Robert Isabel, the party decorator known for transforming the drab into the fantastic, to cover up the rubble for a tour by journalists and suppliers on June 13. But Mr. Isabel demurred.
"I thought the raw concrete and exposed steel beams were dramatic," Mr. Isabel said. Now the plan is for hundreds of high-wattage caged work lights, coffee served in chrome thermoses and hard hats for guests.
Both Seventh Avenue manufacturers and Fifth Avenue retailers have looked askance at the Galeries Lafayette invasion, especially since the store's president, Eugenia Ulasewicz, recently revealed that no American designers would be sold there.
The store will have a decidedly French flavor, and in more respects than its merchandise. The Job Bank column in the June newsletter of the Fashion Group International, an organization of female executives, said the store still needs to hire 250 employees. French-speaking applicants, the article said, would be preferred.

HEADLINE: In the Realm of Technology, Japan Seizes a Greater Role

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
WITH startling new clarity and detail, indicators of technical vigor are depicting a world in which the United States rapidly gives ground to its Japanese competition, a surprising number of small but vigorous nations mount their own challenges and the Soviet Union virtually withdraws from the field.
The findings are based on statistical methods that gauge the significance of a nation's patents and scientific papers by measuring how frequently they are cited in subsequent patent filings. A patent that is often referred to is judged to be more important and influential than one that generates no citations. 
 High-quality patents are seen by many experts as potent indicators of a nation's future prosperity because they signal the emergence of important new technologies that will be under the patent holder's exclusive control for many years. Superior scientific papers are considered important to a nation's industrial health because inventors increasingly rely on basic research to compete effectively in the international race for commercial innovations.
The detailed analysis of citations to patents and scientific papers, though laden with limitations and sometimes faulted as experimental, is seen as having attained a new level of maturity and respectability in recent years. The Federal Government has increasingly used the method to study technical trends.
Most recently, an analysis of patents that compares the technical strengths of 1,100 companies around the world is to be marketed in June, giving managers, economists and stock analysts a more objective look at a company's technical health or sickness.
The findings of such analyses can be disquieting. For example, the International Business Machines Corporation, the computer and electronics giant, is seen as having been surpassed by Hitachi in 1985 in overall technical strength, with the gap growing wider in recent years.
The patent data, compiled by CHI Research Inc., of Haddon Heights, N.J., which tracks technical trends for the Federal Government and industrial clients, has also been analyzed in aggregate to discover the new world order among countries. This feat was accomplished by grouping a nation's top companies or industrial associations and then comparing the group's overall citation strength to that of other countries' groups of leading companies and associations.
The new patent findings are considered important because they cut through the vast clutter of useless ideas and frivolous filings to show what is solid, innovative and enduring.
"It's scary," Dr. Francis Narin, CHI's president, said in an interview. "The Japanese are continuing to expand in virtually every area of technology. Anybody who believes that the Japanese increase is just in autos and electronics is totally oblivious of the facts. Their performance is impressive across the board, in virtually every field."
Daniel F. Burton Jr., executive vice president of the Council on Competitiveness, a private group in Washington, strongly agreed. "This shows that the Japanese drive is pretty deep," he said. "It's not just microwaves and toasters and VCR's. They're capable of mounting a challenge in the most sophisticated areas of technology."
While the United States still leads the field because of the sheer size of its industrial base, the data show that its position is threatened by top Japanese companies. The Japanese rise to technical prominence can now be seen to have thrust forward with particular vigor during the 1980's.
Hitachi began to draw significantly ahead of I.B.M. in the mid-1980's. Fuji Photo started to overtake Eastman Kodak at the same time. In autos, however, Detroit lagged for most of the 1980's but recently began to narrow the gap with the Japanese troika of Toyota , Honda and Nissan . Experts caution that the high-tech satellite companies owned by General Motors and Ford may account for much of their apparent recovery in the patent race.
The cumulative effects of the assault are evident in CHI's overall comparison of American and Japanese technical strength, with results showing Japan racing upward to challenge the lead position.
Surprisingly, several other small countries rank relatively high in the international patent race; these include the Netherlands, Switzerland, Taiwan and Liechtenstein.
Many analysts in the United States had remained confident about the outcome of the industrial competition because America's level of basic science was so high, implying that research and development, much of it produced in universities, would ultimately win the race.
 
Faith in Research

 But that scenario has been shaken by a new analysis of American scientific papers by the Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia, which scrutinizes some 10 million footnotes a year from 3,200 scientific journals to discover what is hot and what is not. Earlier this year the institute published an upbeat study that said the quality of American research had steadily risen over the last decade, as judged by the growing number of citations the research attracted.
But further analysis by the institute showed that the advances had occurred largely in academic fields like earth science and environmental studies. In contrast, technologies that are key to industrial vigor, including engineering, computer science, electronics, communications, robotics and instrumentation, suffered sharp declines over the latter part of the decade.
"It's surprising," said Dr. David A. Pendlebury of the institute, who noted that the earlier analysis had been widely interpreted as bolstering the image of American technical pre-eminence.
Central to the ascendancy of the analysis of patents and scientific papers is the longstanding struggle by analysts to find an objective way to judge the quality of work in science and technology. Peer panels and awards are generally acknowledged to be highly subjective and sometimes wrong. And raw numbers as a measure of achievement can be deceptive. A scientist who has produced 200 papers, or a company with 200 patents, might be mediocre in terms of real performance, while an inventor with one good patent might make a fortune in royalties or a scientist with one good paper might go down in history as another Einstein.
Citation analysis was pioneered in the 1950's when a few analysts started to tally, by hand, the number of references made to a given scientific article. The method's effectiveness was based on the principle that requires researchers to cite previous studies on which their work is based.
More recently, the technique has become highly computerized to handle huge volumes of data and has been expanded to include patents, assuming that the importance of a bright idea is reflected in how often other inventors cite it. For patents and papers, the method analyzes networks of citations, striving to separate seminal ideas from insignificant ones in an informational system cluttered with millions of irrelevancies.
 
Limits of Analysis

 Citation analysis has well-known limitations, including the tendency of authors and inventors to cite their own work disproportionately and the tendency of certain papers or patents to become highly cited merely because they document a method or technique that becomes widely used but falls far short of a breakthrough. Moreover, some critics say cultural differences in the significance placed on patents can bias the results.
Even so, analytical techniques have been refined over the years to try to take such factors into account. As a result, the use of citation analysis has soared in a world increasingly eager for reliable measures of technical excellence.
The recent CHI work on patents represents the first time a giant data base has been assembled to measure what the company calls "total technical strength," which, in essence, takes the number of patents issued to a company or an industry or in a country and multiplies it by citation rates in order to achieve a broad gauge of performance. CHI, in earlier work for the Federal Government, developed country rankings that looked only at raw citation rates.
The new data base, known as Tech-Line, is based on a novel method that zeroes in on large companies and, starting in June, is to be marketed publicly as an analytical tool by Mead Data Central 's Nexis/Lexis computerized information service. The Tech-Line data base now covers the years 1983 to 1989 and is to be updated annually.
Dr. Narin of CHI said Tech-Line revealed disturbing trends in the industrial contest between America and Japan, with company after company in the United States shown to be falling behind. "I.B.M. has generally been flat and Hitachi is going straight up," he said. "When you look at stock prices, you see the same thing." The stock correlation is evident over a long period, not on a week-by-week basis.
In rankings among countries, he said, the United States still leads the field. But he cautioned that America could soon be overtaken by Japan if that nation's advances continue in the future at the same extraordinary pace that they did in the 1980's. A CHI analysis shows that between 1983 and 1989 Japan nearly closed the gap in total technical strength, a remarkable feat for a nation with a far smaller industrial base than the United States.
 
Impact of Culture

 Some analysts dismiss such comparisons, saying cultural differences can skew the results. Earl H. Kinmonth, a historian at the University of California at Davis, has argued that Japanese patents are more public-relations hype than certificates of technical merit. "This has resulted in substantial exaggeration of the Japanese position and comparable denigration of that of the U.S.," he has written.
But Dr. Narin of CHI argued that Japanese ascendancy in technology is self evident and that it belies such criticism.
"Walk down the street," he said. "On the left you see Japanese cars and the right Japanese electronics. What our work is saying is that there's much more of that kind of innovation in the pipeline."
Further evidence of the erosion in America's preeminence in technology is found in the analysis of citations to scientific papers by the Philadelphia institute. During the latter half of the 1980's, according to the recent study, the country's position in technical areas fell by nearly 7 percent, as measured by fewer citations. The other categories were physical sciences, agricultural sciences, clinical medicine and life sciences.
"Technology was the only area in which we have conspicuous declines," said Dr. Pendlebury of the Institute for Scientific Information. The study is to appear in the next issue of Science Watch, an institute publication.
The downward trend is considered important because inventors in the recent past have dramatically increased their reliance on basic research to compete in the international race for commercial innovations. Experts say that the time lag between science and technology -- between understanding nature and using that knowledge to reorder the natural world in the form of clever inventions -- was once centuries and decades but now can be as short as years and sometimes months.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
Behind the Price Cuts

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS

 BODY:
COMPUTER companies are cutting prices once again, partly in response to the recession and decreased demand and partly because regular price reductions are a byproduct of progress in the industry.
But there is a more profound reason for the recent price reductions by the Compaq Computer Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation, among others. There appears to have been a fundamental shift in the buying attitudes of consumers. 
 "Buyers are no longer willing to pay premium brand prices" for computers that differ only in the nameplate on the cover of the box, said Bruce A. Stephen, director of PC hardware research for the International Data Corporation of Framingham, Mass. "Brand name loyalties that were firm are now more tenuous," he said.
As a result, "premium brand" computer companies are discovering that they must become as aggressive about pricing as they are about bringing new technologies to market.
I.B.M. has reduced the suggested retail prices on its PS/2 series of personal computers twice in the last two months, cutting them by as much as 38 percent on selected models. Compaq cut prices by as much as 34 percent last month. The Dell Computer Corporation, whose already low prices may have been at least partly responsible for the cuts by I.B.M. and Compaq, cut prices again.
Even Apple Computer Inc., which has no direct competition for its Macintosh but which must still compete against industry-standard PC's, has shifted its emphasis to lower-cost machines.
It is also increasingly difficult for a computer company to stand apart from the crowd on technology. Compaq had nearly a year's jump on I.B.M. when it introduced the first desktop PC's built around the Intel Corporation's i386 microprocessor. But earlier this year, when Intel rolled out its new i486SX chip, nearly a dozen PC makers announced systems on the first day.
The net effect is that PC's are becoming commodities even at the high end of the PC market, just as they have become at the low end.
"All this has resulted in a feverish, price-competitive environment where prices are cut more often," Mr. Stephen said.
 The trend is good news for consumers, both for those who are looking for an entry-level system and for those who are moving up to high-performance PC's.
Compaq, of Houston, has long had a reputation for building high-quality, high-performance computers, with commensurately high prices. In the last six months, however, Compaq has borne the brunt of a withering barrage of competitive advertising and declining market share.
AST Research Inc., once thought of as a second-tier clone maker, earlier this year began shipping an Intel i386SX-based notebook computer that matched the features of Compaq's popular LTE 386s/20 notebook for $3,100 less, before Compaq's recent price cuts. One could buy an AST Premium Exec 386SX/20 notebook with a 60-megabyte hard disk for $3,795, toss in a stripped-down AST i486-based desktop PC for $2,995, and still spend less than the cost of the Compaq notebook ($6,999) alone.
Compaq's new price on its 60-megabyte LTE 386s/20 is $4,799, still $1,000 higher than AST's model but not the embarrassing 2-for-1 difference that existed before.
The most damaging assault on the industry's pricing strategies, however, may have come from Dell, of Austin, Tex. Dell sells its computers directly to customers, unlike Compaq and I.B.M., which sell their machines through a network of dealers. Dell has run a series of advertisements comparing Dell and Compaq machines head to head.
Many people (including Compaq's lawyers) believe the Dell ads are misleading, in that they compare Dell's discounted prices to the full list price of Compaq's machines, which nobody pays. Others feel that the strident tone of the ads is needlessly offensive. However, whether because of the ads or the decline in Compaq's share of the business computer market, Compaq last month reduced prices on its entire product line by 8 to 34 percent.
Customers may not see the full extent of those price cuts, since dealer prices and list prices do not necessarily move in tandem. Even so, Compaq sent an unmistakable signal that it would no longer allow Dell, AST or other rivals the luxury of overwhelming price advantages.
Dell responded to Compaq's move by reducing its prices on selected models even further.
Dell received an added bonus this month when it was named the top overall brand by J. D. Powers & Associates, a market research company best known for tracking customer satisfaction in the automobile industry. Dell has also consistently won top honors from corporate computer buyers.

HEADLINE: Aiding Moscow: The Quid Pro Quo Approach

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a May 17 news article, you outlined a new initiative by the Soviet economist Grigory Yavlinsky, presumably enjoying Mikhail Gorbachev's support, for salvaging perestroika. In essence, it offers rapid economic reform in exchange for massive Western aid; figures of up to $30 billion per year for five years are cited. But such a "Marshall Plan" is highly improbable. To assume that it will be agreed upon because Soviet economic reform in itself would be our reward is unrealistic.
Indeed, the European Community, Japan and the United States would each profit from Soviet recovery. Perestroika's failure threatens outmigration to Europe. It also reduces Soviet purchases from the nations of Eastern Europe, adding to their difficulties and increasing Western Europe's responsibilities. The U.S. must additionally confront the security implications of chaos in a crumbling superpower; it cannot contemplate with equanimity Soviet transition to the anarchy of Bakunin instead of the markets of Adam Smith. Japan, with trade and foreign investment (fueled by its large trade surplus) as its primary concerns, would find an attractive and proximate market in a Soviet economy gradually shifting into capitalist gear. 
 But foreign aid, even where enlightened self-interest is demonstrated, is suffering from fatigue, and there are more deserving claimants. So the Soviet Union is not likely to qualify.
However, a realistic mutual-gain plan emerges if we ask what the European Community, Japan and the United States each can do and what each can reasonably expect from the Soviet Union as quid pro quo.
For the European Community, the big-ticket dimensions of a deal are obvious. The community, which will obviously gain from the Soviets' conclusion of the conventional arms treaty, can in turn offer them a substantial, five-year grain and meat agreement, selling its farm surpluses on medium-term credit. In view of the opening Uruguay Round of tariff negotiations, the European Community needs to cut back subsidies on its farm exports. Providing farmers with a temporary new Soviet market could ease the political pain of these cutbacks.
Japan and the Soviet Union can do even better. The four disputed islands Stalin seized in August 1945 could be traded for Japanese foreign investment and credits. But Japanese investment, ever prudent, will not venture onto the Soviet scene as long as confrontational politics are undercutting perestroika. This was the message an otherwise empty-handed, and long-faced, Mr. Gorbachev brought back from Tokyo in April.
The subsequent accord between the feuding leaders in Moscow may give
the deal that did not materialize in Tokyo a new chance, but not unless the prospect for perestroika's revival becomes a certainty. For that to happen, the Soviet Union and the United States must fashion a concerted and coherent plan. Its key components are almost obvious:
* The Soviet Union must rapidly conclude the conventional arms treaty, reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal, begin negotiations on the islands with Japan and join the U.S. in scaling down assistance to the warring factions in Afghanistan.
* These Soviet initiatives would bring immediate gains for the United States in terms of reduced superpower obligations for international security. And they would be decisive in overcoming conservative opposition in the U.S. to a major underwriting of Soviet efforts at perestroika.
* President Bush would thus be in a position to offer the Soviets entry into the World Bank, with access to the bank's resources for long-term "structural adjustment," and to the International Monetary Fund with its host of funds for short-term needs.
* The Soviet use of multilateral funds, the European Community grain and meat agreement and Japanese credits and direct investment would make a core plan of successful transition to markets credible, and such a plan would simultaneously exploit and justify these commitments. The food problem in the restive cities would be contained, foreign investments would bring in needed technology and the (nonfood) credits would ease the transition to convertibility and reinforce the capacity to attract investment from everywhere.
* A consortium of the trilateral powers and the multilateral institutions would back the economic plan (whose basic elements are now broadly agreed upon by Soviet and foreign experts). To respect Soviet sensibilities, the plan would be monitored by the multilateral institutions.
* The threat of suspension of the plan if turmoil returns to the Soviet Union would be the glue to keep Mr. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin working together for the orderly progress of perestroika and, equally, of glasnost.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Head of Timken Named Chairman of Steel Group

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Joseph F. Toot Jr., the president of the Timken Company, has been elected chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the trade association of the nation's large steel producers. He replaces Frank W. Luerssen, the chairman and chief executive of Inland Steel Industries, who served two years. The election was held at the association's annual meeting in Washington last week.
Mr. Toot, 55, becomes the industry's chief spokesman during the most challenging period for steel producers since the early- to mid-1980's. Steel demand from the automobile and construction industries is lackluster, prices are weak and the industry's losses are expected this year to be the heaviest since the mid-1980's. 
 "This is an industry and an organization that is in change," Mr. Toot said. "In this period, the fundamental job is to adapt to the changes that the economy and other influences have placed on the industry."
As chairman of the association, Mr. Toot will oversee the trade group's moves into new steelmaking techniques that avoid the use of coke ovens, which have been found to cause pollution. He will also be expected to speak on the effect of the expiration of voluntary restaint agreements, which have placed limits on the amount of imported steel allowed into the United States. The measures expire next spring.
Another priority, he said, is the development of new and different uses of steel. "Many people tend to think of steel and steel products as mature, and they assume that things do not change much in the industry," Mr. Toot said. "But there are new and more effective uses for the material that we have to find and develop."
Mr. Toot joined Timken in 1962 as a trainee in manufacturing operations. He then began a decade of work in Timken's activities outside the United States, primarily in Europe. He was elected vice president of international operations in 1967 and was named a member of the company's executive committee and assumed the position of executive vice president in 1973. He was elected president of Timken in 1979.
Timken, based in Canton, Ohio, is a specialty steel producer, making such products as stainless steel and specialty bars and tubing. The company also makes bearings.

HEADLINE: Joining Forces to Protect a Paraguayan Forest

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE

DATELINE: MBARACAYU, Paraguay

 BODY:
SINCE 1989, when a military coup ended the 35-year dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, there has been a democratic awakening in Paraguay, and interest in safeguarding the country's natural resources has blossomed.
A major focus of this attention is Mbaracayu, a 225-square-mile extension of Brazil's Atlantic Forest system. It is one of the last great tracts of privately owned subtropical forest in South America. 
 "Mbaracayu is unique because physically there is no larger piece of land that is virtually undisturbed," said Alan Randall, Paraguayan program director for the Nature Conservancy, one participant in a coalition of governmental and private entities seeking to protect the larger of Mbaracayu's two parcels on Paraguay's eastern border with Brazil.
Alwyn H. Gentry, senior curator of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, called Mbaracayu "one of the most important remaining examples of 'Alto Parana,' a high-forest type unusually rich in endemic species, found there and nowhere else."
Mbaracayu is not formally part of the Atlantic Forest, which once ranged thousands of miles along Brazil's coast and which the International Conservation Union in Switzerland considers one of the two most endangered rain forests in the world, along with a jungle in Madagascar. It is, however, a vital haven for numerous Atlantic Forest species that have disappeared from the forest proper.
"It is the last refuge for many species," said Mr. Randall. "It is a bird sanctuary and is particularly rich in fruits and nuts which provide subsistence for the local Indian population."
The two parcels of land that make up the Mbaracayu property, one of 143,000 acres, another of 27,000, have been owned since 1979 by the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank that gained title because of the bankruptcy of a timber company. While the properties, which are about 50 miles apart, have been maintained and their borders protected, the land is threatened by poachers, landless peasants and those wishing to develop the land.
The Moises Bertoni Foundation, a Paraguayan conservation group started in Asuncion in 1988, has forged an unusual preservation alliance. It involves the World Bank, the Nature Conservancy, the United States Agency for International Development, the Government of Paraguay and AES Barbers Point, a private American company that is financing a survey of Mbaracayu property to determine the amount of carbon that will be sequestered by preserving the existing forest. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Applied Energy Services of Arlington, Va.
In a precedent for the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation is selling a property below market value to a conservation organization. After the Paraguayan Government rejected a debt-for-nature swap, the I.F.C. asked $8 million for the larger Mbaracayu tract, but it has agreed to sell it to the Nature Conservancy for $2 million. The first grant of $500,000 from A.I.D.'s Regional Global Climate Change Fund has been pledged to the conservancy to establish Mbaracayu as a nature reserve.
The Nature Conservancy will purchase the property in behalf of the foundation. As part of the agreement, the Paraguayan Government has agreed to buy the smaller tract with the intention of establishing agrarian reform settlements. The price is still being negotiated.
Because the Mbaracayu forest is far from Paraguay's navigable rivers, it was protected from European colonists. Spanish traders looking for the leaves of a locally grown tea, yerba mate, first entered the forest in the 16th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Brazilian slave traders also foraged the forests of Mbaracayu, but its isolation continued to provide a sanctuary for local Indians, the Ache.
Today the Ache live in two villages adjacent to Mbaracayu, but still use the forest as their traditional hunting grounds. Plans to preserve the wildlife and plant communities of the forest also include programs to allow the 1,000 remaining Ache to hunt and gather there and to help them make the transition to agriculture and animal husbandry.
"It is so quiet here, you feel like you are king of the world," said Raul Gauto, executive director of the Bertoni Foundation, leading visitors on a trail under the forest canopy. He explained that Mbaracayu means yellow macaw in Guarani, the second official language of Paraguay.
The Mbaracayu property holds a range of habitats. Fifteen percent is low transition forest (up to 49 feet tall), 80 precent is high, dense forest (up to 131 feet, depending on the depth of the soil) and 5 percent is natural grasslands, wetlands, rivers and caves of ecological, biological and archeological significance.
Initial surveys have identified 19 natural plant communities and a variety of threatened and endemic species. Tapirs, howler monkeys, peccary, giant armadillo, jaguar and bush dogs are among the endangered mammals found in the area. Rare birds, such as the king vulture, bare-faced curassow, black-fronted piping guan, bare-throated bellbird and large macaw have been spotted.
"The importance of Mbaracayu is not only to maintain this last undisturbed pocket of temperate, subtropical rain forest," said Mr. Gauto, "but it will also set a precedent for preservation that can then be replicated in other parts of the country."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Pricing Garbage To Reduce Waste

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
HOW much does it actually cost to haul away the trash? Many Americans do not know, because garbage-disposal fees are lumped in with other municipal services, like police and fire protection. As a result, there is little incentive to reduce the amount thrown out, despite the rising costs of disposal in much of the country.
Most approaches to dealing with the disposal of solid waste have been administrative and legislative. Some states now ban yard waste from landfills; others bar home appliances to conserve scarce space. Maine even banned the brick-shaped drink boxes popular with children on the ground that the boxes' paper-plastic-metal foil composition made them difficult to recycle. 
 Lately, though, there have been attempts to apply market forces to environmental problems, including waste disposal. One idea is to impose progressive per can charges for trash disposal, with increasing charges for each additional can. The intention is to create incentives to minimize waste.
The plans vary from location to location. But the basic theme is that a family pays a modest fee for the first can of trash each week. The second can or bag is priced sharply higher and the third or fourth even more so. Materials properly separated for recycling are collected without charge.
"Variable-can rates have been shown to be effective in waste minimization," said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Fund, an environmental group. "It makes people aware of how much they are generating. They can see the real cost of waste disposal."
Advocates of this form of unit-cost pricing say it encourages many forms of environmentally desirable behavior by consumers. For one thing, they are more dedicated in crushing boxes, cans and bottles, so that a week's trash fits into one can. That helps at the landfill, which fills up because of the volume of material, not its weight.
Consumers also pay more attention to separating recyclable materials. And they become more careful shoppers, avoiding excessive packaging that will have to be discarded.
"There is considerable evidence that such charges do alter waste 'consumption' habits, leading to more recycling, altered buying habits, composting, garbage compacting and other consumer responses to reduce solid-waste habits," wrote Lynn Scarlett, vice president of the Reason Foundation, a conservative research center, in a recent study of waste management.
A "pay as you throw" system has been in effect in Seattle for a decade, with good results, she reports. More than 85 percent of residents now participate in recycling programs, and the average number of garbage cans set out has declined to slightly more than one can a week, compared with 3.5 before the program started. Seattle requires the use of city-supplied garbage cans and charges $13.75 a month to pick up a 32-gallon can. The charge increases to $22.75 for a 60-gallon can. The rates must be set carefully, experts warn. If they are too low, people's behavior will not be changed; too high, and they encourage illicit dumping along roadsides and on vacant land.
Converting what had been seen as a "free" service to one that involves regular out-of-pocket financial costs has political pitfalls as well. "This is a hot political item, particularly in the Midwest," said Neil Seldman, director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a municipal consulting firm. "We suggest picking up the first can for free, and then applying the user fee to the second and subsequent cans. That way you protect low-income people while getting the attention of the middle class."
Solid-waste disposal is likely to be a key issue as discussions on reauthorizing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act begin in Congress later this year. But Mr. Hershkowitz, a solid-waste specialist, said Federal rules on disposal fees were not a good idea since local conditions varied widely. "It is easy to mess up unit-cost pricing," he said. "It has to be administered at the local level."
Others think economic forces need to be applied earlier in the production process. "Why wait until all this stuff has been created," said Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste specialist at the Environmental Action Foundation in Washington. "Why not have a virgin-materials tax on manufacturers so you get some action farther upstream."
Such a tax would encourage manufacturers to use recycled materials, which could help develop markets and increase prices for these materials. Some recycling programs have been severely hampered by the lack of markets for the materials they collect. For instance, in the Northeast recyclers pay to have old newspapers taken away because the supply has overstripped demand.
Some environmentalists say that without incentives, markets for recycled materials will be slow to develop because the materials are inherently dirtier and of more varied quality than raw substances.

HEADLINE: Home Resales in April Highest Since August

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes rose 3.4 percent in April, to the highest level since August, a real estate trade group said today. It was the third straight gain, and the report provided new evidence that the housing recession may have ended.
The National Association of Realtors said the sales pace was being driven by low mortgage interest rates, which are expected to remain in the single-digit range for the rest of the year. "Favorable financing is driving the market," said Harley E. Rouda, president of the realtors group. "Sales to first-time and repeat buyers are picking up across the board." 
 The realtors said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34 million, up from 3.22 million in March. It was the highest level since a 3.41 million rate eight months ago.
 
Median Price Up
 The advancing sales are being accompanied by rising prices, the realtors' survey found. The median price of an existing home was $100,200 in April, up 2 percent from March and 4.7 percent from a year earlier. The median means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
Analysts view January as the bottom of the housing recession. At that time, sales of existing homes fell to an annual rate of 2.9 million, and sales of new homes plunged to a 409,000 rate.
Since then, sales of both new and existing homes have risen, and many analysts expect sales of new homes to post another gain when the Commerce Department reports the April figures on Thursday.
Housing starts in April were 13 percent above the January level. And applications for building permits, a barometer of future activity, have risen for three straight months. The Commerce Department, which originally reported April permits had fallen by 3 percent, revised that figure last week to show a 2.4 percent rise.
Still, analysts expect just a modest recovery this year. The realtors, for instance, project sales of existing homes will total just 3.24 million units, down 1.7 percent from the weak sales in 1990.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said the average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in April was 9.49 percent, nearly a percentage point below that of a year earlier.
The low rates are luring first-time buyers, in turn spurring sales of higher-priced homes, Mr. Rouda said. "Most trade-up buyers must sell their homes before they can buy another one," he explained. "The more first-time buyers are in the market, the more chances repeat buyers have to move up from their starter homes."
The only sales drop came in the Midwest, where there was a 4.1 percent decline, to 930,000 units at an annual rate. But that followed what the realtors said was an "unsustainable sales spike," to 970,000 units, in March. The median price there was $77,400, up 1 percent from March.
 
Spurt in Northeast Sales
 Sales were up elsewhere, including the lagging Northeast, where they spurted 12.2 percent, to 550,000 units, the largest month-to-month increase since December 1986. The median price was $144,100, up 1 percent from March.
The realtor group's chief economist, John A. Tuccillo, cautioned, however, that while things were looking up in some Northeast areas, "in most major urban markets, a struggle continues with lending constraints and weak economic conditions."
Sales in the West were at a 570,000 rate, up 9.6 percent from March. The median price jumped 3.1 percent, to $151,800. Sales in the South rose 4.1 percent, to 1.28 million units. The median price was $88,000, up eight-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Silver Up Sharply; Mideast Demand Is Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold and silver futures prices rose sharply yesterday as a weaker dollar, a stronger stock market and a variety of supply-and-demand factors caused a surge in investment demand for precious metals.
Gold settled $6.90 to $7.30 higher on the New York Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in June at $363.70 an ounce; the expiring May contract rose $7, to $363.50 an ounce. 
 Silver was 12.4 cents to 13.5 cents higher, with May at $4.152 an ounce.
After languishing in narrow trading ranges for several weeks, the metals opened higher yesterday on speculative buying linked to signs of strong Middle Eastern demand, analysts said.
The advance accelerated after Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. released a report indicating gold demand exceeded production last year.
News reports of merger talks between the American Barrick Resources Corporation of Toronto and the Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver, North America's largest gold producer, put additional attention on the gold market.
Gold also benefited from weakness in the dollar, which could stimulate exports and provide fuel for inflation.
Silver, which has many uses in manufacturing, found support in the Dow Jones industrial average's gain of nearly 45 points, which pointed toward economic recovery.
"There is a lot of pent-up demand for the metals," said Randolph Donney, head of commodity research at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
New-crop cotton futures rose on the New York Cotton Exchange after the Agriculture Department said heavy rain during the planting season in the Mississippi Delta had reduced planting prospects for the region.
A weekly Agriculture Department report released after the close of trading showed 59 percent of the United States crop planted as of Sunday, compared with a five-year average of 74 percent. Planting progress in Mississippi and Louisiana remained far behind the normal pace.
Cotton futures finished 0.72 cent lower to 1.55 cents higher, with July at 89.30 cents a pound.
Corn and soybean planting also lagged behind the normal pace, mainly because of rain-related delays in Iowa and Minnesota.
Corn planting was 86 percent finished as of Sunday, compared with the five-year average of 91 percent; soybean planting was 42 percent complete, compared with the norm of 51 percent.
Winter wheat continued to advance toward the harvest stage, with heads appearing on 76 percent of the crop by Sunday compared with the norm of 74 percent.
In grain and soybean trading, wheat futures ended 2 1/4 cents to 5 1/2 cents lower, with July at $2.91 1/4 a bushel; corn was 3 1/4 cents to 4 1/4 cents lower, with July at $2.46 3/4 a bushel; oats were 1 1/4 cents to 1 3/4 cents lower, with July at $1.28 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with July at $5.77 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Upbeat Tone on Scheduling a Meeting With Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., May 28

 BODY:
 President Bush moved today to reassure President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he was eager to schedule the next superpower summit meeting and appeared to signal that he was looking favorably on a Soviet request for $1.5 billon in agricultural credits.
Speaking to reporters in a 20-minute impromptu news conference at the 18th hole of the Cape Arundel Golf Club here, Mr. Bush also defended his decision to extend China's trading status unconditionally for a year. 
 But he acknowledged that he was "starting perhaps a little behind" in his effort to persuade Congress not to approve any of five pending measures that would link the trading rights to China's human rights policies.
 
Delay on Summit Meeting
 The next Soviet-American summit meeting is supposed to be held by the end of June, under an agreement reached this year when the talks were delayed at Washington's request. But agreement on a date has been delayed by Soviet-American disputes over the carrying out of the treaty reducing nonnuclear arms in Europe that was signed last year and over a proposed treaty that would cut stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons.
After a 20-minute telephone conversation with Mr. Gorbachev on Monday, Mr. Bush said today that the remaining differences over the conventional arms accord, which focus on how many armored combat vehicles the Soviet Union may keep on active duty in the European part of its territory, were "now very narrow."
And he said he expected the long-delayed summit meeting to take place "sooner rather than later."
But Mr. Bush said he still could not offer a prospective date for the talks, and he said he could report no real "breakthrough" on the remaining arms control disputes.
Rather, Mr. Bush, who sought out the pool of reporters watching him play golf to make his remarks, seemed primarily interested in offering a public repetition of the assurances that he said he had offered Mr. Gorbachev in private about the improving state of Soviet-American ties after the chill that seemed to settle into the relationship last fall.
 
Moscow Seeks Economic Ties
 Soviet officials have made it clear in private that they are very eager to schedule the summit meeting and to move forward on the two countries' efforts to expand their economic ties, which Moscow sees as the foundation of its financial relationship with the industrial democracies, American officials said.
"I want to go to Moscow, and I've said that, and I don't know that the Soviets have believed this all along, because there's speculation in our papers that we're pulling away," Mr. Bush said. "So I had an opportunity to tell him that we're not moving away from him or the Soviet Union, that we want to do what's right."
But at the same time, Mr. Bush said he still had not made up his mind about extending significant financial aid to the Soviet Union, or about whether Mr. Gorbachev should be invited to the July meeting in London of the Group of Seven industrial democracies, as the Soviet leader has requested.
Mr. Bush also said he had made no final decision on the Soviet request for $1.5 billion in additional agricultural credits. He did not object when a reporter suggested that he seemed to be leaning toward granting the credits, but said: "I'm looking at it in terms of overall reforms and wanting to see the credits, if granted, help. Not just alleviate hunger, but be used perhaps to help in their whole agricultural system."
 
Soviet Delegation to Visit
 Mr. Bush said he would base his decisions on these issues in part on discussions this week between American officials and a Soviet delegation headed by Yevgeny M. Primakov, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a prominent Soviet economist.
Administration officials have said that Mr. Bush believes it is still too early to include Mr. Gorbachev in the London meeting, but there is some support among the other countries in the group -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- for inviting Mr. Gorbachev to a meeting in London outside the formal conference.
In Tokyo today, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said at a joint news conference that they would not object to such a proposal.
On Monday, in a commencement speech at Yale University, Mr. Bush announced that he would extend China's "most favored nation" status, which guarantees the best available tariff rates, for another year. The announcement drew immediate criticism from lawmakers, including Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bush will give the commencement address at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said Mr. Bush would unveil "a new initiative for combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, beginning in the Middle East."
Mr. Fitzwater provided no details, but Administration officials have said they have prepared a plan that would bar Israel from producing material for nuclear weapons, require Arab nations to give up their chemical weapons, ban ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 90 miles and require the five permament members of the United Nations Security Council to notify each other of sales of conventional arms to the region.
Besides the obstacles posed by regional politics to any arms control proposal for the Middle East, China also appears to be a problem for the Bush Administration in its efforts to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The United States has accused the Chinese of selling missile technology to Pakistan, and Beijing also has supplied Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran.

China Praises Bush on Trade
 BEIJING, May 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Government indirectly thanked President Bush today for his recommendation to extend China's trade privileges.
The Government also offered a subdued criticism of Mr. Bush's decision to impose new restrictions on the sale of missile technology to China. It expressed regret at the new sanctions, which were imposed partly because of concerns about Chinese arms sales to third-world countries.
But the most important decision was the recommendation to continue "most favored nation" trade benefits without any conditions. "This is a realistic and wise decision for which the Chinese Government would like to express its appreciation," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

HEADLINE: North Korea Reluctantly Seeks U.N. Seat

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 28

 BODY:
In a major policy reversal that appears intended to stem its growing diplomatic isolation, North Korea said today that it would apply for separate membership in the United Nations, paving the way for both North and South to join the world organization for the first time.
The surprise announcement, monitored in Tokyo, marked a major victory for the South Korean Government of President Roh Tae Woo. Mr. Roh has been courting Moscow and Beijing, historically the North's two patrons, to support South Korea's entry to the United Nations. For decades, North Korea has fiercely opposed separate membership, saying it would amount to international ratification of the 46-year partition of the Korean Peninsula. 
 Ever since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the North has insisted that it is the true Government of Korea, though it has held open the possibility that it could share a seat at the United Nations in rotation with the South.
But in recent weeks the Soviet Union made it clear that it would no longer aid North Korea by using its permanent seat on the Security Council to veto Seoul's application for a separate, independent membership. And it is widely suspected that China sent the same message when its Prime Minister, Li Peng, visited Pyongyang earlier this month. [The United States said it would support bids by the North and the South, Reuters reported.]
Currently, North and South Korea have only observer status at the United Nations, with no voting power.
 
No Room for Options
 North Korea's decision was announced in a bitterly worded statement that acknowledged that its hand had been forced.
"As the South Korean authorities insist on their unilateral U.N. membership, if we leave this alone important issues related to the interests of the entire Korean nation would be dealt with in a biased manner on the U.N. rostrum," the statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry said. "We cannot let it go that way."
The announcement was met with jubilation in Seoul, where officials said it was the first clear sign that North Korea's leadership was changing its policies in response to increasing apprehension about its international isolation. But the South Korean Government was careful not to appear triumphant, saying only that the move would provide a chance to "cement peace and insure stability" in Asia.
"Their economy is falling apart and they realize they no longer have anyone to turn to," a Japanese diplomat said of the North the other day, adding that Kim Il Sung, the North Korean President, "is running out of choices."
 
Question of Nuclear Technology
 What appears to have been decisive in moving Pyongyang, however, is Mr. Roh's overtures to the North's traditional allies. In April, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev became the first Soviet leader to visit South Korea. Mr. Gorbachev is negotiating for South Korea's help with his own battered economy, and seemed willing to back Seoul's application to the United Nations even if it meant poisoning relations with the North, which accuses him of selling out to capitalism.
It is unclear how United Nations membership would affect one of the most sensitive issues on the Korean Peninsula today: Growing evidence that North Korea is amassing the technology to build nuclear weapons.
So far, the North has refused to allow international inspection of a nuclear complex it is building north of Pyongyang, in an area called Yongbyong. Satellite photographs suggest that the installation is designed to produce weapons-grade nuclear fuel.
North Korea is already a signer of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which obliges nations to undergo inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. If it tries to join the United Nations, North Korea could face more pressure to accept inspection.
With both Koreas as full members, the United Nations may become a forum for talks between the two countries. The South Korean foreign ministry said tonight that simultaneous entry was a "provisional measure" before the unification of the two Koreas, but that day still seemed distant to most officials in Seoul.

HEADLINE: Macy Loses $100.9 Million In Quarter

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Describing its results as "unsatisfactory" and vowing to take steps to bolster sales, R. H. Macy & Company yesterday reported a loss of $100.9 million for the quarter ended May 4. It was the largest quarterly loss for the company in nearly three years.
In the corresponding quarter of last year, Macy's loss was $63.1 million. 
 Macy said sales in the latest quarter declined 6.7 percent, to $1.39 billion from $1.49 billion. That decrease was somewhat smaller than the declines earlier in the fiscal year. For the nine months, sales fell 9 percent, to $5.13 billion from $5.64 billion.
Sales in stores at least a year old were down 6.3 percent, while for the nine months they were off 9.2 percent. Such "same store" sales are considered a truer barometer of a retailer's performance than overall sales, which include results from new stores.
In a letter to its investors, released yesterday by the company, Macy's management said it considered "our results to be unsatisfactory," and added, "While the sluggish economy in the Northeast and unsettled conditions in the Middle East were contributing factors, we recognize that increased sales volume holds the key to improved bottom-line performance."
A Macy spokesman said that besides the sales decline, the loss reflected the cost of investing in new technology and the expenses of increased marketing efforts, including a new television advertising campaign. Macy recently announced a $150 million television campaign and said it would promote the Macy name as a "brand," in the manner of McDonald's and Coca-Cola. It also plans an aggressive promotion of its credit cards intended to attract another 100,000 regular customers.
But some analysts said the huge loss was jarring, especially in light of a series of ambitious plans Macy announced to suppliers last week. The New York-based company said then that it planned to open 11 stores, renovate a number of others and increase its sales by $3.6 billion, or 41.5 percent, in the next five years.
"In addition to its sales drop, Macy's had very large markdowns in the quarter in order to promote its business," said Walter F. Loeb, an independent New York securities analyst. "I am concerned about Macy's acceleration of store openings at a time when it is so important to gain existing-store productivity. But even with an increase in its losses, I still think that Macy has a unique ability to merchandise itself out of its problems and generate higher profits."
 
Analyst Expresses Surprise
 Another independent New York retail analyst, Kurt Barnard, said the big loss was surprising, adding that it was "a direct result of high expenses and insufficient sales volume."
Macy is not the only retailer reporting disappointing results. Other large retailers, including the May Department Stores, the Dayton Hudson Corporation and the Limited, have reported earnings declines in the quarter ended in May, but none reported losses. Macy's, with a Manhattan flagship store, operates its biggest store group, the Northeast division, in states in which the recession is worse than in much of the rest of the nation.
Macy said its operating earnings fell to $10 million in the most recent quarter, from $89.5 million a year earlier. The figures do not reflect taxes and interest payments or the charge for costs connected to the sale of its credit card operations. About $25 million of the net loss in the most recent quarter came from costs of selling those operations to a subsidiary of the General Electric Company.
 
Shifting Sentiments
 Sentiment regarding Macy, among both bond investors and clothing makers, was heavily negative last fall but improved considerably earlier this year after the institutions that own most of Macy agreed to buy more stock, providing money for an ambitious debt-retirement program. Macy bond prices dropped yesterday after the results were announced, but there was little if any trading, according to bond traders. The bond prices remain far above the autumn levels.
Macy still has long-term debt of $3.4 billion, despite large reductions from the bond-repurchase program. Because Macy repurchased the bonds for less than face value, it was able to report extraordinary gains on the transactions, including $15.4 million in the most recent quarter and $110.9 million for the nine months. The nine-months gain cut the net loss to $79.4 million for the period, compared with $135.3 million in the corresponding period of last year.
Over all, the net loss for the quarter was the largest since the company posted a deficit of $161.4 million in the quarter ended July 30, 1988. That loss was inflated by costs connected with the acquisition that year of the Bullocks and I. Magnin chains from Federated Department Stores.

HEADLINE: U.S. Responds Coolly To Overture From Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it would not move to improve relations with Iran until Teheran used its influence to obtain the release of six American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
Senior Administration officials greeted commitments by senior Iranian leaders to seek closer ties with both their Arab neighbors and the West with varying degrees of skepticism and little enthusiasm. They said it was premature to consider modifying American policy toward Iran. Washington has made any improvement in relations contingent on release of the hostages. 
 Some American officials, including the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, gave no indication that the United States was eager for a better relationship with Teheran, repeating the longstanding condition that Iran end its support for international terrorism.
 
'A New Order'
 Other senior officials offered a more nuanced interpretation that took into account a series of actions in Teheran, saying remarks by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and other officials about "a new order" based more on economic development than political goals were both positive and encouraging.
"If Iran wants to re-emerge as a full member of the community of nations, it knows well what it is expected to do," Miss Tutwiler said, using virtually the same words she has used to characterize relations with Teheran in the past. "First and foremost, Iran must take action to end its support for international terrorism and hostage-taking."
When asked whether the United States believed that Iran held the key to the release of the hostages, Miss Tutwiler replied, "All those who have influence should bring influence to bear, and obviously, it goes without question Iran has influence."
 
'Not Going to Run After It'
 Reflecting the more positive view in the Administration, one senior official said: "There is a general, although not universal pattern of restraint in Iranian foreign policy, and one sees an effort by Iran to reduce its self-imposed isolation. We are open to a better relationship but we are not going to run after it. And the question of the hostages and terrorism is still out there."
Independent scholars on Iran said they had hoped that the Administration would respond to the policy articulated by Iranian officials at the start of an international oil conference in Isfahan on Monday with a conciliatory move.
"One could have seized on this opportunity to make some small gesture toward the Iranians," said Patrick Clawson, an economist and expert on both Iran and Iraq at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. "The United States could have said that it is pleased to see Iran moving toward a more market-based economy and more realistic economic policies and that we hope that this moderation will carry over into the political sphere as well. Even better, the United States could do what is inevitable and remove all restrictions on Iranian exports of oil to the United States."
Currently, Iran is allowed to export oil to the United States only if the revenues are used to pay companies to which Iran owes money or are placed in a special fund set up to pay off claims against Iran.
The Iranian strategy involves a commitment to use foreign credit and expertise and closer relations with Western and Arab governments.
Iran has taken a number of steps since the crisis in the Persian Gulf to moderate its behavior. During the gulf conflict, Administration officials gave Iran the benefit of the doubt, consistently portraying its leaders as responsible players who would not take Iraq's side. The United States repeatedly stated publicly that they believed Iran's assurances that it would not violate the embargo against Iraq, that it would not return more than 120 Iraqi planes sent to Iran during the war and that it would not get directly involved in unrest in southern Iraq.
Since then, Iran has re-established diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, and Egypt and Iran have opened interests sections in each other's capitals. Iran has also promised that its 110,000 pilgrims will not disrupt the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which starts next month.
In an effort to encourage foreign investment, Iran has decreed, for example, that foreign companies can control 49 rather than 35 percent of joint ventures, and that these ventures can be administered by foreigners.

Ameritech To Acquire Cybertel

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 28

 BODY:
The Ameritech Corporation, the regional Bell operating company based here, said today that it would pay $512 million to acquire Cybertel, one of the two companies providing cellular telephone service in St. Louis.
The transaction should provide higher growth opportunities for Ameritech. Its principal business, providing local phone service in five Midwestern states, is viewed by the investment community as a slow-growth utility. 
 It also provides further evidence that prices in the volatile cellular phone business are stabilizing. Prices for cellular systems were soaring, peaking last year with the acquisition of Lin Broadcasting by McCaw Cellular Communications for more than $350 a potential cellular customer. The deal announced today is for $195 a potential customer, which puts it in line with other large recent transactions, like the announced sale of Metromedia's cellular business in Philadelphia to Comcast for $193 a potential customer.
 
Cash for the Sellers
 Finally, the deal will provide a huge injection of cash to Cybertel's principal owners -- the partners of JMB Realty, the big Chicago-based builder, who acquired the majority stake in Cybertel in early 1987. Although JMB is one of the world's most successful property developers, like others in the business in the current recession it has seen the value of some of its properties decline.
JMB denied having any cash problems, but said it was selling to raise cash to take advantage of buying opportunities in the depressed real estate market.
Current real estate buying opportunities, particularly for regional shopping malls, "might not re-present themselves for a long time," said Gary Nickele, a JMB senior vice president. The current shortage of bank financing for real estate has squeezed out many buyers.
Although Ameritech did not release many details about Cybertel, Wall Street telecommunications analysts estimated that the company might have signed up 40,000 cellular customers in St. Louis, or close to 2 percent of the 2.1 million potential customers. That would represent a more than 10 percent expansion in cellular business for Ameritech, which already has 370,000 cellular customers in five states, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. Cybertel competes against the St. Louis cellular system of Southwestern Bell, another regional Bell company.
In terms of potential customers, Ameritech will jump to sixth largest, from eighth. McCaw-Lin is the biggest; GTE/Contel, the second largest; Pactel, the third; BellSouth, the fourth, Southwestern Bell, the fifth. Ameritech already serves Chicago and Detroit, which are third and fifth, respectively, in terms of potential customers. St. Louis is 11th. Last year, Ameritech acquired the New Zealand telephone company, which also offers cellular service.
"A number of Bell companies have decided to bite the bullet on earnings to acquire a high growth business that they believe will generate above- average earnings," said Ken Leon of Bear, Stearns, who estimated that Americtech's acquisition of Cybertel would reduce earnings per share by about 20 cents a share in 1992. Analysts had expected the company to earn about $5 a share. Mr. Leon continued, "We would agree with that position emphatically."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Moves Lower While the Mark Advances

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, brought lower by the strength of the German mark against other leading currencies.
Analysts said much of yesterday's foreign exchange activity centered on the mark, which advanced on expectations that German interest rates would remain stable despite the change in leadership at the Bundesbank. 
 The German finance ministry said yesterday that Helmut Schlesinger, a Bundesbank vice president, had been named to replace Karl Otto Pohl as the central bank's chief. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet is to formally approve Mr. Schlesinger's appointment at a meeting on June 12.
Traders believed that Mr. Schlesinger "obviously is someone who will keep rates firm," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York Company.
The mark, like all currencies, is supported by higher interest rates. The prospect for stable rates increases demand for German securities and, in turn, the mark.
The dollar fell to 1.6938 marks in New York from Friday's 1.70375. United States financial markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day.
In earlier European trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.6975 marks from 1.7029.
Traders also sold dollars to adjust their holdings in advance of today's scheduled release of second-quarter gross national product figures. The market expected further weakness in the economy and a possible decline in United States interest rates.
The dollar fell to 137.48 Japanese yen in New York, from 138.33 yen late Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.17 yen, to a closing 138.35 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 137.85 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.7490 in New York from late Friday's $1.7345. In London, sterling rose to $1.7450, from $1.7355 late Monday in Frankfurt. London markets were closed for a holiday Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.4440 Swiss francs, down from 1.4513; 5.7540 French francs, down from 5.7920; 1,260.00 Italian lire, down from 1,268.25, and 1.14655 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14925.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late on Monday, included: 1.4455 Swiss francs, down from 1.4495; 5.7675 French francs, down from 5.7885, and 1,262.75 Italian lire, down from 1,266.50.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Chief Gives Staff Tough Talk

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M.'s chairman read some of his managers the riot act earlier this month, saying the company had "too many people standing around the water cooler waiting to be told what to do," according to notes of his remarks obtained yesterday.
Asserting that most divisions had failed to grow with the market in the first quarter, John F. Akers, chairman and chief executive of the International Business Machines Corporation, gave a stinging internal review of the computer maker's progress in restructuring business activities in an informal talk before some of the company's fast-rising managers. 
 Notes from the unusually hard-hitting talk, taken by one manager, were distributed widely throughout I.B.M. on an electronic message system and have since touched off a broad debate inside the company.
 
Criticizes Excuses
 Mr. Akers said the company could make any number of excuses, ranging from the quality of its mainframes to the supply of its PS/2 personal computers or to organizational changes in the United States, "but the fact of the matter is they are all excuses."
The company has too many sales representatives "popping out for coffee with their customer and calling it a call," the notes quote him as saying.
"The tension level is not high enough in the business -- everyone is too damn comfortable at a time when the business is in crisis."
A company spokesman said the notes were authentic, but cautioned that it was not the first time that I.B.M.'s chairman had made such remarks and that he could not confirm the accuracy of any specific quotes.
The memorandum has touched off an extensive internal I.B.M. discussion carried out on a computer conferencing system over who is to blame for I.B.M.'s woes. Several I.B.M. employees said that in responding to the memorandum, a number of employees had blamed Mr. Akers for many of the company's problems.
 
Reshaping the Business
 In the face of changing technology and rising competition, the computer maker, based in Armonk, N.Y., has been trying to reshape its business for five years by cutting costs and giving employees incentives to leave. In December 1989 it accelerated its cost cutting by announcing that it planned to reduce its domestic work force by more than 10,000 and taking a $2.3 billion charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
"This is not the first time I've heard this message," said Peter Thonis, an I.B.M. spokesman. "This has been the tone in the company for the last six months or so. Mr. Akers has been delivering this message for some time."
Mr. Thonis said Mr. Akers had been speaking about I.B.M.'s business difficulties widely within the company and was eager that the message got out to employees.
Mr. Akers was quoted as saying, "I'm sick and tired of visiting plants to hear nothing but great things about quality and cycle time, and then to visit customers who tell me of problems."
 
'Not a Happy Man'
 The remarks were made to an I.B.M. management class and the note taker, who was not identified, said: "Akers is not a happy man. He didn't pull any punches. In the spirit of his concern on filtered communications, I left with a real sense of obligation to spread his word."
Mr. Akers told the management class that he had known that the first quarter of 1991 would be difficult as early as last November but that he had been surprised with the "magnitude" of the financial decline.
In April, the company reported its operating earnings had plunged 48.7 percent while its revenue fell 4.5 percent during the first quarter. The report, which surprised Wall Street analysts, caused the company's stock to plunge $12.75.
The chairman said he wanted the company to focus on its "knitting," the business of making and selling computers and that he wanted to hear less about community/social activities, even though they were important to the company.
 
Calls for 'Street Fighting'
 He said he had urged his executives to get the message across to their workers immediately and that market share loss in any sector of the business would not be tolerated.
"In these times, the tone and mood needs to be tough no-nonsense street fighting," the memorandum said.
Mr. Akers said that the economy in Europe was in better condition than the United States, but that the company's European competitors -- including ICL, Philips and Olivetti -- were "flat on their face."
He said, however, that although I.B.M. was increasingly being viewed as a European company, the business benefits of such a change had not yet become visible.
He said that the company was continuing to do extremely well except in Japan, where it has been losing market share for a couple of years. The memorandum said that he called first quarter 1991 results in Japan "disastrous."
He called the performance of the company's United States business unsatisfactory and said that although the company had shed 5,000 people there had been no evidence in terms of financial return.
"Where's the beef?" the memo asked. "What the hell are you doing for 'me'?"
Mr. Akers told the class that normally after the company's annual meeting he would take a couple of vacation days to "recover," but that he had chosen not to this year because of the business situation.
The company still has too many employees attending to its large accounts, he said. Mr. Akers said that he had recently received a letter from an account executive saying that his head count had dropped from 22 to 16 and that revenue had dropped from $35 million to $25 million, but Mr. Akers said that even 16 were not needed.

HEADLINE: Deflating the Post-Gulf Balloon

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumer spirits, which roared back at the end of the gulf war, are receding as postwar euphoria gives way to the realities of recession.
Those who expected spending to snap back as fast -- or as robustly -- as sentiment after the war, have been disappointed. While the worst of the economy's slide may be over, there is no clear evidence yet that the economy as a whole is expanding. 
 Instead, there are scattered signs that the consumer spending drop is mostly over -- notably in housing. Yesterday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in April rose 3.4 percent, the third straight rise. [Page D2.]
 
'Dancing in the Streets'
 "We got dancing in the streets when the war was over," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "That is giving way to a somewhat more sober assessment." The board's survey of consumer attitudes, conducted in the first weeks of every month, covers 5,000 households in the United States.
The closely watched Conference Board index of consumer confidence registered its second straight monthly decline in May, to 74.2, from 79.4 in April and 81.1 in March. The March reading, up from a low of 55.1 in January, was the index's highest since the start of the recession last July.
The confidence index combines two main measures. One reflects how consumers feel about their present circumstances, and the other charts their expectations about their own financial circumstances. The expectations measure, though lower in May, remained relatively hopeful. The expectations data often foreshadow changes in consumer spending.
Another survey, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment, also showed a decline in May. According to a preliminary report, the Michigan index dropped from 81.8 in April to 78.2. Its results have generally mirrored those of the Conference Board this year.
Declining confidence, Mr. Linden said, can mostly be traced to increasing gloom about consumers' current situation, namely rising fears of joblessness.
After the war's end lifted consumers' moods, most economists pointed out that a revival of spending must wait for layoffs to end and incomes to rise. Most did not expect that to happen before summer.
Although consumers were not as bullish about the future as they were in March, Ira A. Silver. the J. C. Penney Company's chief economist, said consumers were much more hopeful than they were last January when expectations reached a 10-year nadir. The Conference Board's expectations measure stood at 93.5 for May compared with 100.7 in March. In January expectations hit a low of 55.3. "Expectations are thumping along at a decent level," said Mr. Linden of the Conference Board.
Moreover, consumers are more optimistic now than when the last couple of recessions hit their low points, according to Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. At the bottom of the 1981-82 recession, the Conference Board's expectations index, now just under 94, stood at 84.7, while in March 1975 it languished below 88.9. "If there is another decline in June, we'll start worrying," Mr. Silver said. "But we're not worried yet."
Forecasters expect consumer spending, which dropped more sharply in this recession than in any other except the 1973-75 downturn, to stabilize in the quarter that ends in June.
The latest signs show a consumer sector that is bottoming out -- but hardly bounding back.
Sales of existing homes in April were the highest since last August. A gain in sales of new and existing homes has started to lure appliance buyers into stores, said Richard Hagenauer, a market analyst at the Whirlpool Corporation. Direct sales of appliances to builders will not rise until more new homes are completed, which usually happens three to six months after housing starts turn around.
Reed-Lallier Chevrolet near Fort Bragg, N.C., sold 65 cars and trucks over the Memorial Day weekend, half again as many as a year ago. Fort Bragg, which is the home of the Army's 82d Airborne Division, saw its business roar back in late March when the troops came home, and sales have continued to be brisk since.
Nationally, car sales crept up in May but were still well below January's depressed levels.
Department stores, meanwhile, are turning in mixed results.
Traffic and sales at the K Mart Corporation are up. "We've seen the bottom, but we don't expect a real recovery in spending until the back-to-school season," said Robert E. Hayes, a member of K Mart's store planning group.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 44.95 to Close at 2,958.86

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Wall Street came to life late yesterday, but traders said there was little hard news to account for the broad rally.
Rumors that the Fed might cut interest rates further to stimulate the economy, and seemingly contradictory rumors that smart money is moving into cyclical stocks to take advantage of the coming economic upturn gave the market a big lift. The Dow Jones industrial average -- which began to rise around noon and kept gaining the rest of the day -- shot ahead 44.95 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,958.86. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange, advances led declines by almost 2 to 1. Seventy-eight stocks rose to 52-week highs; only seven dropped to lows.
The broader-based Standard & Poor's 500, which also started to climb around noon, gained 1.2 percent, and the smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite, advanced almost 1 percent.
Trading, which stood at a lethargic 123.5 million shares by 3 P.M., expanded in an unexplained rush to a respectable 162.4 million by the 4 P.M. close.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said very little selling coupled with repeated waves of computer-driven buying -- almost all of it in the late afternoon -- had lifted the Dow 22 points.
Traders pointed to the low level of selling as a big reason that the market had responded so well to the heavy buying.
There were, nevertheless, signs that the economy might be on the mend. The National Association of Realtors, citing low mortgage rates, said sales of existing homes jumped 3.4 percent in April, the third straight monthly rise.
And Wayne Atwell, metals analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said that while there was nothing fundamental to account for yesterday's rise in metals stocks, "the market appears to have rotated into metals shares in anticipation of a recovery in the economy."
 
Advantage to Metals
 Steel, copper and aluminum would benefit from an upturn.
Stock traders often give the bond market most of the credit for lifting stock prices because stocks typically respond extremely well to low interest rates. But surprisingly yesterday several traders pointedly said they did not want to fall back on that reason but were unable to come up with a better one.
"The word going around is that smart money is going into cyclicals," said David S. Chao, head trader in New York for County NatWest Securities."
He mentioned stocks like Caterpillar, up 1 3/8, to 47 5/8; Deere, up 1 3/4, to 52; Ingersoll-Rand, up 2 1/8, to 48 1/2; Reynolds Metals, up 3 1/8, to 61 1/4, and International Paper, up 1 5/8, to 65 3/8.
"There's a rumor around that the Fed will cut the discount rate again," said Richard G. Unruh, chief investment officer for Delaware Investment Advisors, with $18 billion in pension fund and mutual fund investments.
 
Rumor About Cyclicals
 But when told of the cyclicals rumor, he said, "We've already made that move consistently for the last two months."
He said that since the final quarter of 1988, when it become "obvious" that the economy was starting to slow, investors "gravitated toward the safe stocks." He described them as the big consumer stocks with a high degree of predictability of earnings, like Coca-Cola, General Mills and Philip Morris.
That, he said, has been driving the market until recently and "now, as people are starting to think the economy is beginning to come out of the recession, people want stocks with more leverage to the economy."
He mentioned J. C. Penney, K Mart, General Motors, paper stocks like Union Camp, Federal Paper Board and Weyerhaeuser, some manufacturing companies like Deere and Eaton and some chemical companies like Du Pont and Dow Chemical.
Mr. Unruh said he thought metal shares would come "a little later in the cycle."
 
No Straight Lines
 Describing the move into cyclicals as a change in leadership, he said: "Our guess is this change will continue. But it's not a straight line; it could be a bumpy road. When the baton is passed, sometimes it's dropped."
Gold shares were strong, along with metals, but Newmont Gold, 90 percent owned by Newmont Mining, rose 3 1/4, to 37 3/8. Newmont Mining, rising 2 3/4, to 36 1/8, announced with American Barrick Resources that the two metals companies were discussing exchanging stock in a merger that might include Newmont Gold.
Potlatch, the paper company, sank 4 1/4, to 41 1/2, after rising 7 1/4 last week on wild rumors of a takeover by International Paper. Neither would comment but Wall Street people thought to be familiar with the two said the idea seemed unlikely. Potlatch said it was not for sale.
I.B.M., which traded as low as 103 5/8, rose 1/8, to 105 1/8, but other technology stocks were much stronger. Intel rose 2 1/4, to 53 1/4; Hewlett-Packard 1 7/8, to 52 7/8; Borland 1 3/8, to 53 1/2, and Motorola 1 3/4, to 70 1/8.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Tokyo Stock Gain
 TOKYO, Wednesday, May 29 (Reuters) -- Stock prices in Tokyo advanced today with a heavy turnover. At the close of trading, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 104.74 points, or slighlty more than four-tenths of a percent, to 25,495.41.

HEADLINE: Dos and Don'ts of Office Etiquette: Has Rudeness Gotten Out of Hand?

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
YOU'RE standing in the back of a crowded elevator. The elevator stops at your floor and you say "Excuse me," but the people toward the front of the car don't budge. Do you shriek "getting off" and elbow your way to the front or meekly ride to the next floor?
A co-worker has the phone to his ear and his eyes on the computer screen. Should you hover over the desk and thumb through the morning paper or just plunge right into conversation? 
 Your child needs a set of No. 2 pencils for school and the stationery store has none. Why not take a batch from office supplies?
The situations illustrate how the atmosphere in the workplace has changed from one of formality to one of laissez faire.
Dr. Abraham Zaleznik, a psychoanalyst and the Matsushita professor emeritus of leadership at the Harvard business school, traces the changes to the 1960's when traditional values and manners came under fire.
"Corporate America experimented with the idea that letting it all hang out was a means of achieving harmony in the office," Dr. Zaleznik said. "Then came the computer culture and a new wave of authority in which corporations were encouraged to be less hierarchical and more egalitarian, which was supposed to increase participation in the organization by producing a higher comfort level by eliminating or minimizing symbols of authority."
The results were a more informal workplace where everyone, from the chairman down to the receptionist, was on a first-name basis; where employees shared everything from the workload to lunch; where jeans with jackets and ties were as commonplace as three-piece suits. But somehow familiarity began to breed contempt.
"Whenever I'd address my boss, he'd always say, 'What?' " said a paralegal who works in a midtown Manhattan law firm. "Once, he called upon me and I responded the same way, with a 'What?' and he accused me of sounding hostile."
Employers and employees alike are reluctant to talk about office problems or to criticize colleagues. But privately, both sides complain that things have gotten out of hand.
Among the most commonly voiced gripes about both managers and employees were these: starting the day with a request (or a demand) rather than with a good morning, viewing an open door as an invitation to walk in and sit down, routinely leaving desks or offices without informing anyone of whereabouts, dropping trash on the floor and leaving it for the maintenance crew to clean it up and believing that paychecks are compensation enough and that there is no need for pleases and thank-yous for jobs done or services requested.
Letitia Baldrige, one of America's leading arbiters of manners, found bad manners and oafishness so widespread in large corporations in the early 1980's that she wrote "Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to Executive Manners" (Rawson Associates, 1985).
"There were a lot of self-help books telling you how to get rich," she recalled in a recent telephone interview from her Washington office. "There was nothing to tell you how to behave on your way there."
In 1983, upon releasing his book "The New Office Etiquette" (Poseidon Press), George Mazzei, said: "There has been a breakdown in business manners and people are realizing they can no longer deal with the constant rudeness which became a part of the business world when crude young people became superstars."
In a recent interview, Mr. Mazzei, a former journalist, said people have now grown accustomed to such rudeness. Mr. Mazzei went on: "The whole point of etiquette is to enable people to cope with a situation that is difficult in a tolerable way and to help you enjoy your job. Right now, the only career value that means anything to certain executives is the bottom line." The puzzle is what can be done to change things.
Judith Martin, the syndicated columnist who writes the "Miss Manners" column, said: "The opposite of manners is not informality. The problem is, and it is not confined to the business world, that there is a lessening commitment to the idea of good manners."
The situation has created considerable confusion in the workplace.
"People can't really tell their friends from their business associates, but people who are thrown together for business purposes are your colleagues," Miss Martin said. "There are misunderstandings that result from this, like the person who is hit by the 15th office collection for someone they hardly know."
Lois Tansey, director of advisory services for the Ethics Resource Center, a Washington-based nonprofit group that works to build society's ethical foundation said that for the best reasons, managers don't want to enforce arbitrary values on people.
"So there are those people who think their own personal values are just fine," she said.
"When businesses moved toward more informal structure and empowering workers, it was fine," she went on. "But perhaps it's gone a bit too far. Now businesses are setting higher standards for themselves and their employees."
Ms. Baldrige agreed, saying, "I'm getting calls all the time now, four or five calls a day, from corporations requesting seminars. Employees are dying for values, manners. This is the antithesis to the greed of the 1980's, a reaction to it. The recession and the Persian Gulf war have helped us think about these human values."
In her seminars, Ms. Baldrige encourages employers to speak out on issues of manners or include tips in the company newsletter.
She also advises employers to reward employees for doing something kind or nice for fellow employees or for helping someone out.
Still, the subject of manners is given only cursory study by most professional business schools and colleges. An exception is the Katharine Gibbs School, now celebrating its 80th year.
Teaching professional and personal etiquette is necessary, "but it just doesn't happen," said Dr. Jim Otten, the school's director.
"We still have a dress code, not only for clothing, but hair, makeup, nails and perfume," he said. "In terms of business etiquette, we address this in numerous courses in office procedure, professional development, business language and speech."
Earlier this month, 92 De Paul University students received a lesson in corporate etiquette when the school gave an etiquette dinner at the Drake Hotel in Chicago to help students prepare for business meals.
"We chose the menu with difficulty in mind, to give students experience in situations they may not have considered," said Jane A. McGrath, De Paul's director of career planning and placement. (Like how to dispose of fish bones, the dinner's main course.) "Competition for jobs is fierce and the little things can make the students stand out."
The students were advised to avoid discussing argument-provoking subjects like war and religion during business socials, not move around the room while holding a cigarette or a cigar and to be polite, even to someone who annoyed them.
So what should a person do on a crowded elevator? How do you approach a colleague who appears to be busy? Is it ever proper to take extra office supplies? Here is some advice:
Regarding elevator etiquette, Ms. Baldrige advises: "Everyone at the very front of a crowded car should automatically get off when the doors open, even if they are not at their destination floor.
"The people behind cannot possibly emerge with ease if the people in front do not exit to give them enough room to move."
Ms. Baldrige notes that if someone comes to your desk and you are on the telephone or engrossed in your work trying to meet a deadline, you should make a quick nod of acknowledgement and say something like: "Glad to see you; be with you in a minute," or wave the visitor into a seat by your desk. On the other hand, the visitor should stick a note on the desk or telephone, saying "please call me." "But don't pressure people."
When it comes to taking home some office supplies, the experts agree: Avoid the temptation and just say "no," thank you.
 
 
 
DEAR LADIES AND GENTS
 ETIQUETTE mavens say good manners mean good business. Here is some advice from the experts on what constitutes proper business manners:
"Suitable office manners are exactly those a responsible worker uses toward his or her own family or potential family member while on the job." -- Judith Martin, "Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium" (Pharos Books Scripps Howard+ , 1989).
 "If you stop and think about whether or not you should use a person's first name when you greet him, the answer is you should not. Familiarity does indeed breed contempt. No one likes to be addressed by his or her first name by someone who doesn't have the right to do so." -- "Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to Executive Manners" (Rawson Associates, 1985).
 "Remember to thank the little people who do all the work on a major event -- such as arranging the travel, making audiovisuals for a presentation, copying necessary materials, organizing large conferences or corporate parties. The kind recognition should be on the record -- via personal letters to the people involved, in verbal salute in front of the group, or in a tribute published in the company magazine. -- "Letitia Baldrige's Complete Guide to the New Manners for the '90s" (Rawson Associates, 1990).
 "Respect someone else's physical space and property; live by the old golden rule in life to regard others the way you want to be regarded."-- Dr. Abraham Zaleznik,
Matsushita professor emeritus of leadership at the Harvard Business School.

The War Against Misery at Home

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Bill Moyers says that as he walked to work in New York City during the ground war in the Persian Gulf, his attention was drawn to what he calls the paradox of America achieving victory across the seas while the numbers of the defeated at home keep growing. "The Home Front," tonight at 9 on Channel 13, carries the faces of defeat amid the bulletins of victory.
Although most of what is reported here is familiar from months of coverage on national and local news programs, the miseries of unemployment and homelessness, of cutbacks in schools, hospitals and shelters, continue to resonate. Mr. Moyers makes a sympathetic listener, and the accounts are moving. "I'm a disposable American," says a 55-year-old man who once earned $50,000 a year and now, after months out of work, is reduced to selling jokey hats in a flea market. 
 Such experiences are juxtaposed with radio and television dispatches from the Gulf. President Bush's voice is heard frequently. The technique is not subtle. You hear a correspondent reporting, "The country of Kuwait is burning," and the camera goes to a fire in Queens, where two deaths are laid to the closing of a firehouse. The efficient medical care given to a wounded soldier is contrasted with the overworked emergency room of Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.
Since Mr. Moyers is not arguing that the United States should not have sent troops to the Gulf and is not blaming the recession on the war, the backs-and-forths seem mainly rhetorical. The soft point of the program is that life would be better if the sort of energy, dedication and dollars invested in saving Kuwait were invested in saving America's cities. Mr. Moyers asks, "When will we find the same will and resources to win the war here on the home front?" Not an original question, but one that has to keep being asked as long as the pain reported on here continues.

The Home Front
 
Produced and directed by Marc Levin; Daphne Pinkerson and Mi Ling Tsui, associate producers; Alan Miller, editor; Judith Davidson Moyers, executive producer. At 9 tonight on Channel 13.

HEADLINE: Albany Makes a Bad Year Worse

 BODY:
This year's annual spring spectacle in Albany produced a new definition of political irresponsibility. Not only is the new budget agreement a record eight weeks late, the delay cost cities and towns millions of unnecessary dollars because they had to borrow to make up for absent state aid.
And what was it all for? Not much. What's known about the budget agreement so far shows that it makes few fundamental changes in the way the state operates and delivers services and doesn't address New York City's fiscal crisis except by doling out the bare minimum aid the city needs. That will force New York to fight its way to fiscal health without the active participation of its unofficial partner, the state. 
 The reason for Albany's abdication is cowardice. Legislators simply could not face up to their uncomfortable job of doling out pain instead of budget goodies. Despite blatant evidence of the state's economic trouble, too many lawmakers stubbornly refused to concede that business as usual doesn't apply in a recession.
As they might have in any other year, they rejected an unpopular tax, like Gov. Mario Cuomo's proposed 10-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, and instead passed a smaller "hidden" gas tax by increasing the tax on petroleum importers. They also imposed sales taxes on such narrow items as non-custom computer software and telephone answering services. Once again, legislators stitched together a patchwork of solutions, including non-recurring revenues, rather than make the hard choice of selecting unpopular but broad-based and progressive revenue measures.
The worst offender -- the Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino of Long Island -- insisted on his regular budget demands, especially school aid for suburban districts like his own. He played a negative role, saying no to a gas tax and higher income tax. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller at least came up with a plan, mainly a call for an income tax increase, but never quite got his numbers together.
Governor Cuomo proposed a responsible budget but then dug in, providing the Legislature little leeway and even less leadership. He himself had ruled out a boost in the personal income tax, putting the fairest and broadest-based tax out of bounds.
The result was the 58-day morass, and the likelihood of a repeat performance next year.
Albany leaders could have used adversity to the state's advantage. Instead of simply cutting services, they could have changed the way they are delivered and found ways to do more with less. If they had joined forces with New York City and truly reshaped programs and services, from school aid to fiscal reforms, they could have benefited millions of New Yorkers and avoided a crisis atmosphere the next time a recession hits.

HEADLINE: How to Advance China's Freedom

 BODY:
We want to advance the cause of freedom, not just snub nations that aren't yet wholly free.
 
President Bush defined the right objective in his commencement address at Yale Monday. But he passed up a perfect opportunity to do something concrete about it. Had he coupled his decision to extend China's trade privileges with a strong human rights reporting requirement, Mr. Bush could have contributed to China's freedom and prosperity while upholding America's own democratic values. Congress now has a chance to correct the President's omission. 
 Day-to-day management of foreign relations is usually best left to the executive branch. But in China's case, U.S. trade law specifically invites Congressional review. Because China's economy is centrally planned, and its citizens are denied free emigration, Beijing needs an annual waiver to qualify for most-favored-nation treatment, allowing its products to enter U.S. markets with minimal tariffs. Congress has three months to reject or amend the President's request.
Mr. Bush's error is that he proposes to extend China's most-favored-nation status without addressing China's sorry record on human rights. But some human rights advocates in Congress go too far in the other direction by proposing highly specific, and highly unlikely, conditions for renewal. Punishing China's neo-Stalinist leadership may feel good but, as the President reminds Americans, the goal of policy is to encourage desirable changes.
There's little to be gained from punishing those forces in China most committed to economic and political change -- the traders, entrepreneurs and reformist intellectuals in Hong Kong and the special economic zones of the south China coast. It is in the interest of American and Chinese democrats to maintain the strength and influence of those forces in preparation for the succession crisis sure to erupt once the present octogenarian leadership passes from the scene.
Congress can make the best use of its review period by attaching reporting provisions to a renewal of most-favored-nation status. That way the President would have to give Congress an explicit accounting next year of Beijing's human rights record, specifically assessing progress on issues like emigration, political imprisonment and China's use of prison labor in export industries.
Even if China fell short of desired goals, Mr. Bush would still be free to recommend another renewal, based on his own overall judgment of Chinese developments. But he would have to justify that decision publicly in an election year.
Mr. Bush has responded reasonably to other complaints about China, threatening limited retaliation for copyright infringements and restricting exports of U.S. missile technology. But on human rights, he missed an obvious chance "to advance the cause of freedom." It's now up to Congress to set American policy on a more worthy course.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
A Time for Action

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
"The American taxpayer needs a rest," says Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Others may think that the taxpayer -- particularly the low-income taxpayer -- needs relief more than rest, just as a lagging economy needs stimulation more than deficit reduction.
 Neither relief nor stimulation is in sight, and Mr. Rostenkowski is only one reason. He told Robert Hershey of The New York Times that "the practice of annually rewriting the tax code . . . creates a tremendous uncertainty. We should not engage in political tax wars lightly." 
 Indeed not, but what's light about an economy in recession (machine tool orders, an important indicator, fell by a third from April 1990 to April 1991)? What's light about a school system that's not teaching, health care not provided, an infrastructure falling apart, and states and cities scrambling to balance budgets by closing libraries and swimming pools? Why not a "tax war" when the wages of two-thirds of American workers fell 12 percent in the last 15 years, to the level of the late 1950's, while the rich were getting richer?
 Mr. Rostenkowski's reluctance to tamper with taxes is not, however, as high a barrier to recovery as last year's disastrous budget agreement. That piece of collusion between the White House and Congress included, in the sacred cause of deficit reduction, a requirement that money saved in one budget area not be transferred to another area, and a second requirement that any tax change causing the Government to lose revenue be offset by equal revenue raised elsewhere.
 The first of these requirements means that money saved by cutting the military budget (after the collapse of Communism, there's no reason to call it a "defense" budget) may not be used for education or health care, etc., but only for deficit reduction or other military purposes. Robert Reich, the economist, wrote in a Times article recently that a 15 percent annual cut in current and planned military spending over the next decade would save $450 billion. But the budget agreement, as it stands, would prevent any of that sum from being transferred to meet the nation's most crying needs.
 The other requirement means that if the Democrats who control Congress could get up enough gumption to provide tax relief for those from the middle-to-lower end of the income scale, they'd have to make up the lost revenue by raising taxes somewhere else, presumably on the wealthy. After a decade of reducing the tax burden of the rich, that would be fair enough; but after that same decade, in which two Republican Presidents preached the iniquity of taxes, the evils of government and the glories of the market, don't hold your breath until a Democratic Congress takes that plunge.
 Actually, Mr. Reich pointed out, a Federal income tax with rates restored to the progressivity of 1978 would require "the top 10 percent of income earners to pay about $950 billion more than they'll otherwise pay in the 1990's." Put more brutally, that's the amount that the tax breaks of the Reagan years will profit the richest Americans in coming years, while the cities, the schools, highways and bridges and much of the remaining amenity of American life go to rack and ruin.
 Getting back to the progressivity of 1978, however, would require undoing the Reagan tax breaks for upper-income Americans. Not only would that violate Mr. Rostenkowski's uncertainty principle; it would cause the mother of all "political tax wars."
 Robert Hershey reported that for these and other reasons little possibility for sizable tax reduction exists this year, and only innocuous and revenue-neutral technical proposals are likely to be considered. Already in 1991, suggesting the prevailing atmosphere, the Democratic Congress has rejected a proposal by Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York to cut the onerous and regressive Social Security payroll tax, and to remove the $54,000 cap on income earners who have to pay it.
 Nevertheless, the recession calls for economic stimulation greater than small interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve, and the Democrats desperately need a strong political issue to take into the 1992 election. If those aren't reasons enough to act, what would be?

The Free Elections Trap

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Last Sunday, 87 percent of Georgian voters cast their ballots for Zviad Gamsakhurdia and independence from Moscow. On the same day, Saudi fundamentalists petitioned their King to broaden participation in government.
 The proliferating number of American Savonarolas who preach democracy as the salvation for U.S. foreign policy surely will rejoice at the news. The general sentiment is terrific, but its application at this time in the Soviet Union and the Middle East is highly questionable. 
 The danger is that the Savonarolas often reduce democracy to "free elections," and free elections can be a trap. They can legitimize would-be dictators as well as democrats.
 The U.S. does not want to be trapped into blanket endorsement of democratic means that can and will be used in many countries for undemocratic ends. Policy should focus not on free elections but on what makes free elections genuinely free -- namely a nation's political culture, political leadership and economic base.
 Hitler, of course, is the classic example of exploiting free elections and coalition-building to destroy democracy. Others in more recent memory gained or legitimized power through elections to the same end: Indira Gandhi in India, Sukarno in Indonesia, Lee Kwan Yew in Singapore and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. India and the Philippines rebounded, but how well and for how long?
 We have the case now of Mr. Gamsakhurdia and perhaps others like him in the crumbling Soviet Union. He may well turn out to be a democrat, but there are already troubling signs.
 His only commitment, it seems, is to establish Georgian independence from the Soviet Union. Two weeks ago Georgian police under his control burst into the headquarters of an opposition candidate. Only a week before the election, the Georgian parliament banned any statements that would injure Mr. Gamsakhurdia's "honor and dignity" and set a six-year prison term for violators. And of a Radio Liberty reporter who charged that soldiers had been used to intimidate voters, Mr. Gamsakhurdia said: "He deserves to be arrested."
 The American Savonarolas of democracy are quiet about these shortcomings. They think that self-determination and independence for the various Soviet republics is good for them and good for America. They think free elections are the proof of the people's will, and of democracy.
 A glance at Mr. Gamsakhurdia's slim record, however, suggests that his election may lead not to the birth of democracy in Georgia but to its prenatal demise. Georgians might well enjoy more freedoms under a reformist Gorbachev regime -- even without elections.
 Similar concerns should attend the new interest of Islamic fundamentalists in democracy. They have pressed for free elections in several Arab countries. Presenting themselves as protectors of the oppressed, they have done quite well in these elections, as they knew they would. But it is questionable that their real aim is to promote democracy.
 In Saudi Arabia, religious scholars and Muslim clergy asked King Fahd for a wider representation in government, protection of human rights and an end to corruption. Noble goals all, in the tradition of Islamic egalitarianism. But the same petition calls for revising Saudi laws to make them conform with Islamic teachings.
 Islam draws no line between religion and politics. As undemocratic as the present Saudi regime is, a total Islamic one -- even with broader political participation -- would be less free. It would leave no neutral public space where people's views are treated as opinions, not as truth. Elections would become trivial in that environment.
 It is more important for democratizing societies to have a free press than free elections. Today in most Islamic countries, free elections would produce fundamentalist victories and validate the imposition of theocracy. Today in most Soviet republics, free elections would result in nationalist control and may legitimize secular tyranny.
That is why the mullahs and many Soviet republic nationalists want elections, and why they equate elections and democracy. That is why the U.S. has to watch these new democrats very carefully. For otherwise we shall find ourselves outmaneuvered in our own noble enterprise.

HEADLINE: Malpractice Reform Is License for Negligence;
What Pharmacists Do

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is true, as Joseph A. Califano Jr. states (Op-Ed, May 14), that the days of mixing powders and potions by pharmacists are mostly gone. They were the simple days, because today the pharmacist is confronted with the more difficult task, which Mr. Califano mentions, of counseling about drug interactions.
However, he misses the point. The most critical time of the pharmacist's intervention is in reading the prescription. Only the pharmacist has the expertise and knowledge to decipher and evaluate the prescription, having spent at least five years in college to learn how. Many medicines have similar spelling, and a prescription could very possibly be mistaken for something else, which could be disastrous. 
 Mr. Califano states that mail-order houses do without the services of a pharmacist. This is far from true. Not only would it be against the law, but it would also be calamitous. Congress has investigated allegations about harm, and even death, to patients, caused by unscrupulous practices of mail-order houses.
Mr. Califano's assertion that pharmicists cause the price of drugs to be 3 to 10 times higher is absurd. According to the Lily Digest (a respected journal on pharmacy economics), the average pharmacy nets only about 3 percent, and a recent survey proves that it costs only about 2 cents extra a day to have a prescription filled at a neighborhood pharmacy compared to a mail-order house. I think most people would rather talk to a pharmacist than to a mailbox.
I agree that cost containment is very important, and that the use of technicians can be cost-effective, but only to a limited degree and only if supervised by pharmacists. Would any one feel comfortable having a salesclerk in a pharmacy fill a prescription while the pharmacist was out to lunch?

HEADLINE: Ex-University Head Pleads Guilty To Accepting 2 Illegal Payments

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., May 28

 BODY:
Completing his precipitous fall from power, prestige and influence, James B. Holderman, the former president of the University of South Carolina, pleaded guilty today to using his position to earn illegal compensation and no contest to violating state tax laws.
Mr. Holderman, who resigned the presidency last June amid allegations of overspending and extravagance, received a suspended sentence and five years' probation and was ordered to perform 500 hours of community service and to pay state taxes, penalties and interest -- about $4,000 -- on $25,000 he received illegally through a privately run university foundation. 
 The illegal-compensation charge, a misdemeanor, and the tax charge, a felony, each carried maximum five-year terms.
 
Praise and Punishment
 The plea was part of an agreement with prosecutors that required Mr. Holderman to cooperate in any Federal investigations of Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. Mr. Hatfield, whose son attended the University of South Carolina and received a scholarship from Mr. Holderman's discretionary fund, is the subject of inquiries by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Federal grand jury and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. Each has sought university records of any gifts, meals, travel or other items of value received by the Senator, his family or his aides.
Even as Mr. Holderman was being punished, he heard himself extolled, by the judge as well as Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago; the Right Rev. William A. Beckham, Episcopal Bishop of Upper South Carolina; former Chief Justice Julius B. Ness of the State Supreme Court, and prominent business people he once courted in his drive to upgrade the university.
"I feel that as far as punishment is concerned, you have been punished enough" said Judge John Henry Waller Jr., presiding over the hearing in Circuit Court here. "But I can't let it go at that. You broke the laws of South Carolina. The one thing that you can be proud of and point to in all this trouble is that you have enhanced the University of South Carolina, and that is a fact."
The prosecutor, Richard A. Harpootlian, said the sentence was in line with what had generally been given first-time offenders in white-collar crimes like this one. He said he was satisfied with the guilty plea and the sentence.
"He's a convicted felon," Mr. Harpootlian said in an interview, "and he and a convicted crack dealer have the same status in our society after today."
 
'A Great Many Mistakes'
 For almost 13 years as president, Mr. Holderman occupied a lofty position as the man who built the University of South Carolina's reputation through a combination of promotional genius, fund-raising success and capital construction programs. Many of his supporters and critics credit him with raising the university from one with a reputation as a party and football school to one with a nationally recognized program in international business, a respected engineering program and a modern performance hall.
Today in court, Mr. Holderman's lawyers described the slide of a deeply troubled man who is unemployed and has debts that exceed assets by $40,000. They said Mr. Holderman, 55 years old, had been diagnosed by his psychiatrist as suffering from manic depression, a condition in which a person's moods alternate between extreme depression and being elevated, expansive and grandiose, which contributed to his creative energy as well as to his profligate spending. Associates said Mr. Holderman and his wife of 32 years, Carolyn, had separated in recent weeks.
Facing Judge Waller before sentencing, Mr. Holderman spoke in a clear, steady voice. "The years were very fast-moving years," he said, "and we made a lot of progress. But at the same time, because I am very human, we made a great many mistakes. I hope that the good that was done will far outweigh the mistakes that were made. Thank you for your consideration."
Mr. Holderman pleaded guilty to receiving $25,000 in two payments through a university foundation from 1986 to 1988. The money was paid to the Carolina Research and Development Foundation and subsequently to Mr. Holderman through an influential Columbia law firm headed by former Gov. Robert McNair, a close friend of Mr. Holderman.
Mr. Harpootlian, the Richland County solicitor, said the money came from a businessman client of the law firm who had been jailed in the Dominican Republic on drug charges. Mr. Holderman had arranged for the lawyers to meet with the Dominican President, Salvador Jorge Blanco, in 1986. Mr. Holderman had met the Dominican leader two years earlier at a much-publicized, university-sponsored conference on the Caribbean.
The jailed businessman, Bernard Baus, was subsequently freed and the charges were dropped. He later directed that a donation be made to the university foundation, and it was that money that wound up in Mr. Holderman's personal account.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Clemens Is as Good As It Gets for Pitchers

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
When the Mets and Boston Red Sox drove the 1986 World Series to a sixth game, the National Leaguers knew they had to get past Roger Clemens, the Sox's 24-game winner and eventual American League most valuable player, in order to hope to win it all.
 Rafael Santana, then the Mets' shortstop, cocky and confident of his team's ability and unfamiliar with Clemens, didn't see what all the fuss was about. "It's no big deal," Santana said. "He ain't Cy Young, you know."
 
 As Rafael and all other major leaguers have come to learn, Roger Clemens may not be Cy Young, but he's just about as close as there is to Cy in the game today.
 No pitcher has so dominated baseball in the last five seasons. From 1986 through 1990, the Boston right-hander's 100 victories and 2.71 earned run average were the best in the majors (yes, even better than the victory total of his nemesis Dave Stewart, 93; and National League e.r.a. leader Orel Hershiser, 2.88).
 Clemens's 1,224 strikeouts in that five-season span were second only to the totals of Clemens's fellow Texan, Nolan Ryan (1,225).
 So it was Clemens, not Cy Young, who took the mound at Yankee Stadium, last night and ended the Yankees' five-game winning streak with a 6-2 victory.
 Clemens continued his uncanny run as the league's consummate stopper. He is now 71-19 lifetime, 4-1 this season, in starts following Boston defeats. The pitcher was, said catcher Tony Pena, "the right man in the right situation."
"He had everything going," said Pena . "He was hitting his spots."
And Yankee Manager Stump Merrill said, in grudging admiration, "If you gave me a guy to get in this league, he'd be the guy."
 Nothing, it seems, could have really stopped Clemens. To lose the game last night would have meant a three-game losing streak; he has not suffered such a calamity since 1989.
 Even if Clemens appeared tired at times, resting his palms on his knees, he was not. "I was just getting a breather," the pitcher said. "I wanted to keep concentrating, trying to make every inning like my last inning."
The reason, said Clemens, was that he felt he had tried to pace himself in the two previous games.
"I feel where I've made mistakes in the past was by trying to stay strong," he said.
So he poured everything he had into his 128 pitches in eight innings of work. The Yankees? They managed just three hits, struck out eight times and managed to stay patient enough just to induce one walk.
Going into the game, Clemens was a mere 2-2 with one no-decision since April. Still, over all, Clemens is 7-2 and he still is the Rocket, the pitcher thoroughly capable of throwing entire offenses into a stall, as witnessed last month.
 Clemens roared through April with a 4-0 record in five starts, recorded an 0.28 e.r.a. Even though Clemens has become more and more a pitcher as opposed to a strikeout artist, he still managed to strike out 34 in those first five games, walk only 5 and allow just 17 hits.
 And like his idol Ryan, Clemens is evolving, becoming more and more accomplished as a technician.
 Once, it was his fastball and slider that blinded the opposition. Now, with polishing and maturity, Clemens has four pitches that are routinely dubbed unhittable, weaving in his curveball at a greater rate -- something his pitching coach, Bill Fischer, and his friend, Ryan, have urged.
 And Clemens is following fastballs up with a forkball, a blend that is dazzling even those hitters who once thought they were getting a bead on the right-hander.
"I once attended a banquet with Roger and asked him, 'Man, with the stuff you have, why do you throw me that breaking stuff all the time?' " Jesse Barfield, the Yankees' right fielder, recalled. "He said, 'It's simple. What are you looking for?' "
 The Seattle Mariners of 1986 knew what they were looking for -- fastballs, sliders, heat -- and still they could do nothing about it as Clemens struck out a major league record 20 of them in one game on April 29, 1986. Now, with the marvelous blend of pitches, Clemens's followers have watched the strikeout performances ebb, but the efficiency of the pitcher grows. Economy is one of Clemens's hallmarks now, as he throws fewer pitches and makes hitters put the ball in play.
 "Patience is the key," Barfield said. "He can be beaten if you get ahead in the count, then make him come to you. Make him come down with that high fastball by working the count. His high fastball is so inviting, you want to swing and that's a part of his weaponry. You have to be patient. You have to be aggressive, too, though."
For the record Barfield was 0-for-3 againt Clemens, striking out twice, once on -- what else -- a rising fastball.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Chief Installs Kinsmen in Key Posts

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
In the three months since the end of the Persian Gulf war, experts say, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has sought to tighten his grip on power by turning over key functions of Government to trusted family members.
 He has also taken steps intended to portray Iraq as committed to "democratization," by holding autonomy talks with Kurdish leaders, abolishing the secret Revolutionary Court, easing restrictions on travel and news organizations and promising to hold elections and disband the ruling Revolutionary Command Council. 
By moving in what appear to be two contradictory directions, experts on Iraq inside and outside the Bush Administration say, Mr. Hussein is motivated by only one factor: fear. Genuinely threatened by the revolts of the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south, he felt he had no choice but to close his circle around him while at the same time making changes that give the impression of reform.
 Mr. Hussein has put his family in charge of the institutions that control the country's security, falling back on a pattern that has served him well in other times of trouble in the 23 years of Baath Party rule.
 
Shuffling of Cabinet
 "So far I don't see anyone new emerging in the Iraqi elite," said Amatzia Baram, an Israeli and author of a new book on the culture and ideology of Iraq under the current Government. "There is just a shuffling of the cards and shuffling them in a way that makes him more important than ever. Sure, he's sharing power -- with his family."
 Since Iraq's devastating military defeat, Mr. Hussein has adjusted his Cabinet twice, shifting the portfolios of longtime senior officials and promoting other officials known for their personal loyalty. On the surface, the reshuffling looked as if he was moving to democratize.
 In March, for example, he relinquished the title of Prime Minister and gave it to Saadun Hamadi, a Shiite from Karbala who has held several important positions in the Baath Government over the years. Mr. Hamadi, an urbane, English-speaking, University of Wisconsin-educated agricultural economist who is responsible for the economic and physical reconstruction of the country, has enjoyed a high profile in the last few months, visiting towns and cities around the country, giving news conferences, appearing on Iraqi television and giving speeches to the National Assembly.
 Other officials who are continually in the public eye are Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, who is leading the negotiations with the Kurds, and Tariq Aziz, who lost his post as Foreign Minister but who retains considerable power as Deputy Prime Minister.
 
Reputation for Ruthlessness
 But behind those officials -- all of whom who have worked closely with Mr. Hussein since the 1960's -- is his family.
 During Iraq's civil war, Mr. Hussein named his cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, as Minister of Interior, a job that carries responsibility for all of the country's powerful overlapping security and intelligence forces. Mr. Majid earned a reputation for ruthlessness in 1988, when he suppressed a Kurdish uprising by using chemical weapons against civilians, and again in 1990, when he was appointed Iraq's chief administrator in Kuwait.
 Mr. Hussein's half-brother, Sibawi, retains direct control of the intelligence services, which have emerged as even more important since the outbreak of Iraq's civil war.
 Last month, Mr. Hussein named his son-in-law and former bodyguard, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, as his Minister of Defense. General Kamel, who is widely regarded as the second-most-powerful man in Iraq, succeeded Lieut. Gen. Saadi Tuma Abbas, former head of the elite Republican Guard and a respected military officer who had held the top defense post for less than four months.
 The appointment may have been aimed at inhibiting a revolt from within the army. The Voice of Free Iraq, a Saudi Arabian-based radio station believed to have the support of the Central Intelligence Agency, has repeatedly called for the military to rise up against Mr. Hussein. One broadcast praised the then Defense Minister, Gen. Tuma Abbas, by name and appealed to him to "curb the mad bull and take things in hand."
 But General Kamel is unlikely to win the respect of the military establishment. He rose through the ranks by managing the office of the palace-based security structure and later by developing Iraq's weapons industry, not for any heroic battlefield victories.
 He is believed to have directed Government efforts to put down the Shiite and Kurdish uprisings after the war.

HEADLINE: REAL ESTATE;
Boeing's Expansion Drive

BYLINE: By Harriet King

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
A RECORD $102.5 billion order backlog is driving a far-reaching commercial real estate expansion program by the Boeing Company in its stronghold, the Puget Sound area. The company's own plants, some dating from the World War II period, are being modernized, and huge amounts of acreage are being purchased for expansion and to develop high-technology centers for building the new Boeing 777. The plane is to roll off the production line in 1995.
Boeing has up to $3 billion worth of projects, about eight million square feet, either in construction, design or proposal stages. In the next 10 years, it will build offices, paint hangers, fabrication plants, laboratories and tooling centers. The short-term goal is to increase production from the current 34 planes a month to 39.5 by early 1992, said Russell Young, a company spokesman. Some 1,800 jet planes are on order, and the backlog jumped by $48 billion in 1990. 
 Boeing is preparing for expansion by buying acreage while large parcels are available. "Land assembly may be more difficult in the future," Mr. Young said.
Cities and counties, too, once they know Boeing's construction and employment plans, can prepare for traffic, transit and infrastructure needs and deal with environmental issues. Boeing backed away from buying one site where it wanted to build a $30 million tool-sharpening plant because Pierce County said that wetlands-preservation provisions would prevent building on part of the property.
Boeing officials confirm that "some lands have become available" because of the recession and that the company gets offers every day. Although the commerial real estate market has continued to be fairly healthy in the Puget Sound area, Thomas Abbott, manager of Cushman & Wakefield of Washington Inc., said some of the speculative atmosphere had abated because of the difficulty in getting financing.
Boeing, which recorded the highest sales, earnings and backlog in its history last year, is using its own money to pay for its expansion. At the end of 1990, it had $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.
The expansions stretch the length of Puget Sound. On the north end, in Everett, Boeing recently acquired an additional 250 acres. The 747's and 767's are produced in Everett and the new 777 will be assembled there. This spring, work starts on a $1.5 billion, five-million-square-foot plant for production of the 777. This will double Everett's capacity.
Thirty miles south, in Seattle, the company is planning major modernizations of the Duwamish River-Boeing Field plants, where B-17 bombers were produced during World War II. Plans call for tearing down buildings holding about 3 million of the 10 million square feet now there and constructing up to 3.5 million square feet of new space.
Many horse-racing fans were stunned when Boeing recently said it was buying Longacres Park in Seattle. The land came on the market unexpectedly, and Boeing seized the chance to buy. The 212-acre track is close to Boeing's headquarters, in a heavily developed area where amassing large tracts of land is difficult. In May, the company said it would invest up to $800 million to build a three-million-square-foot office park with 15 buildings. The 10-yea project is to start in 1993.
South of Seattle, Boeing is making its first move into Pierce County, by acquiring 527 acres in the Frederickson Industrial Park. The proposed development is to be done in phases, with an eventual total of 4.5 million square feet of space, where 11,000 people will work. The company is currently building a $132 million, 950,000-square-foot plant there to manufacture wing skin panels.
Analysts say that once Boeing goes into an area, it sets the price for other property. "They validate a place that probably would have eventually come into its own, such as the Frederickson site," said Robert Aigner, executive vice president of CB Commercial in Seattle. "They just accelerate that market."
Mr. Aigner said this was the case in the 1980's in Eastgate, a section of Bellevue, Wash., where there was little commercial development. Boeing put its computer services division on the site of a former airfield. Since then, Eastgate has grown rapidly and now has other office buildings and a hotel.
The Boeing construction is straining the capacity of the labor force in the building trades. Workers from outside the region will probably be brought in eventually, especially pipefitters and electricians, because refineries north of Seattle are also planning large expansions. And there are a number of other commercial construction projects under way in the Seattle area.

HEADLINE: ETHIOPIA OFFICIALS FLOWN INTO ISRAEL

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 29

 BODY:
The Israeli Government acknowledged today that at least two senior Ethiopian Government officials were flown here and given temporary asylum as part of the price paid for the release of more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews brought here in an airlift last Friday and Saturday.
The disclosure may complicate Israel's efforts to persuade the new interim Government in Addis Ababa to release more than 1,000 Jews still in Ethiopia. 
 Government officials also confirmed reports that Israel had paid the former Ethiopian Government $35 million for the Jews' release. But a senior Foreign Ministry official said he believed the money had merely been reimbursement for expenses.
"If any payments were effected, they went from bank to bank in order to cover some expenses, the upkeep and maintenance fees, the use of the international airport for the whole day, ground services, the flight of an Ethiopian carrier," said Reuven Merhav, director general of the Foreign Ministry.
 
'Passed From Bank to Bank'
 "All this came in a package that to the best of my knowledge was passed from bank to bank," he said. "Nothing was paid in cash, as far as I know."
In the past Israel has had few qualms about making payments to other governments for the release of Jews in their countries. Under the former Romanian Government, for example, Israel had to pay a specific dollar sum for the release of each individual.
The two disclosures today are the first clear confirmation that the former Ethiopian Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam had used the Jews to extract payments and political concessions from Israel and the United States during the Government's final days in power.
Former Senator Rudy Boschwitz, President Bush's special envoy to Ethiopia now on a visit to Israel, said as much today.
"Mengistu felt that as long as he held onto the Jews that they would be useful to him -- that he could get arms for Jews or that he could in some way use them as a hostage," he said.
Uri Lubrani, a senior Israeli Defense Ministry official who acted as this nation's envoy to Ethiopia, said Mr. Mengistu repeatedly asked Israel to supply arms for use in the insurgency against his Government. But, Mr. Lubrani said, "I had to make it abundantly clear to Mengistu that we were not going to supply Ethiopia with arms."
In the end, however, as Addis Ababa fell under rebel guns, Foreign Ministry officials admitted today that Israel did agree to fly at least two senior Government officials, including Kasa Kadebe, Mr. Mengistu's half-brother and senior aide, to Israel among the Ethiopian Jews airlifted here last week.
The other official, who was not named, was said to be a deputy interior minister who had approved exit visas for the Jews.
Already, Israeli officials said, the interim rebel Government in Addis Ababa has protested to Israel about the granting of asylum to senior members of the hated Mengistu Government. But the Foreign Ministry said the two "do not have official status here" and may not be allowed to stay here for long.
 
Studied at Hebrew University
 The daily newspaper Maariv reported that Eineho Almenech, the head of the Ethiopian secret service, was also brought here. Government officials would not comment on the report.
Mr. Merhav would not confirm the presence of any of the men directly. At the same time, he suggested that their presence might not be temporary.
"We have not granted political asylum," he said. "There may be Ethiopian individuals in transit or in residence having legal documents, and this is the only status that I know of."
Mr. Kadebe studied economics and sociology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem almost 30 years ago. He is fluent in Hebrew and is the official who was sent here in 1989 to renew diplomatic ties between Israel and Ethiopia.

HEADLINE: Soviets Propose Foreign-Owned Businesses

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 29

 BODY:
Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov presented a draft bill on foreign investment today that envisions enterprises fully owned by foreigners and a range of other guarantees and incentives.
Mr. Pavlov told the Supreme Soviet that the law was critical to the creation of a legal basis conducive to serious and long-term foreign investment. 
 "Foreign investment is not just money," the Prime Minister told Parliament. "Together with it comes more modern technology, intellectual potential and managerial experience. World experience and the state of our economy dictate that the promotion of foreign investment in every way is necessary."
Mr. Pavlov acknowledged that the legislation still had major gaps, especially where critical economic and organizational differences remained in limbo between the center and the republics. Some republics, including the Russian Federation, have already passed laws on foreign investment.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and leaders of 9 of the 15 Soviet republics have taken steps recently toward a new union treaty. Under the arrangement currently under discussion, the federal law would then serve as a guideline for participating republics.
The draft presented by Mr. Pavlov was thus more a set of principles than finished legislation. Still, the document represented a commitment by the Kremlin to remove the major barriers that have so far prevented major long-term investment from the West, and a reaffirmation of the Gorbachev Government's promotion of foreign investment.
Western business people based in Moscow generally welcomed the proposal, but stressed that they would need to see the final product before making any conclusions. Mr. Pavlov's introduction of the measure seemed timed to a visit to Washington by one of Mr. Gorbachev's advisers, Yevgeny M. Primakov, who is expected to lobby for assistance from the United States and other major industrialized countries.
The Parliament gave the draft a strong endorsement, 291 to 11, and most deputies who spoke in the debate stressed the need to quickly create attractive conditions for foreign investment. Only a handful of hard-line Communists pressed the notion that the measure would make the Soviet Union an economic "colony" of the West.
Until Mr. Gorbachev undertook his policies of perestroika, the Communist Government had maintained absolute control over any foreign participation in the economy and effectively barred any private investment. The first laws permitting foreign investment limited it to strictly controlled joint ventures with Soviet companies, and gave few guarantees for the long-term security of foreign investment.
Introducing the proposals, Mr. Pavlov said foreigners would be allowed to engage in business except military industries. He said the law would allow foreigners to take long-term leases on property and would allow business people to import and export equipment without a license. In case of nationalization, investors would be guaranteed the market price of their enterprise in convertible currency.
Mr. Pavlov also said that foreigners would be welcome to invest in denationalized enterprises.
"Foreign capital can and must participate in this process equally with Soviet capital," he said.

HEADLINE: Strawbridge's Net Off Sharply

 BODY:
Strawbridge & Clothier, one of the East Coast's largest regional retailers, yesterday reported a sharp drop in its first- quarter profits.
The Philadelphia-based retailer said that in the first fiscal quarter ended May 4, net earnings dropped to $212,000, or 2 cents a share, from $3.09 million, or 33 cents a share, the year before. Sales dropped 1 percent, to $207 million from $209.2 million. 
 The company said the earnings decrease, which compared with "an extremely successful" first quarter last year, was caused by lower sales and a decline in profit margins.
"The small decrease in sales for the first quarter indicates the continuing effect of the nationwide recession," the company said, "particularly evident in the Middle Atlantic States, which include the company's trading area."
Strawbridge, which operates 13 department stores and 25 Clover self-service stores, said that the first-quarter retailing results represented "a disproportionately small" percentage of the year's earnings. Retailers typically look for their biggest revenue at the end of the year, during the autumn and Christmas shopping seasons.
In its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Strawbridge had sales of $950 million and net income of $31.2 million.

HEADLINE: Ballerina From a Shelter: A Child's Dream

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
Shara Overton dresses her favorite doll, "Little Miss Make-Up," as a prima ballerina and dreams of her doing pirouettes and dancing gracefully in the "Nutcracker."
While other little girls play double-dutch jump rope after school outside the shelter for homeless families in Harlem where she lives, Shara reads books about ballet and listens to classical music on the radio. The 8-year-old girl also teaches her 2-year-old sister, Leah, the routines that she learns at the New York Theater Ballet School, where she dons leotards and ballet slippers like her doll's. 
 Shara's talent emerged last fall in an arts program for children in homeless shelters that is sponsored by New York City. Social workers and directors of cultural institutions that participate in the program, which is conducted after school, say that scores of other children in shelters show promise in the arts. But program officials say such talent will be wasted without stable environments, nurturing and disciplined training.
 
What She Wants to Be
 "Shara is gifted with an extraordinary body for dance," said Diana Byer, artistic director of the New York Theater Ballet Company, who discovered Shara and then offered her a ballet scholarship.
"There is a special elegance about her that is rare in a child," said Ms. Byer, who is also Shara's ballet teacher. "When she points her feet, the knees stretch beautifully, naturally. She has very supple hip joints. Other people have that. But what's wonderful is that Shara, somehow as a little girl, knows how to watch and just do what I teach her."
When asked what she wants to be when she grows up, Shara's eyes grow bright, she smiles, puts a hand up to her mouth and says quietly, "a ballerina." But reaching the world of ballet, a grueling challenge in the best of circumstances, seems even more daunting and foreign at the Convent Avenue Family Living Center, where she lives with her mother, two sisters and two brothers. Still, talent knows no geographic, social or economic boundaries.
The shelter, at West 129th Street and Convent Avenue, is considered by advocates for the homeless to be one of the better temporary living centers in the city. Families live in small two-bedroom apartments, and guards patrol the noisy environs hourly, officials at the center said.
But Shara's mother, Cheryl, still worries about her children's safety. Outside the shelter, drugs and crime are prevalent. Often, she said, other children pick fights with her children and they are wary of going outside without her.
 
Family Occasion
 One day a week, Ms. Overton hustles her children, from 1 to 11 years old, on the D train for the ride to 34th Street and the walk to Shara's ballet class at Madison Avenue and East 31st Street.
"I hope that some good comes out of this," said Ms. Overton, 34, who is separated from the children's father and became homeless last fall when the family's apartment in Brooklyn became unlivable. "Shara asks me to find a classical music station on the radio, and she shows us what she does in ballet. She never listened to classical music before. She loves books about the ballet and reads all the time, more now since she's been in ballet class."
In the ballet studio, Shara can escape the din of Convent Avenue and the uncertainty of homelessness, even if only for brief moments. Though Shara is treated like the other students, she is often asked to demonstrate routines to her classmates.
But Shara, who performed briefly in an abbreviated version of "Nutcracker" with the New York Theater Ballet last winter, has never seen a full-length ballet.
 
Visit With Chancellor
 Her introduction to dance came through the cultural arts and science program offered to children living in homeless shelters. The program, sponsored by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, the Board of Education and the Human Resources Administration and supported by various foundations, exposes children in shelters to the arts and sciences and offers a respite from the shelters.
Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, said the program's concept grew several years ago from a visit that she and Dr. Richard R. Green, then the Schools Chancellor, made to homeless shelters. They found few places for the children to do homework and little exposure to the arts or to artistic discipline.
"The idea was to integrate them into the life of the city, so that when they come out of the shelters, the programs would help them feel a part of the fabric of the city of New York," Dr. Campbell said. "We originally thought this program was for the children. It turns out to be a program for families, who come and look at the different opportunities we offer their children, take part in graduation ceremonies and continue to visit the institutions after the program is completed."
In operating the programs, Dr. Campbell said, workers have discovered children with artistic talent in dance, theater, music or art in all age groups. When children like Shara are discovered, scholarships are found for them to continue their training.
Reggie Nuamah, the Overtons' social worker at the Family Living Center, said Shara's third-grade teacher complained last fall that Shara was withdrawn in class.
"But lately, she has opened up as a person and she smiles more," Mr. Nuamah said.
Ms. Byer said that initially many of the homeless children would not make eye contact with the teaching staff.
"It's just been during the last few weeks that Shara would look at me and say my name," Ms. Byer said. "I cannot imagine how a child that age deals with what they have to deal with."
Identifying children with talent is one thing. Creating the environment where they can be taught and nurtured is another. Dr. Campbell, her employees and social workers say many of the children become lost in the system and their training is interrupted, perhaps permanently.
"The reality is that a shelter is a very transient place and a family that once lived in Brooklyn is living in a shelter in the Bronx before being transferred somewhere else," Dr. Campbell said. "There is no doubt that some talented people get missed. But there have been cases, even with movement, where the young people move into permanent housing and we manage to keep in touch with them."
Ms. Byer worries about whether Shara will keep up her lessons when Ms. Overton finds a permanent home. Ms. Overton said her other children already complain about accompanying Shara to ballet lessons. But she said there was no one else to keep her children during Shara's classes.
Ms. Byer said she had already lost at least one promising child whose family moved out of the shelters. "It's cruel to give children a taste of something and then take it away," Ms. Byer said. "I wonder what's going to happen to these families when they move out of the shelters and what's going to be done for their children then."
 
Discipline and Training
 After brief stays at shelters in Brooklyn and the Bronx, Ms. Overton and her children have been in Harlem for more than six months. They are now eligible for more permanent quarters in city-owned or supported apartments. Mr. Nuamah said Ms. Overton is looking at homes in Queens.
What Shara is now getting one day a week is a sampling of the discipline and training that she will undergo if she studies ballet seriously. Ballerinas need at least 10 years of study before they become professionals, Ms. Byer said.
Next year, when Shara's body begins to mature, she should attend class three days a week. But additional money for the scholarship and for travel must be found, Ms. Byer said.
Shara, who has filled the bedroom she shares with brothers and sisters with teddy bears, ballet certificates and pictures of Ms. Byer as a ballerina, said she shows her skeptical classmates at Public School 129 some of the ballet routines she has learned.
"I tell them I was in the 'Nutcracker' last winter," Shara said.
Did they believe her? She shrugged her shoulders in uncertainty, giggled and looked at her mother for assurance.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher in Light Day; Gold Is Lower in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday in thin trading driven largely by technical factors.
Gold prices fell in New York, retracing some of their steps after their surge on Tuesday. 
 Analysts said the market largely ignored the Government's revised estimate of the gross national product for the second quarter. The Commerce Department said the G.N.P., a measure of the nation's output of goods and services, fell by 2.6 percent, compared with an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent.
The adjustment was largely because of an improvement in the nation's trade deficit in March, but since the figures were released earlier this month, the G.N.P. revision failed to move the dollar.
Kevin Logan, the chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said the dollar opened lower, continuing a downward trend. Technical factors then began to move it higher, and the light volume helped exaggerate the dollar's movements.
Mr. Logan said many traders were out of the market, having closed their books for the end of the month.
The dollar began its day in Tokyo, falling to 137.60 Japanese yen, from 138.35 yen on Tuesday. Later, in London, it rose to 138.05 yen, and in New York, it advanced to 138.10 yen from 137.48 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.7137 marks from 1.6938.
The British pound slipped against the dollar, dropping in London to $1.7315, from $1.7450 late Tuesday. In New York, sterling fell to $1.7275 from $1.7490.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Tuesday, included: 1.4610 Swiss francs, up from 1.4440; 5.8145 French francs, up from 5.7540; 1,273.00 Italian lire, up from 1,260.00, and 1.14665 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14655.
Gold prices, which shot up about $7 in domestic trading on Tuesday, gave up some of the gains in New York after rising overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange, gold fell $2.40, to $361.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $360.40 an ounce, off $2.10.
Large purchases of gold by a single buyer sent prices soaring on Tuesday. Analysts said gold retreated in the absence of more heavy purchases yesterday.
Earlier, gold rose in London to a late bid of $361.10 an ounce, from $359.80 late on Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $361.00, from $360.75 late Tuesday.
In Hong Kong, gold rose $3.88 an ounce to close at $361.10.
Silver fell 0.9 cent on the Commodity Exchange, to $4.143 an ounce. In London, silver rose to a late bid of $4.16 an ounce, up from $4.10 late on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: BUSH UNVEILS PLAN FOR ARMS CONTROL IN THE MIDDLE EAST

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, May 29

 BODY:
President Bush unveiled his long-delayed proposal today to ban weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East in an effort to find the middle ground between his pledge to curb the region's arms race and the political pressures frustrating American diplomacy since the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Bush also proposed that the world's five biggest arms suppliers meet to establish guidelines "for restraints on destabilizing transfers of conventional arms" to the region. 
 But as expected, the initiative, which Mr. Bush announced in a commencement speech to the Air Force Academy, focused less on conventional weapons than on a proposed freeze and eventual ban on ballistic missiles, a ban on poison gas weapons and an end to production of material for use in nuclear weapons.
 
Lower Level Officials
 The United States and its allies do not want to limit their ability to sell aircraft, tanks and other conventional weapons to their clients in the Middle East, while allies, especially Israel, continue to seek major arms purchases.
But Mr. Bush, borrowing from a Canadian proposal, called for a meeting of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain in Paris as early as next month to begin writing the guidelines on conventional weapons. Under Mr. Bush's plan, the meeting would not be conducted by heads of state, as proposed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, but by lower level officials.
Mr. Bush's plan seemed certain to face formidable obstacles in a region where governments have spent decades arming themselves as rapidly as possible to keep their neighbors at bay. In addition, parts of the plan, notably those on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, relate primarily to Israel, which has already complained of being unfairly singled out.
 
Israel Most Affected
 Mr. Bush's proposal treats this issue as circumspectly as possible, referring to the "eventual creation of a regional nuclear-free zone." That has the most direct effect on Israel, which is believed to be the only country in the region with nuclear weapons, and would mean their eventual elimination. But the American plan does not specifically mention Israel or provide any timetable for ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons.
The proposal marked the fulfillment of a promise Mr. Bush made in an address to Congress on March 6, but had been delayed for nearly two months while the President waited to see if Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's shuttle diplomacy would produce a breakthrough in efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 
Seeking a Framework
 Although Mr. Baker's efforts are still not conclusive, the President decided to make his arms control plan public before the political momentum that he believes was produced by the allied victory in the Persian Gulf war dissipates and in hope of somehow combining arms control discussions with other political negotiations.
Mr. Bush said he hoped his proposal could eventually provide the framework for global arms control. But he said he wanted to begin with the Middle East because "nowhere are the dangers of weapons proliferation more urgent."
"Halting the proliferation of conventional and unconventional weapons in the Middle East, while supporting the legitimate need of every state to defend itself, will require the cooperation of many states, in the region and around the world," Mr. Bush said. "It won't be easy, but the path to peace never is."
The plan does not envision any specific treaties, accords or conventions, at least in its initial phases, but is rather "an exercise in collective restraint," a senior Administration official said today.
 
'A Sense of Opportunity'
 The official, who briefed reporters here on condition of anonymity, said "there was a sense of opportunity" in the Administration for an arms control proposal in the Middle East, saying the proposal provided a chance to "test how much countries are willing to do and not to do."
But it remains to be seen how much support the proposal will gain among the major arms suppliers and the nations of the Middle East, who have long resisted arms control out of fear that their neighbors would acquire more powerful weapons.
The Bush Administration could not point to any specific commitments from any arms suppliers or buyers on the overall plan, and indeed had not received any definitive answer from the Soviet Union or China about whether they would participate in the proposed conference in Paris. Israel, which is the only country in the Middle East known to possess nuclear weapons, does not acknowledge their existence and has resisted earlier proposals to curb their production.
The White House declined comment today on a statement by the Israeli Defense Ministry offering a counterproposal for an international conference on conventional weapons proliferation. The White House said the United States had consulted extensively with Israel, Canada, Britain, France and other countries before announcing the plan, but declined to comment on reports that Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir of Israel had asked Mr. Bush to delay the announcement of his arms proposal.
It is still not clear how hard the United States itself will press for the plan.
Mr. Bush, whose Middle East agenda is already filled with seemingly intractible problems, included only two paragraphs about the plan in his speech, which focused primarily on a threat to veto any military budget approved by Congress that does not support his proposed weapons programs, especially the "Star Wars" missile defense projects and the B-2 Stealth bomber.
Moreover, senior Administration officials here acknowledged that one of their primary challenges is to lower arms stockpiles in the region, but not to bring them down so far that the very lack of weapons in some countries could prove destabilizing.
"We are going to continue to provide for the legitimate defense interests of our friends and allies in the Middle East," one official said. "To the extent that involves arms sales, we will proceed with them."
 
Outlined by White House
 As outlined by the White House in documents and briefings provided for reporters traveling with Mr. Bush, the President's proposal includes these elements:
*An effort by the five major arms suppliers to identify the kinds of conventional weapons that most seriously threaten the military stability of the region and curb their sale. An agreement to inform each other of planned sales of weaponry to Middle Eastern countries.
*A freeze on buying, producing and testing all surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, "with a view to the ultimate elimination of such missiles" from the arsenals of the Middle East. Israel is the only country in the region known to possess such missiles.
*A verifiable ban on production and acquisition of enriched uranium and separate plutonium, which can be used for weapons.
*A commitment by all countries in the region to sign a proposed global ban on poison gas weapons.
*A commitment by the countries to abide by a much-ignored 1972 convention forbidding all but the most limited, defensive stockpiles of germ warfare agents, known as biological weapons.
 
Trading With China
 While in Colorado Springs, Mr. Bush also sent to Congress a formal notification that he is extending for another year China's favorable tariff treatment in American markets, known as its "most favored nation status."
At least five measures are under consideration in Congress that would put conditions on China's tariff rights or eliminate them altogether.
The President has argued that the United States cannot hope to influence democratic reform in China unless it stays politically and economically engaged with the Beijing leadership. He also said revoking China's trading status, which provides the tariffs granted to virtually all of America's other trading partners, would hurt parts of China that are moving forward with economic reform and businesses in Hong Kong that process much of the $20 billion in trade the two countries did in 1990.
Members of Congress say, however, that China should be punished for its human rights abuses since the crackdown on political activity that culminated in the violence in Tienanmen Square on June 4, 1989.
China's trading status expires on July 3 and Mr. Bush's renewal will take effect automatically unless both houses of Congress pass resolutions expressing disapproval. Mr. Bush would then have the power to veto the resolutions.

HEADLINE: Corporate Profit Fall Is Slowing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
In the latest sign that the recession may be ending, corporate profits in the first quarter of 1991 fell markedly less than in the two preceding quarters, the Commerce Department said today.
The decline, to an annual rate of $288 billion, was just three-tenths of 1 percent, following declines of 1.9 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, for last summer and autumn. 
 "We are getting a clear moderation," observed Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York. Referring to the recession, he added, "Maybe the worst is behind us."
While corporate profits have historically reached their low point at the end of recessions, they represent a coincident rather than a predictive indicator and analysts were unwilling to cite the report as hard proof of an imminent recovery.
 
Another Sign of Recovery
 A second gauge, cash flow from current production -- the internal funds available for investment -- climbed 3.8 percent in the first quarter. That compared with a nine-tenths of 1 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1990 and a 2 percent decline in the third.
Today's Commerce Department report also showed that gross national product fell at a 2.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual pace in the quarter, a slightly smaller decline than the 2.8 percent initially estimated in late April.
Earlier signs that the nation may be coming out of the recession that began in July have included recent steadiness in housing, retail sales and industrial production, and an upturn last month in durable-goods orders. In addition, on Friday the Government's index of leading economic indicators is expected to show its third straight monthly advance.
The revision in the G.N.P., which was in line with expectations, mainly reflected a bigger jump in net exports, by $4.2 billion, that was only partly offset by a $3.1 billion downward adjustment in output of producers' durable equipment. The G.N.P. represents the total value of goods and services generated in an economy.
Inflation remained at a 5.1 percent annual pace, as gauged by the G.N.P. fixed-weight price index, which is a pure price measure, while the implicit price deflator was revised downward, to 5.2 percent from 5.5.
Even though the deflator is considered a relatively poor inflation gauge, analysts found it somewhat reassuring that the deflator, which rose 2.8 percent in the fourth-quarter, was rising at a slower pace than thought a month ago.
The corporate profits data were a bit weaker than some analysts had expected, even with the much slower rate of decline than in the third and fourth quarters.
 
Recession Reduces Demand
 Companies earn less money in recessions because reduced demand for their products means a lower, usually less efficient, rate of operation. Lower demand also tends to prevent companies from raising prices, but the growth of employee wages usually persists.
"As a result, profits are squeezed on two fronts," said John E. Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "First, output prices weaken prior to labor costs and, second, capital and overhead costs are spread over fewer units of output."
In addition to the decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in profits from current production -- sometimes called economic profits -- today's report portrayed profits by three other measures.
Profits before taxes dropped 7 percent, a steeper fall than the 4.5 percent decline posted in the fourth quarter. Profits after taxes also fell more sharply, 5.6 percent compared with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter.
On the other hand, current-production cash flow, climbed $15.1 billion, or 3.8 percent, compared with a rise of $3.5 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the fourth quarter.
Profits from current production, which are regarded as the most useful measure for economic analysis, include adjustments for the value of inventory and capital consumption. The inventory adjustment converts inventory costs as reported by a company to a valuation of what it would cost to replace those goods at current prices. The capital adjustment converts allowances reported for tax purposes to replacement cost values and to uniform service lives and depreciation formulas.
The improvement in this measure in the first quarter was entirely attributed to the inventory adjustment, reflecting changes in inflation.
Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations eased $3.3 billion in the first quarter after dropping $19.7 billion in the fourth, the report also showed.
 
Breakdown by Industry
 Domestic profits of financial corporations, meanwhile, rose $1.1 billion in contrast to a $2.6 billion decline in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The foreign component of profits rose $1.4 billion, far below the preceding quarter's $10.4 billion. This component measures profits made abroad by United States companies, less profits paid to foreign companies operating in the United States.
By industry, profits were up for trade, transportation and public utilities but down for manufacturing and other nonmanufacturing industries, the Commerce Department reported. These profits are estimated by taking before-tax profits and adjusting for inventory valuation.

HEADLINE: BEATEN MOTORIST IS ARRESTED AGAIN

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 29

 BODY:
The motorist whose beating by Los Angeles police has been seen on videotape around the nation was detained Tuesday night by police officers who said he tried to run over an undercover officer with his truck after picking up a male prostitute.
No charges have been filed against the motorist, Rodney G. King, who was released this morning after spending about seven hours in custody. A spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office said prosecutors would evaluate the evidence after receiving details from the police on Thursday. 
 Police officials denied that Mr. King had been singled out and said the surveillance that began the incident was not unusual.
The incident began late Tuesday night, said Officer Francine Spada, a police spokeswoman, who gave this account:
Plainclothes vice officers saw Mr. King picking up a male prostitute dressed like a woman in Hollywood. The two officers followed Mr. King's truck into an alley beside a parking garage and approached it on foot.
 
Officer Hurt Dodging Truck
 When the officers identified themselves, Mr. King started the Chevrolet Blazer and drove toward one of the officers, said Officer Spada, adding, "There was plenty of room where the driver could have driven around rather than driving right towards the officer."
She said the officer, "in fear of getting struck by the vehicle, moved aside and injured his leg by hitting it up against a wrought-iron door or fence." The police refused to identify either officer. The second officer was not hurt.
Mr. King drove out of the alley but was stopped by other officers in a patrol car who saw him speeding, said Officer Spada. It was only after stopping him that the officers learned that the man was Mr. King, she said.
Mr. King, whose beating on March 3 has led to charges of assault with a deadly weapon against four officers, was arrested for investigation into assault with a deadly weapon.
Mr. King's lawyer, Steven A. Lerman, confirmed in a statement that Mr. King had been arrested. "It is obvious that Mr. King is a very upset and confused person and certainly regrets this incident," the statement said.
Mr. King, a 26-year-old unemployed construction worker who is on parole for a robbery conviction in early 1990, suffered several fractures and possible brain damage in the beating and has filed an $81 million lawsuit.
Comdr. Rick Dinse, who is in charge of the internal police investigation, denied that officers had singled out Mr. King for scrutiny.
"I can tell you right now that we are definitely not doing that," he said. "There are not enough police officers or time or interest in following Mr. King or anybody. We are not engaged in any active investigation of Mr. King."
Commander Dinse said it was not uncommon for vice officers to follow a vehicle that had picked up a prostitute. "They had no idea that Mr. King was in the car," he said. "It only came to their attention that it was Mr. King after he was taken into custody and he identified himself."
This incident is Mr. King's second ecounter with law enforcemnt officers since the beating in March, which was videotaped by a neighborhood resident and played for television viewers worldwide. On May 11, he was stopped in Santa Fe Springs by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies who said his vehicle had expired license plates and illegally tinted windows, but he was not charged.

HEADLINE: With No Unifying Force, Political Power for Blacks Ebbs in Chicago

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 29

 BODY:
Ten years ago, this rabidly political city was on the verge of a revolution as the sons and daughters of sharecroppers and other migrants from the rural South took their first tentative steps toward electing one of their own as mayor.
Lu Palmer, a black political organizer and radio talk show host here, talks wistfully about holding clinics in his community group's weather-beaten storefront to teach people who had not graduated from high school how to work a campaign. His worn face brightens when he recalls stirring the masses over the airwaves with what became a political rallying cry, "We shall see in '83." 
 It is no longer 1983, and the shouts of black unity are more like faint pleas. Harold Washington, the man they ushered crusadelike into office, has been dead for almost four years, and so apparently are the last vestiges of the movement he inspired.
 
A Mirror of Nation
 In a way, black politics in Chicago mirrors changes around the country. "The black community has gotten so large and diverse, there is not necessarily one black politician who can bridge the divisions," said David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black-oriented research organization in Washington. "This isn't the 60's anymore. The era of rallying around a single person is somewhat past."
Now, for the first time in 20 years, blacks hold none of the three citywide elective offices in Chicago, which has more black residents than any city outside New York and where blacks make up half the population. In the last two years, Richard M. Daley, son of the former Mayor and Democratic boss, Richard J. Daley, has trounced four leading black politicians, each of whom claimed to be walking in Mr. Washington's footsteps. The strongest challenger, Timothy Evans, the charismatic Alderman who came closest to beating Mayor Daley two years ago, has now lost even his City Council seat.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who with his army of Operation PUSH workers figured prominently in the election of the city's first black mayor, has moved to Washington, far from the struggle to regain City Hall. And now Mr. Palmer, a political folk hero among black Chicagoans, is about to shut down the fraying South Side office that became the incubator for it all, because of lack of interest and money.
"We are in the worst situation we have been in my lifetime," said the 69-year-old Mr. Palmer. "We're worse off now because we have seen what we can do and have thrown it away."
 
Collapse of Coalition
 That glum assessment comes as blacks here are still trying to recover from the death of Mayor Washington and the destructive battling that followed. They have witnessed not only loss after loss in every mayoral campaign since his death, but also the collapse of the delicate and winning coalition they forged with Hispanic progressives and white independents and liberals. It was that coalition that rallied around Mayor Washington and that many thought could eventually heal the racial rifts in one of the nation's most segregated cities.
Now, it is as if 1983 was a dream. "I'm just not optimistic about anything positive happening right now," said Eugene Sawyer, the black former Alderman who was Mayor for 16 tumultuous months after Mayor Washington died. "Black people are turned off to the process of voting. We're going backwards."
As a measure of the apathy that has set in, the turnout for April's mayoral election was as low as 30 percent in some black wards. And those who did turn out were divided. Many black ministers rose to support Mayor Daley while The Chicago Defender, a middle-of-the-road, black-oriented newspaper, ran a front-page editorial last April endorsing Mayor Daley rather than the black candidate, R. Eugene Pincham, a former Illinois appellate judge.
 
'New Face of White Politics'
 And so while only 3 percent of the black vote went to Edward R. Vrdolyak, the leading white challenger to Mayor Washington in 1987, Mayor Daley won close to 27 percent of the black vote in April. "The Daley Administration is the new face of white politics," said Gary Orfield, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. "The traditional Chicago machine exploited things openly. This is a kind of post-civil-rights white administration that is not playing on racial fears and is trying to run the city decently."
The Daley administration has courted Hispanic voters, the city's fastest-growing ethnic group. "Hispanics represent a richer field for the machine," said Don Rose, a local political consultant. "They know that the black community and the machine will be on a collision course. This is a way to beat the demographics and bolster the declining population of white voters. It's a black-proof constituency."
Given the changing demographics, any black candidate who makes it to the mayor's chair will have to win back the white liberals and Hispanic voters who defected to Mayor Daley.
"I don't think we'll ever be able to run an all-black program," said John Stroger, finance chairman of the Cook County Board, who is a Democratic ward committeeman and a black Daley supporter. "This is a numbers game, and we must be reaching out to the Hispanics, the Irish, the Italians and look for commonalities. We've got to put together a quilt to stay warm. We have to accept the fact that Daley is the Mayor and that Harold Washington is dead."
That realization has left blacks scanning the horizon for a viable candidate. Political analysts say they see no clear leader, but when pressed, point to prominent blacks like Roland Burris, the Illinois Attorney General; Carol Mosely Braun, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds; John Steele, a rising Alderman; and even, wishfully, to such nonpoliticians as Vincent Lane, the popular head of the Chicago Housing Authority.
 
When the Demise Began
 The demise of black political power here, most people agree, began during the City Council's battle over who should succeed Mayor Washington. Mr. Evans was the choice among the black rank-and-file. But a group of white Aldermen, some of them Mr. Washington's most virulent critics, threw their votes to Mr. Sawyer and, in effect, crowned him mayor.
It was an endorsement that tainted Mr. Sawyer in the eyes of many black voters who felt he had sold out to Mayor Washington's enemies. And it did him little good in wooing white voters when he ran against Mr. Daley in the Democratic primary two years ago.
In office, his strategy was to prove himself a loyal Washington soldier by following the late Mayor's program to the letter. But in doing so he never came from under his predecessor's shadow and failed to establish himself as a leader in his own right. Sawyer supporters say his biggest mistake was in not disimissing resentful holdovers from the Washington administration who tried to undermine him.
What tore the black electorate apart and ravaged its voting power was the political civil war that broke out between Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Evans and their supporters in the months leading to the 1989 mayoral race. It was a battle that can still turn an otherwise ordinary dinner conversation icy.
Sawyer supporters urged black voters to rally behind their candidate since he already had a toehold. They warned that blacks would lose City Hall if they split their vote. But Mr. Evans held himself up as the rightful heir to Mayor Washington and refused to cede the office to Mr. Sawyer. Some of his supporters even urged black voters to stay home rather than vote for Mayor Sawyer.
The tactics worked. Mr. Sawyer lost to Mr. Daley in the primary, paving the way for Mr. Evans to run against Mr. Daley as an independent in the general election. But because of what were by then bone-deep divisions, Mr. Evans lost to Mr. Daley, too.
Black leaders learned the hard way that the mayor's office was not an automatic inheritance. "There were some people naive enough to believe that the government belonged to them, to their way of thinking," said Danny K. Davis, a Cook County Commissioner who lost to Mayor Daley in February's Democratic primary. "There was so much emotionalism. People had forgotten how Harold got there. A big mistake was made."

Philip Morris to Increase AIDS Donations

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In response to a consumer boycott by homosexuals, the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest consumer-products concern, plans to announce today that it will substantially increase its charitable contributions to AIDS medical research.
Last year, Act-Up, a gay rights organization, called for a boycott of Marlboros, the world's best-selling cigarette, and Miller, the nation's second-largest brewer after Anheuser-Busch. It sought to protest Philip Morris's contributions to Senator Jesse A. Helms, a conservative Republican from North Carolina, a major tobacco-growing state. Homosexuals consider the Senator to be sharply critical of their causes. 
 Act-Up, which is short for the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, estimates that there are 10,000 gay bars in the country and contends that many people boycotted Philip Morris products. Philip Morris said the boycott had no economic impact.
Since 1987, Philip Morris has contributed $1.3 million to several gay causes, including the Gay Men's Health Crisis. Alice T. McGillion, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, said the company would double the amount it gave last year but she would not be more specific.
 
'An Ethical Choice'
 Act-Up had announced that Philip Morris would contribute $3 million to AIDS research; Ms. McGillion said it would be less than that, but that support would continue for the duration of the epidemic.
Act-Up had demanded that Philip Morris stop its contributions to Senator Helms and renounce its past support of him, both of which the company has refused to do.
"We had an ethical choice," said Michael A. Petrelis, a boycott organizer for Act-Up's Washington chapter. "Either we remain politically correct and continue the boycott or settle with Philip Morris and actually do something."
Mr. Petrelis said that even though Philip Morris had contributed tens of millions of dollars over the years to artistic programs, its support of Senator Helms was undermining the good will that had been created. "What really hurt them was the bad public relations," Mr. Petrelis said. "That's especially true in the arts community, where there are many gays and lesbians."
Philip Morris acknowledged the point. "The boycott sensitized us to concerns within the arts community," Ms. McGillion said.

HEADLINE: NATO: Still the Defender of Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 29

 BODY:
By announcing radical changes in NATO's military structure in response to a sharply reduced Soviet threat, the Western alliance has simultaneously sought to forestall moves by the European Community to develop an independent defense capability.
 After a two-day meeting here, Western defense ministers emphasized today that European security should still be primarily guaranteed by a United States-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that any European Community role should be secondary to that of the Atlantic alliance. 
 They also disclosed that European countries will play a more prominent role in NATO's new military structure through the creation of a British-led rapid-reaction corps and development of seven other multinational corps, several of them to be commanded by European officers.
"The allies are agreed that the Europeans could and should take a greater responsibility for the collective defense of Europe and that this European effort will not undermine but strengthen the Atlantic alliance," NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner of Germany, said today.
 
French Are Sidelined
 A final statement by the ministers said that "the efforts to develop a European security identity and defense role should lead to a strengthened European pillar within the alliance." But it emphasized that NATO remained the "essential forum" for Western cooperation.
The immediate effect of the reorganization is to isolate France, which has taken the lead in trying to promote a new defense capability for the European Community. France is a member of NATO, but since 1966 its armed forces have not belonged to NATO's integrated military command.
In an apparent response to NATO's moves, President Francois Mitterrand told his Cabinet today that France remained a "loyal ally," but was also determined to preserve its independence in relation to the alliance. The French did not take part in this week's meeting here.
NATO officials believe that the alliance has now seized the initiative by spelling out a military structure that prepares it to deal with new kinds of threats while increasing Europe's involvement in regional security arrangements.
No less significant, the officials said, while the United States will gradually reduce its troop strength in Europe in the 1990's, the new structure continues to give Washington a central role, with an American officer certain to remain the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe for the foreseeable future.
"We intend to maintain significant forces in Europe as well as a substantial capability to reinforce," the American Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, said today. "By the mid-1990's, we expect to have a corps headquarters, two army divisions and corps support elements in Europe. We will also continue to provide significant air and naval forces."
The United States now has 320,000 troops stationed in Europe, but NATO officials expect this number to be halved within five or six years.
 
What About Eastern Europe?
 In explaining the thinking behind NATO's planned reorganization, allied defense ministers said the decline of Communism in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact as a military alliance have made an East-West conflict "much more unlikely."
But they warned that uncertainties and risks remain. They pointed to the "difficult political evolution" in the Soviet Union as well as political, social, economic and ethnic problems in Eastern Europe "which could lead to crises jeopardizing overall stability in Europe." And they added, "As the gulf war underlined, risks can also arise from elsewhere."
NATO has therefore moved from a large and static military structure designed to deter a Soviet-led assault on Western Europe to a smaller one that emphasizes mobility.
Mr. Worner said the new organization would bring substantial reductions in arms spending in the long term. But he warned that in the short term it would mean additional costs. And Mr. Cheney cautioned that "you have to spend money up front in order to save money in the long term."

HEADLINE: Fujitsu Buying Maker Of Computers in Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, May 29

 BODY:
Fujitsu Ltd., the world's second-largest computer maker after I.B.M., continued its drive in Europe today by agreeing to buy Nokia Data, Europe's sixth-largest independent computer maker. The move is expected to add fuel to the debate raging in Europe about whether to increase protection from the Japanese for important manufacturing industries like autos and electronics.
"The Fujitsu strategy is very aggressive," said Daniel Lebourhis, a Paris-based analyst for Dataquest Inc. He added that the reaction in Europe to the Nokia deal "will be to be more critical of Japanese policies." 
 Under the terms of the deal, a British computer company that Fujitsu controls, ICL P.L.C., will pay 230 million ($402.3 million) for the Stockholm-based Nokia Data and assume about 100 million ($174.9 million) of its debt. Nokia's Finnish parent, the Helsinki-based Nokia Corporation, will also receive a 5 percent stake in ICL in the mid-1990's.
Nokia said it was selling the computer unit to concentrate on its businesses in consumer electronics and mobile telecommunications, areas in which it has been aggressively expanding through acquisitions.
The Nokia Data deal is Fujitsu's second big European acquisition in six months. In November, Fujitsu paid 740 million ($1.29 billion) for 80 percent of ICL, which was then Western Europe's fifth-largest independent computer maker. The remaining 20 percent of ICL is owned by Northern Telecom of Canada.
Today's deal would give the combined company fifth place in Europe's $102 billion computer market, behind International Business Machines, Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany, the Digital Equipment Corporation of the United States and Olivetti of Italy. At present Nokia ranks 15th, with a 1.2 percent share, while ICL is 9th, with 2.75 percent, according to the International Data Corporation, the market research firm.
In a telephone interview, Amit Chaudhuri, a London-based analyst for International Data, estimated that Japanese companies had 10 percent of the European computer market, counting equipment they sell directly or indirectly through others and machines that use a significant amount of their technology.
Last year, ICL had a pretax profit of 110 million ($192.4 million) on revenues of 1.61 billion ($2.82 billion). Nokia Data, which is based in Stockholm, lost more than $50 million on revenues of $1.2 billion. But Nokia Data executives said today that they were confident that the company, which has been revamping, would be profitable this year.
Nokia Data's main products are networks of personal computers that use the Unix operating system, and computer terminals; its main market is Scandinavia. ICL is one of the top 10 makers of mainframe computers and is also strong in mini-computers.
 
Moving Up in Rank
 The ICL-Nokia combination "will place the new company in the top three in the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, and together with its majority shareholder, Fujitsu, in Spain," Peter Bonfield, ICL's chairman, said at a news conference in London. He said Nokia would also strengthen ICL's position in Germany, France and the Netherlands.
Fujitsu has a majority interest in a big mainframe factory in Spain and an agreement to sell powerful large computers through Siemens-Nixdorf.
Reacting to Fujitsu's acquisition of ICL, the Europeans banned the English company from several semiconductor research projects aimed at improving the European electronics industry's competitiveness. The projects are paid for by European governments, the European Community and private industry.
But some analysts noted that the community did not block the ICL-Fujitsu deal. They added that several big European computer companies depend on the Japanese for some machines they sell or for technology and that the Americans already have a much bigger presence in Europe than the Japanese do. As a result, they questioned whether the European Community would resort to protectionism.
Those favoring protection against the Japanese have a new champion in the new Prime Minister of France, Edith Cresson. The European Community has been trying to negotiate an agreement with Japan to limit the rate at which Japanese car companies will be allowed to increase their market share in the barrier-free European market that is being formed, but community members have had trouble agreeing among themselves.

HEADLINE: Several Rioters Are Killed as Ethiopians Vent Anti-American Anger

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, May 29

 BODY:
Thousands of residents of the capital turned out today in violent protests against the American role in negotiations that they say are leading to the partition of Ethiopia among rival guerrilla groups.
Members of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, which took over Addis Ababa on Tuesday from the collapsing national army, opened fire on the demonstrators. Officials of the front acknowledged that there had been casualties, but gave no figure; reports from diplomats and witnesses indicated that 10 or more people had been killed. 
 The violence, which was quelled when the guerrillas cleared the streets this afternoon, was a reversal for a plan backed by American officials. Under the plan, the northern-based rebel front took control of the city, promising to forge a broader coalition that would replace the overthrown Marxist government.
The violence also underscored the tension between the Amhara ethnic group dominant in the capital and the northerners, from Tigre province, who dominate the Democratic Front.
The Tigreans are supposed to govern the capital until they and rebel organizations drawn from the Eritrean and Oromo ethnic groups can meet to create an interim coalition government. Under the American-mediated plan, that is to occur by July 1. The rebel factions, who want varying degrees of autonomy from Addis Ababa, forged a tactical alliance to defeat the old government.
Riots and looting broke out around the city today after radio reports here that Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said the people of Eritrea, the northernmost province, deserved the opportunity to vote on the question of independence from Ethiopia. Mr. Cohen made his remarks in London, where he has been mediating among the various Ethiopian groups.
University students and others here interpreted the report as meaning that the United States had reversed its policy favoring a united Ethiopia and now supported the separation of the Red Sea province.
"I'm very apprehensive because the demonstrations were very spontaneous," said Aminu Hussein, a political science professor at the University of Addis Ababa. "The people think they have been betrayed by the United States."
The violence began when 2,000 students and unemployed workers marched on the United Sates Embassy compound at noon, diplomats said.
Some of the marchers began chanting slogans like "Americans used to be our brothers and sisters and now they are siding with the Weyane," derisive slang for the Tigreans. Some threw stones into the compound, and an American reporter leaving the embassy was injured.
The charge d'affaires, Robert G. Houdek, telephoned Gebre Tsadkan, the rebel military administrator of the capital, asking for help. Thirty Tigrean soldiers were sent to guard the embassy, and they set up an anti-aircraft gun on a flatbed truck by the front gate.
Thousands of more demonstrators returned to the embassy three hours later, denouncing the Tigrean guards and shouting that they would fight to remove them from the capital, diplomats said. The Tigreans first responded by firing over the heads of the demonstrators, then by shooting directly into the crowd. A diplomat said one person was killed.
 
Witnesses' Accounts
 Other groups rioted around the city. A second detachment of Tigrean soldiers broke up a demonstration with gunfire, killing at least two people, according to witnesses. One witness said he saw five bodies. A Red Cross nurse said she saw the bodies of several people who were killed in a similar incident at the city's main market.
Alemseged Glamlak, a member of the Politburo of the Democratic Front, said tonight that his men had been forced to shoot at the demonstrators because they were armed "with guns, bombs and knives" and because they were involved in an illegal demonstration. Mr. Alemseged pledged that his movement was committed to bringing democracy to the country.
The marchers sporadically attacked white people, including Europeans, assuming that they were Americans. One group surrounded a car containing two American reporters and a French photographer.
The Tigreans brought order to the city by declaring from bullhorns on patrolling trucks that they were immediately enforcing a 24-hour curfew.
A senior Middle Eastern diplomat, who spoke on condition that he remain anonymous, said the violence seriously threatened a breakdown in the city.
Speaking of Meles Zenawi, the chairman of the Democratic Front who is in London, the envoy said: "He's caught between three corners. He's under pressure from the Eritreans to support their separatism, pressure from his army to support Marxist doctrine and pressure from the people of Addis Ababa who do not want to be commanded by Tigreans."

HEADLINE: Soviet Economy Letter: Reform Map?

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Two senior Soviet economic advisers, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, wrote a letter on Soviet economic change and its links to possible Western assistance that has become a catalyst for discussion between Washington and Moscow. The letter is scheduled to appear in the forthcoming issue of a Washington-based magazine, The International Economy, which translated the document and gave permission for its publication here. Following is the text of the letter.
To the Group of Seven: 
 The U.S.S.R. has entered into a stage of deep social crisis. Three developments are taking place simultaneously: transition from totalitarianism to a democratic society, transformation of the economic system, and worsening of the nationalities problem, the solution of which has been postponed for too long.
Having skipped the stage of a hidden stagnation which was obvious only to specialists, the Soviet economy finds itself surrounded by the obvious collapse of its monetary sphere, its consumer market and its capital market. Different structures of government management have become drawn into the crisis as well. Under these conditions, individuals supporting the policies of perestroika and of "new thinking" are engaged in a complicated struggle for the peaceful continuation of reforms.
A path toward economic reform throughout the entire economy of the country has become the only alternative to our present state, something which is obvious for the leadership of the majority of the republics seeking national sovereignty. The recent signs of readiness for dialogue among major political forces in the country are a signal of hope.
In April of 1991, the President of the U.S.S.R. and the leaders of nine republics signed a joint agreement formulating the terms for united actions to stave off a political crisis. The center has unambiguously expressed its intentions to allow a real democratization of power in the country, and there is now a chance to take advantage of these favorable tendencies.
A scrupulous analysis of the country's economic situation has indicated an opportunity to conduct the necessary changes. However, the excessive social tensions expected to accompany transformation on such a scale inside a military superpower would present an unjustified risk for both the country and the entire world.
A solution can be found in interaction with the world community toward the continued reform in the U.S.S.R. History shows that the success of postwar reforms in West Germany and Japan, and of the economic revival of Europe devastated by the war, was to a great extent achieved through comprehensive assistance to these countries.
 
A Plan of Action
 Meanwhile, the beginning of this year witnessed a sharp decline in Soviet production. The economy is on the verge of hyperinflation. The percentage of the population living below the poverty line is growing. Serious problems with the country's paying capacity reflect its considerable dependence on imports. Social tensions have reached a dangerous level.
It must be obvious that the absence of such a powerful state as the Soviet Union on the Euro-Asian continent could give rise to a number of most dangerous geopolitical problems. It may unleash multiple conflicts which are predetermined by a concentration of centuries-old ethnic and religious tensions.
The problem will be aggravated by a natural (under the circumstances) reduction of control over one of the world's largest nuclear potentials. All of this may cost the world considerably more than support for reform in the U.S.S.R. and assistance in creating a large democratic state which shares values common to all mankind.
That is why the joint efforts of the pro-reform forces inside the Soviet Union together with those members of the world community which support perestroika in the U.S.S.R., are vitally important.
We suggest the following. It is necessary to draft a plan allowing the provision of effective interaction between the reformist leadership of the U.S.S.R. and the Group of Seven. What we mean is the development of a detailed plan of action, for which we assume the bulk of responsibility. The group of Soviet experts involved in preparing the plan would include national republics' representatives. In addition, direct participation in the final stage of the project by the G7 experts, authorized by their respective governments, is desirable.
Once a coherent plan for reform in the U.S.S.R. is prepared, the G7 should examine the prospects and prepare its parallel plan of action. This plan will coherently formulate the scale, time limits and forms and economic assistance by the official G7 nations for the Soviet reforms.
 
Austerity and Authority
 We believe that the plan for reform in the U.S.S.R. should include:
*Precise separation of authority between the center and the republics, especially in the economic sphere, on the basis of a regional decentralization of power and federalization of the union's executive branches.
*Formulation of demands for a rigid fiscal and monetary policy.
*Liberalization of prices.
*Implementation of a wide privatization and demonopolization program.
*A strategy for rebuilding the economy, and the creation of preconditions for the country's open economic system together with its subsequent integration into the world economy.
*Ongoing efforts to create a legal infrastructure for market relations which will include the regulation of external economic relations, monetary policy and foreign investments.
*Basic directions for implementing the G7 economic assistance, in order to stabilize the socioeconomic situation in the country and insure the reforms' progress.
*Creation of mechanisms for minimum social support of population under the conditions of an unstable economy.
 
Forms of Economic Aid
 The basis of the G7 plan can include the following approach: Guarantee effective resources arriving at the proper time and place, in the required amount, and for clear-cut goals which are to be much higher than those possible under disorganized financing. As far as large-scale investments are concerned, they, in our opinion, should be closely tied with economic stabilization of the economy.
The G7 plan of action can list the scale, time limits and forms of economic aid to the U.S.S.R. as well as methods to relieve the servicing of the country's national debt and of its long-term credits. It can also include admitting the U.S.S.R. into international economic organizations, canceling restrictions and changing trade practices with the U.S.S.R., developing long-term investment programs and, finally, scientific, legal, technological and other types of cooperation.
Special attention should be paid to establishing procedures for monitoring the way in which the U.S.S.R. uses these resources, and the establishment for that purpose of the appropriate Soviet and international institutions.
Both programs can be expected to exist over a period of years with their major activities coordinated. It would be quite necessary to carefully describe and synchronize their initial steps, for example, in terms of their initial 12 or 18 months.
 
Change as Fact of Life
 We feel that by this fall, conditions favorable for the implementation of such a program might be created in the U.S.S.R. However, the official G7 meeting in London this summer will be a wonderful opportunity to reach agreements in principle, as well as to discuss technical details with the Soviet Union. It will be difficult to predict further developments in our country if the momentum is lost.
Radical democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe, due to Soviet foreign policy in the last several years, have become a fact of life. This new political orientation was confirmed during the recent Persian Gulf crisis, as well as by the position our country has taken toward events in other regions of the world.
Joint cooperation between the leading industrial powers and the Soviet Union aimed at economic stabilizaiton and the creation of a market economy inside the Soviet Union, will create a reliable base for the promotion of positive changes which are underway in today's world.
At this dramatic moment, energetic and pointed efforts made in unison by the U.S.S.R. and the world community might offer a unique historical opportunity for a new generation to live in the 21st century in an economically and politically secure world. These actions will greatly contribute to a stable and just world order.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Sanderson Wins Sixth As Yanks Rout Red Sox

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Scott Sanderson does not throw as hard as Roger Clemens. Hardly anyone does. Last night at Yankee Stadium, Sanderson tossed some pitches that could have been thrown by Roger Rabbit. They floated, they sank, they danced and they dazzled, and the Red Sox did little with them.
Sanderson pulled a Clemens out of his own bag of tricks by toying with Boston for seven innings and sparking the Yankees to a 7-0 victory. Some home run magic shot off the bats of Jesse Barfield, Kevin Maas and Steve Sax and lit up the Bronx in a scene that is becoming more and more common lately. 
 The chief reasons the Yankees won for the sixth time in their last seven games were the four quick runs they scored in the first inning and the solid outing by Sanderson.
Sanderson struck out two, walked none, limited the Red Sox to four singles and allowed only one runner to reach second. Before giving way to Steve Farr in the eighth, he threw an economical 75 pitches and retired the last 13 batters he faced. Sanderson said he could have pitched the full nine.
 
Rebound to Take Series
 "This team is hot right now," said Sanderson (6-2), who won for the fifth time in his last six decisions. "It's great to pitch for a team that is hot."
The triumph was special because the Yankees displayed the ability to rebound from a humbling loss to Clemens and take the three-game series from a team that is sitting in first place.
"This was the biggest win of the year for us," said Barfield, who slugged a three-run homer in the first. "We kept saying we got to keep the momentum going and we did."
And what would a little magic at the Stadium be without fireworks? Dennis Lamp provided some in the seventh when he nailed Mel Hall in the foot with a pitch after Sax had belted a two-run homer. Home plate umpire Greg Kosc immediately tossed Lamp out of the game and ejected Boston Manager Joe Morgan moments later when he argued the call.
Hall said nothing to Lamp, a surprise in itself, and simply shook his head as he walked to first base. Lamp said he did not throw at the batter and Hall laughed it off and joked that the slider did not hurt anyway. Maybe these Yankees are kinder and gentler, but they are also having fun and making it a bit easier for fans to watch them struggle through growing pains.
"We went out there and took it to them," said Manager Stump Merrill. "We showed we had some character. This was key for us."
Sanderson has made it easy for his teammates to watch him in his last two starts by pitching 12 straight scoreless innings and allowing a mere four hits. He left his last start against Baltimore with a five-inning no-hitter because of mild stiffness in his right shoulder and he resumed his effectiveness last night.
Boston had two singles in the first, but Sanderson escaped without damage and two double plays helped him out of the second and third innings. From the fourth to the seventh, no Red Sox batter reached base.
"We didn't do anything with Sanderson," conceded Morgan.
His starter, Tom Bolton, struggled through his third straight outing. Before Bolton registered two outs, he was staring at a 4-0 deficit. Hall knocked in one run with a groundout and Barfield smashed his three-run shot to the opposite field. Maas added a bases-empty blast in the third to make it 5-0. Barfield and Maas lead the team with nine homers each.
The Yankees had eight homers in the three games against the Red Sox and inched their way toward gaining respect from the league. They also continued breaking a nasty habit that drives Barfield crazy.
"Losing stinks," Barfield said. "There is no other way to put it. It's not a lot of fun. We're starting to get a taste of what it can be like when you win."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 DON MATTINGLY sat out his second straight game because of a jammed right pinky and will probably not play until this weekend.

HEADLINE: No Formula or Bottles For Needy Countries

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was disturbing to read in your report on the conclusions of a United States Government relief team on health deficiencies in Albania (news article, April 30) the view that infant formula and baby bottles are essentials for improving the health of children: such suggestions contradict more than a decade of experience in international health.
In almost no situation are prepared formulas essential for good child nutrition. It is far better to encourage parents to use readily available ingredients for weaning foods and foods to supplement breast milk. Such home-made weaning and supplementary foods eliminate the economic burden of purchasing prepared formulas at market prices. For families living at subsistence levels, the money saved may help insure that household food intake remains adequate. 
 Women with infants younger than four months should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively: the use of formulas in this age group leads to needless exposure to water-borne gastrointestinal diseases.
The suggestion that baby bottles are safer for feeding than cups and spoons is likewise mistaken: a baby bottle is a more effective germ incubator than a cup and spoon (and also a needless expense).
It is clear that there are many opportunities for promoting preventive health practices in Albania and other Eastern European countries: let us do our best to insure that these practices will truly give the children of these countries a healthy start in life.

HEADLINE: Let Lebanon Lead the Mideast to Peace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Keep the Peace in Lebanon" (editorial, May 7) concludes, "The way to secure Lebanon's new peace is to convert it into true sovereignty." However, you do not speak of how to disarm the militias and secure the withdrawal of all foreign troops.
The Palestine Liberation Organization refuses to disarm as long as the Palestinian question remains unresolved; Syria refuses to leave until Israel leaves; Israel refuses to leave as long as the P.L.O. is under arms; Syria will not disarm the Palestinians while Israel is in the Golan; the South Lebanon Army refuses to disband as long as the Palestinians are armed. 
 But as you say, "contrary to almost everyone's expectations, peace is taking root through much of Lebanon." The Lebanese puzzle need not remain without a solution, nor need Lebanese sovereignty and peace be held hostage to the Palestine-Israeli conflict.
Both Israel and the Arabs are looking for confidence-building measures before convening a peace conference. The Palestinians desperately need peace; the Israelis need acceptance and inclusion in the economic life of the area; Syria needs the Golan to keep its dignity intact; Lebanon needs peace to recover from 16 years of devastation. Confidence building can begin in Lebanon.
Syria can show good faith by disarming the Palestinians; the Israelis could simultaneously disarm the South Lebanon Army; the National Lebanese Army could patrol the border. A measure of tranquillity would then return to northern Israel, and Syria and Israel would have shown they are capable of taking bold steps to peace. The Palestinians, in acquiescing in their own disarmament, would show they want to be part of the solution.
Let not Lebanon remain a no man's land between Arabs and Israelis, but the mountain on which they meet to make peace.

HEADLINE: Soviets Propose New Economic Changes

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
Three advisers to the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, presented the Bush Administration today with new proposals for Soviet economic and political reforms to stabilize the Soviet economy, but they were told by Washington that they would have to make concrete steps -- not just promises -- before any American aid would be considered.
"The United States is very interested in supporting both political and economic reform in the Soviet Union," Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said after meeting the Soviet delegation. "The first step, of course, is for the Soviet Union to undertake real market-based reforms, to use incentives to tap the very great potential that exists in the Soviet Union and the considerable resources and skilled people that exist in the Soviet Union." 
 Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the Soviet economist, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shcherbakov and Yevgeny M. Primakov, the member of Mr. Gorbachev's national security council responsible for economics, presented what they called a "revised anti-crisis" program to Mr. Baker; Michael J. Boskin, the White House economic adviser, and the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Robert B. Zoellick, as well as to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.
American officials had considered the first anti-crisis program, introduced by Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov several months ago, as woefully inadequate, because it called for a strengthening of centralized control of the Soviet economy to stabilize it in the short run, later gradually introducing privatization of property and free-market changes.
 
Plan for 'Crisis Situation'
 The new version was drawn up after the agreement on April 23 between Mr. Gorbachev and nine Soviet republics, shifting some powers from Moscow to the republic leaders, and it reflects their requests for more economic freedom.
"We just presented the Secretary of State with the Soviet Union's latest Government plan for coming out of the crisis situation," said Mr. Primakov, emphasizing that it was a draft and did not yet contain any specific dollar request for Western aid. "What it calls for is primarily liberalization, privatization, destatization, the liberalization of prices, and getting away from the policies of the administrative structure that had been existent previous."
American officials said they wanted to study the Soviets' proposals and would be giving some formal response in the coming weeks. The Soviets also promised that Mr. Yavlinsky would provide a fuller elaboration next week of the new Soviet plans, as well as proposals for what sort of help Moscow would like simultaneously from the West to help ease the transition to a free market.
Mr. Yavlinsky and Mr. Primakov have been working on an aid-for-economic-reform plan since April, with the apparent backing of Mr. Gorbachev. Two weeks ago, Mr. Yavlinsky came to Harvard University, where his team of Soviet economists has been working with some American economists on the details.
 
Incremental Western Aid
 The Soviets apparently want to finish the plan so that it will be ready for consideration by the Group of Seven industrial nations at their economic summit meeting on July 15-17 in London. Mr. Gorbachev, who wants to attend the meeting, might try to use the finished proposals as his ticket for getting an invitation.
"We would like to learn more about some of the new ideas that have been just presented to us -- some changes or refinements in the economic reform program of the Soviet Unon," said Mr. Baker. "We want to learn a little bit more as well about Mr. Yavlinsky's effort jointly with others. We're going to be receiving some information on that over the course of the next couple of days. And then I think we will be in a position to determine how best we can help at this time."
Bush Administration officials, along with several Congressmen with whom the Soviets met Tuesday, say they made clear to the visitors that while Washington wanted to be helpful, and would be responsive to real economic and political changes in the Soviet Union, any American financial aid is only going to come in relatively small, incremental doses, and only after the Soviets have actually taken concrete steps toward a free market, not simply promised to do so.
Some American officials say they believe that the American economists from Harvard and other universities who have been advising the Soviets in preparing their proposal may have given them an exaggerated sense of what Washington is able and willing to do.
"We want to inject a little realism into their expectations," an Administration official said. "The London economic summit is not going to be the day the Messiah comes. Gorbachev may have decided that no economic reform is possible without massive Western assistance. Our message is that reform is necessary no matter what, and that as they take steps down that road, the conditions for Western aid and private investment will change as well. But if the Soviets think they are going to get a $100 billion up front, there is just not going to be that kind of safety net. It is going to have to be an evolutionary thing."
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and met the Soviets on Tuesday, said he found them talking in terms of a simultaneous extension of Western aid and the carrying out of economic changes.
"I don't think that is politically feasible," Mr. Hamilton said. "My reaction was that they are going to have to proceed on this not with the idea of some grand design, mega-treaty and massive infusion of aid, but rather on some kind of step-by-step basis, in which we are prepared to extend some assistance after we see specific implementation of reforms. You are not going to see large-scale economic assistance at this time because of concern about pouring money down a bottomless drain."
Mr. Yavlinsky and Mr. Primakov have jointly written an article for the coming issue of the journal The International Economy, a copy of which was made available today, in which they laid out the broad outlines of their plan. They said the plan, when completed, should be reciprocated with a "parallel plan of action" for economic assistance by the seven leading industrial nations.
They said that any plan for economic changes for their country must include programs for a precise separation of authority between Moscow and the republics, especially in economic areas; formulation of rigid fiscal and monetary policies; liberalization of prices; putting into effect privatization and demonopolization policies; efforts to create a legal structure for free-market relations, and a plan for the use of any assistance from the West.

HEADLINE: New York at Work;
The Woman Who Counts the City's Cash

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
If New York City were to run out of cash -- as city officials have feared was possible -- how would anyone actually know?
This is, after all, a city government that maintains more than 1,000 bank accounts at 27 institutions, makes out more than 200,000 paychecks every two weeks as part of its $14.8 billion payroll and is inundated with a blizzard of sanitation- and parking-fine payments, state and Federal agency transfers and a variety of other receipts. And just to make life more difficult, the city transfers very little money electronically. 
 But not to fear: Tina Lubin is on the case. This demure 44-year-old freckled and bespectacled public servant spends her day figuring out the city's cash position and raises a red flag to her boss, the City Comptroller, whenever she sees the balance getting dangerously low.
 
She's the One
 "In terms of cash, she's the person," said Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the financial rating agency.
It was Ms. Lubin, the city's financial analysis bureau chief, who warned the Comptroller in February that the city would not be able to make a $250 million payroll commitment on May 10 if it did not borrow more money from the bond market, which it promptly did. And it was she who pointed out that the city's cash balance was getting precariously low in March -- down to about $10 million -- until a certain state check for $165 million finally arrived.
"If we hadn't called, I think we'd still be waiting for it," said Ms. Lubin, who has learned to think of $10 million as a rounding error. "It doesn't matter what they say until it arrives."
The amount of cash the city has on hand on any given day is far from an aca demic issue. It became of increasing concern to bondholders and city officials in recent weeks, when the Comptroller's office warned that the city was in danger of running out of the precious commodity by mid-June without action by the State Legislature to make up for the $1.8 billion in state aid that the city has been expecting to help repay notes and meet other claims.
Investors cared, of course, because it increased the risk that the city could default on its bonds. Politicians were concerned because if that were to happen -- or if it seemed very likely to -- the State Financial Control Board would be required under state law to step in to help manage the city's finances, wresting some control away from the city's elected officials.
 
Financial Sleuthing
 In the financial statements the city distributes to potential investors whenever it sells bonds, it boasts that it has developed a cash forecasting system that enables it to predict its daily cash balances. But what that really seems to amount to is the Lubin Method.
Think of Ms. Lubin as something between a forensic scientist and a detective. Every day she and the 10 financial analysts she supervises fan out across the city in search of evidence. The checks written by the city are the easy part; the city's Financial Information Services Agency keeps track of them, generating a daily computer list for Ms. Lubin's department with special codes indicating what each check is for. The city pays her a salary of $79,500 a year.
But tracking the money coming into the city's coffers takes a little more effort. Ms. Lubin's group sends an emissary 17 floors down in the Municipal Building to the Finance Commissioner's office to pick up photocopies of all the big checks that came in the day before, as well as copies of any tax payments that were made.
And they send someone to the eighth floor to pick up photocopies of hand written cash receipts filed with the Bureau of Accountancy showing how much various agencies have received. They also get computer tapes or daily statements from Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust showing how much came in to those banks, which receive the bulk of the city's tax revenues.
 
Check by Check by Check
 Armed with this information, Ms. Lubin and her team begin to sift through the raw data, assigning each large incoming check to a category on a handwritten ledger sheet. Many checks lack details, including commas to quickly delineate millions from thousands. Was this check from the state for education aid or public assistance? Was this receipt for the general corporation tax or the unincorporated business tax? Always laborious, the process can also be somewhat circular: a check for $25 million will probably prove to be from the city's stock transfer tax because that is what Ms. Lubin's team expected the amount to be in this case.
They keep going until they have identified to their satisfaction incoming receipts of at least $5 million and outgoing checks of $50,000 or more.
That done, they compare what the city actually took in and paid out with what they expected the city to take in and pay out. Discrepancies alert them to a potential problem -- or in a good year, to an unexpected windfall.
The work sheet they use to compare actual cash flows is itself something of an achievement. Each fiscal year, which starts July 1, they analyze the Financial Plan and Message of the Mayor that emanate from City Hall, every official statement that the city produces when it sells bonds and, line by line, the city's capital budget.
But they do not stop there. In the 13 years that Ms. Lubin has worked for the Comptroller's office, she has developed a certain skepticism for the numbers that city agencies generate in their budgets. It is her department's job to decide how realistic they are, and how much cash it believes will really be generated or spent. The conclusions are often not the same as what the administration estimates.
 
Billions and Pennies
 "It's not a science, it's an art," Ms. Lubin said. "You have to really understand the city." Before joining the Comptroller's office in 1978, she spent 11 years working in the back-office operation at Manufacturers Hanover Corporation. She has an economics degree from Brooklyn College and while in her current job earned a master's degree in business administration from Pace University.
A native of the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, Ms. Lubin said her zeal to keep track of the city's cash has not had any influence on her personal spending habits. "There's no relationship between dealing with billions and dealing with pennies," she said.
Some of her group's analysis is straightforward. It knows, for instance, that the bulk of the payroll is generated on the 15th and 30th of each month and usually is made in installments of $250 million. It knows that the bulk of real-estate tax payments arrive in July and January.
Other items, however, are harder to predict. Once she has read and assimilated the various financial plans and budgets, Ms. Lubin goes to the Office of Management and Budget and analyzes its numbers. She asks for back-up material to support certain numbers. She queries agency representatives in ways intended to elicit the real thinking behind a particular number. Why do they think their head count will decline by 2,000 in a particular department? Why do they think their payments to the city's pension system will rise by $50 million in a given year?
 
A Financial Road Map
 Back on the 22d floor of the Municipal Building, in her corner office -- which has an enormous piece of steel scaffolding jutting through the ceiling while work is under way outside her window -- Ms. Lubin makes her own estimates for revenues and expenditures, plugging in her own office's economic analysis. At the end of the process, she uses a computer to come up with a forecast of how much the city is likely to spend and take in during the year, and then she allocates those cash flows day by day.
With that, she has the equivalent of a road map to the city's daily cash position. A monthly version of her work sheet is circulated to the Finance Department, the Office of Management and Budget, the rating agencies, the Financial Control Board and the State Comptroller's office.
Recently the City Council and even some State Senate staff members have asked for her work sheet. "Right now, everyone is asking for it," Richard Halverson, a deputy comptroller, said with a laugh.
Ms. Lubin acknowledges that on any given day her work sheet may be off -- usually, she says, because a check from the state has not arrived. But as a trend indicator it has proved highly reliable, certainly enough to allow her to see whether the city will be able to make large coming payments.
When Ms. Lubin believes the city is moving into the danger zone, the Comptroller goes into the equivalent of red alert. Last week, for instance, the office announced that instead of taking six days to pay city vendors after they presented bills, the office would now take 28 days.
"Their information systems are good," Mr. Grossman of Standard & Poor's said of Ms. Lubin and her team. "They're certainly far better than they were 15 years ago."

The Bedoons: Outcasts in the Land They Served

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, May 25

 BODY:
Ahmed waved his hand toward a water truck that lurched to a stop next to a shoulder-high pile of garbage, one of hundreds that line the streets of his neighborhood, Jalib al-Shuyukh.
"You see that tanker of water?" Ahmed said. "We have to pay for that water. For Kuaitis, water is free. For us, we have to pay. You know why? We are Bedoons." 
 Ahmed, who like other residents said he was afraid to give his last name, is a Bedoon. No one knows how many Bedoons were here before Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, but estimates range from 150,000 to several hundred thousand. They are on the margins of Kuwaiti society, regarded neither as Kuwaitis nor any other nationality. They are officially stateless. Now they hover in a limbo of disquiet and resentment.
"I was taken by the Iraqis on Aug. 3 because I was in the Kuwaiti Army," Ahmed said. "They came and got us. I was in prison until I came back on March 27. Now I do nothing. I went to headquarters three times. I asked our officers when I could come back to my job. They say 'Not yet.' Every time, they say 'Not yet.' "
 
In the Army or the Police
 A Bedoon man's best hope was for work as a policemen or in the army. Now, however, the Kuwaiti Government is seeking to purge the country of all non-Kuwaiti Arabs. The 300,000 or so Palestinian residents are the largest such group, and the Bedoons are second. For even though many Bedoons were born in Kuwait and serve in its security forces, the Government does not consider them to be Kuwaitis.
In the last century, and more so in the early decades of this one, nomadic shepherds, most from Iraq but indifferent to national boundaries, settled in Kuwait. Because they were not rooted in the pursuits of the original families of Kuwait -- fishing, trading or pearl fishing -- they remained apart from the society that formed the modern state.
These people became known as Bedoons, from the Arabic word for "without." They are not to be confused with the Bedouins, the dwindling number scattered across North Africa, Sinai and the Arabian Peninsula who retain their nomadic ways.
 
Garbage and War Debris
 The Bedoons are settled. They became Kuwait's street sweepers and garbage collectors, the menial laborers on the fringes of one of the world's most luxuriant economies. They remained stateless, citizens of no country.
 Jalib al-Shuyukh is a slum of compact cement apartment buildings, small apartments crowded by large families, a district wallowing in months of garbage and war debris. The blue-uniformed street sweepers employed by Waste Management, the American trash removal concern, are not seen here.
On crumbling steps, crouched in glass-strewn lots or on abandoned automobile seats, young Bedoon men gather in the late afternoon to assess their plight, discuss missing family members and wonder about the future.
"I myself am jobless," said one, who gave his name only as Mohammed. "My father is a soldier, a technician in the Kuwait Army. I was born in Kuwait but I cannot get a job. No one here can get jobs."
His words evoked murmurs of agreement from a growing audience of fellow Bedoons.
The fate of these Kuwait City Bedoons is not very different from that of some 5,000 Bedoons who languish in a refugee camp of blue and orange tents in Abdali, just yards from the Iraqi border.
 
Disavowed by Kuwait
 Most of the Bedoons in Abdali traveled back and forth between Kuwait and Iraq during the seven-month occupation, just as they had in earlier years. They were in Iraq with their flocks of sheep, their loads of rice or blankets when the cease-fire was declared in the Persian Gulf war, joined the tide of refugees fleeing the Iraqi Army's suppression of a Shiite Muslim rebellion and ended up in Abdali.
A few weeks ago, there were more than 11,000 Iraqis, mostly Shiites, in a neighboring camp run by the American military. But those refugees were transferred to new camps in Iran and Saudi Arabia, leaving only the Bedoons to endure the increasingly frequent sandstorms that howl across northern Kuwait at this time of year.
Although many of the Bedoons in the Abdali camp were born and raised in Kuwait, the Government here has disavowed them, refusing to allow them to re-enter.
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, met recently with Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, and raised the issue of the Bedoons on the border. According to an official traveling with the Prince, Sheik Saad declared, "The Bedoons are not Kuwait's problem."
A senior officer at the American Embassy said the issue of the Bedoons is raised in virtually every official conversation with the Kuwaitis, but that the Government shows little willingness to confront the problem.
The residents of Jalib al-Shuyukh say they are equally ignored. Suleiman, a young man from the neighborhood, spoke with despair of his postwar life.
"I was born here," he said. "My father died here. He was a shepherd, from the desert. I was a sergeant in the army, in engineering. During the occupation, I moved from house to house because the Iraqis were searching for me. I changed my I.D. And now I have no job, no work, no money. The army said not to come to work."
He patted the side of a decrepit blue pickup truck. "I have this," he said. "I use it as a taxi and make a bit of money. But if the army doesn't want me, what will I do?"
Because so many Bedoons were in the army and the police, many of them died in the first violent days of President Saddam Hussein's takeover. But the Kuwaiti Government has acknowledged none of this. Khalid, a student at Kuwait University, told his father's story.
"My father was in the army," he said. "Six months ago, the Iraqis came and took him. He is lost. We don't know anything about him. We ask the Government and they say nothing."
"As for me," he said, "I don't know if I can go back to the university. They have said nothing."
He stopped for a moment, and then asked, "Why are they ashamed of us?"

Neiman Has Net Loss Of $7.3 Million

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Neiman Marcus Group Inc., one of the nation's largest retailers of luxury goods, yesterday reported a net loss of $7.3 million in the fiscal quarter ended May 4, against a net profit of $4 million in the corresponding 1990 period.
While third-quarter sales rose 5.8 percent, to $392.3 million from $370.8 million, the company, based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., said profits were hurt by heavy markdowns at its Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casual store chains. The widespread use of sales and discounts to improve sluggish business is a problem that many other retailers, including Macy's, May Department Stores, the Dayton Hudson Corporation and the Limited, have been facing. Most of those chains' recent financial reports also reflected losses or lower profits.
Noting that the economy remained sluggish in the quarter, Richard A. Smith, the Neiman Marcus Group chairman and chief executive, said: "Despite the softness and significant disruption within a number of major stores that are being remodeled, we were able to maintain comparable revenues at approximately the same level as a year ago. Operating expenses were held below plan, with selling, general and administrative expenses improving as a percent of revenues."
Operating earnings fell 9.16 percent, to $17.6 million from $19.2 million. But the company said that $17.3 million of operating earnings represented obligations concerning employees of Carter Hawley Hale Stores.
The Neiman Marcus Group was established in 1987 out of Carter Hawley Hale holdings by the General Cinema Corporation, which owns about 60 percent of the group's stock. But in February of this year, Carter Hawley filed for voluntary bankruptcy, raising the likelihood that the Neiman Marcus Group will be responsible for benefit payments to certain Carter Hawley employees.
Otto F. Grote, a longtime retail analyst at Derby Securities in New York, said that companies like the Neiman Marcus Group were being hurt not by a cyclical decline in retail sailes, but by "a sea change" in consumer attitudes.
"Not only is the more affluent public moving away from buying high-priced clothing accessories," he said, "but it prefers to spend on the home, for leisure and entertainment." Mr. Grote also noted that big downtown stores were continuing to be hurt by increased shopping in suburban areas, especially in shopping centers.
In a breakdown, the Neiman Marcus Group said that the Neiman Marcus stores, which include the Horchow mail-order division, had improved sales and operating earnings while Bergdorf Goodman, which has two stores, both in Manhattan, "continued to reflect the depressed New York City retailing enviironment."
Bergdorf's sales did rise, but the rental costs of the new Bergdorf men's store brought lower margins and operating earnings, Mr. Smith said. Contempo Casuals had a strong sales gain and higher operating earnings in the quarter before start-up expenses connected with the opening of Pastille, a new women's clothing chain.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Announcement by Nissan Sends Platinum Tumbling

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The global platinum market was shaken yesterday after the the Nissan Motor Company, the Japanese auto maker, said it had developed a catalytic converter that uses palladium instead of more expensive platinum to remove pollutants from motor vehicle exhausts.
As a result, platinum prices tumbled first in Tokyo, then in London and New York, while palladium prices soared. Within the platinum group of metals, only rhodium is used with its sister metals in exhaust antipollution devices. The other members of the platinum family are iridium, osmium and ruthenium, all hard, corrosive-resistant metals used for products as diverse as pen points, phonograph needles and the linings for jet engines. 
 But the price movements in platinum and palladium were tempered by memories of a statement made by a Ford Motor Company executive in December 1988 indicating that Ford technicians had found a substitute for platinum in its catalytic converters.
"Nothing further was heard about Ford's breakthrough, but the platinum market has still to recover from the damage caused by that statement," said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals specialist at Prudential Securities. "What effect the Nissan announcement will have is not clear, but it will not be good. About 40 percent of the 3.7 million ounces of platinum mined last year went into these antipollution devices."
As measured by the closing prices at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the spot July platinum delivery settled at $376.70 an ounce, down $20.50, while the spot June palladium contract climbed $5.80 an ounce, to $99.05. During most of the session at the New York Merc, most platinum contracts were locked down the daily permissible limit of $25 an ounce, while most palladium deliveries were frozen at their daily price-fluctuation limit of $6 an ounce.
Other negative factors weighing on platinum and palladium prices in recent years, Ms. Raptopoulos noted, were the weak economy and sluggish industrial demand and high levels of Soviet sales of both metals. While South Africa mines about 70 percent of the world's platinum, the Soviet Union accounts for 1.7 million ounces, or half the palladium output.
William B. O'Neill, a metals specialist at Merrill Lynch & Company, offered a somewhat more optimistic view. "Our information is that it will take Nissan four or five years to substitute palladium for platinum and then only in its smallest vehicles," he said. "The general view in the metals market is that European car makers may try to emulate Nissan, but that Detroit is willing to spend up to $25 on platinum used in its larger models rather than spend millions on finding a substitute for the metal at this time."
In any event, Mr. O'Neill recalled that the Ford statement caused platinum prices to fall the daily limit for three consecutive session, with the unrestricted spot delivery losing $99 in that time. "We don't think the reaction to the Nissan announcement will be anything near that damaging," he said.

Dollar Ends Mostly Higher On Stock and Bond Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher yesterday, supported by higher United States stock and bond prices.
Gold prices also rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for June delivery settled at $363.10 a troy ounce, up $1.90. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $2.10, to a late bid price of $362.50 an ounce. 
 Trading was somewhat light earlier in Europe, with German banks closed for a national holiday. The dollar moved on technical factors until talk of a large buy order prompted a brief flurry of buying late in the session.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues climbed 30.86 points to close at 3,000.45. Bond prices also advanced across the board, with the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue gaining more than $7.50 per $1,000 in face amount.
 
Economic Reports Help
 The dollar also drew support from a string of fresh economic data, which indicated the economy might be recovering. The Government reported that personal income and new-home sales rose during April, while initial jobless claims declined during the week ended May 18.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 137.68 Japanese yen from 137.60 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 137.85 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 137.80 yen, down from 138.10 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7155, from $1.7315 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.7124 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7275.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7200 German marks, up from 1.7137; 1.4645 Swiss francs, up from 1.4610; 5.8350 French francs, up from 5.8145; 1,279.50 Italian lire, up from 1,273.00, and 1.1453 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1476.

HEADLINE: STATES AND CITIES WITH DEFICIT WOES MAY SLOW REBOUND

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30

 BODY:
States and municipalities across the country plan to raise taxes and cut spending by tens of billions of dollars in the fiscal year that begins July 1, and economists fear that the money this takes out of consumers' pockets could inhibit recovery from the recession.
Edward M. Gramlich, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan who is studying the situation for the Congressional Budget Office, has concluded that belt-tightening by state and local governments could send unemployment up one-half of one percentage point nationwide and much more in New York, California and New England, where fiscal problems are the worst. 
 "This will make it more difficult to pull out of a recession this summer," Mr. Gramlich said in an interview.
 
Estimated $50 Billion
 By some calculations, the tax increases and budget cuts by state and local governments could total $50 billion in the next fiscal year. The economic effect would be the same as that of a comparable cut in the Federal budget deficit. And the political difficulties in achieving deficit reductions of this magnitude could be as great as they were when President Bush and Congress struggled for months last year to reduce the Federal deficit by almost $50 billion.
The prevailing, although by no means unanimous, view among economists is that the recession that began last July will bottom out in the late spring or summer and that the economy will return to a path of slow growth. The economists expect that to happen even though for the first time since World War II, the Federal Government is not stimulating the economy.
 
'Significant Economic Drag'
 David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, predicted that the steps the states were taking to eliminate their budget deficits would result in "quite a significant economic drag" and would "reinforce the recession" in many states. Mr. Hale, a native Vermonter, is an adviser to Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont and pays close attention to state budget issues.
Few states have completed their budgets for the next fiscal year, so the amount of tax increases and spending reductions cannot be calculated precisely. But the National Conference of State Legislatures, the foremost authority on the subject, estimates that 21 states must deal with a total projected budget deficit of more than $35 billion in the next fiscal year. That figure represents a two-year deficit for a few states that operate under biennial budgets.
Unlike the Federal Government, states by law cannot operate in the red. While some states may disguise part of their deficits with accounting gimmicks, almost all the $35 billion will have to be eliminated by raising taxes or cutting spending.
Ronald K. Snell, fiscal program director of the Conference of State Legislatures, expects the states to enact about $15 billion worth of higher taxes and to eliminate the rest of the deficits by spending reductions.
Hal Hovey, publisher of an authoritative newsletter called State Budget and Tax Notes, estimates that more than 60 percent of Americans will be hit with a state tax increase in this calendar year.
No one has tallied what is happening at the local level. But cities, counties and school districts across the country are having to cut back. Professor Gramlich and Mr. Hale said they would not be surprised if state and local tax increases and budget cuts beginning July 1 totaled $50 billion, about 1 percent of the country's gross national product.
 
'Imagine All the Screaming'
 "Can you imagine all the screaming if Congress were involved in a $35 billion deficit-reduction package in the middle of a recession?" asked Brad C. Johnson, who runs New York State's Washington office.
Numbers like the $35 billion and $50 billion estimates should be viewed with caution, said Robert Rafuse, an economist who specializes in fiscal issues at the Federal Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. In New York and many other states, he added, the governors, legislatures and mayors are angling so hard for tactical advantage that "it's hard to figure out what's behind all the political smoke and mirrors."
But whatever the exact size, the states' actions on deficit reduction will "hamper the recovery from the recession or deepen the recession," Mr. Rafuse said.
State and local government finances always operate in accord with business cycles. When times are good, they rake in more tax money, and their spending for welfare and other social programs falls. In a recession, tax revenues are down, and the demand for social services rises. To balance their budgets, they must raise taxes and cut spending, steps that tend to worsen the economic situation.
In Washington, President Bush and Congress seem determined to stick with the Federal deficit-reduction measure enacted last fall. That means taxes will probably not be reduced, and spending will probably not be increased for such programs as extended unemployment benefits. As a consequence, the Federal Government will not be providing the kind of economic stimulus it did during other recent recessions.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, said that one reason the states' fiscal tightening seemed to be having more economic effect than it had in past recessions was that during the 1980's many responsibilities were shifted to the states from the Federal Government. States do not have the option the Federal Government had, at least during previous recessions, of maintaining spending and tax levels and operating at a deficit.
 
More Cuts Than in the Past
 "If the states are spending a larger share for highways or housing or education or whatever," Mr. Reischauer said, "it means you are likely to get a greater reduction in spending or increase in taxes associated with an equal-sized downturn in the economy."
Another reason that the situation may make it more difficult to pull out of this recession, said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany, is a rapid rise in Medicaid and education costs, and that means other state programs must be cut more. Nationwide, state spending for Medicaid, the medical insurance program for the poor, could go up as much as 25 percent in the next fiscal year, and school enrollments, which fell during the early 1980's, are now rising rapidly.
A third explanation is that state spending rose so fast in the boom of the 1980's that the effects of a slowdown are magnified. "States have been on a phenomenal growth path," Mr. Rafuse said. "So when you fall off, you hit the ground pretty hard."

Pan Am Joins Trump in Lower Shuttle Fare

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Seeking to attract more leisure travelers, the Trump Shuttle yesterday offered a $119 weekday round-trip fare between New York and Washington or Boston. The Pan Am Shuttle quickly matched it.
Business travelers, who often grumble at paying $284 round trip, will find it hard to take advantage of the new fare because of some stiff restrictions. Tickets must be purchased 14 days in advance and can be used only from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. and from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. 
 Harris K. Herman, president of the Pan Am Shuttle, said, "It would be worth looking to see whether we can find some price-sensitive people in this market."
In October the Trump Shuttle started a $119 fare on weekends, but Mr. Herman said Pan Am had not matched that because there seemed to be no movement of passengers to his competitor.
Reservation agents at the Trump Shuttle were besieged by callers yesterday who wanted to book the low fare.
Joan C. Fudala, the director of corporate communications for the shuttle, said that by late afternoon more than 700 people had booked the fare and that hundreds of calls were still coming in.
She said the Trump Shuttle introduced the weekend fare in October because it wanted to test its appeal and has found that it attracted several hundred extra travelers.
She said the fare was intended mainly to attract leisure travelers, many of whom have cut back on travel because of the recession.
Although business travelers, who can rarely plan two weeks ahead, will find it difficult to use the fare, some will be able to because it does not require a Saturday night stay.
The Trump Shuttle's share of the market has hovered at about 47 to 48 percent. When Eastern owned the shuttle, it normally held at well over 50 percent, but a strike by the unions at Eastern in 1989 devastated its traffic and cut its share to about 20 percent.
 
Still Losing Money
 Donald J. Trump took control of the shuttle from Eastern in June, 1989 with $380 million in bank loan. Thus the shuttle was saddled with heavy interest costs.
Even though it was able to struggle back by refurbishing its planes and coaxing back the business traveler, the shuttle has remained largely a money-loser.
A recent analysis of the filings at the Department of Transporation showed that the carrier has lost $128 million since it was bought by Mr. Trump.
Some analysts believe that there is too much capacity in the market.
"It's a one-shuttle market but it's got three and a half shuttles in it," said Edward Starkman, the airline analyst for Paine Webber.
In addtion to Trump and Pan Am, both of which fly from La Guardia airport, Continental runs hourly flights to Washington and Boston from Newark Internaitonal Airport. Meanwhile Northwest Airlines has built up service between Newark and National Airport in Washington.
"It was great when Eastern was operating the shuttle," Mr. Starkman said. "It was a jewel. Now there are too many players in the game."
 
Steadily Increasing Fares
 The cost of flying the shuttle has also escalated. In December 1989 Mr. Trump raised the one-way fare from $99 to $119, where it stayed until August. Then, because of the huge rise in fuel costs resulting from the war in the Persian Gulf, it rose to $129. In October, it rose another $10, to $139. On Dec. 1, a $3 charge was added to offest a tax on airline tickets, making the ticket price $142.
Since companies pay for most business travel, most of the increases have been absorbed without a large loss in business traffic. Leisure travelers, however, have been put off by the high fares.
Last August, thanks to an agreement with its lending banks, the Trump Shuttle was able to come out from under the burden of its high interest costs. Since then it has taken in more cash than it needs to cover its operations. It has also cut costs, reducing its flights on weekends and using the planes and crews for charter flights, which have brought in $15 million in revenue in the past four months.
In addition, the shuttle managers are engaged in negotiations with NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, to reach an agreement under which Northwest would operate the shuttle.
Such an agreement would give the shuttle a way to cut its high maintenance costs, which it now must bid out on the open market. Its fleet of aging Boeing 727's, which require more intensive maintenance because of frequent take-offs and landings, could use the in-house services of the larger carrier.
Northwest, which has an extensive route network in the East, could also feed passengers to the shuttle while building up its presence on the East Coast.
