HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Against Yen On Harder U.S. Trade Stand

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen in late trading yesterday after a senior American official warned that Washington would use its own trade laws to force Japan to open its markets if negotiations with Tokyo failed to produce results.
The remarks by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, contrasted with his softer comments on Monday and with the progress to reopen the long-stalled American-Japanese trade talks. 
 Both nations agreed yesterday to widen trans-Pacific trade talks to include the financial-services sector and reopened the negotiations later in the day.
In an interview published yesterday in The New York Times, Mr. Kantor said the Clinton Administration would not wait for all trade issues with Japan to be settled in a so-called framework or package deal.
"When you are ready to reach agreement on a particular sector," Mr. Kantor said in the interview, "you should go ahead and finalize that and continue to move forward on the other areas."
 
Isn't 'Going Soft'
 But yesterday afternoon, Mr. Kantor, speaking in Paris, said: "Our goals and strategies have not changed. We will open the Japanese markets either through the framework or through U.S. trade laws."
He added, "One thing I have never been accused of is going soft."
 The remarks spurred fears that the Administration might eventually pursue a stronger yen as a means of curbing the United States' $60 billion trade deficit with Japan if trade talks fail again.
"With the tone of these comments being more aggressive than recent statements, this provided the perfect excuse to sell the dollar," said Bill Arnold, chief dealer and vice president at the Chemical Bank in New York.
After trading in a narrow range most of the day, the dollar fell to 104.17 yen in late New York trading, from 105.29 yen on Monday.
The dollar had fallen sharply against the yen after trade talks collapsed in February. But this week Mr. Kantor signaled a softening of the American stance that had encouraged dollar buyers -- until yesterday, that is.
"If Kantor is resorting to these terror tactics against Japan, it probably means things aren't getting done and the market should not be too long dollars right now," said Randolph Donney at Pegasus Econometrics in New York.

Dell Computer Closes Out Bad Investments

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 7

 BODY:
Continuing to shore up its financial position, the Dell Computer Corporation said today that it had closed out some bad financial investments that had forced the company to take a charge in the first fiscal quarter and would require a charge in the second quarter.
The personal computer company, based in Austin, Tex., had announced its strategy to get out of the investments last month when it released its first-quarter earnings, which were surprisingly strong despite a charge of $26.3 million for losses related to the investments. 
 Dell, like some other companies, had invested in interest-rate derivatives, betting that interest rates would hold steady or fall. When interest rates rose, Dell lost money and took a charge of $15.6 million in the quarter on the derivatives. The value of derivatives is derived from underlying securities like stocks, bonds or currency.
Dell also took a charge of $10.7 million for losses on other investments in the first quarter that ended on May 1.
Thomas J. Meredith, the chief financial officer of Dell, said the company had gotten out of the remainder of its derivative investments and short-term investments with exposure to the principal. The company has said that closing such investments is expected to result in an after-tax charge of about $6.9 million in the second quarter, which ends on July 31.
 
Credit Changes Planned
 Shares of Dell rose 62.5 cents, to $28.25, in Nasdaq trading today.
Mr. Meredith, speaking at a technology investors' conference in New York, also said Dell expected to restructure and expand a revolving credit arrangement with a group of banks led by Citibank to $90 million, from $75 million. The company also said it was renewing an asset securitization program -- a financial instrument that allows assets to be used as collateral against borrowings -- with Barclays Bank P.L.C.
Dell had cash and lines of credit of about $487 million at the end of its first quarter.
The latest actions, coming on the heels of a good first quarter during which Dell's gross profit margins rose, showed that the company had made substantial progress in improving its operations, said Antoine Tristani, an analyst with the Southcoast Capital Corporation in Austin.
"Everything is finally coming together for them," Mr. Tristani said. He said Dell had a strong balance sheet for a company of its size and expected the company to introduce its redesigned notebook computers during the second quarter.
"The key issue for the company is revenue growth," he said, noting that revenues had been stalled for the last three quarters. "They're in the best position now to get revenues going than they have been in a long time."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A History of Hedging"
 
1992: In November, an analyst suggested that Dell had accounted improperly for speculative foreign-currency trades. The Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation.
 
1993: In February, the S.E.C. completed the investigation but said it would continue to monitor the company's practices.
 
1994: In April, Dell said it expected losses from derivatives. In May, Dell took a $15.6 million charge for losses onderivatives and a $10.7 million charge on other investment losses but still reported higher-than-expected earnings. Yesterday, Dell announced plans for a $6.9 million charge in the current quarter to close out its position in derivatives.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Bid To Press Peace On Bosnia Foes

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, June 8

 BODY:
The United States has decided to support a European strategy for ending the war in Bosnia that envisions possible punitive steps against either warring party that does not accept an emerging peace plan, senior American and French officials said today.
President Clinton told the French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, in a meeting on Tuesday that it was important for American, Western European and Russian negotiators to work as one to complete a map dividing the country, present it to the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croatian federation based in Sarajevo, and make clear that there would be consequences if either side rejected it, the officials said. 
 In particular, Mr. Clinton said the Americans and the Europeans would have to consider suspending the stringent economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, which supports the Bosnian Serbs, if the Sarajevo Government rejected the plan and the Serbs accepted it.
Until recent months, the Clinton Administration insisted that it had no intention of producing a map for Bosnia. But Clinton aides said that in meetings with French officials on Tuesday, the President said the United States would work to refine a map that gives the Muslim-Croatian federation 51 percent and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent of the country's territory.
Both factions reject the 51-49 split. The Bosnian Serbs, who would have to give up nearly a third of their captured territory under the plan, say it is too much. The Government in Sarajevo, strengthened militarily by the recent federation with the Bosnian Croats, is insisting on 58 percent.
The American embrace of the European position, which was hinted at publicly both in Mr. Clinton's speech to the French National Assembly on Tuesday and in subsequent news briefings by senior Administration officials, reflects a subtle shift by the Administration.
Publicly, the Administration has vowed not to impose a peace settlement on the Sarajevo Government, which American officials at times have called the "aggrieved party." That is still the formal American position, as a senior Administration official briefing reporters on Tuesday said more than once.
But in the last few weeks, as the United States has become directly involved in hammering out a detailed peace settlement in a "contact group" with Western European and Russian representatives, it has had to face the issue of what to do if the parties do not agree and if the French and other nations with troops in the Balkans carry out their threats to withdraw them.
In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton pointed out that the group "is working on a map, which can be the basis of a full and final cessation of hostilities," adding, "We must do all we can to get both sides to embrace it."
 
Clinton Presents Strategy
 Although Charles Redman, the Administration's special envoy on Bosnia, has offered proposals for a map and has discussed various scenarios in the contact group, what was significant for the French was that Mr. Clinton himself came to Paris and presented them with what they described as a pragmatic, workable strategy for resolving the Bosnia crisis.
"Clinton presented us with a much, much clearer picture, much more realistic, than we have ever received from the Administration," said a senior French official, who only months before had excoriated the Americans as unhelpful. "He really seemed to fully comprehend our concerns."
Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Balladur, and a subsequent meeting with President Francois Mitterrand, offered a clear sign that Washington is now willing to put more pressure on the Serbs and the Bosnian Government to make peace.
What particularly struck Mr. Balladur and his aides, French officials said, was that it was Mr. Clinton who brought up the issue of a possible lifting of the sanctions, a idea that had been repeatedly broached by the Europeans and steadfastly refused by the United States.
"The President did discuss what type of consequences would arise under different scenarios," a senior Administration official said. "There would be particular consequences if either the Serbs or the Muslims refused or delayed an agreement."
 
Issue of Ending Sanctions
 The official cautioned, however, that the Administration did not believe that the Serbs would accept the plan and the Bosnians reject it. Even if that were to happen, he said, "lifting the sanctions is still an issue that is not settled."
Since last November, the Europeans have promoted a plan that includes rewarding the Serbs with a progressive lifting of the sanctions if they moved toward peace, a position the Americans have never endorsed.
The emerging American position coincides with an agreement by Bosnia's warring factions in Geneva today to end the fighting for a month so the United Nations can work out a more durable truce. The length of the cease-fire was a concession to the Bosnian Government, which has argued that the four-month cease-fire favored by the Serbs would allow them to solidify their territorial gains.
But a senior Administration official traveling with Secretary of State Warren Christopher from Paris to Istanbul, where he will be attending NATO meetings, played down the importance of the cease-fire. "Cessation of hostilities is not the answer to war," he said. "The answer to war is a negotiated settlement."
The official characterized the United Nations cease-fire in Geneva as "yet to really take off." By contrast, he described the negotiations under a joint American, Western European and Russian initiative as a more substantial effort that has been "moving right along."
Mr. Clinton assured the French that he had no intention of violating a United Nations-mandated arms embargo and unilaterally arming the Bosnian Muslims. But he described the pressure from Congress to lift the embargo, saying that if there were no peace agreement by the fall, he expected that the House of Representatives would follow the lead of the Senate and pass a resolution endorsing such a move.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D., Seeking Wider Membership, Signs Russian Pact

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 8

 BODY:
Signaling that it is no longer an exclusive club of rich nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development signed its first cooperation agreement with Russia today and declared itself ready to welcome new members from Eastern Europe and Asia.
The 25-nation organization, which monitors and analyzes the economic performance of industrialized countries, said it would talk with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia about membership and expected an application from South Korea. 
 In a further break with its past, the O.E.C.D. said it would also seek a dialogue with China, which, it noted, "has become in many respects a leading player in the world economy." Only free market democracies are allowed to join, but experts believe the organization could sign a cooperation agreement with China.
 
Advocating Broader Role
 Opening the Paris-based organization to broader membership has the strong backing of the United States, which argues that the O.E.C.D. can not only stabilize Europe following the end of the cold war but also bridge the industrialized world and the fast-growing economies of Asia.
"The United States sees a broader role for the O.E.C.D. and also encourages its reform," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today. "The community of market democracies is not a closed club. It is open to open societies. It is open to open markets. It is open to freedom everywhere."
In addressing the group's annual ministerial meeting, Mr. Christopher gave priority to completing "the unfinished business of postwar reconstruction" in Eastern Europe. "Europe must not be split into zones of prosperity and poverty, stability and insecurity," he said.
Mr. Christopher called Russia's integration with the West "the best investment we can make in our security." He hailed today's cooperation agreement, which will let the O.E.C.D. provide Moscow with Western expertise on legal, structural and statistical reforms.
Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who signed the accord, welcomed it as "a real step forward in the future integration of our country into the world economy." He said Russia could profit from advice on economic laws, foreign investment rules, banking and privatization of state enterprises.
 
Revising Its Mission
 The decision to become more international is a turning point for the O.E.C.D., which emerged from an organization created in 1948 to help enact the Marshall Plan. Until now, it has functioned as a low-profile "think tank" that devoted much time to economic studies for its member states.
In a statement today, ministers agreed to start negotiating membership status for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. "I think we're talking in terms of 15 to 18 months," said Canada's External Affairs Minister, Andre Ouellet.
Japan, which is the only Asian O.E.C.D. member, also favored negotiations to admit South Korea to the group in 1996. Japan's envoy, Nomuo Matsunaga, told today's meeting that "the O.E.C.D. should also commence a dialogue with China."
But Ireland's Foreign Minister, Dick Spring, said China's human rights record would influence the extent of the organization's contacts with Beijing.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner, warned against expanding too quickly. "We must not so widen our membership that our work becomes shallow," he said.
The O.E.C.D. is also under pressure to diversify its work. On Tuesday, it offered policy recommendations to reduce unemployment in the industrialized world. It has now been asked to study the impact of trade on labor, investment and the environment.

HEADLINE: Legacy of '93 Flood: Sand, Sand and More Sand

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTSBURG, Mo., June 3

 BODY:
First came the flood, which tore nearly 500 holes in the farm levees along the Missouri River last year and drowned $150 million in crops.
Now the water is gone, but the rampaging river left even greater trouble: millions of tons of sand that have transformed miles of fertile bottom land into a desert landscape of blowing grit and shifting dunes, in some places five feet deep. 
 Nowhere in the Midwest was the agricultural damage from the 1993 flood as extensive as it was here in Hartsburg and the other farm villages that hug the Missouri River. The Soil Conservation Service, a unit of the Federal Department of Agriculture, estimates that of the 945,000 acres on the Missouri River flood plain, 455,000 were damaged by sand scoured from the bottom of the river and erosion.
Reclaiming the flood plain, for generations Missouri's most productive farmland, could cost $500 million, the Soil Conservation Service said. Perhaps 200,000 acres have been permanently ruined by sand.
"It's an awful mess," said Orion Beckmeyer, who before the flood last summer grew corn and soybeans with his brother, Glen, on their 900-acre farm here on the Hartsburg bottom along the Missouri River.
The brothers estimate that perhaps 100 acres are beyond help, and as Orion Beckmeyer climbs into the cab of his four-wheel-drive tractor, he scowls at a landscape of water, sky and sand so foreign it could pass for the New Jersey shore.
"The good thing is that the flood brought this community together," he said. "The bad thing is that we got years of work putting this place back together. No matter what we do, the land will never be as good as it was."
While luckier neighbors nurse along the corn and soybeans they planted on undamaged land, this will be the second successive year that the Beckmeyers will not harvest a crop. Nor are they alone. Along the 498 miles of the Missouri River that runs through this state, hundreds of farmers are trying to reclaim sand-covered land by turning over their fields with immense plows. They hope to mix the sand on top with more fertile dirt that lies beneath it, giving their ground enough organic matter to support a crop next year.
But when the sand is more than two feet deep, plowing is useless, said Russell C. Mills, the director of the Soil Conservation Service in Missouri. "In a lot of places out there we have sand five feet deep," Mr. Mills said. "The river turned the best farmland in the world into a giant sandbox."
The extent of the damage surprised farmers in the flood plain. But the possibility of such devastation had been anticipated for decades by Government hydrologists and engineers, Mr. Mills said.
The Missouri River, called "The Big Muddy" by people around here, naturally carries five times the amount of sediment as the Mississippi River above Cairo, Ill. The Missouri River also falls swiftly, twice as fast as the Mississippi.
Hemming in such a river with dikes and levees, as most hydrologists are quick to point out, invites trouble during flooding. The high walls increase the depth of the water, concentrate the river's energy, and accelerate the current. In a river like the Missouri, fast water scours the bottom, digging beneath the rich layer of dirt that usually lies there and churning up sand instead. Anywhere along the way that is flat will cause the river to slow down and the sand will drop out.
In 1944, as the United States began to invest heavily in flood-control structures on the Missouri, Congress anticipated problems. In the plan that they approved that year, the lawmakers proposed to build Federal levees 1,500 to 2,500 feet back from both banks of the Missouri.
The idea was to give the river up to a mile of open space in high water, thereby dispersing the energy of floods across a larger area, particularly around river bends where the damage is generally most severe. By designing a system of farm levees that gave the river room, Congress sought to reduce the velocity of the water and limit the amount of sand that would be scoured from the bottom and deposited on farm fields.
But the proposal was rejected by farmers, many of whom had already built their own levees right on the Missouri's banks, and were loath to move them. Over the years, those levees were built higher and stronger by farmers and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. By 1993, the Missouri River was essentially a huge, man-made channel.
Last summer during the flood, the Missouri ripped the levee system apart with a vengeance that still leaves farmers and agricultural officials awestruck.
 
Wrath of the River
 What occurred here on the Hartsburg bottom was typical. The river blasted several openings in the levee and at each one poured through with the same violence as if a dam had collapsed. At the biggest break, the gushing water scoured a gaping hole in Mr. Beckmeyer's field that was 70 feet deep across 40 acres. Vietnam veterans here say bombs from B-52's did not cause such large craters.
As the water poured onto the bottomland, it swirled around three of Mr. Beckmeyer's metal grain bins, causing a whirlpool that dug a 12-foot hole into which the bins fell. They lie now in a toppled heap, as though they were pins hit by a giant bowling ball.
It wasn't until the flood waters had spread well onto the Hartsburg bottom that the current slowed, depositing sand from the holes and the river on Mr. Beckmeyer's fields.
In all, the flood punched 465 holes in the Missouri River's levees, according to an estimate by the University of Missouri's Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute. The research institute said that 546 million cubic yards of sand ended up on farmers' fields -- enough to create a pile in Central Park 406 feet high, as high as some 30-story buildings.
Last month, in a draft report, a committee of Federal experts convened by the White House discussed at length the damage along the Missouri River. The committee recommended that the Government seriously consider reviving the 50-year-old Congressional plan for giving the Missouri River more space. "The flood of 1993 demonstrated the need for some form of floodway to provide greater capacity to convey flood flows," the committee said.
Environmentalists in Missouri and in Washington support such a change in policy because it would reduce economic losses in floods and restore some of the river's natural systems.
But the recommendation has produced nothing but catcalls from farmers and has all but been ignored by the Clinton Administration. Last year, the White House and Congress approved legislation that provided over $300 million to repair levees across the Upper Mississippi River basin. Although work along the Missouri has proceeded at a slower pace than along the Mississippi River, the Army Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies overseeing the repairs say they have no plans to halt contracts or move levees back.
The reason is the same in 1994 as it was in 1944. Farmers, who hold considerable political power in Missouri, want to protect their land from any flooding, and levees built directly on the banks, they say, are the best way to do it. Never before, they added, had the river done as much damage as it did in 1993 and they are willing to take the chance that a comparable flood will not occur for decades.
This week, after months of delay, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the final contract to repair the Hartsburg levee surrounding the Beckmeyers' farm. "I'd heard that because of this new report, maybe the Government was having second thoughts about fixing the levee," Orion Beckmeyer said. "It's taken a long time to get the work finished. But when they let that contract, we all felt a little better."

HEADLINE: U.S. Shifts Stress to Haiti Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
Encountering more opposition than it expected on military intervention in Haiti, the Clinton Administration sought today to signal a shift in its policy by voicing a new confidence that economic sanctions would succeed in ousting the Haitian military leaders.
In separate appearances, both Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, played down the prospects of military intervention while trying to bolster the notion that sanctions would work, even though they have failed to budge Haiti's military for more than a year. 
 Both officials said a surge in cooperation from other countries had finally created an effective embargo that they said should be given some time to squeeze the Haitian military and their wealthy supporters.
And Mr. Gray suggested that the United States and several other countries planned to tighten the sanctions even further this month, to ban all commercial air traffic and financial transactions between Haiti and other countries.
 
'Higher Degree of Confidence'
 "Not only are we committed to exhausting all political, diplomatic and economic instruments available to us to achieve a peaceful multilateral solution to this problem, but as a result of what's happened in recent days we have an even higher degree of confidence that that is indeed possible and it certainly is our hope," Mr. Talbott said at a news briefing, referring to recent talks in which Latin American and Caribbean allies have backed tougher sanctions.
One Administration official said the increased emphasis on sanctions and the decreased emphasis on intervention was "a tactical shift."
Part of that shift results from the Administration's encountering far more opposition to its talk of military intervention than it had expected -- in Congress, among the American public and among other countries.
And part of the shift results from the Administration's new-found belief that tougher sanctions just might work, especially now that the Dominican Republic, the only country that borders Haiti, has pledged to crack down on smuggling.
Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Gray said the new, tougher sanctions would increase the Administration's chances of pressing Haiti's military to cede power.
To turn up the pressure on the Haitian military's rich supporters further, he said, the United States and other countries are looking into denying visas to wealthy Haitians who support the military as well as freezing their assets.
"I have confidence that the sanctions can create an environment where people come to their senses," Mr. Gray said, noting that business supporters of Haiti's military are rethinking their allegiance. "We have a responsibility to try every arrow in the diplomatic quiver to make sure the coup leaders step down."
Mr. Gray and Mr. Talbott in no way ruled out the use of military force, saying repeatedly that the United States had important national interests at stake in restoring democracy to Haiti. But Mr. Gray said no United States invasion was imminent.
Mr. Talbott indicated that the Administration would not wait forever for the sanctions to work. "We do feel a sense of some urgency here, for the very simple reason that people are dying," he said.
Administration officials acknowledge that with all their talk about the urgent need to oust Haiti's military leaders quickly and about perhaps using force to do so, the Administration runs the risk of being criticized for backing off if it does not invade Haiti within weeks.
Sanctions, mainly on oil and weapons, have been in effect on and off for more than a year, but the Haitian military seems no closer to stepping down. Although Administration officials boasted early this year that the embargo represented the toughest sanctions ever enforced in the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Gray dismissed those sanctions as porous and piecemeal.
On May 21, new United Nations sanctions took effect that ban all trade with Haiti except for food and medicine.

Haitians Confront U.N.
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 8 (AP) -- Police and armed civilians stopped two cars carrying United Nations observers Tuesday night, smashed their radios and seized a handgun, United Nations officials said today. It was one of the worst confrontations since the observers arrived in 1991.
The chief of the United Nations human rights observer mission in Haiti protested to the commander of the Haitian armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras.
Hours before the incident, the army-installed government threatened to arrest Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was appointed last year by Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr. Malval had said that Haitians would be more likely to support American troops than their own military if the United States invaded.
Shouting epithets against international observers, about 20 armed Haitians stopped a United Nations vehicle carrying two security officers on the road from Petionville to Port-au-Prince, said Eric Falt, a United Nations spokesman.
Another vehicle carrying Haitian employees of the United Nations was stopped minutes later. The armed men seized one weapon and three portable walkie-talkies and destroyed two radio phones, Mr. Falt said, adding that United Nations personnel were not harmed.

HEADLINE: After Humdrum Primary, California Candidates Gird for Tough, Costly Races

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8

 BODY:
The 1994 California races for Governor and the United States Senate got officially under way today after a round of lackluster primary voting on Tuesday that routinely produced the expected nominees.
The fall contests shape up as anything but routine. 
 In the primaries for governor, Republicans renominated Gov. Pete Wilson and Democrats chose Treasurer Kathleen Brown, setting up what promises to be a hard-fought contest.
Ms. Brown, a 48-year-old moderate liberal, is the third member of the Brown political dynasty to seek the California governorship. Her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, served from 1959 to 1967, and her brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., served from 1975 to 1983.
Mr. Wilson, a 60-year-old moderate conservative, is an experienced, resourceful campaigner who, like Ms. Brown, is sometimes mentioned as having national ticket potential.
The race, Mr. Wilson vowed this morning at a Republican breakfast, will fought over real issues, "not what your family was."
He is also expected to press the crime issue, betting that Ms. Brown may be vulnerable. California voters now say that crime, not the flagging economy that the Democrats have focused on, is their biggest worry, and Ms. Brown, though she has promised strong measures to fight crime, opposes capital punishment.
In the Senate race, the Democratic nominee is the incumbent, Dianne Feinstein, a 60-year-old moderate liberal, and the Republican candidate is Representative Michael Huffington of Santa Barbara, a 46-year-old moderate conservative.
That contest also shapes up as a close one.
Senator Feinstein is expected to dwell on Mr. Huffington's limited political record and his limited residency in California. He has been active in politics for under three years and has been a resident of California only slightly longer.
"He's a legislative cypher," she said today in the opening shot of her campaign.
Mr. Huffington will probably try to paint Ms. Feinstein as a big-government, big-spending, high-tax liberal. "She's a career politician who never had a private sector job," he scoffed today.
And each has raised questions about whether the other has paid enough income tax over the years.
But ultimately, another kind of money -- campaign money -- may decide the Huffington-Feinstein contest: the race could turn out to be the most expensive Congressional election in history.
Mr. Huffington, whose wealth from family oil investments in Texas has been put at $75 million, spent $6 million to win nomination on Tuesay and vows to spend an additional $10 million, if necessary, to win in November.
Ms. Feinstein, who also has considerable family wealth and, further, is regarded as one of the best political fund-raisers in the country, promises to come up with at least $10 million.
The spending record for a Congressional race is $25.9 million, set in the 1984 Senate race in North Carolina.
From a national perspective, both the Senate race and the governor's race will be watched closely.
 
Presidential Hints
 California is the most populous and politically powerful state, so what happens here in November will hint at Presidential prospects in 1996. Further, the outcome of the Huffington-Feinstein race will help determine whether Democrats retain control of the Senate and whether the small contingent of women in that body shrinks. Republicans would need to wrest seven seats from Democrats to take over the Senate.
Political analysts and polltakers say the crucial accomplishment this fall for the nominees in both the races for governor and the Senate will be to win back party members who favored some other candidate on Tuesday.
While none of the four nominees were seriously challenged in the primaries -- the results seemed so preordained that only about 40 percent of registered voters turned out -- the balloting did produce evidence of soft support for some candidates. So for the fall contest, the timeless political work of protecting and strengthening support will be crucial.
 
Halfhearted Unity
 Those efforts got under way first thing this morning, though hardly smoothly for Mr. Wilson.
At a Republican unity breakfast here, the Governor called for "a very unified party." But the Governor's primary opponent, Ron Unz, a right-leaning computer millionaire, avoided a direct endorsement of the man who beat him with 62 percent of the vote, offering instead general support for Republican candidates who espouse "party principles and policies."
The unity pitch went better for Ms. Brown during a press conference at which she was joined by other Democrats who won nomination on Tuesday. One after another they rose to offer their support to her effort to unseat what she called "the Rip Van Wilson Administration, which wakes up once ever four years, just in time for an election."
Ms. Brown came out of the Tuesday primary with comfortable double-digit leads over two opponents, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and State Senator Tom Hayden.
Still, Mr. Wilson could take more comfort from the results of a Los Angeles Times survey in which voters were questioned as they left the polls on Tuesday. Almost 50 percent of the Republicans who chose Mr. Unz said they would be back with Mr. Wilson come November. Less that 20 percent said they would vote for Ms. Brown.
Of Democratic voters, roughly a third of those who voted either for Mr. Garamendi or Mr. Hayden said they would go with Ms. Brown in the fall. But another third said they would vote for Mr. Wilson.
In the Senate primaries, surveys of voters leaving the polls found support for Ms. Feinstein and for Mr. Huffington to be about equally solid, with both assured of getting the votes of two of every three members of their respective parties in the fall.
Ms. Feinstein faced no serious opposition in the Democratic primary.
Mr. Huffington handily defeated his one major opponent, former Representative William E. Dannemeyer of Orange County.
There were several other notable political developments in the Tuesday balloting.
In the Democratic contest for the nomination to run for secretary of state, the Acting Secretary, Tony Miller, defeated Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles and Michael Woo, a former Los Angeles councilman and mayoral candidate. Should Mr. Miller win in November, when his Republican opponent will be Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno, he would be the first openly gay candidate elected to statewide office in California.
In the race for the Democratic nomination for treasurer, a former state Democratic party chairman, Phil Angelides, defeated the former president pro tem of the State Senate, David Roberti, who had earlier fended off a recall effort led by members of the National Rifle Association.
Mr. Roberti, author of several gun control bills, ran out of money in the treasurer's race, having used up much of his financing in the earlier fight against the recall.
And in Palm Springs, the former mayor, the entertainer Sonny Bono, won the Republican nomination for Congress. His Democratic opponent will be Assemblyman Steve Clute.

HEADLINE: MTV Worker Dismissed Over Cuba Concert

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 8

 BODY:
After complaints by the leading Cuban exile group, the fledgling Spanish-language network of MTV has dismissed an employee here who was helping to organize a private tour to Havana for a concert by a Cuban singer.
The employee, Maria Romeu, an assistant to the managing director of MTV Latino, was dismissed on Monday, five days after an official of the Cuban American National Foundation called the network. The network said the group had complained that material promoting the Havana trip, in which MTV Latino is not involved, had been faxed from the network's corporate offices here. 
 The exile group contends that travel to Cuba is immoral and violates the economic embargo against Cuba that has been American policy for three decades.
A spokesman for MTV Latino, Nelson Benedico, said Ms. Romeu "was terminated for one very simple reason, which was that she used the company name and resources for a personal matter."
A letter of dismissal sent to Ms. Romeu this week also accused her of "jeopardizing the company's image" by creating the impression that MTV Latino, which began playing music videos in Spanish and English in October, was involved in "highly sensitive and political activities."
 
Questions of 'Public Image'
 "Clearly, this has called into question the company's reputation and public image in the community of Miami," said the letter, dated June 6 by the network's personnel director. "In addition, there are potential ramifications and consequences that have placed the company at risk at our corporate level."
Mr. Benedico said he was not sure what the letter meant by a "risk" to MTV Latino, and the personnel director referred all inquiries to Mr. Benedico. But Mr. Benedico said it would be "absolutely ludicrous to suggest that we were worried about bomb threats" or advertisers' boycotting the network, two tactics that have often been employed against those who run afoul of exile groups here.
Ms. Romeu said, however, that MTV Latino officials had been unhappy that the network was carried on only one cable television system in the Miami area, which has the most affluent Hispanic population in the United States.
The network recently began playing music by the Cuban singer Carlos Varela, whose concert in August in Havanna was the focal point of the tour Ms. Romeu was organizing. She said that MTV Latino "deliberated for six weeks" over whether to use the video because of concern about possibly violating the Trading With the Enemy Act or alienating powerful Cuban exiles here.
 
Coup Becomes Morass
 The network, which cultivates the same hip image as its English-language counterpart, appeared to have achieved a coup by playing the video shot in Havanna and featuring a performer who is regarded as the voice of Cuba's disgruntled youth. But, as often happens in Miami on all matters Cuban, politics has intruded.
The focal point of the dispute is Mr. Varela, a 31-year-old singer and songwriter who lives in Havana but is admired by some young Cuban-Americans here. In recent years, Mr. Varela has developed a large underground following among Cuba's young people, and has irritated the Communist Party elite that has ruled Cuba for the last 35 years, by writing songs about the country's problems.
MTV Latino, which has an estimated 3.5 million subscribers in Latin America and the United States, has been broadcasting a video of Mr. Varela, "Robinson," since May 23. The song was taken from the compact disk "Coins in the Air," which was released in the United States last year but is still unavailable in Cuba because of its political content. It is a rock parable that includes references to the collapse of the Soviet bloc and suggests parallels between the isolation of Robinson Crusoe and the Cuban nation.
Mr. Benedico said MTV Latino would continue to play the video despite the dispute over Ms. Romeu's involvement in a rare officially sanctioned performance by Mr. Varela that is scheduled for August. But Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said her group objected to any effort to portray Mr. Varela as a courageous dissident.
"He is part of the system," she said. "The Cuban government is using Varela to make people think there are changes taking place in Cuba and that you can have internal dissent."

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's plan to impose new global sanctions against North Korea for its defiance of nuclear inspectors has run into strong resistance from Japan, throwing into question the effort to impose strict financial sanctions against the Communist Government.
The Japanese, concerned about North Korea's reaction, are balking at a quick cutoff of the hundreds of millions of dollars that Koreans living in Japan send back to relatives in the North. Combined with China's reluctance to exert greater pressure on North Korea, the sharp debate threatens to greatly reduce the pain inflicted on the North. 
 Japan has said it would abide by any sanctions imposed. But in private, officials say, Tokyo has been arguing against Washington's plan, which would set a deadline for North Korea to open its nuclear complex to United Nations inspectors, and halt financial transfers if the North refused to comply. Instead, Japan wants to issue another warning and another vague threat of sanctions.
"We are in agreement on the overall goal of bringing the North Koreans back to the negotiating table," a senior Japanese official said tonight. "But stopping the remittances of funds is a very heavy sanction. Our differences are over the weight of the sanctions and the timing."
The Japanese are worried about North Korea's threat to launch a war against South Korea if sanctions are imposed, as well as possible uprisings or terrorism by the 250,000 Koreans in Japan who have links to the North -- mostly the descendants of Koreans brought to Japan as slave labor during its occupation of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
Japanese officials also fear that a halt in the North's biggest supply of hard currency could trigger widespread suffering among the people.
"We look at the funds differently than the United States does," a senior Japanese official said last week. "They see this money as something that props up the North Korean Government. We see it as largely something from Koreans in Japan who want to help their families."
Though estimates vary greatly, intelligence agencies believe that Koreans in Japan send $600 million to $1.8 billion to North Korea every year, a huge figure in a country whose gross domestic product is only about $20 billion a year.
Intelligence officials say almost all of the money winds up in the Government Treasury or in the pockets of Government officials.
Ever since North Korea began unloading spent fuel rods from its 25-megawatt nuclear reactor last month, yielding a supply of plutonium that could produce four or five nuclear weapons, Washington's coordinator of North Korean policy, Robert L. Gallucci, has sought a United Nations Security Council resolution that would get Pyongyang's attention. Cutting off the financial transfers has been crucial to that strategy.
Japanese officials have said that even if the Security Council votes to block the transfers, they doubt it is possible to stop all of them.
Much of the money is reportedly cash carried by hand by Korean-Japanese with North Korean passports. They visit North Korea via a ship that runs between Niigata, Japan, and North Korea, or by plane through Beijing. A good deal of it originates in the pachinko industry, a game similar to pinball that is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
Japanese authorities say they could impose limits on the cash that individuals could carry abroad. But they argue that it would be virtually impossible to stop money transfers through banks in Hong Kong, Switzerland and elsewhere.
Japan has also argued that lesser sanctions would help bring China aboard. China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, was quoted recently in the official China Daily as saying, "Sanctions are not a sensible choice, as they would only aggravate the crisis."
While officials on all sides say the differences are over tactics rather than strategy, the impact on Washington's relations with Japan could be considerable. The United States has supported Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the Security Council, and Tokyo's handling of the crisis is widely regarded as the greatest test of its ability to take a leading role in regional security.
Mishandling the standoff could also bring down the fragile minority Government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mr. Hata has reportedly been arguing for a more aggressive stance by Japan, but the opposition Socialist Party, with long and strong links to North Korea, holds the deciding votes when a no-confidence resolution is presented in Parliament, perhaps as soon as this month.
South Korea's President, Kim Young Sam, is now taking a far harder line against the North than at any point in his 16 months in office. Today, at the first meeting of the country's National Security Council since 1991, Mr. Kim made it clear that he would not settle for anything less than a full accounting of what the North has done with its plutonium.
"North Korea's development of nuclear weapons is intended for use not against other countries but against South Korea, and thus their program should be stopped at any cost," the President said. But Government officials here say that "at any cost" does not include a military strike on the North's nuclear facilities.
 
North Seeks Talks With U.S.
 KIEV, Ukraine, June 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Foreign Minister of North Korea said today that international inspectors would be allowed to visit its nuclear sites again if the United States resumes negotiations to resolve their differences.
The official, Kim Young Nam, said at a news conference during a three-day visit to Ukraine that if talks were resumed, North Korea would "provide full technical support for the preservation and measurement" of fuel rods removed from a North Korean nuclear reactor.
[The State Department quickly rebuffed the offer, saying the withdrawal of fuel rods had made further inspections moot.]
Last year, the United States and North Korea held two rounds of talks on the nuclear issue. "The problem can only be decided between them," Mr. Kim said.

HEADLINE: Mutual Fund Bailout;
Paine Spends $33 Million to Cover Losses, But the Gesture Proves Troubling to Some

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
Some Wall Street executives were likening it to the arrival of Santa Claus to the securities markets: For the second time this spring, a brokerage firm said it would inject millions of its own money into a mutual fund to rebuild investors' confidence.
Paine Webber Group Inc. said yesterday that it would put $33 million into its popular Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund, which has attracted $1.7 billion from investors since it was started in 1990. The fund has suffered as a result of losses in the fixed-income market this spring. 
 Now, in part as a reaction to a class-action lawsuit, the brokerage firm will partly cover the losses in its mutual fund and pay the lawyers who represented the investors who sued. [Page D7.]
The question in the financial community yesterday was: Has a socialistic principle invaded the free markets of Wall Street? But that may miss the point. It may be that in the wake of the sharp decline in the bond and stock markets this year, there is a fear among money managers of a loss of investor confidence, especially because a lot of small investors were not aware of the risks that they were taking or were misled about the risks by money managers.
Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday that he was generally pleased by Paine Webber's action, noting that investors had been shocked to learn that some funds with the soothing word "government" in their titles were not as secure as they sounded.
But he conceded that the movement to repair the damage of markets that had gone bad could backfire. "I don't think it's gone too far yet," he said. "But if the notion were to prevail that it is in the interest of fund managers to subsidize the performance of all funds, that would be very distorting to the market."
Paine Webber's generosity is troubling to believers in a free-market economy in which investors should enjoy the gains and tolerate the pain of a market's ups and downs.
"The danger is that people will expect that if you lose a little money, some Santa Claus is going to step up and make you whole," said William Fitzpatrick, general counsel of the Securities Industry Association. "I think the better thing to do is to educate people that there is risk in the market."
But consumer advocates generally applauded the recent moves in which investors were assisted after having been given the wrong impression about the potential risks of an investment.
"Brokerage firms are seeing that they have commitments to live up to," said Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America.
Earlier this spring, the Piper Jaffray Companies, based in Minneapolis, made the first move to shore up investors' confidence in a mutual fund. It said it would invest at least $10 million in its Institutional Government Income Portfolio Fund, which had dropped by more than $3 a share from a peak of $11.62 in January. Piper also said it would waive the management fees in several other "closed-end" funds that traded on the New York Stock Exchange -- an attempt to offer a small compensation for the losses from this year's volatile fixed-income market.
Mutual funds will feel increasing pressure to put up some extra cash when losses occur, said Arthur Abbey, a New York lawyer who represented a group of investors against Paine Webber. "I think it would be very hard now for a firm that experiences the same thing to take a position different to Paine Webber -- and every firm has one of these things," he said, referring to the short-term government-bond category of mutual funds.
Mr. Levitt said he had heard of "a number of instances in recent weeks and months" in which fund managements had decided to inject money to keep money market mutual funds from falling below $1 a share -- a level at which consumers expect money market funds to consistently trade. Mr. Levitt said fund managements were padding money market funds in this way "more so today than in any time in recent memory."
 
Good Performance, at First
 Indeed, the very securities that had caused Paine Webber's problem appear to have helped the same mutual funds' performance until the crisis in the fixed-income markets in the spring, Wall Street experts pointed out yesterday.
To be sure, Paine Webber's was not a simple case of investors taking a hit because a market had gone haywire. The fund's prospectus said it retained the right to trade in mortgage-backed securities, which are backed by pools or groups of home-mortagage loans, and which hurt the Paine Webber fund and scores of other mutual funds. But the prospectus also said the fund had no immediate plans to exercise that right.
A spokesman for Paine Webber said that while its portfolio manager probably had not broken the letter of the law, the firm had decided to bail investors out because, "We chose to take the high road and say, 'Look, we're not hanging our hats on any legalese.' "
The firm felt that the risks in the fund had not been communicated fairly to investors, who saw it as very safe, the spokesman said.
Mr. Abbey, the class-action lawyer, said the key issue was that the prospectus had not disclosed "the illiquidity of these assets," meaning that investors had not been warned that the mortgage-backed securities market could end up with no buyers.
"It's a liquidity issue more than a disclosure issue," he said, acknowledging that Paine Webber could have pursued a legal battle in which it contended that it had left open the option of buying the mortgage-related securities that ultimately caused such trouble.
Those who worry about the trend to make up investor losses point to many markets that are deemed highly liquid one day only to turn out to have no buyers the next. In October 1987, even the New York Stock Exchange was such a market, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 500 points.
If precendents are increasingly set by mutual fund complexes to make investors whole when markets turn sour, or when brokers misrepresent products, it could also create an uneven playing field. Large firms like Paine Webber can choose to take multimillion-dollar losses to increase investors' confidence, while less well-heeled funds may not.

HEADLINE: Rifkin Gets Maximum Sentence for Murder

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., June 8

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who confessed to killing 17 women, was sentenced today to 25 years to life in prison for murder by a Nassau County Court judge who described Mr. Rifkin's crimes as "brutal and horrific."
Mr. Rifkin, 34, showed no emotion as he stood before Judge Ira H. Wexner, who, in response to a request from the defense, said he would recommend that Mr. Rifkin be given psychiatric care and counseling in prison. 
 Mr. Rifkin was convicted last month of killing Tiffany Bresciani, 22, whose body was found in the back of his pickup truck after he was stopped by the state police for a traffic violation. During questioning, he admitted killing 16 other women, who he said were prostitutes he picked up in Manhattan.
Jurors quickly rejected his claim that he was temporarily insane when he killed Ms. Bresciani.
 
More Charges Await
 Unshaven and wearing a rumpled white shirt, baggy gray pants and brown loafers, Mr. Rifkin shuffled from the courtroom in leg chains and handcuffs. Law-enforcement officials said he would be transferred to the care of state prison officials in Brooklyn until his next court appearance, perhaps Thursday, when a pretrial conference is to be held in Suffolk County Court, where he faces charges in two more killings.
Judge Wexner, in giving Mr. Rifkin the maximum allowable sentence of 25 years to life, told him, "During the entire course of this trial, you never once exhibited any feelings of remorse."
He also sentenced Mr. Rifkin to an additional 2 1/3 years in prison for endangering the lives of the state troopers in the chase before his arrest almost a year ago, on June 28.
Before sentencing, the prosecutor, Fred Klein, said: "Joel Rifkin is, in my opinion, best described as a killing machine. What he did to Tiffany Bresciani was not impulsive. It was very deliberate, premeditated and methodical."
Mr. Klein read a letter in court from Cheryl Bresciani, the victim's mother. Of her daughter's death, Ms. Bresciani wrote: "I live one day at a time. Nothing seems to relieve the agonizing pain."
Cheryl Bresciani was not in the courtroom today, but relatives of three other victims sat quietly, tears welling in their eyes, during the sentencing.
Margarita Gonzalez, the sister of Jenny Soto, 22, who the authorities say was strangled by Mr. Rifkin, said she wanted to thank Tiffany Bresciani.
"Although she was not my sister, I feel for what she went through," Ms. Gonzalez said. "And if it wasn't for her, Joel Rifkin would still be out there."
 
'His Tortured Existence'
 Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, John Lawrence, said he was "not surprised by the verdict and sentence, considering the circumstances."
Mr. Lawrence had argued that Mr. Rifkin was a paranoid schizophrenic who suffered from delusions and was therefore unable to know that he was killing his victims or that it was wrong.
"It's only through proper psychiatric care and treatment that Mr. Rifkin will find peace from his tortured existence," Mr. Lawrence said.
Mr. Rifkin will try a new insanity defense in the Suffolk murder trial, said his lawyer in that case, Martin Efman. Mr. Efman said he hoped to show that as an adopted child, Mr. Rifkin suffered from a wide range of emotional problems, including hypersensitivity to rejection that caused him to kill his victims in a murderous rage.
Mr. Efman said he would call as his chief defense witness Dr. David Kirschner, an expert on adopted killers, who has developed a psychopathology he calls adopted-child syndrome.
Mr. Rifkin told psychiatrists who testified in his first trial that he believed his mother, like his 17 victims, was a prostitute. He will seek court release of his adoption papers to determine if any genetic clues in his background can explain his behavior, Mr. Efman said.
Mr. Rifkin also faces murder charges in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
In the Suffolk case, Mr. Rifkin is accused of murdering Leah Evens of Brooklyn and Lauren Marquez of Sunnyside, Queens, both 28. In his confession, Mr. Rifkin told when and where he picked up both women in lower Manhattan, how he strangled them and where he buried them in the resort areas of Southampton and Westhampton Beach.
If convicted, Mr. Rifkin faces an additional 25 years to life for each killing. If found not guilty by reason of insanity, his attorney expects that Mr. Rifkin would spend the rest of his life in a state prison for the criminally insane.

HEADLINE: New Fuel for the Fed's Rate Fire

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has found another argument to justify its attempts to shove inflation ever lower with repeated increases in short-term interest rates.
Buttressing his argument with a new Federal Reserve study, he is contending that the central bank can increase the productivity of the nation's people and factories by at some point pushing consumer price inflation even lower than the 2.4 percent for the year that ended in April. The reasoning goes that lower inflation forces businesses to become more efficient because they cannot raise prices, and that when businesses are more efficient, the nation's economic output and standard of living rise. 
 Mr. Greenspan's fascination with the link is important not only as a defense of past interest rate increases but also as one of many signals about future policy. The research may help to explain why Mr. Greenspan has gradually become more willing than most Federal Reserve officials to raise interest rates this spring, after some initial reluctance.
 
Findings, and Skepticism
 A preliminary draft of the study contends that with a reduction of one percentage point in the inflation rate, the nation's productivity and economic growth rates both rise by two- or three-tenths of a percentage point.
But the argument does not impress Administration officials or some private economists, who are skeptical of the Federal Reserve's new claims and worry that in using higher interest rates to slow the economy and therefore push down an already low inflation rate, the Federal Reserve will excessively restrict the economy and needlessly cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Mr. Greenspan first cited the research in Congresssional testimony at the end of last month to argue that further reductions in inflation may be needed. "We don't have enough observations to know that it's conclusively the case," he told the Senate Banking Committee, "but I think it's becoming persuasively the case that not only is it -- which everyone agrees to -- important to bring the inflation rate down from 10 percent to 5 percent, but it's increasingly becoming evident that the lower we get under 5 percent, the more stable and growing the economy is."
Mr. Greenspan has previously indicated a desire to reduce inflation to 1 or 2 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The productivity research is the latest of many justifications that the central bank has offered over the years for raising interest rates. In effect, the central bank is arguing that short-term economic pain may be necessary for long-term economic gain.
The new Federal Reserve study found that low inflation has gone hand in hand with high productivity, and high inflation with low productivity, during the last 40 years in the United States. The same correlation was found in similar periods in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Japan.
The study also used a much-debated statistical device to make the case that it was low inflation that raised productivity, rather than high productivity causing low inflation. Finally, the study's authors, two Federal Reserve economists, attempted to adjust for the booms and busts in the business cycle, although they acknowledged that their success could be questioned.
Instead of using consumer prices, the new Federal Reserve study uses a different inflation measure -- prices charged by businesses for all goods -- that produces slightly lower numbers and offers a broader comparison to business productivity. The study excluded prices and productivity on farms and in government agencies.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, disagrees with Mr. Greenspan's argument. She said in an interview that while extremely high levels of inflation might have hurt productivity in foreign countries, inflation in the United States had never been high enough to have a demonstrable effect on productivity, even in the late 1970's.
"I don't think it has been well documented at lower levels," she said.
 
Link or No Link?
 Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said earlier academic research had failed to document any clear link to productivity for inflation rates below 20 percent. He suggested that in arguing for the existence of a link at much lower levels, Mr. Greenspan might be looking for a politically palatable explanation for the central bank's interest-rate increases this spring.
"I think it's a bit of throwing everything at the fan and seeing what sticks," Mr. Bosworth said. "He wants to make the argument for the benefits of low rates of inflation."
But Stanley Fischer, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will soon become the deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that his own research in the last two years suggested that Mr. Greenspan might be right, at least for inflation rates of 3 percent or more.
The new Federal Reserve research will be discussed at length on Thursday during a Bank of England conference on monetary and financial policy, he said.
Federal Reserve officials initially expressed reluctance to share the new study even after Mr. Greenspan had mentioned it in his testimony, but they relented last weekend.
Economists at the Federal Reserve said Mr. Greenspan had taken a strong personal interest in the research. Other central bank officials were largely unaware of the work until Mr. Greenspan mentioned a link between inflation and productivity.
"I was taken by that comment myself -- it has some intuitive appeal but I have not seen any of the data," said Robert P. Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
 
Computer Modeling
 The study consists of highly esoteric statistical calculations and computer modeling, rather than any field research involving interviews with companies or workers. The study also does not address why low inflation may cause higher productivity.
It suggested that temporary shrinkages in the economy might be needed to curb inflation and increase productivity. "Even if a one-percentage-point reduction in inflation boosts the trend growth of productivity (and hence output) only 0.2 percentage point, then an initial sacrifice of, say, two and a half percentage points of G.D.P. is more than recovered within five years," the draft says. The arithmetic is true because of a compounding effect.
Two Federal Reserve economists, Glenn D. Rudebusch and David W. Wilcox, wrote the paper.
Susan M. Phillips, one of the five sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Tuesday that when inflation was low, businesses were more willing to judge long-term investments on their own merits and tended to make more efficient decisions, adding to productivity. When inflation is high, she said, businesses tend to time investments to minimize the erosion of returns by inflation.
But other research has suggested that high productivity may produce low inflation, rather than the other way around, Ms. Tyson said. Mr. Rudebusch and Mr. Wilcox tried to show this was not the case by using a statistical technique known as a Granger test. In using the test, the two economists compared each year's productivity with inflation in four previous periods and found a strong correlation. They found no correlation when they compared inflation with productivity in four previous periods.
Some economists have criticized the Granger test over the years as unreliable for examining indicators like productivity that tend to rise and fall with the health of the overall economy.

HEADLINE: In Budget, Albany Preserves Some Hometown Goodies

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 8

 BODY:
Since 1986, when the State Legislature was ridiculed for appropriating $175,000 to help build the Museum of Cheese in Rome, N.Y., legislative aides say they have been trying to clean up the process that produces the budget items referred to here by euphemisms like "legislative initiatives" and "member items." Elsewhere the spending is more commonly known as pork.
But that did not prevent this election-year budget from including grants like $2,500 for the Farmingdale Midget Football league, $5,000 for the Firefighters Monuments for the Massapequas, $100,000 for Carnegie Hall, and $250,000 for the Boonville Fair. 
 The money was on a list released by legislative aides shortly after midnight Tuesday that disclosed, for the first time in a six-month budget process, about $102 million worth of proposed grants to local youth, cultural and social-service organizations.
 
Minor-League Stadiums
 Four hours later, before the sun brought daylight to the Capitol, the Legislature approved the spending as part of the state's $34 billion budget. It also approved a lump-sum appropriation of $48 million -- $24 million for each house -- that legislative leaders will distribute later this year to members for pet projects in their districts.
And earlier this week the Legislature allocated $127 million to pay for the construction and renovation of 10 minor-league baseball stadiums and for a swimming center on Long Island that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has compared to the Taj Mahal.
Critics of the grants say they understand that each appropriation has a constituency. They say many -- although not all -- deserve taxpayer support. But they argue that the selection process mocks the concept of equity.
In choosing projects, the relative merit of any given proposal, compared to that of thousands of others made by the 211 lawmakers, usually takes a back seat to considerations like seniority, party affiliation and political vulnerability.
 
'Sense of Competition'
 "There is no sense of competition among needs," said Brian D. Backstrom, vice president for research of Change-NY, an anti-tax group.
"The problem with them is they become a tool of incumbency when legislators, particularly during election years, don't think about the best use of this money but the use that will get the most votes," said Andrew Greenblatt, executive director of New York State Common Cause. "So the money usually goes to organized, high-profile groups or causes."
Mr. Backstrom and Mr. Greenblatt said this year's grant process was particularly opaque, even by the standards of a budget that was negotiated almost entirely behind closed doors.
Legislative leaders said they were negotiating the grant list until the final hours Tuesday night and did not want to release it in parts. With the budget already more than two months late, they said they wanted to pass it as soon as negotiations closed.
The grants requested by the Democratic leaders of the Assembly tend to be for social-service organizations, like senior-citizen centers and AIDS education groups. Many of the grants requested by the Republicans who control the State Senate are for local civic, youth and economic-development projects. Senate aides say that is because Mr. Cuomo includes many similar initiatives in Democratic districts when he proposes his own budget in January. Minority parties control very little of the money.
 
A Soaring Museum
 The appropriateness of the grants is always open to interpretation.
The National Soaring Museum, at Harris Hill between Elmira and Corning, received a $5,000 one-time grant this year to advertise new directions to the museum while the state replaces a bridge on its main access road. James W. Swinnich, executive director of the museum, which is dedicated to the history and science of gliders and sailplanes, said the museum has lost 50 percent of its visitors since the bridge construction began.
He said Senator John R. Kuhl Jr., a Republican from Hammondsport, helped secure the grant for billboards and new brochures showing an alternate route. But he said he lost the use of two prime billboards because the budget was so late.
Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Garden City, procured $30,000 this year, as he has in past years, for the Long Island Coalition for Fair Broadcasting, a nonprofit research group that encourages New York City television stations to carry more news about Long Island.
 
Too Much Buttafuoco
 "Our function is to complain when they only cover Joey Buttafuoco, and if they do a good job, we let them know that too," said Abby B. Kenigsberg, the group's executive director. She defended the use of state funds for her organization, which has a total budget of $130,000, by saying it "encourages a free press."
Senator Hannon said the grant provides "regional promotion of 2.5 million people who heretofore had been ignored by a city-centric electronic media."
In nearby Bellmore, the Bellmore-Merrick Roller Hockey Association will be able to repair the fence around its blacktop rink because of a $2,500 grant secured by Senator Norman J. Levy, a Republican from Merrick, according to Ted R. Manara, an association board member.
And in Massena, the work of Senator William R. Sears, also a Republican, will provide $250,000 for architectural planning for the $14 million St. Lawrence Aquarium and Ecological Center, which is expected to bring $5 million in economic activity to the region each year.
"These grants are only egregious in the eyes of the beholder," said John E. McArdle, a Senate spokesman. "People in districts back home, where these funds go to senior-citizen centers, rape crisis centers, day-care centers, find them very worthwhile."

Bond Prices Decline After Early Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bond prices declined yesterday, pushing interest rates higher, as rising commodity prices and a falling dollar helped erase a morning rally. 
 The Treasury's 30-year bond lost 6/32 of a point, or $1.875 for each $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.27 percent from 7.26 percent on Tuesday.
The bond market's retreat came late in the day and followed a morning rally that had been set off when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, told bankers in London that inflation was "clearly restrained." Mr. Greenspan's comments reduced speculation the Fed will raise interest rates soon.
 
Lack of Investor Interest

 
 Wall Street's largest securities firms were among the biggest buyers of Treasuries, betting early in the day that they could sell bonds at even higher prices to investors. When investors failed to show much enthusiasm, bond firms "dumped what they bought," said Peter Hirsch, the top Government bond trader at Salomon Brothers.
Contributing to the bond market's late slump was the drop in the dollar that followed remarks by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who said trade sanctions against Japan could not be ruled out in an effort to force Tokyo to accept more American goods.
"Once again, the Administration is refusing to pay heed to the old wartime adage that loose lips sink ships," John Ryding, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. "Bonds have benefited from overseas buying, and the benefits for foreigners holding U.S. assets decline as the U.S. currency declines."
Bonds also came under pressure from a rise in the Commodity Research Bureau's index, which some traders consider a leading indicator of inflation.
Adding to the bond market's worries were comments by Thomas Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., who said that while inflation was stable, the economy was nearing full employment.
Some economists believe the threat of rising inflation increases dangerously as the unemployment rate drops. More inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
 
10-Year Note's Yield at 6.95%

 
 Among other Treasury issues, the yield on the 10-year note rose to 6.95 percent, from 6.94 percent on Tuesday. The yields on some intermediate and short-term issues were also marginally higher.
Mr. Greenspan's comments indicate the Fed is "likely to pretty much sit on its hands for the next three months, and maybe beyond," said Anders Ekernas, president and chief investment officer of the ABB Investment Management Corporation, in Stamford, Conn.
The Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, echoed Mr. Greenspan's sentiments at the London conference of bankers, saying that he "hopes and expects" a lower inflation rate.
Central banks around the world are trying to calm inflation fears, Mr. Ekernas said.
"The Fed has gone out of its way to reassure the market it's not going to raise rates in July," when Fed officials next meet, Robert Bluestone, a managing director and head of fixed-income investments at Oppenheimer Capital, said. "They're going out of their way to gain the bond market's confidence."
Bond yields have fallen about 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, since topping out at 7.66 percent on May 11, "and we've got more to go," Mr. Bluestone said.
Bond yields were 6.30 percent before the Fed began raising rates in February. The long bond ended at a record low yield of 5.78 percent on Oct. 15, 1993.
The Fed has raised the rate on overnight bank loans four times this year for a total of 1.25 points.
 
Belief in a Rally

 
 "I'm feeling a lot better," said James Casselberry, head of almost $1 billion in fixed-income investments at the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago. So long as the Fed doesn't raise rates, bonds can keep rallying, he said.
"I definitely don't think we'll run through 7.30 percent," Mr. Casselberry said. "I feel like I can come out of my foxhole."
Thomas J. Steffanci, director of fixed-income investments at Fidelity Investments in Boston, has not changed his opinion that bonds will rally this year. "Our view remains the same -- that is, the economy is on a moderate growth track, with inflation that's acceptable to the Fed and the bond market, and that the inflation premium in the bond market is too much," Mr. Steffanci said. "I would not be surprised to see 7 percent or slightly through that in the next three months."

Dollar Weaker Against Yen After Tough U.S. Trade Talk

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar continued to weaken against the Japanese yen yesterday after Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the United States would not rule out the use of trade sanctions to open Japan's markets to American goods. 
 Mr. Brown's comments, coupled with tough talk on Tuesday by Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, convinced many traders that the United States was willing to resume calls for a strong yen to curb Japan's trade surplus if current negotiations fail.
"The Clinton Administration says it isn't using the dollar as a tool, but no one believes them," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. "People are going to be nervous until the trade talks are over."
 
 
Sanctions Still Possible
 The dollar fell to a three-week low of 103.65 yen just after Mr. Brown said in Paris that the use of sanctions against Japan "should not be ruled out."
A White House economic aide, W. Bowman Cutter, said later that the United States had no intention of driving the dollar lower against the yen, a strategy it pursued last year. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104 yen, down from 104.17 yen on Tuesday.
But the dollar rose against the German mark as traders sold marks for yen, a strategy that often requires them to sell marks for dollars and then sell dollars for yen. The dollar rose to 1.6695 marks from 1.6659 marks.
Mr. Kantor fired the first salvo on trade on Tuesday, when he said that the United States might use trade law to pry open Japan's markets if the two countries did not reach an agreement. Those remarks sent the dollar plunging 1.12 yen on Tuesday.
 
 
Traders Rattled
 The remarks by Mr. Brown and Mr. Kantor rattled traders because the Treasury went to great lengths last month to rescue the dollar from a free fall. It called on the Federal Reserve and 18 other central banks to stage a dollar-buying spree on May 4. Five days before, the Fed alone bought $700 million with marks and yen.
The Clinton Administration has "done a brilliant job of confusing the market about the U.S.-Japanese trade situation," said Chris Furness, a currency market analyst in London.
The dollar rose to a two-month high of 105.55 yen on Friday, a few days after the United States and Japan resumed formal trade talks.

Oil Prices Rally as Supplies Grow Tighter in Midwest

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Oil prices rallied late in the day, bouncing back from Tuesday's selloff amid growing concerns about dwindling supplies in the Midwest. 
 On other commodity markets, copper rose to a 21-month high as demand from factories and other industrial users continued to deplete inventories. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 2.25 points, to 231.21.
Midwestern oil stockpiles are at a 15-month low, and they fell 2.3 percent last week, to 68.4 million barrels from 70.1 million barrels a week earlier, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Inventories are 10.9 percent below those of a year earlier.
"The bottom line on crude is that the Midwest market is still tight," said John Saucer, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc. in Houston. "It's like magic. When they drop below 70 million, people start taking notice."
Crude oil for July delivery rose as high as $18.40 a barrel before settling at $18.34 a barrel, up 59 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the biggest one-day rise in two months. July unleaded gasoline rose 0.46 cent, to 51.81 cents a gallon, while July heating oil rose 0.15 cent, to 46.62 cents a gallon.
 
Shortage in Oklahoma
 While supplies elsewhere are plentiful, Mr. Saucer said, traders are concerned that not enough crude will be available for delivery in Oklahoma against the futures contract.
Elsewhere, copper rose to a 21-month high as rebounding economies worldwide continued to push up industrial demand and reduce inventories.
"Heavy manufacturing in Europe and the U.S. is causing this to happen," said Richard Hirsch, vice president with Deutsche Bank's Sharps Pixley brokerage in New York. "Old-fashioned industrial commodities are booming. Smokestack America is really booming, and that's what's helping copper."
Copper for July delivery rose as high as $1.095 a pound before settling 1.75 cent higher at $1.0855 a pound on the Commodity Exchange.
Copper stockpiles held in London Metal Exchange warehouses have fallen by 40 percent so far this year at a time when stocks are low and demand is growing and have reached a 14-month low. Inventories in American exchange warehouses are 58 percent lower.
Separately, coffee prices rose on fears that cold weather could arrive next month in Brazil, harming the world's largest crop at a time when stocks are low and demand is growing. July coffee rose 5 cents, to $1.2795 a pound at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Closed-end country funds are not always what they seem to be.

BYLINE: By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
IF you want to know how excited investors are about various foreign stock markets, there's no easier place to look than the quirky world of closed-end country funds.
These country funds generally raise a fixed amount of money that they invest in stock markets abroad. Americans can buy shares in the fund here that trade for more or less than the value of the underlying foreign stock portfolio. When the price of shares has been bid up to well over the price of the underlying assets -- that is, a premium, -- that's usually a sign that investors are enthusiastic about a given country's prospects. 
 But not always. As the fate of the Turkish Investment Fund shows, sometimes fund shares trade at huge premiums not because investors think a foreign market is about to take off, but because they can't believe how far it has dropped.
How fallen are the mighty: in 1993, the Turkish stock market was the hottest in the world, more than doubling in value in the space of just a few months. But in mid-January the Turkish market hit its peak and has fallen so sharply since then that investors' fortunes have been turned upside down. In January, the price of the shares in the fund were cheap at a 9 percent discount to the value of the Turkish stocks. But last week the shares of the fund were trading at a 72 percent premium to its collapsed net asset value, or N.A.V. Investors would now have to pay $1.72 for every $1 of the fund's assets.
While that premium is by no means a record -- funds specializing in Korea and in Spain traded at more than 130 percent at various times in the late 1980's -- the Turkey fund's premium is by far the largest today, according to Michael Porter, the closed-end fund analyst for Smith Barney.
The reason that the fund's premium has soared from 23 percent to as high as 80 percent this year is that the value of its portfolio plunged more than 64 percent this year, much of which was caused by a collapse in the Turkish lira. But, at the same time, the fund's shares sank just 48 percent, leaving them selling at a much higher price than the value of the stocks in the Turkish Investment Fund. "It's sort of like you've fallen from the 100th story of a building, and now you're down to the 20th floor -- you still have a long way to go," Mr. Porter said, adding, "I've never seen that kind of N.A.V. meltdown."
Antoine van Agtmael has. An old hand at overseas investing and now the president of Emerging Markets Management, Mr. van Agtmael points out that often the best-performing market in one year is the worst performer the next year. "If the economy policy is not sustainable, the bottom falls out," he said. "We've seen that in Brazil, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and numerous other countries."
In the case of Turkey, "the combination of still-high inflation, slower economic growth and political challenges add up" to a less-than-optimistic outlook, he said. Still, he added, because most of that is already reflected in stock prices, "Turkey actually offers some interesting opportunities."
But Morgan Stanley Asset Management, which runs the fund, remains cautious, at least for the next year. "The expectation is still that this will be a V-shaped recession, with a very rapid recovery" in Turkey, Marianne Hay, the fund's portfolio manager, said. "But we think it may take longer than that."
Bottom fishers beware: as long as the fund trades at such a whopping premium, it will be almost impossible to make money, fund mavens warn. "If you are right, and the N.A.V. rallies sharply and the currency is in your favor, the danger is that the premium will contract," said Thomas J. Herzfeld, whose Miami firm specializes in closed-end funds. For example, he noted that earlier this year, Italy Fund was trading at a 24 percent premium. The net asset value rose 20 percent, but the premium contracted as demand for the fund seemed to slacken a bit and the share price fell from $12.50 to $11.
"The pitfall in buying the Turkey fund," Mr. Herzfeld said, "is you can be right about the market and still lose money."

South Africa's huge challenge: bringing the good life to blacks.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IT seems a miracle: South Africa has become a multiracial democracy. But democracies can't live by virtue alone, and the economic challenge facing the new Government is far greater than generally understood. 
 Indeed, by the reckoning of many of South Africa's well-wishers, it will take a comparable miracle to transform an economy twisted by apartheid into an engine of growth capable of satisfying the expectations of the majority anytime soon. "The South African economy is unique," said Jeffrey Herbst, a political scientist at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton and contributor to "South Africa: The Political Economy of Transformation" (edited by Stephen Stedman). "No country has ever been saddled with this set of problems."
South Africa is obviously not just another third-world economy with little to show from top-down rule other than a big foreign debt. Along with most of Africa's industrial capacity, it can boast of excellent transportation, communications, hospitals, schools -- in short, all the accouterments of a modern consumer culture.
Probably more important, said Stephen Lewis, an economist who is president of Carleton College, the governing African National Congress has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, jettisoning the rhetoric of revolutionary socialism almost overnight. And it has gone out of its way to reassure the world that South Africa's fiscal and monetary policies will be prudent to the point of austerity, retaining key technocrats from the Nationalist administration as a symbol of its sincerity.
What's more, the Government's commitment to the rule of law is backed by an independent judiciary and a professional civil service. "Investors aren't going to be ripped off by the legal system," said Robert Klitgaard, an American economist teaching at the University of Natal.
However, for all the grace displayed by black South Africans in their hour of triumph, Mr. Herbst expects that their patience is a rapidly depleting asset. He predicts that the pressures to deliver the good life to the great majority will grow rapidly as time passes and the A.N.C. coalition fractures along the ideological spectrum.
Such redistribution is more easily imagined than accomplished, though, by a government that honors property rights and is reluctant to raise taxes very much, lest it undermine incentives for savings and production.
By the estimate of one South African economist, Servaas van den Berg, bringing social spending on blacks to the standard enjoyed by whites would increase Government outlays from one-quarter of national output to almost half. And that figure does not include the cost of remedial programs for the most impoverished Africans, the bottomless pit of need in a country in which rural inhabitants generally lack electricity, clean water, nutritious food and basic skills.
Almost everyone's preferred way out of the bind is rapid economic expansion, with the added output spent on the poor. And on first glance, the prospects seem favorable.
Plagued by boycotts from abroad and wasteful bureaucratic efforts to sustain apartheid from within, average living standards fell by 15 percent in the 1980's. If South Africa could simply go back to the growth experience of the 1946-73 period, output per person would rise by one-quarter over the next decade.
But Mr. Herbst notes that South Africa's "normal" growth in the past was achieved only through abnormally high rates of investment. And while the hoped-for end of white flight and assured access to world capital markets should make a difference, he is skeptical that the "apartheid dividend" will be sufficient to push growth much above the 2 to 3 percent rate needed to cover population growth.
It is still tempting to compare South Africa to the latest crop of Asian tiger cubs -- Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia -- which started in seemingly more difficult economic circumstances and have managed 7 percent-plus growth for a decade. But they do not suffer from severe shortages of skilled labor, a legacy of apartheid. Nor do they have powerful labor movements, committed to protecting wage gains that raced ahead of productivity in the 1970's and 1980's. Nor do they have huge entrenched bureaucracies hostile to free enterprise. Nor are they dependent on foreign savings, a dependence that pushes South Africa's foreign currency accounts into deficit whenever the economy shows signs of vitality.
To Mr. Herbst, South Africa's best hope is to rely on the maturity of the electorate to sustain civility through a long economic transition. South Africa will have succeeded, he argues, "if the next election is about who gets what" rather than the viability of democracy itself.
While no Pollyanna, Mr. Lewis thinks economic miracles can be made to happen. In the end, he believes that South Africa's economic prospects "turn on the capacity to change institutions." And where else on earth, he asks, have so many shown the strength to set aside both grievances and prejudices in order to move on?

Low Shock Threshold In White House Expose

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

The Agenda
Inside the Clinton White House
By Bob Woodward
Illustrated. 352 pages. Simon & Schuster.
$24. 
 Ever since Bob Woodward's first book, "All the President's Men," the expose of the Watergate scandal he wrote with Carl Bernstein, we have come to expect startling revelations from him, an expectation that was hardly dampened by his succeeding works: "The Final Days," "The Brethren," "Wired," "Veil" and "The Commanders."
After the announcement of Mr. Woodward's latest book, "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House," anticipation of high-level gossip was further excited by reports that it revealed the power wielded by Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the influence exerted on Presidential policy by Alan Greenspan, the presumably apolitical chairman of the Federal Reserve system.
So it comes as somewhat of a surprise that while "The Agenda" is built of unsourced inside scenes that resemble in pace and point of view the shocking narrative of Richard M. Nixon's resignation, "The Final Days," the tone and attitude of the new book are not only far from sensational but also neutral almost to the point of ambiguity.
True, Mrs. Clinton does put in regular appearances to tell her husband and his advisers in caustic words to shape up and stop dithering. And true, Mr. Greenspan delivers messages to the President fervently approving anything that might cut the deficit and lower long-term interest rates.
Moreover, the President keeps having tantrums, so often and so violently that you come think of them as his way of keeping himself going. And his anguished indecisiveness can make Hamlet look like Fortinbras.
Mr. Woodward reports an incident in which Thomas F. McLarty, the White House chief of staff, makes a promise to Representative Dave McCurdy in exchange for the Congressman's support of the President's economic plan and then promptly seems to forget his obligation. There are several other scenes of back-corridor treachery. And in one confrontation, Vice President Al Gore tells off the President in tones that witnesses felt breached protocol.
But are we supposed to be shocked by such reports? Haven't these sorts of incidents always occurred behind the scenes as White House staffs have tried to define Presidential policy and put it into effect? Is it remarkable that a President would start out with a visionary agenda only to see it whittled down by compromise from a mighty oak to a toothpick, as President Clinton seems to have done in promising an economic plan that would tax energy consumption, stimulate the economy, invest in development and cut spending, and in the end settling for merely lowering the deficit?
Has it never happened before that in pressing legislators for votes a President pulls out every emotional stop from self-pity to profane abuse, as the President seems to have done with Senator Bob Kerrey in seeking his support? If a Lyndon B. Johnson leaned on a senator in a forest, would there have been no expletives to delete?
The lack of a firmer point of view in "The Agenda" can be traced in part to the author's rush to get the book out while its news is still fresh. As he points out in his introduction: "Much of this book was reported while events were developing, before the outcomes and consequences were known or imagined. As a result, I believe, it contains some events that otherwise might have been lost to the record."
Also, Mr. Woodward is searching for a unique point of view, one that "falls between newspaper journalism and history." As he explains: "I believe there is a place for reporting that aspires to combine the thoroughness of history with the contemporaneity of journalism. This book aims to find that ground."
If one detects the faintest note of defensiveness about the author's heavy reliance on interviews conducted on "deep background," it seems to be echoed in his announcement that all material connected with his interviews will be deposited in the Yale University Library, with the files to be "opened to the public and researchers in 40 years to provide the exact source or sources for each portion of this book." If this holds true, it will be 2034 until we finally get to cross-examine Mr. Woodward's methods of reporting.
Without ambiguity, the main point of "The Agenda" is that in the first year of his Administration, President Clinton fell absurdly short of the promise he made when, in accepting the Democratic Presidential nomination on July 16, 1992, he said, "George Bush, if you won't use your power to help people, step aside, I will." The next April the President was telling his staff with bitter sarcasm: "We're Eisenhower Republicans here, and we are fighting the Reagan Republicans. We stand for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?"
But many of Mr. Woodward's finer points are not so obvious in what they reveal. Scenes shift and conversations are reported without distinct guidelines to the author's point. The lack of a sturdy framework can be disquieting. Readers with a solid background in Presidential politics will probably find Mr. Woodward's raw material invaluable. But those without an ideological or historical foundation may find themselves perplexed by much of what Mr. Woodward reports.
In the end, one finds it hard to tell whether "The Agenda" is meant to be an indictment of an ineffectually struggling Presidency or an objective revelation of how most Washington Administrations have to work these days.

HEADLINE: The Harm in Family Welfare Caps

 BODY:
A destructive provision in President Clinton's forthcoming welfare-reform bill would allow states to put a cap on family welfare benefits. Under the cap, mothers who give birth while on welfare would receive no additional money for the care of the additional child. That will do little good and much harm. According to nearly every careful study, family caps do nothing to discourage childbirth but they do victimize innocent children.
Family caps, which are also included in several bills already before Congress, are based on the false notion that larger benefit checks encourage welfare mothers to have more babies and thereby stay longer on welfare. But a welfare mother would have to be crazy to think of babies as an economic advantage. The average extra stipend to welfare mothers who give birth is less than $75 a month -- which does not even cover the cost of diapers and other expenses for the new baby. 
 Studies -- including research by Mary Jo Bane and David Ellwood, who head the Administration's task force on welfare reform -- do not show that raising welfare benefits leads to more illegitimate births. Indeed, welfare mothers typically have fewer than two children -- which is fewer than women in the non-welfare population.
Thus the family cap will not significantly reduce illegitimate children or welfare costs. But it will take $75 a month from mothers desperately trying to feed, clothe and educate their children. There are also legal questions, not yet settled, whether states have a right to discriminate against additional children.
New Jersey, Georgia and Arkansas have already received permission from Washington to impose family caps under current law. This page embraced New Jersey's application because, in the absence of national reform, states deserved wide latitude in figuring out how to discourage welfare dependency. But that rationale will no longer apply once Congress passes national reform.
Mr. Clinton's two-years-and-out plan -- whereby welfare recipients would, after two years of collecting benefits, be required to find a job or accept a government-subsidized job -- would make long-term dependency by the able-bodied impossible. A state cap on family benefits would then serve no purpose other than to punish poor children.
As a former Governor, Mr. Clinton leans to giving states room to experiment. But welfare policy is the wrong place for state options. States have all the wrong financial incentives -- by stinting on benefits, they encourage out-migration and discourage in-migration of poor families. The place to set welfare rules is in Washington, so that the poor do not have to shop around for humane treatment. Under the discipline of national welfare reform, there is no justification for family caps.

HEADLINE: A Budget: Delayed and Deficient

 BODY:
Without a trace of embarrassment, Gov. Mario Cuomo and the Legislature have finally agreed on a state budget they should have adopted 10 weeks ago. Heaping praise on themselves for cutting taxes and adding money for all sorts of popular causes in an election year -- like school aid and baseball stadiums -- they neglect to mention that, once again, they failed to remove the Medicaid burden on New York City and county governments statewide.
Over all, New York City fares well. It will get more state aid than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sought, including token Medicaid relief and a significant increase in aid for schools. Moreover, the increase in school aid is more generous than the basic aid formula that has shortchanged the city for years. 
 It may seem odd when a state government dominated by Democrats gives a Republican Mayor more help than he asks for, but that is not how it plays in politics. Facing elections in November, the Democratic Governor and the Democrats who control the Assembly wish to be seen as helping New York City's preponderantly Democratic voters.
The Mayor sought $275 million of state aid in various forms -- school aid, Medicaid, etc. Depending on who in Albany is spinning out the numbers, he will get a little more than that or a lot more, perhaps as much as $425 million altogether.
Even so, the Mayor complains that the Legislature, in a separate bill, would require that the school aid be used to aid schools -- not diverted, as the Mayor wants, to reduce the budget gap or finance other programs. The Mayor is on weak ground here. When Albany earmarks aid, it ought to go to the intended beneficiaries. Mr. Cuomo should sign the bill sending school aid to the schools.
The tax cuts in the new budget are more than twice as large as Governor Cuomo proposed, thanks to unexpected surplus funds and insistent pressure from the Republican-controlled Senate. The state's 5 percent tax on high-priced hotel rooms is repealed as of Sept. 1 -- a welcome relief for New York City. But the biggest tax reduction, phasing out the 15 percent corporate surcharge, is not really a cut at all. The entire surcharge was scheduled to expire this year; now it is only phased down.
The big disappointment was failure to start shifting anything more than a modest share of Medicaid costs out of local budgets. New York State shoulders a smaller portion of Medicaid costs than any other state. Governor Cuomo proposed this year that the state assume the whole burden. Mayor Giuliani and county executives statewide pressed the Legislature to approve. The urban-Democratic Assembly did, but the suburban-Republican Senate did not, apparently because New York City would get 70 percent of the benefit.
All through the recession, shrinking revenues forced Albany to agonize over budget cuts. With renewed expansion, budgeting should be easier now. So why did it take until June 8 -- the next-to-latest budget in the past decade -- for Governor Cuomo and the Legislature to come to terms? Their tardiness put an enormous strain on local budgets that will only now be mitigated by the belated largesse.

HEADLINE: Turning a Profit On Dirty Reactors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report (Business Day, May 31) a plan to "shift responsibility from private companies to the Federal Government for millions of dollars in damages from certain types of nuclear accidents outside the United States." The idea is promoted by the Energy Department. The cited beneficiaries will be Bechtel, Combustion Engineering, Nuclear Fuel Services and Raytheon. Westinghouse, General Electric or both should gain too. 
 The cited companies argue they cannot work on Russian nuclear projects because local laws impose great liability on the nuclear contractors. Private insurer premiums are prohibitive, because the risks are so great. Uncle Sam is thus likely to pay on any guarantees, so it amounts to a huge subsidy of nuclear power.
There are alternatives to nuclear power -- fossil fuels (including natural gas), solar and wind power, energy efficiency. They can have high-technology components without nuclear power's dangers -- nuclear proliferation, cost overruns, meltdowns.
Special interests always win if those with a general interest keep silent. If the Federal Government guarantees Russian reactors, American tax dollars will fly out Washington windows into the pockets of United States nuclear-reactor manufacturers.

HEADLINE: U.S. FINDS IT HARD TO WIN CONSENSUS OVER NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
One week after Washington said it would push for economic sanctions against North Korea, the Administration is still struggling to complete its plan and says it may be weeks before the United Nations Security Council will be ready to vote on the matter.
With China voicing objections and Japan expressing reservations about imposing tough sanctions, and with differences within Administration ranks, the White House has yet to draft a sanctions resolution. 
 Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs and the Administration's point man on North Korea, told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee today that Washington hoped to agree on a position in the next several days.
But even after the Administration's position is set, officials said, consultations at the United Nations could be difficult and prolonged. "We expect the process to continue over the next few weeks," Mr. Gallucci said, referring to consultations with allies.
Although Washington has repeatedly said it would push for a gradual tightening of global sanctions if North Korea continued to thwart inspections of its nuclear sites, the Administration has moved slowly to develop a response since the North called Washington's bluff.
In part, the delay reflects the Administration's difficulty in agreeing on a plan that would punish North Korea for blocking inspections while keeping some threats in reserve to dissuade the North from withdrawing completely from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and developing nuclear weapons.
It also reflects the Administration's difficulties in securing the support of other Security Council members. Mr. Gallucci pointedly declined to predict that Washington's diplomatic efforts would result in tough sanctions that would get the North Koreans' attention.
He told the panel, for example, that it was unclear whether a resolution by the Security Council would include a ban on the hundreds of millions of dollars in private funds that flow to North Korea from Japan.
"The question is whether the sanctions resolution will initially or eventually take account or limit such remittances," he said, "and at this point I can't predict whether the resolution or resolutions would so limit remittances."
The difficulty in devising and winning support for sanctions has undercut the message of resolve that Washington has sought to convey. As Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a New York Democrat, observed at the hearing today, "It just seems there are no stated punishments for those stated crimes and violations."
 
Twin Goals
 The crisis was set off by North Korea's decision to destroy evidence of its past plutonium production by rapidly withdrawing spent fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. In devising its sanctions, the Administration wants to punish North Korea for defying the International Atomic Energy Agency, while dissuading the North from using the fuel to make bombs.
The Administration's emerging plan would specify initial sanctions to be imposed by the Security Council if North Korea continued to defy the atomic energy agency. Tougher sanctions would be imposed if the North pressed ahead on the nuclear front.
The key questions include which sanctions to seek now and which to put off. And if sanctions are imposed, what would North Korea have to do to get them lifted?
Mr. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State, has recommended two steps: a cut-off of the funds that are sent by Koreans living in Japan, and a voluntary embargo on arms purchases and deliveries.
 
The Pentagon's Concerns
 Pentagon officials, in contrast, have been more concerned with limiting the growth of the North Korean nuclear program than with solving the mystery of whether the North diverted a bomb's worth of plutonium in 1989. When the issue of sanctions was debated in past weeks, an official said, the Pentagon's approach was to "go low and slow."
Officials said today that there were broad areas of convergence but that important issues needed to be resolved.
China, for its part, appears to be as concerned about possible instability on the Korean peninsula as it is of a nuclear North Korea.
Japan would prefer that the Security Council begin by issuing a warning and undertaking some modest sanctions. Japanese officials have said Tokyo would prefer that any ban on remittances from Koreans in Japan be part of a broader trade ban that would be put off for now.
 
Agreement in Principle
 But all sides have sought publicly to maintain a united front.
"Japan believes it is time to show an appropriate response to North Korean actions, including sanctions, at the U.N. Security Council," Mr. Gallucci said in an unusual statement to the panel that he said had been approved by the Japanese Government.
Some Administration officials say North Korea's recent decision to shut down its reactor is a sign that it will soon rush to build nuclear weapons regardless of what actions the United Nations takes.
North Korea may be getting some comfort from the possibility that China will wield its Security Council veto. "I'm not prepared to try and predict how China will vote on a specific sanctions resolution," Mr. Gallucci said today, "certainly not knowing in advance what that resolution will look like."

Carter to Visit Koreas

 ATLANTA, June 9 (AP) -- Former President Carter said today that he and his wife will visit North and South Korea next week as private citizens, and he hopes to discuss "important issues of the day with leaders."
"The initiative for this trip has been from Korea, not Washington, and I will have no official status relating to the U.S. Government," Mr. Carter said in a statement.
A State Department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Carter was "traveling in a private capacity."
"He has been in touch with the White House and has been briefed," the spokesman said.
Mr. Carter said: "My hope is to discuss some of the important issues of the day with leaders in the area."

HEADLINE: Health Legislation Advances in Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
National health insurance took two major strides forward in the Senate today as one committee approved a bill, guaranteeing a Senate vote on the issue, and another, perhaps more crucial, committee shifted from general discussion to serious work on new legislation.
By a comfortable 11-to-6 margin, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee adopted the Senator's more generous version of President Clinton's health care proposal. It is the first Congressional committee to act, and its vote insures that the full Senate will confront the issue this summer. 
 At the Finance Committee, whose close partisan and ideological divisions parallel those in the full Senate, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the chairman, sought support for a detailed new proposal that he showed his colleagues today. It is a less generous plan than Mr. Clinton's.
Mr. Moynihan's proposal eliminated several politically popular benefits in the Clinton bill, like prescription drugs and long-term care for the elderly and government insurance for early retirees. Mr. Moynihan's willingness to eliminate those provisions, in a year when he is running for re-election, made it clear that he was seriously pushing for health care legislation and not just acting for show. He is also making known his worry that if the cost cannot be controlled, the bill cannot be passed.
The Clinton, Kennedy and Moynihan plans all rely on employers to buy health insurance for their workers and to pay most of the premiums. Mr. Kennedy's bill would exempt employers with 10 or fewer workers; Mr. Moynihan's would exempt employers with 20 or fewer workers but only for several years.
Mr. Moynihan, who has been skeptical of the Administration's financing estimates, proposed much higher taxes than the other bills did. He would raise the tobacco tax from 24 cents a pack to $2 and impose a 1 percent payroll tax on companies of 500 or more employees. Mr. Clinton proposed a tobacco tax of 99 cents, and Mr. Kennedy suggested a tax of $1.74.
All three measures would seek economies by enabling individuals to buy health insurance through purchasing cooperatives called health alliances. Mr. Clinton would make participation compulsory for almost all Americans, while Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Kennedy would make it voluntary while also giving the alliances much less authority than Mr. Clinton would. The provision to make participation voluntary should make the proposal more palatable to opponents of the Clinton plan in both parties.
The Labor Committee move was steeped in history, for Mr. Kennedy has campaigned for national health insurance for a quarter-century. But the bill moved out of his committee today was the first that was more than a political statement and that could perhaps become law.
President Clinton hailed the Labor Committee vote, saying it "gives me great confidence that Congress will pass legislation this year that meets the expectation of the American people: guaranteed private insurance for every American that can never be taken away." Referring to other measures in Congress, the President said, "For the first time in our history, committees in both the Senate and the House are seriously moving forward on health care reform."
Just before the vote, Mr. Kennedy told his committee, "Comprehensive health reform is a defining issue for this Congress."
He went on: "Comprehensive health reform has never been easy, or it would have been enacted long ago. The time for action is now. This committee is the first in the Senate or House to vote out comprehensive reform, but others will not be far behind."
There was drama of a different sort at the Finance Committee, as Mr. Moynihan ended the months of suspense about where he stood. He has fueled the uncertainty by speaking kindly about Republican ideas and by his occasional outbursts about parts of the Clinton plan that he thought were badly conceived.
 
'This Is Where You Begin'
 Mr. Moynihan was far more cautious in discussing his bill. Talking to reporters after his committee met, he said: "This is where you begin. You have to begin."
By proposing tax increases and an employer mandate, Mr. Moynihan was not reaching out to Republicans, who offered a range of comments, from negative to noncommittal.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said, "It doesn't look very good to me." Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri said, "I think it's a piece of paper, and we all need a piece of paper." But he added, "It's an awful lot of taxes."
More hopeful, Senator Dave Durenberger of Minnesota said, "This is more realistic" because it requires less Federal regulation than Mr. Clinton's plan. But he also said, "This is not yet a middle-of-the-road bill."
Two Democrats whose votes Mr. Moynihan will need if the committee's nine Republicans oppose his efforts were also cautiously negative. The committee has 11 Democrats.
One of these pivotal Democrats, Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, said, "I think the worst thing we could do for the country is press forward with a bill that's not on a bipartisan basis." The other, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, said the bill had too much government and too many mandates.
In the House today, the Ways and Means Committee began going over the proposal of its new acting chairman, Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida. His plan would provide more benefits than the Clinton plan with fewer taxes. But he said his proposal was not final because he did not yet have a cost analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. He said he did not know when he would get that analysis but would not hold any votes until he did.
In addition, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor voted in favor of a single-payer health plan, like the Canadian system. Under this plan, payroll taxes and others would replace insurance payments, and the Government would then pay all medical and hospital bills.
A subcommittee can send as many bills as it wants to a full committee, and this subcommittee has already approved a bill patterned on Mr. Clinton's but with more generous benefits. The full Education and Labor Committee will begin discussing that bill on Friday morning.
In approving the Kennedy bill, one Republican on the Senate Labor panel, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, joined the committee's 10 Democrats. The other six Republicans on the panel voted no.
The Kennedy bill would broaden the ability of individuals to choose health insurance beyond President Clinton's plan by allowing them to enroll in the Federal Health Benefits Program, which offers a variety of options to Federal employees, including members of Congress.
It also sought to meet widespread complaints about the potential effect on small business of requiring employers to pay for insurance. It would allow employers of 10 or fewer workers not to pay for insurance, though those who employed one to five workers would have to pay a 1 percent payroll tax and those with 6 to 10 workers would pay a 2 percent tax.
Mr. Clinton's plan had no such exemptions, though it offered subsidies, as Mr. Kennedy's does, to small employers.
The Moynihan bill is initially more generous to small business and eventually tougher on them. His plan would allow employers of up to 10 workers to pay a 1 percent tax and employers of 11 to 20 workers to pay a 2 percent tax.
But it would eliminate those exemptions and require all employers to insure their workers if by 1998 this system had not resulted in the insurance of 97 percent of employees and their dependents. Mr. Moynihan would raise the standard even higher by the year 2000, requiring all employers to insure all workers if 98.5 percent of workers and dependents were not insured.
The taxes in the Moynihan proposal drew some sharp attacks. Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said, "It's a Burger King bill, a Whopper, $190 billion in taxes." He said that was "the Democrats' way out: tax and tax and spend and spend."
 
Concern About Deficit
 Mr. Moynihan expects final revenue and spending estimates from the Congressional Budget Office by late next week. But his proposal leans away from some expensive benefits and calls for more in taxes because of his fear about increasing the deficit.
All three measures are intended to reduce the soaring rate of health care costs by instituting more competition among providers. And all declare that their formulas will guarantee that all Americans have health insurance that cannot be canceled and that cannot be denied because of pre-existing medical conditions.
All three would insure people primarily through employers but would require individuals not covered either directly or as dependents to buy their own insurance. Each would offer much larger tax benefits than are now provided for such insurance and provide large subsidies for those with low incomes.
All three bills would leave the Medicare system of health care for the elderly as it is, while providing insurance under the new systems to those now covered by Medicaid, which serves the poor.
All three bills would enable states that preferred a single-payer system to adopt one for themselves.

"POINT BY POINT: Comparing the Clinton, Kennedy and Moynihan Visions of Health Care"
 
BENEFITS:
 
Clinton: Basic benefit package includes doctor, hospital and emergency services; some coverage for mental health and substance abuse; prescription drugs; rehabilitation services; hospice, home health and extended nursing care services; preventive care; lab and diagnostic services.
 
Kennedy: Follows outlines of Clinton package but provides additional benefits for women, children, the disabled, low-income individuals and for mental health and substance abuse. Provides increased coverage for preventive exams and additional benefits for long term care.
 
Moynihan: Follows outlines of Clinton package with more generous mental health benefits but no coverage for long term care or prescription drugs for the elderly.
 
ALLIANCES:
 
Clinton: Most Americans would be required to get their coverage through regional insurance purchasing alliances. All firms with 5,000 or fewer employees would have to purchase coverage through an alliance.
 
Kennedy: Individuals could purchasing insurance from private insurers, participating in consumer health purchasing cooperatives established by the states or participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the existing plan forFederal workers.

Moynihan: Participation in alliances would be voluntary. People working for companies with fewer than 500 employees, self-employed people and those not connected to the work force could buy insurance through a cooperative. Companies with 2 to 10 workers could enroll employees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan.
 
EMPLOYER MANDATE:
 
Clinton: Employers would be required to pay about 80 percent of the costs of the average health insurance plan in their area for a single person or about 55 percent of the cost of the average family plan, but no more than 7.9 percent of payroll. Companies with 75 or fewer employees and average annual wages under $24,000 a year would be eligible for subsidies. Individuals would pay up to 20 percent of the premiums.
 
Kennedy: Would exempt small businesses with 10 or fewer employees and average annual wages under $24,000 per worker. Employers of one to five workers would be required to pay a 1 percent payroll tax instead. Employers of 6 to 10 workers would pay a 2 percent tax. Employees of exempted small businesses would be required to buy their own insurance, but with very substantial subsidies. Some companies would be elibigle for subsidies based on, depending on the wages of individual workers.
 
Moynihan: All employers with more than 20 employees would have to pay at least 80 percent of the average premium for the standard health plan. Employers of 20 or fewer workers could, as an alternative, pay a payroll tax: 1 percent for companies with 1 to 10 employees and 2 percent for those with 11 to 20 employees. As in the Kennedy plan, employees of exempted small businesses would be required to buy their own insurance, but with subsidies. "Trigger" mechanism would require small employers to pay premiums if specified percentages of workers nationwide did not have coverage from employers by certain dates.
 
TAXES:
 
Clinton: Requires a 1 percent payroll tax on companies with 5,000 or more workers. Raises the current 24 cents a pack cigarette tax an additional 75 cents for a total of 99 cents.
 
Kennedy: Requires companies with 1,000 or more employees to pay a 1 percent payroll tax. Increases the cigarette tax 75 cents above the President's plan to $1.74 per pack.
 
Moynihan: Requires companies with 500 or more employees to pay a 1 percent payroll tax. Increases the cigarette tax to $2.00 a pack. Raises the current 11 percent tax on handgun ammunition to 50 percent. Imposes a new tax on health insurance premiums. (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: New York's Council Votes Plan to Build 42d St. Trolley Line

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Reviving images of urban travel from another era, the City Council approved a plan yesterday to build a trolley line along 42d Street from one side of Manhattan to the other.
Officials said the project would cut traffic, pollution and noise, encourage development on the West Side of Manhattan and add a spectacular tourist attraction to one of New York City's most congested thoroughfares. 
 The vote by the Council, the final step in the approval process, allows the Government to seek bidders for the $135 million project. Officials said that they have selected four consortiums of companies to bid on the project. The companies would lay the track, provide the cars and operate the system on a franchise basis.
The cost of the project includes $60 million in street refurbishing and replacement of water and sewer lines, which would be paid by the city. The rest of the cost would be borne by the successful bidder, whose expenses would be recouped through fares and possibly advertising revenues.
There would be no operating subsidy from the city. City officials said that if engineering studies that the Council authorized yesterday validated their cost estimates and if the expected bids materialized the rail system would open by the end of 1996.
Despite yesterday's vote, the project is still far from becoming a certainty. Engineering studies could determine that the city's cost estimates are too conservative and that the project would not be economical.
Also, prospective bidders might shy away from the project if they concluded that the city's ridership estimates -- 9 million passengers a year -- were too optimistic. And the Giuliani administration has not set aside money for the project and would need to revise its capital plan to finance the street rehabilitation.
Officials said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was committed to the project and would seek state and Federal money to help pay the city's share.
Despite the hurdles, the vote was hailed by proponents of the rail system, primarily because it represented the last approval needed by a government body to get the project under way. The vote also authorized spending $750,000 for the engineering study to verify the cost estimates.
"It means that the West End of 42d Street will become accessible and developable," said Frederic S. Papert, president of the 42d Street Development Corporation, a private nonprofit group. "It means that New York will have the tourism attraction that the cable car has in San Francisco. It means that there will be cleaner air in midtown Manhattan. It means new life for 42d Street."
Under the plan, developed by the city's Transportation Department, a fleet of trains would travel between a terminal near the United Nations headquarters on East 42d Street and First Avenue and end at a pier at the Hudson River at West 34th Street.
 
Four Stops Planned
 The route would include four stops along 42d Street -- at Grand Central Terminal, the New York Public Library, Times Square and the Port Authority bus terminal -- and one at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center at 39th Street and 12th Avenue. Each train would accommodate up to 250 passengers -- with two cars per train in rush hours -- compared with the 75-passenger capacity of buses.
Although the rail system has come to be known as the "42d Street trolley," the fleet of 17 rail cars would more resemble sleek, futuristic subway cars with large windows. They are intended to make inaccurate the perennial complaint of crosstown travelers in midtown: that it seems to take longer to travel the 13 blocks from east to west than to travel the length of Manhattan.
Transportation Department officials say that when the project is completed, it would take 20 minutes to travel from one side of Manhattan to the other, with the trip from Grand Central to the bus terminal lasting little more than 8 minutes. Some trains would travel only between Grand Central and the bus terminal, while others would travel from one side of the island to the other.
The department said that the cost of ridership would not exceed a bus or subway ride's cost, now $1.25, and that passengers could transfer between buses to the rail system for one fare. They said they expected the system to be used by more than 9 million passengers a year, about a third of the ridership of the subway system's shuttle train linking Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.
But the construction of the rail system would permanently alter midtown traffic patterns. For example, 42d Street would become a one-way, three-lane street for westbound traffic only, with the eastbound lanes reserved for the rail system.
Transportation officials acknowledged that the adjustment of traffic would create far more severe congestion on the adjacent eastbound streets, primarily 40th Street. Officials said they were looking into increasing towing and ticketing for double-parked cars and adjusting traffic lights for greater speed.
While businesses, particularly those along 42d Street, have applauded the project, the prospect of the construction of a rail system in midtown Manhattan has been criticized by some neighborhood organizations and some public officials who fear the project could result in lengthy disruption and unnecessary costs.
While city officials conceded that there were still many hurdles before construction begins, they said they had been encouraged by the level of interest by prospective bidders.
Transportation Commissioner Elliott G. Sander said more than a dozen consortiums indicated interest in the franchise. The field was narrowed to four that the city considered most qualified to handle the project. "This administration viewed the project upon coming into office and feels very strongly about it," Mr. Sander said.

HEADLINE: Kenmore Hotel: The Place at the End of the Line

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

 BODY:
One old woman walks through the Kenmore Hotel and spells her name over and over, as if she is afraid of losing it somewhere down the long, dark hall. Another woman, her cheeks rouged a candy-apple red, goes from person to person in the lobby, asking people she has never seen before what they would like for dinner.
On the eighth floor, a man sits amid jumping fleas, crusted dirt and six-month-old newspapers, screaming that he should not have to live like this because he is an American. 
 Down the hall, a transvestite whose only possessions are a purple party dress and a fake fox fur with a hole in it talks about how the Kenmore is really not as bad as it looks, as the water backs up in the sink for the fifth straight day and a rat runs past a pile of garbage in the hall.
And on every floor, single mothers and families and other hard-working people are just trying to survive amid the craziness.
It is a blessing to be a little mad in the Kenmore, say some of the people who live there, held prisoner by their poverty and victimized by criminals who prosecutors say controlled whole floors of the building.
The 621-room Kenmore, a red-brick residential hotel at 145 East 23d Street, was seized by United States marshals on Wednesday under a little-used 1984 law that allows the authorities to take over a building being used in the sale of drugs. It had become a bizarre warehouse for crack dealers, prostitutes, robbers and extortionists, said both Federal investigators and people who live there. The criminals did not go outside. They worked the halls, said the residents.
"You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to live in the suburbs," said Phillip Yee, standing in one hall, his bare feet dirt encrusted. "I like the suburbs. In the suburbs, your neighbors don't light fires in the hall."
Residents said the hotel owner, Tran Din Truong, a Vietnamese immigrant who prosecutors say used the Kenmore as a "cash cow," allowed the building to fall apart, the filth to collect and the toilets to overflow, even as he allowed it to become a haven for criminals.
Rent that is considerably less than the usual Manhattan rate -- $ 200 a month for a room the size of a closet, with the bathroom down the hall, or $ 400 for a slightly bigger room -- has filled it over the years with elderly residents; poor people with physical, mental and emotional problems; welfare mothers, and others who cannot afford anything better.
"This is what I have to live in," said John Grant, 38, who sat on a bare narrow mattress in a filthy hole, five feet wide and about eight feet long. His voice became higher, shriller, as he talked. "Look at me. I'm dying in here. I'm dying."
He said he was unemployed, disabled and had lived in the Kenmore for 14 years. He does not own any pictures or keepsakes. The walls of his room are covered with yellowed newspaper photos that he likes to look at.
"It's not fair," he said, almost screaming. "It's not fair."
The Kenmore has been a rundown apartment house for as long as anyone can remember, but when the predators moved into the building and sold their drugs and stole from people who had almost nothing to give, when the prostitutes started having sex with clients in the stairwells and halls, the quality of life dipped even lower. The old people suffer most, said Kirk Mickels, 39, who lives on the 19th floor.
"Some are afraid to come out of their rooms," he said. "Some shouldn't be here. Some have mental problems. Some have health problems, and these people prey on them."
Dennis Brady, 43, studied music at Lehman College in the Bronx and once dreamed of being a concert pianist, but eviction from a building that went co-op, loss of a hotel job and injuries he suffered from being run over by a soda-delivery truck landed him in the Kenmore. He said he has neck, head and back pain, but he worries more about the old people there who may never get to live anywhere else.
His tiny room is crowded with books like "The Tibetan Book of the Dead" and "Celtic Heritage." One of his favorites is "Purity of Heart," by Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard, he said, would find hope in the lives of the people there, but he would want society to help them.
Others have lived worse than this already.
 
A Way Station
 For Mr. Mickels, 39, his little room is just a place to catch his breath.
"I've been told this is the last stop, but I don't believe that," said Mr. Mickels, bouncing his visiting 2-year-old grandson, Eric, on his knee.
Mr. Mickels moved into the $120-a-week room in March, shortly after being released from prison after serving six years for a crime he would rather not discuss.
"A lot of us make mistakes, and a lot of us recover," said Mr. Mickels, who grew up on Wyona Street in East New York.
Each morning he sweeps his room and then sweeps the hallway, he said, explaining that there has not been any janitorial service for a long time.
On the wall of his room, just to the left of an immaculate porcelain wall sink, are button-photos of Malcolm X and Marvin Gaye, and a photograph of Mr. Mickels, as an inmate, coordinating an entertainment event at Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, N.Y.
"I want to do prison counseling," said Mr. Mickels, who is in a training program run by the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that helps former convicts.
He said that when he leaves the Kenmore, he doesn't want to travel far from needy people, explaining that "I want to live in the ghetto. A little place. A little car. And some food in the house would be nice."
On the hotel's eighth floor, two dark rooms are joined a by a small bathroom, and for four years this suite has been home to Lonie Houng, 40, her four young children and her husband, Steven Kaplovich, 59, who makes $24,000 a year as a handyman in a Sutton Place apartment building.
The children -- Max, 5; Joey, 6; Jonathan, 9, and Juliana, 8 -- sleep on mattresses on the floor of a main room with cracked and peeling walls. The toilet does not work; water has to be poured from a bucket into the tank to flush it.
There are vermin, "lots of mice," Ms. Houng said. The family's cat, Con Mel, lies purring in a dresser drawer, asleep. He is the first line of defense, when he is awake.
"I don't mind this that much, but I feel bad for the babies. They sleep on the floor and they have asthma," Ms. Houng said. "We can survive with no problem, but they need space and they can't eat good food here. I cook on a hot plate."
Conditions at the hotel are better, in some ways, than those she left when she was brought to the United States at 14 by an American airman who became her first husband.
"There was shooting," she said of her childhood in Pleiku, where she was raised by her father, Vu Quang Trong, whom she described as "the second most famous painter in my country."
A year ago, Ms. Houng was robbed by a man in the hallway who tried to stab her. He missed when she sank to the floor, she said. "We would move," she said. "But it is hard to find people to take us with four children."
Mr. Yee said people who live in the hotel should expect life to be hard. He said people get what they pay for.
Down the hall from him, residents point to a metal exit door that has been dented several times. One resident explained that it happened when one man repeatedly clubbed another man in the head with a baseball bat but missed several times and hit the door.

HEADLINE: President to Campaign Against Teen-Age Pregnancy

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has settled on a campaign against teen-age pregnancy that includes new restrictions on welfare payments, $400 million in grants to schools and neighborhoods over five years, and the use of the President's bully pulpit to promote responsible behavior.
Officials who outlined the plan said three-quarters of the grant money would go to a thousand needy schools, to be used for education and counseling programs. While there will be much local flexibility, the programs may be loosely patterned after an Atlanta model that promotes both abstinence and contraception and uses older students as mentors. 
 The remainder of the money would be used to create about a half-dozen larger, experimental programs to improve opportunities in distressed neighborhoods. Those programs could provide teen-agers with services as diverse as family-planning clinics and recreational activities, like midnight basketball leagues.
The strategy was developed as part of President Clinton's plan to overhaul the welfare system, which he is expected to announce as early as next week. The entire package must go before Congress, where an unbridled debate is expected and passage seems unlikely this year.
 
First Welfare, Then Work
 Mr. Clinton wants to expand training opportunities for welfare recipients, but those who are still unemployed after two years will be required to enroll in a work program. The thinking is that the time limit will make welfare less attractive and so discourage teen-agers from having children they cannot support.
The number of children being born to unwed teen-agers is a source of increasing national concern. But while Mr. Clinton is putting more oratory and money into the issue than previous Presidents, it is unclear whether his Administration has the answer.
Mr. Clinton would also require unwed mothers younger than 18 to continue to live at home, and he would raise the financial penalties on those who did not seek education and training. He would also try to discourage irresponsible sexual behavior by young men by increasing efforts to collect child-support payments.
Officials said the legislative changes would be accompanied by a public campaign to urge teen-agers to avoid pregnancy and stay in school. It would include speeches by Mr. Clinton and members of his Cabinet, and, possibly, a new, nonprofit foundation to supplement the work.
Officials from many agencies spent more than a year putting the plan together, often disagreeing about whether two decades of previous experiments could offer more than vague clues about how to proceed. The decision to spend $400 million over five years is a middle position, between calling for further experiments and proclaiming a nationwide solution.
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, gave an optimistic reading of the research on past programs. "We have had some successful demonstrations in this country," she said. "What they've told us is that you have to do a lot of things, not a single thing."
But an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, Rebecca Maynard, took a dimmer view, noting that some previous programs had led to higher, not lower, pregnancy rates.
"We really don't know what to do," said Ms. Maynard, who served as a consultant to the officials drafting the Clinton plan. "We've got some promising new ideas, but they're still ideas. They haven't been tested."
Teen-age pregnancy is the most troubling end of a larger national problem: the rising incidence of out-of-wedlock births at all ages. Single-parent families are much more likely than those headed by two parents to experience poverty and associated traumas like crime or drug abuse.
The problem is acute for the children of unwed parents who are themselves teen-agers. Administration officials express it as a tale of two poverty rates. About 80 percent of the children born to unwed, teen-age dropouts will live in poverty. But the figure is only 8 percent for parents who finish high school, marry and defer having children until age 20.
The number of children born to unwed teen-agers has sharply risen in recent years -- from about 250,000 in 1980 to about 357,000 a decade later. The reasons are complex and not entirely understood, but they seem to include increased sexual activity among most teen-agers and diminishing economic prospects for those in the poorest neighborhoods.
Administration officials conducted several reviews of the academic literature on teen-age pregnancy, including one review led by William Galston, a staff member of the White House Domestic Policy Council.
 
'Abstinence-Plus'
 "I came to the conclusion that we had, in fact, learned something from the previous decade," he said. "You might describe the emerging consensus as 'abstinence-plus.' "
Mr. Galston said that for teen-agers 15 or younger "the principal message has to be: don't, you're too young." For older teen-agers, he said, "the principal message is still, 'don't, but if you do, act responsibly and make sure you don't do something that harms your future.' "
Mr. Galston and other officials are impressed by the Postponing Sexual Involvement Program, which serves eighth graders in 16 Atlanta schools. The program supplements a curriculum on human sexuality with talks by high school students that encourage the postponement of sexual activity.
Marion Howard, the program's director, said the older students sometimes conduct role-playing exercises to help girls ward off unwanted sexual advances. Among the social skills that she said were being imparted was, "How to say 'no' without hurting the other person's feelings."
The program also refers sexually active teen-agers to a clinic, where they can get contraceptives.
 
Uncertain Research
 Ms. Howard said an evaluation had found that the program was delaying the onset of sexual activity by a year and was reducing pregnancies by about one-third, but she cautioned that the last finding was based on a small research sample.
But Ms. Maynard, the former Administration consultant, says such success stories are often based on imprecise research techniques and can be impossible to duplicate on a larger scale.
She helped evaluate a program called the Teen-age Parent Demonstration, which provided intensive counseling and education to 6,000 teen-age mothers in New Jersey and Illinois. She found the services had done nothing to keep the mothers from having a second child. And in Chicago, she said, the program had an effect opposite than what was intended: unwed mothers were more likely to have an additional child.
 
Opposite Effect
 Ms. Maynard speculated that in making young mothers feel more competent the program might have made them feel competent enough to raise a second child.
Under the Clinton program, the Government would choose 200 schools a year for the next five years to receive grants of about $60,000 a year. The schools would have latitude in designing their programs, but they would also have to specify the underlying scientific research.
Officials supplemented their talk of legislative details by stressing the importance of a cultural campaign to encourage responsible sexuality. A White House aide, Gene Sperling, foresaw "a wide-ranging mobilization effort, including not only Cabinet members but also outside people."
Mr. Sperling was vague about the extent of Mr. Clinton's direct involvement, but he predicted that the President would continue to make remarks like those he offered in February at Kramer Junior High School in Washington, D.C. Mr. Clinton told the students to "make up your mind you're not going to have a baby until you are old enough to take care of it, until you're married."

HEADLINE: P.L.O. Pleads for Faster Disbursement of Foreign Aid Money

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 9

 BODY:
The Palestine Liberation Organization is pressing for a speedier disbursement of millions of dollars pledged by foreign governments and international agencies for projects in Gaza and Jericho, asserting that it urgently needs $177 million from a Paris meeting of aid donors that will conclude on Friday.
But P.L.O. officials are resisting some donors' insistence on stringent measures to supervise the spending of the money, complaining that some of these requirements for accountability are humiliating and cumbersome. 
In a reversal of old roles, Israeli officials are joining the P.L.O. in arguing for less stringent controls. Israel has sent a high-level delegation headed by Yossi Sarid, the Environment Minister, to assist the Palestinians in the Paris talks.
The Israelis are becoming worried that lack of funds may seriously impair Palestinian efforts to begin self-government. Israel plans to complete handing over responsibility for the upkeep of public services in Jericho and Gaza in three months. This means that hospitals will no longer be supplied with medication and that electric power will be cut off if the nascent Palestinian National Authority fails to make payments for power to the Israeli Government.
 
A Growing Police Force
 P.L.O. officials here said the immediate infusion of at least $100 million this month is necessary to pay the salaries of a steadily growing police force whose numbers are approaching 7,000, and to fix sewers, supply hospitals with medication and pay teachers.
Foreign donors had pledged some $2.4 billion in financial aid to the Palestinians, but the mechanisms for disbursing these sums have yet to be clarified. So far, only $7 million, from the United States and Norway, has reached Palestinian hands.
Much of this money has already gone to pay overdue salaries of the Palestinian police staff, most of whose members had not been paid for more than seven months before arriving in Gaza and Jericho last month.
"The money is the carrot for signing the peace agreement with Israel," said Hassan Abu Libdah, deputy chairman of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, which is the agency in charge of receiving and spending financial aid in the autonomous regions. "We have signed. Yet all we hear now is demands for accounting before we even get more funds. It's like being considered guilty before the trial. Let us have the funds and we will account for them."
 
Palestinians' Cash Needs
 According to agency figures, the P.L.O. estimates that it will need $381 million this year to launch the self-rule process. Palestinian officials said they expect to raise $204 million of this sum from taxes and various fees collected in Jericho and Gaza.
In an effort to show that they are serious about tax and bill collection, P.L.O. officials began to distribute leaflets in Gaza on Wednesday warning that electricity will be cut off to Palestinians who fail to pay their bills. But even if they meet their target in tax collection, Palestinian officials say they will face a steep deficit.
"We will have a deficit of $177 million, and without securing it we can't build new administrations or pay the police force or employees," said Ahmed Qurei, the P.L.O.'s newly appointed finance minister. Mr. Qurei is responsible for negotiating most of the economic agreements with Israel related to the peace treaty signed in Cairo on May 4.
 
Donors Meet in Paris
 Representatives of foreign donors, which include the United States, the European Union, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Norway, the World Bank and other parties, began meeting in Paris today to discuss the difficulties blocking the flow of money.
Most donors seem to favor well-planned projects and some accountability -- procedures which the P.L.O. describes both as delaying tactics and an unwarranted intrusion.
"I can understand that donors are concerned about how their funds will be spent, but their conditions are humiliating because no Palestinian official will go begging to donors each month and tell them, 'Please pay my employees' salaries,' " Mr. Qurei said recently.

HEADLINE: NATO Rebuffs the Russians On Role in Decision-Making

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, June 9

 BODY:
NATO decided today to pay special attention to Russia because of its history and military strength, but it rejected Moscow's demand for a voice in NATO decision-making.
In agreeing to join the American-inspired Partnership for Peace program, which offers a sort of junior partnership to members of the former Warsaw Pact, Russia had hoped that it could have a special formal relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that was on a higher level from that of smaller countries. 
 At a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels last month, Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev of Russia called for a "full-blooded strategic relationship" with NATO that would go beyond the "partnership" framework to enhance military cooperation with its former enemies, and a separate document formalizing that special relationship.
He said at the time that Russia's status as Europe's largest nuclear power required a broader "consultative mechanism" with NATO that would involve nuclear disarmament, peacekeeping missions, conversion of military industries and dealing with global threats like terrorism and environmental pollution.
But the NATO communique today and statements by NATO officials and foreign ministers made clear that that would not be the case. They also assured the rest of Eastern and Central Europe that NATO's enhanced cooperation with Moscow would not signal a 1990's version of the 1945 Yalta accord, which led to the division of the Continent.
 
No 'New Dividing Lines'
 "We will not draw new dividing lines across Europe nor engage in a NATO-Russian condominium," the Deputy Secretary General of NATO, Sergio Balanzino, told reporters after today's meetings. "No country can hold a droit de regard over NATO," he added, meaning that no outsider could veto a NATO policy or decision.
A number of ministers went out of their way to speak of cooperation, not confrontation, with Moscow. "No vetoes, no surprises, substantial cooperation," Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain told reporters in explaining the relationship that NATO envisions with Moscow. By that, he said, he meant that Russia would not be allowed to veto NATO decisions, that NATO would not spring surprises on Moscow and that both sides would work to increase cooperation.
But Mr. Hurd also made clear that NATO did not believe that there was a need for "an extra document accorded to Russia and not to others."
In a speech to NATO and in remarks to reporters, Secretary of State Warren Christopher also stressed the positive, welcoming Russia's new role in NATO and laying out specific areas in which Russia would cooperate in a unique way with the Western alliance.
"Russia's size, broad interests, resources and military capabilities provide the basis for a productive relationship with NATO in addition to the Partnership for Peace," Mr. Christopher said. He added that the safe dismantlement of nuclear weapons and nonproliferation strategies would be natural areas for cooperation.
Mr. Grachev pledged in Brussels last month that Russia would join the partnership plan, and NATO members are eager for Russian leaders to sign onto it as soon as possible. Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia is certain to be asked his country's intentions in meetings between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact members on Friday.
 
A Face-Saving Way Out
 But Mr. Christopher offered his Russian counterpart a face-saving way out of committing his country to a date certain on Friday, telling reporters that it would be natural for Mr. Kozyrev to want to consult with the leadership back home first.
On the war in Bosnia, Mr. Christopher told reporters that the United States could support the lifting of economic sanctions against the Serbs if they were to accept a peace settlement in Bosnia and the Bosnian Muslim Government was to reject it. From the very beginning, he said, it was understood under a current plan that "if the Serbian government agrees on a settlement and acts upon it, then there could be a contemplation of the lifting of sanctions." He added, "There's nothing new about that at all."
Mr. Christopher would not be drawn into a discussion of whether the United States would resuscitate its plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims if they agreed to a peace plan but the Serbs rejected it.
In a meeting with French leaders in Paris on Tuesday, President Clinton said that there would be negative consequences for the party that did not embrace the emerging plan, adding that consideration would have to be given to lifting economic sanctions against the Serbs if they accepted peace, but the Bosnian Muslims rejected it.

HEADLINE: North Korea Threatens Japan Over Backing U.S.-Led Sanctions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 9

 BODY:
North Korea threatened today to mete out a "deserving punishment" to Japan if it cuts off the North's chief source of hard currency or joins in other economic sanctions, apparently in an effort to intimidate its wealthy neighbor from participating in an American-led effort to force the North to accept nuclear inspections.
North Korean officials have denounced Japan before and have accused it of harboring plans to build nuclear weapons of its own. But this appeared to be the first time that the North threatened to target Japan if it joined the movement for sanctions in the United Nations. 
 Japanese officials have said in the past that North Korea does not have the military ability to pose a direct threat to the country, apart from its experimental Rodong-1 missile, which may be able to strike Osaka and Western Japan. But they fear that North Korean agents living in the large Korean community here could easily disrupt cities or perform acts of terrorism.
If Japan should "join force in any sanctions against us," the North said in a statement monitored in Tokyo, "we would regard it as a declaration of war and Japan would be unable to avoid a deserving punishment for it."
While such language is common from the North these days, the Japanese Government has done little to prepare the public for the possibility that a confrontation could develop, and officials clearly fear that the North's attempt to rattle the country could work.
 
Monitoring Troop Movements
 In Seoul today the South Korean Defense Minister, Rhee Byong Tae, told the Parliament that the United States and the South Korean military had stepped up its reconnaissance efforts to monitor troop movements in the North. He said that while there had been no unusual activity, the North has stockpiled extensive supplies and deployed a number of new weapons systems just north of the Demilitarized Zone.
In recent days Japan has been arguing to slow the sanctions efforts somewhat, and to give North Korea another warning about opening its nuclear installations.
Officials here are wary of a quick cut-off of the $600 million to $1.8 billion that intelligence agencies say is funneled to the North's Government every year by Korean residents in Japan. That sanction, they argue, should come later because it would have a devastating effect on ordinary citizens in the North.
The Japanese Foreign Minister, Koji Kakizawa, warned the Parliament today that "we must avoid remarks that might incite North Korea." His aides said Mr. Kakizawa was growing increasingly concerned that the allies could talk themselves into a conflict with the North.
 
China Opposes Sanctions
 The North Korean warning came as China told the South Korean Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo, that it was not ready to join a sanctions resolution at the United Nations.
"We are not in favor of the involvement of the United Nations Security Council in this issue," the spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Shen Guofang, said today. "We do not agree on sanctions, because sanctions will only serve to push the parties concerned into confrontation with one another and result in a situation no one wants to see."
It was unclear, however, whether China would veto any sanctions effort in the Security Council or simply abstain. Mr. Han said little as he emerged from the meeting.
Administration officials have said in recent weeks that if they could not get a sanctions resolution through the Security Council, they would attempt to organize informal sanctions with Japan and South Korea. However, that would do little to cut off oil and other vital supplies that the North imports across the Chinese border.

How Do Japan's Rulers Approach U.S.? Carefully

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 9

 BODY:
There is nothing simple about sending the Emperor of Japan on a two-week tour, especially when the destination is America.
So much can go wrong -- just ask the bureaucrats who thought it would be a nice touch to send the royal couple to Pearl Harbor until someone thought better of it -- and there are so many uncomfortable issues to be neatly sidestepped, like a $60 billion trade surplus. 
 So it is no wonder that after five decades of intensive training and five years on the job as symbol of the state, Emperor Akihito, 60, is the master of innocuous conversation. But that makes it all the more remarkable that the middle-aged couple who arrive in the United States on Friday have managed to breathe a bit of new life into a 1,600-year-old monarchy that, as Emperor Hirohito might have put it, was not necessarily developing to Japan's advantage.
Japan's leaders have never failed to mold the Emperor to fit the current needs of the state -- Hirohito was transformed from a uniformed military leader on a white horse to a quiet biologist -- and the 11-city tour gives them a chance to do it anew.
And while the Government protests that everything the Emperor does is apolitical, no one denies that the mission to America is part of a grander scheme to portray Japan as something more than a source of Walkmans and economic heartache.
It doesn't hurt that this is the first royal couple in two millenniums who might actually enjoy a tour of Monticello, a weekend in the Rocky Mountains or a few innings at the Cardinals-Pirates game in St. Louis. All three are on the whirlwind schedule.
The image-makers have been so busy that suddenly imperial candor and a public sharing of pain -- within carefully defined limits, of course -- are suddenly permissible. To the astonishment of the Japanese press, Empress Michiko, who is 59, did the unthinkable last week: she talked about the mysterious illness, presumed to be some kind of nervous breakdown, that left her unable to speak last fall.
"The worry and sadness of having lost my speech grew bigger and bigger each day," she said at a news conference, speaking in a weak but clearly audible voice. Though she made no direct reference to a spate of critical magazine articles about her that many believe triggered her illness, she offered this tidbit of introspection, "My heart, weary and sad at the time I was taken ill, had become hard and fragile, for which I now blame myself."
By British tabloid standards, this may hardly seem like hot stuff, but it has its appeal in Japan. Michiko is the subject of considerable sympathy, and her critics have been stunned into silence. Instead, the weekly gossip magazines are filled with speculation over when Crown Princess Masako, a graduate of Harvard and then a diplomat, will provide the country with a future Emperor. (Twice the press has declared her pregnant, so far incorrectly.)
But new and youthful as the imagery may be, Akihito is still dogged by the war that was launched in his father's name. He has spent much of the last five years on an "apology tour" of the region, including the first visit of a Japanese monarch to China. He has swung down through Southeast Asia, and even went to mend fences with the residents of Okinawa, the only Japanese territory invaded in World War II.
"These were training missions," a Japanese diplomat joked the other day. "America's the big leagues."
Since nothing is done lightly in the palace, the Emperor has spent weeks boning up on contemporary America. There have been briefings on social issues, delving into everything from health care to gun control. There was lunch with former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, now the American Ambassador here. Japanese business executives were called in to talk trade -- within limits. One of Japan's most prominent executives confessed the other night that if the discussion ever ventured into something mildly controversial "His Majesty skillfully moved on to another topic."
A small group of American reporters was even invited for a no-quotations-please audience over coffee at which the Emperor and Empress chatted about their lives and inquired about the United States while legions of nervous aides circled.
It is within the bounds of the ground rules to say that the Emperor expressed his understanding that two countries as big as America and Japan will go through a lot of ups and downs; he is looking forward to seeing if squirrels still populate the parks of Washington, and he was amazed, during a trip through the Rocky Mountains years ago, that his limousine drove for hours without passing more than a handful of people. Try that in Japan, he said.
Anything beyond such chitchat, though, is left to the hands of the professionals in the Foreign Ministry, who script every word and calibrate every expression of regret. They were the ones, it turned out, who created a miniature crisis here before the Emperor was even packed.
It arose when someone decided to send the Emperor to Honolulu to meet Japanese-Americans. How could he go to Honolulu without stopping off at the memorial over the sunken U.S.S. Arizona?
There was anguish and hand-wringing and consultations and finally a decision that the visit would simply raise anew all the old questions about war responsibility. After fumbling for official explanations, a few officials explained that if the Emperor visited Pearl Harbor this year, the Japanese right wing would bring enormous pressure on the Government to send him next year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, to Yaskuni Shrine, where the Japanese heroes of the war are enshrined. And that would not do.
If the Emperor himself has thoughts on this he is, as always, keeping his own counsel. "In World War II, many lives were lost, many people were wounded and many people suffered," he wrote recently, neatly ducking a written question about whether Japan should keep apologizing for events that happened half a century ago. "My heart grieves deeply because of this."

HEADLINE: Everything's Coming Up Vanilla

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Vanilla is no longer plain vanilla.
Suddenly this age-old, ho-hum flavoring is a hot marketing concept. Women are spraying it on as perfume, bathing in it and using it as a lip gloss. Men will soon be sampling vanilla cologne. Makers of cake frosting, flavored coffee and ice cream say every new vanilla offering these days becomes an instant best seller. Food companies are using vanilla to put some zest in low-fat dairy desserts. And a recent study of patients undergoing tests at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York praised vanilla's scent as soothing -- especially while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging. 
 "Vanilla is the scent of the moment," said Annette Green, president of the Fragrance Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York that sniffs out scent trends.
"It's the new musk," she said, referring to the fragrance blockbuster of two decades ago. In the scent world, she added, "vanilla is the first dominant element to come out of the kitchen, and that makes it almost revolutionary." As cosmetics executives put it, vanilla makes the big "smell impression."
Vanilla, which some food historians believe was first brought to the United States by Thomas Jefferson, has long been an important ingredient in food and fragrance. So how can a flavoring so old be perceived as new?
Vanilla "evokes memories of home and hearth, warmth and cuddling," said Susan Rosenthal, director of marketing at International Flavors and Fragrances, the world's largest scent and taste purveyor.
In September, Coty Inc. introduced Vanilla Fields cologne spray mist for women and rang up $25 million in retail sales in four months. Kmart discount stores started marketing it last fall and it has become the retailer's most popular fragrance. "Manufacturers see vanilla as a trend, and a lot of them are coming to us with vanilla scents," said Lorraine Boyle, co-buyer for the Kmart Corporation in Troy, Mich.
In August, Coty plans to introduce yet another vanilla fragrance. "We thought, why not put vanilla and musk together?" said Mary Manning, vice president of market development. Thus, Vanilla Musk was born.
At the Bonne Bell Company, vanilla has been added to its line of Smacker and Lip Smacker glosses and the company has introduced a new scent, Vanilla Blossom Fragrance, as well as Vanilla Vibes shower and bath gels. "We're going to see tons of activity with vanilla in the next six months," said Jess Bell Jr., vice president for marketing.
And next fall, a big competitor will be a scent called French Vanilla from Parfums Parquet, a division of Houbigant Inc. of Ridgefield, N.J. "We've used vanilla before now, to give fragrances warmth, sensuousness and buttery softness," said Gene Folkers, the division's vice president of marketing. "But this is the first time we're giving vanilla star status." French Vanilla will debut in October with a $5 million ad campaign.
 Vanilla scents are even doing well at the pricey peak of the fragrance market. Thierry Mugler, a French designer, reports brisk sales of "Angel," a vanilla-scented perfume priced at $150 for a 75-milliliter star-shaped blue bottle.
 
 
Hold the Flowers
 Although some shoppers reject vanilla is too sweet and cloying, others prefer vanilla scents "because they're not too flowery," said Jeaneane Judelson, an event coordinator for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation in New York. For three months she has been wearing Chopard Casmir, a vanilla-based scent sold at Saks Fifth Avenue stores. "I've never been a person who liked floral fragrances," she said, "and now we have these alternatives."
Vanilla is also an important constituent of three new fragrances for men: the just-released Samba Nova Homme from Perfumer's Workshop in New York; the soon-to-be marketed Nicole Miller for Men, made by Riviera Concepts of Toronto, and Cassini for Men, scheduled for introduction in the fall by Cassini Parfums.
The vanilla boom is not entirely natural. Different products may use real beans, pure vanilla extract and vanillin -- often a less expensive, artificial version used in scents and some baking confections -- or some combination of ingredients. Frequently, Government food labeling standards dictate which can be used. Also, "all natural" marketing considerations or lower-cost generic brands may prompt food companies to choose different forms of vanilla.
David Gilman, a spokesman for Haagen-Dazs, the ice cream company, said that depending on cost and labeling strategies, the tendency was "to use the real beans, because customers can taste the difference."
Imports of beans, principally from Indonesia and Madagascar, have not shown noticeable growth, but Mark Mitchell, a product manager for vanilla extract at McCormick & Company, the big spice producer, said McCormick's extract sales were running ahead of overall food industry growth this year, mostly because of the growing use of vanilla in reduced-fat foods.
"We're using vanilla to mask 'off-notes' in food when you pull fat out," he said. "That is a big area of work for us, creating customized vanilla flavors and extracts for reduced-fat food products."
 
 
A 'Less Frenzied' Flavor
 Andrew Shore, an analyst who follows the cosmetics and food industries for Paine Webber Inc., said: "It's making a surge in coffee and other foods. Vanilla is clean, it's pure, and perhaps it reflects America's yearning for a return to a less frenzied past."
Social science provides some evidence that vanilla has calming qualities. A research study of 85 patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who were undergoing magnetic-resonance-imaging testing found that a sweet vanilla scent reduced their anxiety and lowered their stress. Sixty-five percent of the patients described the scent as relaxing, pleasant and soothing.
In the scent world, at least, the very notion that vanilla could be newly popular is something of an import. "We knew vanilla scents were selling well in Europe, and we thought they could work here," said Mr. Bell of Bonne Bell. Houbigant also enjoyed success in Europe with a vanilla fragrance, and on the strength of that introduced the fragrance in the United States, said Mr. Folkers of Parfums Parquet.
But in the world of coffee, ice cream and cake frosting, the vanilla boom seems to be a function of strong demand, as well as vanilla's status as the substitute of choice for makers of low-fat desserts seeking a tasty fat replacement that also masks the taste of diet-food ingredients.
 
 
Scoop of the Decade
 At Haagen-Dazs, which is owned by Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain, sales of vanilla ice creams soared to $37 million last year, from $27 million in 1990, a company spokesman said, and in April, sales of its vanilla flavors were up 6.7 percent from a year earlier. In August, Haagen-Dazs plans to introduce Brownies a la Mode, a vanilla flavor mixed with chunks of brownies.
Vanilla, already a leading ingredient of cola, cream soda and other beverages, is enjoying new success as a flavoring in coffee. "Vanilla has never been more in demand, and its popularity is growing," said Ted R. Lingle, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America in Long Beach, Calif., a trade group of 1,600 premium coffee companies.
In its first comprehensive survey of retailers in March, hazelnut, a blend of vanilla and a nutlike flavor, accounted for 44.7 percent of flavored-coffee sales, far ahead of any other flavor category.
Six months ago, Maxwell House Instant Cappuccino added a vanilla flavor to its product line, and it has already become the best-selling flavor, said a spokeswoman for General Foods U.S.A., a unit of Philip Morris. Three years ago General Foods International Coffees introduced French Vanilla Cafe to its line of 12 other flavored coffees, and it has become the line's best seller.
 The popularity of vanilla has extended to cake mixes and frostings as well. "Recently we've seen a growth and segmentation of the lighter-colored flavors, where vanilla is a major constituent," said Matthew Smith, marketing manager of Pillsbury dessert mixes for Grand Metropolitan.
Eighteen months ago, Pillsbury introduced a number of vanilla flavors (including French Vanilla, Golden Vanilla and Vanilla With Fudge) in its Pillsbury Plus line of frostings and cake mixes, "and all of them shot into the top third of the cake-mix market," he said.
But beyond the new vanilla worship, why has the flavoring had such enduring popularity?
"As a species we are naturally sweet-loving, probably harking back to memories of mother's milk," said Sarah Friend, vice president and director of fragrance evaluation for International Flavors and Fragrances. "Right now consumers are confused and frightened, thanks to these economic times, and they're returning to flavors and fragrances that are comforting and familiar.
"The trend is, 'Hey, let's get back to basics here.' You can even see it in the movies, with the return of 'The Flintstones,' and on Broadway, with all those revivals."

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Opens Airwaves To Fierce Competition

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
In opening up a big portion of the airwaves for new wireless telephone and data services, the Federal Communications Commission set the stage today for a fierce technological competition to serve people on the go.
While the conventional wisdom holds that wireless communications will be increasingly popular for some time, that hardly means that every market participant will succeed. 
 Each of three competing approaches for delivering wireless telephone and data services has different strengths and weaknesses.
One approach is the traditional cellular systems. With about 16 million customers, these companies have a huge head start on their rivals and are growing rapidly and installing new technology to compete with newer entrants. In this camp is the AT&T Corporation, which has agreed to buy the nation's biggest cellular company, McCaw Cellular Communications, for $12.6 billion.
 
Digital Technology Used
 The second technology, not far behind cellular, is "specialized mobile radio" carriers, which use new digital technology to transform frequencies reserved for taxi and truck dispatch services into cellular telephone and data networks. Nextel Communications, a small New Jersey company, has won licenses covering areas with 180 million people and teamed up with MCI Communications to develop a nationwide network.
The third technology, to be adopted by the newest group of contenders, will use the radio frequencies now being opened by the F.C.C. The new frequencies offer more than twice as much capacity as today's cellular telephone systems, and the new entrants will be able to start with the newest digital technology.
AT&T executives have said they are still interested in the new frequencies that the F.C.C. is opening up, but they are gambling that being in the market early is the most important criterion for success.
In its action today, the F.C.C. decided to auction off three big new licenses in every market; each will cover radio frequencies totaling 30 megahertz, or slightly more than a standard cellular telephone license. It will also auction off three smaller licenses for 10 megahertz, which can be used individually or in combination with other licenses.
The commission also decided to let cellular companies acquire up to 10 megahertz inside their current operation territories, and an additional 5 megahertz in the year 2000.
 
Success Not Assured
 Success is hardly assured. The new systems will cost billions of dollars to build, will not be operational in less than two years and will have to compete against the well established cellular industry.
Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C.'s chairman, emphasized that the commission was setting few guidelines about how the frequencies can be used and was primarily interested in creating a "level playing field."
"This is the first time that any country has committed itself to vigorous competition in a communications industry from Day One," Mr. Hundt said. "This means there will very likely be winners and losers, and lots of mixed results. But the guarantee I would give is that the economy will be the winner, and the consumers will be the winner."
Industry analysts predict that the biggest bidders for the new frequencies will AT&T and the regional Bell companies, which will seek to expand the reach of their cellular services.
Through McCaw, for example, AT&T will have licenses that reach only about 65 million people, or 35 percent of the United States population. Likewise, Baby Bell companies like Bell Atlantic and U S West have made it clear that they want to expand outside their territories.
The trick will be picking markets that can sustain as many as six competing services, and figuring out what to bid for the licenses.
"I'm not convinced that every market will support three or four or five players," said Lawrence T. Babbio, chief operating officer of the Bell Atlantic Corporation. "We have to look at those markets where we think the demographics lend thesmelves to three or four players."
Mark Lowenstein, director of wireless research at the Yankee Group, predicted that consumers would be confused at first by the cacophony of services, but that the contenders would ultimately target certain segments, such as budget-conscious consumers or business customers.
"I don't think any one of them will predominate," he said. "Over time, it will become clear to the user which one will be most appropriate."

HEADLINE: New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

 BODY:
While political leaders across the country talk loudly about illegal immigrants as a costly burden, the two most prominent politicians in New York go so far as to describe them as a boon.
This week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo quietly decided against suing the Federal Government to recover the costs of social services to illegal immigrants, rejecting for now a tactic chosen by Florida, California and Texas. He opted instead to negotiate with the Clinton Administration for reimbursement. He thus avoided a public debate that would put Mr. Cuomo, long a champion of immigrants, in the awkward position of portraying some as a drain on society. 
 "I want to negotiate with the Government instead for a lot of reasons," Mr. Cuomo said yesterday in an interview. "And one of them is, frankly, that when you bring a lawsuit on this issue, it sends out the wrong message. I love immigrants. Legal, illegal -- they're not to be despised."
Last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuiliani gave an even more spirited defense of illegal immigrants, virtually urging them to settle in New York City. Standing before television cameras, he criticized the growing hostility toward illegal immigrants across the country as simplistic and unsophisticated.
"Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are undocumented aliens," Mr. Giuliani said. "If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you're one of the people who we want in this city. You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair."
The politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers.
"So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal," Mr. Cuomo said.
Because of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it.
Illegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup. So the racism that often compounds anti-immigrant sentiment is not as stark in New York.
And against the backdrop of such tolerance, it does not jibe with the image of a New York politician, Democrat or Republican, to speak too long or too loudly about immigrants as a drag -- unless the immigrants are convicted felons.
Florida's lawsuit, announced by Gov. Lawton Chiles in a March news conference on the sand in Key Biscayne, describes a "virtual 'invasion' of the state of Florida by aliens." Such loaded language is anathema in New York.
 
No Lament on the Beach
 "You won't see Mario Cuomo standing on the beach in Far Rockaway and evoking images of how vulnerable New York is," said Frank Sharry, director of the National Immigration Forum, a national advocacy group in Washington. "That just doesn't play."
Governor Chiles, a Democrat, filed suit on April 11 to recoup $1 billion that Florida calculates it spends on social services for illegal immigrants. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, sued the Federal Government on April 30 for $2 billion to cover the cost of jailing illegal immigrants, and promised further suits on other costs.
Both Governors are running for re-election, and evidently believe that voters want them to stand tough on illegal immigration. For Mr. Wilson, the denial of all services and rights to illegal immigrants is central to his campaign.
Mr. Cuomo, who is also up for re-election, first weighed joining Florida's suit, which is so broad as to combine the costs of legal and illegal immigrants. He also considered a separate suit by New York State, estimating the cost to New York at $1 billion, largely for the education of immigrant children. But at the same time, he began pressuring the Clinton Administration to help the states.
 
'Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric'
 In April, the Administration asked Congress to appropriate $350 million to compensate states for the cost of incarcerating illegal-immigrant felons. After that, Mr. Cuomo postponed his plans for a lawsuit.
"I'm sure Governor Cuomo is reluctant to use a tactic made famous by the inflammatory anti-immigrant rhetoric of Pete Wilson -- even if he agrees with the objective of having the Federal Government assist the high-immigrant states," said Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project for the American Civil Liberties Union.
There are 3.85 million illegal immigrants in the country, according to Robert Warren, chief of statistics for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. California has the greatest number, with about 1.6 million. New York is a distant second, with 510,000, followed by Texas, with 405,000, and Florida, with 373,000.
No one knows just what illegal immigrants cost states. Immigration experts criticize the states' estimates as one-sided fiscal calculations that ignore illegal immigrants' economic contributions. Many are taxpayers; most are customers; some are even entrepreneurs.
 
All Americans Cost More
 The states' estimates also focus on immigrants who have just arrived in this country, which gives a misleading picture of their lifetime contribution. Over time, many illegal immigrants become legal, earn more money and pay more taxes. The average household income of legal immigrants surpasses that of natives after 10 years in this country, according to a recent study by the Urban Institute.
Still, illegal immigrants do cost the states money, as do native-born Americans. Americans happen to cost more than they pay in taxes. Most of the illegal immigrants' cost lies in education for their children, followed by emergency medical care and prison costs. Texas, which plans to sue the Federal Government soon, is the only state that subtracted estimated tax payments from its cost calculations. Texas estimates that illegal immigrants contribute $290 million to the state and cost $456 million.
Even in New York, a state that frowns on portraying immigrants negatively, it is more than acceptable to talk about illegal-immigrant felons as a burden.
But even on this issue, New York, for the moment, does not go as far as California and Florida. It wants the Federal Government to pay the cost of illegal immigrants who have served their sentences but linger in state prisons awaiting deportation.
 
U.S. Speeds Deportations
 New York State sued the Federal Government in 1992 to force it to take custody of those ex-convicts, and a Federal judge ordered New York to keep housing them.
But the Justice Department, in a pilot program with New York, has recently started expediting deportations. In the program's first eight weeks, 180 orders of deportation have been issued to illegal-immigrant prisoners compared with 270 in all 1992. It is a sign that the Administration is prepared to work with the states, Mr. Cuomo said.

Bonds Steady as Traders Await Report on Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bond prices ended with little change yesterday as traders awaited today's Government report on producer prices in May.
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 1/32 of a point, or 31 cents per $1,000 bond, while the yield remained unchanged at 7.27 percent. 
 The 10-year Treasury note was also unchanged, at 6.95 percent, and intermediate- and short-term Treasury issues showed little change.
Some bond traders are nervous that the Labor Department's report on its Producer Price Index may show signs of accelerating inflation. In a survey, economists expect the May producer prices report to show an overall increase of one-tenth of 1 percent. They expect an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent when volatile food and energy sectors are excluded.
 
Looking at the Fed
 A higher-than-expected rise in the Producer Price Index would probably revive the bond market's concerns that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates once more to restrain inflation.
The Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates four times this year to restrain the inflationary pressures on the economy.
Adding to the concerns was a comment by Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, who was quoted in news reports as saying that the difference between the inflation rate and the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans was at a historic low.
Consumer prices in the 12 months ended in April rose 2.4 percent, down from 2.7 percent a year earlier. The Federal funds rate is about 4.25 percent. The difference between the two is 1.85 percentage points, compared with an average spread of 2.65 points since January 1985.
Mr. Lindsey's statement suggests the Fed is not done raising rates, said Neil DeSarno, the head United States bond trader at S. G. Warburg & Company. "It doesn't sound bullish," he said. "There's a possibility we could return to the bear market we've been accustomed to the last four months."
Michael Krauss, chief fixed-income technical analyst at Lehman Brothers, said a drop in the open interest in bond futures contracts, even as prices rose during the last week, suggested that the bond market was prone to fall. Open interest measures the total number of contracts outstanding.
Declining open interest "means money is flowing out of the marketplace on up moves," Mr. Krauss said.
In the corporate market, Ontario sold $1 billion of global bonds amid demand for a growing number of new issues.
Demand for Ontario's bonds was greater than expected, money managers said. The 10-year issue was priced to yield 7.625 percent, or 67 basis points more than the Treasury's 10-year bond.
The Ontario bonds were expected to yield as much as 70 basis points more than the Treasury bond. "There was more interest than expected" in the offering, which was sold simultaneously in the United States and overseas, said Bruce Masters, who helps manage about $7 billion at the Great Western Life Insurance Company.

HEADLINE: Europe, Not Japan, Is Called America's Frontier for Trade

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Since taking office, the Clinton Administration's message to American business has been unambiguous: "Follow the Sun." At every opportunity the Clinton team has described the Asia-Pacific region as the nation's most lucrative economic frontier. But a new study published today challenges that thesis, by amassing trade data that suggest that Europe remains America's most important economic partner and will be for years to come.
The Economic Strategy Institute, a private research group financed by American corporations, compared Asia and Western Europe in categories like trade, foreign direct investment in the United States, American direct investment abroad and technology transfers. The study concluded that the links between the United States and Europe benefited the American economy far more than those between the United States and Asia. 
 The study argues that America has much more balanced trade with Europe, and more mutually beneficial commerce, because the two markets have basically similar models of capitalism. By contrast, Japan and the other Asian nations have capitalist systems that differ greatly from that of the United States in terms of corporate structure, antitrust rules and government-business relations. This produces "highly skewed flows of goods, capital and technology," the study said.
Such conclusions will fuel the already heated debate on this subject between traditional economists and revisionists. The revisionists argue that while the Asians practice capitalism, they practice a distinctly Asian brand that makes their markets more difficult to penetrate. The conventional wisdom within the economics profession is that "capitalism is capitalism is capitalism," and therefore discrepancies in trade and investment flows between regions have more to do with basic economics -- such as the relative saving and investment rates -- and not culturally based variations in market systems.
A communality of interest has been lost during the recent, often rancorous negotiations between the United States and Europe over the new global trading rules for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The relatively minor disputes over agriculture subsidies, airplane subsidies and movies soured both sides.
"Critics might say, 'Well, even if Europe has been important to us in the past, it won't be in the future, given the dynamism in Asia,' " said Clyde Prestowitz Jr., the institute's president and co-author of the study. "To which I would say two things: One, that may be true but the future isn't here yet. Two, in order to best take advantage of the opportunities in Asia we should be cooperating with the Europeans instead of fighting with them."
The numbers cited by the study seem to justify that conclusion:
*Although the United States exports more to Asia than to Europe, it imports even more from Asia, even though the dollar since 1985 has steadily fallen in value against the major Asian currencies. As a result, Asia accounts for nearly 75 percent of America's $1.25 trillion in cumulative trade deficits since 1980. Over this period, American-European trade has been roughly in balance and highly sensitive to exchange-rate fluctuations. In many of these years the United States has run a surplus with Europe.
*In terms of quality of trade, since the mid-1980's the United States has maintained a modest trade surplus with the European Union in the area of manufactured goods. However, the United States has consistently run a large deficit in the trade of manufactured goods with Asia. There is a pronounced tendency for America to export raw materials to Asia and import manufactured products from it.
*In 1990, the latest year for which comparative statistics are available, European-owned companies employed 2.9 million workers in the United States -- 62 percent of the total for all foreign countries in this country. American employees of Asian-owned companies represented only about 20 percent of this total. The report said monthly wages for American workers at European-owned companies were 18.8 percent above the national average, largely because 70 percent of European direct investment in the United States is in manufacturing.
*In 1991, European companies spent $7.7 billion on research and development in their American operations -- 65 percent of the total research and development spending for foreign companies in the United States. Asian companies spent $1.5 billion.
*In 1990, European companies accounted for $7 billion in American corporate income taxes, as against $100 million from Asian companies. American corporate affiliates in Europe also generated more than $32 billion in American exports, while American companies operating in Asia generated trade deficits of $7.5 billion by producing goods in Asia and exporting them to the United States.
Mr. Prestowitz said the conclusion that he hoped would be drawn from these data was not that the United States should forget about Asia. Rather, it should cooperate more with Europe, its natural partner, to help break down the barriers to trade in Asia.

Dollar Retreats After U.S. Denies Rumors About Korea

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday, after retreating from an early surge set off by rumors that a dispute was heating up between North Korea and the United States.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 103.95 Japanese yen, down from 104 yen on Wednesday. It also slipped to 1.6681 German marks from 1.6692 marks. 
 Yesterday morning, the dollar jumped 1.50 yen after rumors circulated that the State Department was advising all nonessential American citizens in South Korea to leave the country. Tensions have been mounting in the Korean peninsula in recent days, as the United States, with Japanese support, pushes for sanctions against North Korea over its refusal to allow nuclear inspections.
Japan's geographic proximity to Korea, and its status as a chief trading partner in the region, renders the yen vulnerable to news of potential hostilities. Traders sold the currency to the benefit of the dollar. The mark also fell.
But after the State Department issued a statement around noon denying that Americans had been advised to leave Korea, the dollar slipped back.
"The rumor got the market all in an uproar, but when the State Department denied the rumor, it sold the dollar off," said Kevin Lawrie, vice president and manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank. "The net result was nil."
Mr. Lawrie and other traders said the dollar's early rally might have also been fueled by rumors that Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, planned to say the White House wanted to establish an exchange rate range of 105 to 115 yen to the dollar.
There was no confirmation from the White House, however, and the market discounted the rumors.
Traders expect today's Government report on producer prices in May to have an impact on the dollar. Currency trading has been lackluster this week, with many market participants waiting to see what the data suggest about inflation.
"For lack of anything else, the dollar will look to that," said Tom O'Malley, a foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data, a company in Boston that supplies market data to institutional investors.
Meanwhile, the British pound weakened in New York to $1.5095, from $1.5105 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those on Wednesday, included: 1.4112 Swiss francs, down from 1.4135; 5.6780 French francs, down from 5.6840; 1,617 Italian lire, up from 1,616, and 1.3750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3753.

Copper Prices Rise on Signs Of Large Demand in Europe

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rose again yesterday, reaching their highest levels since September 1992 amid continuing signs that a resurgent European economy was depleting already low inventories.
On other commodity markets, lumber rose its daily trading limit, and crude oil posted further gains. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 0.46 point, to 231.67. 
 Copper for July delivery gained 0.90 cent, to $1.0945 a pound, at the Commodity Exchange of New York. Copper has jumped more than 6 cents a pound this week.
The copper-consuming manufacturing and construction industries are bolstering the economies of Germany and Britain. Germany's economy grew by 2.1 percent in the first three months, compared with a year earlier, pushed up by a surge in construction. Manufacturing output rose 3 percent in Britain, its strongest growth this decade.
Copper supplies in London Metal Exchange warehouses are at a 14-month low, and traders expect a report today to show further declines.
 
 
'Bullishness in Metals'
 "Strong economic growth in Europe and the U.S., as well as recovery in Japan, has fueled bullishness in metals," said Fred Demler, an analyst at E.D.& F. Man International in New York.
Elsewhere, lumber prices surged amid concerns that mill workers in British Columbia would strike.
"The labor situation is a potential problem," said Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. "Inventory is needed to cushion against the possibility of a strike."
Contracts for many union workers in British Columbia expire at midnight on Tuesday.
The July contract for lumber gained $10 yesterday, to $390.50 for 1,000 board feet at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after climbing $7.20 on Wednesday.
Prices could rise to their recent high of $440 for 1,000 board feet in the next three to four weeks if there was a lengthy strike, Mr. Cunningham said.
Separately, oil prices rose amid persistent concerns about limited supplies in the Midwest, where futures contracts are filled. The July contract for crude oil rose 33 cents, to $18.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"They're really concerned about the supply situation right now," said Peter Madias, a trader at Brody, White & Company in New York. "People are buying more aggressively."

HEADLINE: Companies Again Raise Plans for Spending in '94

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Corporate America intends to raise investment in new equipment and buildings by 8.3 percent in 1994, somewhat more than when last polled in the early months of the year, the Commerce Department reported today.
"We're going after market" by adding new products, said Tim Omstead, vice president of Ductmate Industries in Monongahela, Pa., a metal products company that plans to invest as much as $200,000 after spending nothing on capital improvements last year. 
 The Commerce Department survey of more than 5,000 companies discovered plans to invest a total of $634 billion, a jump of 8.3 percent from 1993 and higher than the 8 percent surge reported by companies in the January-March survey. The rise reported today is well above the 5.4 percent advance shown by the first tally in October and November, when most companies assemble annual budgets.
 
 
Biggest Increase Since 1989
 If realized, this year's increase would be the biggest since 1989, when spending for plant modernization and expansion climbed 11.4 percent.
So far, higher interest rates have put no discernible dent in such plans, analysts said.
"The rise in interest rates we've had thus far would not be expected to have an impact," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at CS First Boston, noting the typical lags between monetary moves by the Federal Reserve and their effects on business. If rates are to hinder capital spending, he added, "that is probably an event for '95."
Modest as the shift was in the latest survey conducted in April and early May, the Clinton Administration did not forgo the chance to trumpet it.
Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, said in a statement from Dusseldorf, Germany, "These strong and sustained expansion plans in a wide range of industries argue well for the sustainability of the recovery, for future productivity growth and cost control and for our international competitiveness."
 
 
Holding Down Inflation
 This would be the third consecutive increase in capital spending, which climbed 7.1 percent in 1993 and 3.4 percent in 1992. Such investment is considered important to holding down inflation because it enlarges the nation's productive capacity and, by incorporating the latest technology, makes it more efficient.
Today's report showed manufacturing industries planning a 6.9 percent rise in spending this year, compared with 7.5 percent in April. Durable goods industries were up a hefty 10.8 percent, and nondurables were up 3.7 percent. Large increases were registered for blast furnaces, motor vehicles, electrical machinery and stone, clay and glass. Big declines are planned for the aircraft and nonferrous metals industries.
In the first quarter, investment spending rose 2.4 percent, four-tenths of a 1 percent less than previously predicted, the Commerce Department said. The second quarter is now projected to show a 2.9 percent rise, with the third showing a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent and the fourth quarter, a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
 
Real Spending to Rise 8.9%
 When adjusted for inflation, however, today's figures showed lower planned capital spending than was previously reported. Real spending is projected to rise 8.9 percent for the year instead of the 9.8 percent before inflation in April.
After the release of the next spending report, on Sept. 8, the Commerce Department said it would replace the quarterly survey with a semiannual one. The new survey will have a different scope and details and will be published in February and September.

The number of Americans filing first-time applications for state unemployment benefits was unchanged last week, the Labor Department said today.
There were 358,000 new jobless claims in the week that ended last Saturday. That was the same as the previous week's total, which was revised downward from 362,000. The latest figure was in line with the expectations of Wall Street economists. 
 The department's closely watched four-week moving average number of claims, considered a more reliable barometer than the more volatile weekly number, declined to 362,250 last week, from 368,250 a week earlier.
New York was the only state that reported an increase of more than 1,000 claims for the week that ended on May 28, the latest period for which the data were available. New York had 2,829 new claims.
Three states reported decreases in claims, on an unadjusted basis, of more than 1,000 in the week that ended on May 28. They were California, with a drop of 3,471 claims; North Carolina, with a decline of 2,311 claims, and Washington, with a drop of 1,046 claims.

HEADLINE: A New York Tourist In His Own Hometown

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
A MAN and a woman walk into the River Cafe, the elegant waterside restaurant in the Brooklyn-side shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. It's about 1:30 P.M., the tail end of lunch hour on a Tuesday. They give the maitre d'hotel their name, tell him they have a reservation and hand him a voucher, with the River Cafe typed explicitly on it, for their meal. They're on a tour package, they explain, to which he responds that he is sorry, but the restaurant is not participating in the package. Furthermore, looking down his list of reservations, he finds the couple's name nowhere.
The couple, a casually but not inappropriately dressed pair who might be from Des Moines or Boston or Painted Post, look at each other, disappointed if not aghast. 
 What do you think happens next?
You'll find out shortly, but the scene, which occurred on May 31, the second day of the much-ballyhooed tour package that is part of the NY '94 public relations campaign, was typical of the mix-ups I encountered in four days of sampling what the program is offering through the summer. (It expires on Labor Day, Sept. 5.)
Announced with a flourish in mid-May, the program is a cooperative attempt on the part of the city, the state and a variety of cultural institutions and private businesses that depend on tourism to alleviate the intimidation factor that inhibits many people from visiting New York City. The idea is simple enough: economy and convenience. With one phone call to a travel agent, you can arrange for two nights in a hotel, a ticket to a Broadway or Off Broadway show, lunch in a snazzy restaurant, a city tour by bus or boat, admissions to several of the city's museums, and a personal shopping assistant at a store of your choice. An expensive meal, a smidgen of culture, some high-rent shopping and a smattering of glitz, all for one price. A tourist's dream of New York City, yes?
As with most good ideas, however, the difficulty is execution, and, by my lights anyway, there are plenty of bugs to be worked out. I booked two tours, at the expensive and bargain-price extremes, and spent last week experiencing the city as a visitor would. Granted, I was trying out the program in its first week, with a holiday weekend thrown in to boot. And this is, after all, a complicated venture involving dozens, if not hundreds, of commercial establishments and public institutions, and it was put together only in the last six months. Even its organizers admit it got off the ground prematurely, and that the planning for next year's package, as part of NY '95, is already under way.
"This thing got fast-tracked so quickly," said Alan Rose, a vice president of marketing for the Loews Hotel chain, who served on the project's organizing committee, "that after the press conference last month, a lot of the hotels contacted us and said, 'I know we signed up for this, but what is it?' "
This confusion shows in the marketing of the packages. The tours are sold by price, but the prices in the advertisements can be misleading. There are four packages offered, with prices from $199.40 to $459.40, depending on the choice of hotel. But these are, of course, per-person double-occupancy rates (information subtly disclosed in the fine print). So the range is really $398.80 to $918.80. And for those who want to travel alone, the price range is $329 to $795.
 
A Gloss on the Big Apple
 Still, my week as a tourist was no hardship. The weather was glorious, with the kind of crystalline air that shows off the New York City skyline as a spectacular testament to mankind's industriousness. And several times I found myself thinking: Boy, what a place!
There was the boat tour, for instance: an hour's meander, via Seaport Liberty Cruises, around the the southern tip of Manhattan, departing from the South Street Seaport. On a sunny morning, with the wind spilling your hair in your eyes and the air as balmy as bath water, you look at the vertical spires of lower Manhattan, as tightly packed as porcupine quills, not to mention the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the distance, and you understand why people want to come here and maybe even remember why you moved here yourself.
The boat, which makes five trips daily and normally costs $16, was nearly empty last week; as the summer proceeds, the crowds become huge, the captain said. After we got off the boat, my romantic partner (for what was, after all, a pretty romantic enterprise) and I walked through the Seaport, past City Hall and over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a terrific way to end the morning, and it was appetite-raising, a great segue into lunch.
That was when we encountered John McFadden, the manager of the River Cafe, who was serving that day as maitre d'hotel.
Mr. McFadden showed us the reservation list: the name we used was not on it. He examined my voucher, good, it claimed, for a prix fixe lunch for two at the River Cafe, whereupon he sighed. He explained that he had tried to tell the NY '94 organizers that the restaurant didn't wish to be included; mainly, he said, because there are always mixups when reservations and payments are taken out of the restaurant's hands.
He even showed us a copy of the form sent by the tour sponsors, which he had filled out. To the question "Do You Wish to Participate in the NY '94 Tour Package?," Mr. McFadden had answered in emphatic capitals: "NO."
Besides, he added, the River Cafe doesn't have a prix fixe menu.
And then Mr. McFadden did an unexpected thing. He accepted our voucher, sat us at a window table and insisted that we order whatever we wished from the full-price lunch menu. The food was delectable, the service amiable and skilled. The bill came to $113.12, to which we were asked to contribute $5.36 in tax.
We tipped the waiter $25. Mr. McFadden declined the $10 I offered. It was a superb, gracious performance by the entire place, and I felt welcomed to New York, even though I live here.
 
Pride in Disdainfulness?
 Indeed, this is the good news. As New Yorkers, we often feel it's O.K. to be disdainful of one another, and so we brook disdain in others. It's a local quality, something outsiders can sample, like, say, crab cakes in Baltimore. And we New Yorkers seem to take pride in it, perverse as that may be.
Particularly egregious in this regard are the service professions, or so we believe. Who among us, after all, is surprised when a cabbie is rude or a waiter perfunctory? But this is to report that it appears we're lying to ourselves. Posing as a tourist, I found a remarkable willingness among hotel and restaurant personnel, car-service drivers (one actually believed us when we reported, accurately, that we were quoted a lower price over the phone, and gave us that price without argument), theater box-office people and tour guides to be friendly, helpful -- of service! -- even when their competence was at issue.
Or ours. My girlfriend and I showed up at the Frick Collection on Fifth Avenue mistakenly believing that our museum-admission vouchers were good there. The woman at the box office expressed puzzlement, even skepticism, but then opted for friendly cooperation.
"What do we give you for this?" she asked, accepting the voucher.
"Admission," I said.
"O.K.," she said, and waved us in.
Now, this attitude didn't always obtain. Identifying herself as a voucher-wielder, my friend tried to make a reservation at Lutece, for instance, and was told there were no available tables; it was only when she had someone else call back and conveniently forget to say we would be coming as part of the NY '94 package that we got a table, though, irked, we went to the River Cafe instead. Le Cirque, on the other hand, which has more of a reputation for favoring its regular customers, couldn't have been more amiable. We booked our other tour-package lunch there and as far as I could tell our treatment was no different from Kirk Douglas's, though he had a better table.
 
A Guide's Skewed Outlook
 And then there was the guide for our bus tour of upper Manhattan, a shrill-voiced woman with an intermittently squawking microphone and a French accent so thick she was difficult to understand even when she wasn't speaking French, which she did most of the time, for the benefit of one passenger, apparently the only other person from France on the bus.
The tour itself, provided by a private concern called New York Apple Tours, is pretty nifty. It uses a double-decker bus, and sitting up top in the open air, looking down on the cabs of trucks and able to reach up and touch traffic signals, gives passengers a new perspective, a second-floor view of the city.
But with this particular guide, though I couldn't understand much, what I did understand sent messages of rather dubious value: "So many people in America are sick that doctors will see them just to get insurance money," she said as the bus passed Mount Sinai Hospital. "That's why they have malpractice lawyers in America." On Lenox Avenue, she explained, "Landlords pay people to burn their buildings to get the insurance." And later, in front of the Jewish Museum on Fifth Avenue: "As I said before, Jewish people in New York are very numerous and very powerful."
There were other annoyances. Both the low-end and high-end programs promise a free Continental breakfast each morning of your stay, but there were no vouchers provided for it on either tour ("I'll have to look into that," Mr. Rose said), and we were billed for each one we ordered at the Westbury Hotel, on East 69th Street. Parking was supposed to be included, too, but the Westbury charged us for that, at $33 a night, though the hotel credited my account when I called to question my bill a few days later.
On the low-end package we stayed at the Best Western President, on West 48th Street, which shares the Days Hotel parking lot across the street. Parking (at $11 per entry) was extra, said the reservations clerk I spoke with, and breakfast in the coffee shop (there is no room service) might have been extra as well, but she wasn't sure. I didn't attempt either one, though. I put my car in the lot where I usually park it, and mornings we went out to eat.
 
Better Seats Than Expected
 As for the theater tickets, there was no problem on either package, and even though the seats are supposed to be better for the higher end than for the lower -- I was told the $199.40 package includes mezzanine seats -- we had the same choice of shows for each and we ended up with orchestra seats on the aisle for both "Crazy for You" and "She Loves Me." There was a limited list of available shows, however. I had asked specifically for "Angels in America" and "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" and was told they were sold out, which is true only in the producers' dreams.
Susan Lee, the director of marketing for the League of American Theaters and Producers, who organized the theater community's participation in the program, said this week that there had been some early problems with ticket availability -- partly because tickets were being provided to 687 Tony voters -- but that now virtually every show offering discount tickets is available on the tour package. Even those few shows that aren't discounting -- "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Beauty and the Beast" at the moment -- are offering tickets on the high-end package, she said.
And the personal shopping assistant? The stores that offer such a service generally do so for anyone who wants one, at no charge. And some stores don't do it at all, including Ralph Lauren/Polo Sport, for which I had a voucher but whose customer service department had never heard of NY '94. My girlfriend spoke to a staff member, who was agreeable: if we came in, he said, a regular sales clerk would help us in any way we wished.
 
Heavy Phone Time
 For the most part, though, the troubles we encountered involved making arrangements, ultimately forgivable but with the potential for getting a vacation off to an agitated start. The official travel agent for the package is Domenico Tours of Bayonne, N.J. To judge from conversations with at least a dozen of its representatives, it is an organized company full of individuals of great patience and good will (except for one woman, who hung up on me after she gave me confusing information and I asked to speak with a supervisor). But at least with the NY '94 package, they are in awe of a system they've yet to master.
In booking a tour, I spent a great deal of time on hold, listening to exhortatory, movie-theater music (I almost expected to hear "And now, enjoy the show!"). It was not, I came to understand, because there were not enough people to handle calls, but because there was a lot of information to check on. At one point I had to change some arrangements -- the Lutece-River Cafe switch -- and I kept being put on hold, only to be transferred to somebody else. There were Florence, Veronica, Harriet, Brenda and Carmine.
"What happened to Brenda?" I asked Carmine.
"Long story," he said.
It was finally Alan who got on the line and told me he had made the new reservations himself, while I'd been waiting and listening to the movie-theater music. Though we know how that turned out.
"Travel agencies don't handle restaurants ordinarily, because they don't get a commission," said Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat restaurant surveys and one of the organizers of the NY '94 tour package. "So this may be the first time you have a travel agency doing restaurant reservations, and frankly they don't know much about it. A lot of them don't know the difference between the Second Avenue Deli and Caravelle. Hopefully, they'll get better."
 
Pleasant Digs
 Of course none of that entirely explains why my reservation at the Westbury was mistakenly booked for June 30 instead of May 30, but no matter. The hotel, a quiet and elegant place with exquisitely attentive employees, managed to feel both homey and special, the kind of hotel that doesn't provide much to do (there's a pretty good exercise room, and the Polo Lounge) but that makes you want to hang out there, anyway. (Or to take a walk in Central Park, half a block away.)
Our room was a good place to sit in an armchair and read and munch on something from room service. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the shower: some of the best water pressure I've ever experienced, and great steam. So great, in fact, that it set off the smoke alarm (the loudest I've ever heard).
The problem with such a hotel, of course, is the expense, even after the room rate is covered. I love room service, but sandwiches and salads for two at midnight cost $75.
This was not the problem at the Best Western President, which was clean and not unfriendly, with competent front-desk clerks and bellhops. But the room was the size of a hatbox, and the bed the size of a hat; even the hallways had a claustrophobic feel. I was a little surprised, actually. I've stayed in Best Westerns elsewhere, and they're usually more commodious. There were a bar and a coffee shop off the lobby, but I never saw anyone in either one, save for a moaning woman in the bar one night.
We ate breakfast across the street, at the Metro Deli ("Home of the Delicatessen Hall of Fame") in the Days Hotel Midtown (which is also on the $199.40 package). The waitress explained, as we scrutinized the menu: "The Nova is really popular. That's the pink stuff."
Mr. Rose acknowledged that it behooves tour customers to research the hotels carefully, particularly on the lowest-priced package. "Because we didn't want to have 25 or 30 different rates," he said, "within each price range, there's a lot of difference among the hotels."
According to figures provided by the tour sponsors, more than 4,000 phone inquiries have been made thus far, and about 200 tours have been booked. One can only wish the subscribers a smooth journey, because to judge from my experience trying to see New York through an outsider's eyes, they should have an exciting one. As it turns out, when you're not immersed in city living, the city itself has a way of reminding you that it's a cool place. Indeed, since I moved back to my apartment, I've been keeping an eye out for tourists, and I find it pleases me when it looks as though they're enjoying themselves. It occurs to me that the quicker this tour package irons out its wrinkles, the better it will be for everyone.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
End of an Era: The Rockefellers And the Modern

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
AS much as the Guggenheims and the Whitneys are synonymous with their museums, the Rockefellers are synonymous with the Museum of Modern Art. The Modern was founded in 1929 by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, along with Lillie Bliss and Mary Sullivan, and for most of its history either Mrs. Rockefeller or one of her children has headed its board.
So when David Rockefeller, her youngest son, recently relinquished his post as chairman to Agnes Gund and became chairman emeritus, it signaled a kind of sea change. Mr. Rockefeller still has his hand in affairs like the search for a new director, and his son David Jr. and Nelson A. Rockefeller's son Rodman are trustees. But an era of Rockefeller management at the Modern, stretching back to its beginning, has come to a close. 
 "Masterpieces From the David and Peggy Rockefeller Collection," which has just opened, is a thank-you note to Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller in the form of a small and beautiful exhibition. The thanks are especially for works in it that they have promised to the museum (and in some cases lent long ago). These include great things: a landmark Cezanne still life, and one of the finest of his watercolors of Mont Ste.-Victoire; Signac's famous Pointillist portrait of Felix Feneon against a dizzying abstract pinwheel backdrop; Gauguin's portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan; Andre Derain's flaming Fauvist cityscape of Charing Cross Bridge in London; Matisse's Fauvist "Girl Reading," and Picasso's Cubist view of the reservoir and houses stacked atop the hill at Horta de Ebro, Spain, the indigenous architecture of the houses a nearly ready-made Cubist design.
Most of the 21 works in the exhibition, organized by Kirk Varnedoe, are very fine. There are paintings in it outside the Modern's chronological scope, like Manet's still life called "The Brioche" (1870), which is going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Pissarro's "Landscape at Les Patis, Pontoise" (1868), which is going to the National Gallery in Washington. Moreover, because the Rockefellers' taste, while refined, takes in Manet and also Cubist Picasso, the show is virtually a pocket-size overview of late 19th- and early 20th-century art in France (despite a Bonnard from the 1940's that nonetheless extends in its style his work from the turn-of-the-century).
The show begins with the Cezanne and Manet still lifes. In some ways, the two are similar, borrowing the standard devices of fruit arranged on a table and in a bowl or basket, a cloth hanging over the front of the table, a knife angled diagonally inward toward the center of the canvas to underscore the recession of space. But Manet's work is somber, elegant and balanced, and it pays homage to masters like Chardin. The image is anchored at its center by the round form of the brioche, all the objects clearly delineated in relation to one another and in depth. Even though the handling of paint is astonishingly fluid, it is also exact, down to the fuzzy sheen on the peaches, the dull matte of the plums and the glints of light on the table's gilded edges and handles. The painting is a tour de force of evocative description and fancy brushwork.
The Cezanne operates according to a completely different logic. Its surface is a dense wall of short, parallel strokes that has the effect of pushing the background forward, and flattening and equalizing the image. Objects are arranged asymmetrically so the composition tilts; the ellipses of the bowl and a glass next to it are compressed; the shapes of the fruit are described not by changes in shadow and light, but by sudden shifts in hue, and the lines of the table hitch and bend. The work is vibrant and elastic.
Precisely because of its break with a picture like Manet's "Brioche," and because of its radical and independent formal harmony, it became, as Mr. Varnedoe writes, "the talisman of a new vision" for a generation that included Gauguin. (He even owned it.) The two Gauguins here, "The Wave" and the portrait of de Haan, each with its vertiginous perspective, are partly products of Cezanne's influence.
In "The Wave," Gauguin takes a bird's-eye view from a spur of rock onto a specific curving stretch of Brittany beach where waves break against giant boulders rising like a line of towers along the shore. The starting point, as with Cezanne, is observation of nature. But Gauguin also looked at Japanese prints, and Degas and Monet. His palette turns the black lichens that cling to the boulders purple, and the sandy beach blood-red. He makes arabesques out of the eddies and breakers, and an almost abstract pattern out of the pink-and-green sea.
The Gauguin portrait is abstracted in a different way, with de Haan's weird pear-shaped head and the implicit but indecipherable symbolism of the books and fruit and lamp on the table before him. Brilliant color is its subject no less than it is in Derain's "Charing Cross Bridge," or Matisse's "Girl Reading." In the Derain, the defining element is a fissure of yellow light that slices the Thames in two and rises behind Big Ben like a stack of fire. In the Matisse, a mix of colors and techniques -- daubs, scumbles, tidy outlines, wristy dashes of the brush -- transforms an image of repose into one of rapturous energy.
Six works in the exhibition have not been promised to the Modern or another museum. (The Modern is obviously hoping to be given them.) They include "The Wave" and Picasso's disturbing and remarkable "Girl With a Basket of Flowers," with her shopworn and carefully depicted face and simplified body.
Modern French painting is only part of what Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller collect; they own 18th-century European decorative art and Asian art, too, which obviously isn't in this show because it doesn't dovetail with what the museum owns. The exhibition does not include works bought by the museum with the Rockefellers' money, either, like Martin Puryear's "Greed's Trophy" (1984), although that sculpture is on view in the contemporary galleries.
In 1968, David Rockefeller put together a syndicate (with William S. Paley, Nelson Rockefeller and others) that bought Gertrude Stein's collection. In it was Picasso's "Reservoir, Horta de Ebro" and "Girl With a Basket of Flowers." The interesting story behind that deal, along with a list of all of Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller's gifts to the museum, is in the catalogue. It has a general introduction and concise descriptions, by Mr. Varnedoe, of each of the 21 works on view and more extensive scholarly entries by Margaret Potter and Jodi Hauptman. They are excellent. Altogether, the show turns out to be one of the most pleasurable exhibitions in New York City in some time.
"Masterpieces From the David and Peggy Rockefeller Collection: Manet to Picasso" remains at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, through Sept. 6.

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber 

 BODY:
A year ago, the Tony Award winners were all but obvious long before they were announced. Everyone figured "Millennium Approaches," Part 1 of Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" would walk off with most of the drama awards, and it did, winning four. And although it wasn't a grand season for musicals, two, "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "Tommy," won a total of 12. There wasn't much left for anyone else.
This year things are different. Although complaints about the season are rife, the Tony competition is actually quite lively, with the outcomes of the races in many of the 20 categories hidden in haze, a condition that an unofficial poll of two dozen voters this week failed to clarify. (Those interviewed disclosed their votes and comments on condition of anonymity.) The winners will be announced at the Gershwin Theater on Sunday night -- the telecast, on CBS, begins at 9 -- but as of now, many prognosticators (including this one) are hedging their bets. 
 To dispense with the easy ones first, only two awards seem sure, with those questioned expressing unanimity. They are best actress in a musical, which ought to go to Donna Murphy for "Passion," and best featured actress in a musical, which should go to Audra Ann MacDonald for "Carousel."
Beyond those, however, the debate was on. Certainly the loudest laments of the year involved the dearth of solid new musicals and the inability of plays to attract audiences and stay alive, and the same whininess was reflected in the comments of voters this week. In the best-musical category, neither of the leading contenders, "Passion," the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine collaboration, or Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," stirred much loyalty, the one being seen largely as an artfully ambitious failure, the other an advertisement for merchandise and theme parks that aims low and hits the mark. ("It's an ice show," one voter said.) Whichever wins best musical is also likely to win for book and score, although the embarrassing possibility exists that one could win for the parts and the other for the whole.
"I voted for 'Passion,' but I have to tell you I hated it," one person said. "If it wins, and it probably will, it'll be bad for the theater because people will go to see it and be disappointed. But I don't think anyone wants to vote for 'Beauty and the Beast' because it's not what theater is about. It's a cartoon."
It does seem to be true that Disney's high-visibility, very expensive entry onto Broadway has stirred some resentment among theater lifers. Another factor that may swing some votes to "Passion" is that it needs the economic boost the Tony can provide in order to stay open. "Beauty" needs no such boost; it is currently outselling even "The Phantom of the Opera."
On the other hand, several devotees of the man who wrote "Company" and "Sweeney Todd" said they could not bring themselves to vote for what they viewed as second-tier Sondheim. As one person put it, "I was going to vote for 'Passion,' but I went back to see it again, and it wasn't good enough." Then, too, road presenters make up a significant bloc of voters, and as one person interviewed put it, "they frequently vote with their future wallet in mind." It's unlikely that "Passion" will ever be a road favorite.
The question about best play is whether voters will accept "Perestroika," Part 2 of "Angels," as a new play, and whether Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show, "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," will be accepted by Tony voters as a play at all. The Pulitzer Prize committee rejected both in favor of Edward Albee's "Three Tall Women," ineligible for a Tony because it is playing Off Broadway. No one gave the other nominees, "The Kentucky Cycle" and "Broken Glass," any chance.
Ms. Smith was also nominated for best actress. Among her supporters were several people who did not vote for "Twilight" as best play. Her chief competition is Diana Rigg in "Medea." The debate in this category was about expectations; the word came up a lot. Did people go to the theater expecting too much from Ms. Rigg? Did "Twilight" suffer in comparison with Ms. Smith's previous show, "Fires in the Mirror"? One voter saw this as a reason that a third nominee, Joan Rivers, in "Sally Marr . . . and Her Escorts," might sneak in:
"Even if people didn't like 'Sally Marr,' what they came out of it saying was: 'I didn't know Joan Rivers could do this.' I'm telling you, expectations are everything."
Stephen Spinella, who, as Prior Walter, the anti-angel in "Angels in America," won the Tony for featured actor last year in Part 1 of the play, stepped up to the lead-actor category this year for Part 2, and he has a strong chance again -- one voter called it "the performance of a lifetime" -- even though, as another voter put it, "for the same actor to win for the same character two years in a row is silly." His advantage, in a strong category, is that his performance is still viewable, whereas the other nominees, Christopher Plummer ("No Man's Land"), Sam Waterston ("Abe Lincoln in Illinois") and Brian Bedford ("Timon of Athens") were in limited-run shows, all long gone. Memories among voters don't tend to last.
Among the other performers' categories, the most interesting is best featured actor in a musical, which pits Jarrod Emick of "Damn Yankees" against Jonathan Freeman of "She Loves Me." As Joe Hardy, Mr. Emick has a star-size role. Mr. Freeman, on the other hand, as a maitre d'hotel, has only one scene, the musical number "A Romantic Atmosphere," but it is probably the funniest, most entertaining one of the season.
One show whose fortunes on Sunday will be particularly interesting is "An Inspector Calls," the creaky mystery by J. B. Priestley that was flamboyantly resurrected by the director Stephen Daldry and the designer Ian MacNeil. They have been given all the credit for the success of the show, a favorite for best play revival, which is why Mr. Daldry seems the favorite for best director.
But if Mr. Daldry wins, will voters feel the production has been sufficiently acknowledged and bypass Mr. MacNeil in favor of Bob Crowley, whose set for "Carousel" was equally acclaimed? "I voted for Ian MacNeil because without him there's no 'Inspector Calls,' and without Bob Crowley, there's still 'Carousel,' " one person said. But another offered the opposite view: "I voted for 'Carousel' over 'Inspector' because it was great to see a well-known show done so differently, whereas with 'Inspector' it was the designer, you have to think, carrying out the director's vision."
Meanwhile, the director of "Carousel," Nicholas Hytner, faces off against Scott Ellis, the director of "She Loves Me," for best musical director, the winner probably to depend on the winner of best revival. "Carousel" was critically and popularly lauded when it opened in March, but members of the Tony nominating committee said in interviews that they preferred "She Loves Me," and they proved it with nine nominations overall, to five for "Carousel." In discussions this week, the consensus was no real consensus. And of course, there's a third possibility: "Damn Yankees," which has 14 individuals and a corporation listed above the title as producers. As one person said: "That's a lot of votes right there."
Here, then, are one writer's predictions. As they say in television editorials, the following do not necessarily represent the opinions of management.

Questions at the Whitney
With all the turmoil during the tenures of Leonard A. Lauder as president of the Whitney Museum of American Art and David A. Ross as its director, there has been no end of speculation about what will happen when their terms expire. Mr. Lauder is known as Mr. Ross's staunchest supporter on a divided board. So when the museum announced after the board met on Wednesday that Mr. Lauder had resigned as president a year before his term expired, and would become its chairman, and that Gilbert C. Maurer, an 11-year board member, would assume the presidency, the question was inevitable: What does this mean for Mr. Ross, whose contract runs out in February 1996?
Mr. Lauder denied that the board was divided on Mr. Ross. "They're solidly behind David," he said. "Are there one or two naysayers? Sure." 
 "Gil's an experienced leader," said Mr. Lauder, who is said to have handpicked the committee that elected Mr. Maurer. "He's served the Whitney in many functions."
Mr. Lauder, who has served as president for four years, said he was stepping down early because the museum was set to embark on a major capital and endowment program in the fall. "If I started the campaign, the museum would have to change horses in midstream," he said. "It works out neatly this way."
Mr. Maurer, who is C.E.O. of the Hearst Corporation and who describes himself as a strong David Ross supporter, said the museum had not yet decided the size of its capital campaign goal. But he confirmed that the money would go toward an expansion of the museum. As to whether the architect will be Michael Graves, whose unbuilt design for an expanded Whitney caused an uproar in the art and architecture world, not to mention the Upper East Side, in the late 1980's, Mr. Maurer said, "Probably not."
 
In Memory of a Friend
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has not been forgotten at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, thanks to Jayne Wrightsman, a trustee and one of the museum's biggest donors. This week the museum announced that Mrs. Wrightsman had purchased an 1817 life-size portrait of the French statesman Talleyrand by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon in memory of her friend Mrs. Onassis. The painting is on view in the museum's new 19th-century galleries for European paintings and sculpture.
"As Jacqueline Onassis was deeply devoted to the Metropolitan Museum, I wanted to give a work of art that might remind all of us of her unforgettable impact on our lives," Mrs. Wrightsman said. "The portrait of Talleyrand recalls her deep love of France and of French history, and her own triumphs there as everywhere throughout the world."
The portrait, which is more than seven feet high and valued at around $3 million, was purchased three years ago in France from a descendant of Talleyrand by Alan Salz, the New York director of the Didier Aaron gallery in Manhattan. "It seemed like a perfect painting for the Met," Mr. Salz said. "But these things take time."
The painting is one of three full-length Prud'hon portraits of Talleyrand. It shows him in civilian clothes in his house, Valencay, just south of Paris. The other two portraits show Talleyrand in court costume and were commissioned by Napoleon; this one was commissioned by Talleyrand himself.
"We have been trying to beef up our collection of Neo-Classical and Romantic paintings," said Gary Tinterow, the Engelhard curator of European paintings at the Met. "And this is an important addition."
 
Power Merger
 When the two superpower galleries Pace and Wildenstein merged in October, part of the master plan included extending the newly formed Pace Wildenstein's reach to cultural capitals other than New York City. So this week's announcement that Pace Wildenstein would open a major gallery in London took few art-world insiders by surprise. Nor did the news that the gallery would be at 147 New Bond Street, the building that has housed Wildenstein & Company since 1936.
David Grob, a private London dealer, will be the gallery's director. And the 1752 building will undergo extensive renovations, to create an unusual upstairs-downstairs relationship. The basement and ground floor of the building will become Pace Wildenstein's galleries for 20th-century paintings and sculpture, works on paper and photography; Wildenstein & Company, meanwhile, will continue dealing primarily in Old Masters from the building's upper floors, under the direction of David Ellis-Jones.
"This is all part of a bigger picture," said Marc Glimcher, director of Pace Wildenstein. "It's not the last part of the story." Mr. Glimcher said that the gallery would soon announce other locations, including one in Los Angeles.
Mr. Grob said he had had an "evolving relationship" with Pace Wildenstein. Until the renovations are complete (in 12 to 18 months), he intends to operate from temporary quarters on the building's second floor with a viewing room and computer link-up to New York.
"London will be our base for Europe," Mr. Glimcher said. "We have a large number of Italian, French and German clients. The gallery will definitely be different from our gallery in New York. It's a big mistake to give a big multi-international corporation a party line. Each gallery will have its own flavor."
 
A New Art Market
 Photography is one segment of the art market that has been faring reasonably well even in these difficult economic times. But its success is not limited to galleries and auction houses. Last week, when "Gallery Direct," a new program aimed at "serious art collectors," made its debut on the QVC televison channel, it offered photographs of Marilyn Monroe by the photographer Bert Stern. And television viewers shopped with a vengeance.
"Customers see the value in art," said Mary Forte, QVC's senior vice president for merchandising. "There's a real market for it. Art is our future."
The idea for "Gallery Direct" came from Bruce Goldstein, an electronic-marketing consultant who approached Susan Harder, the New York-based photography dealer who represents Mr. Stern. In March, before creating the new show, they tested the idea on Joan Rivers's program on QVC, "Can We Shop?" In 10 minutes, Ms. Rivers sold two of Mr. Stern's Marilyn Monroe images, one for $2,700 and the other for $5,000.
That gave QVC the confidence to proceed. On June 1 (the anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's birth), it introduced "Gallery Direct," and sold more of Mr. Stern's Monroe photographs. These came from his book "The Last Sitting," images of Monroe commissioned by Vogue magazine in 1962, six weeks before her death.
"Gallery Direct" featured photographs ranging in price from $280 for "The Last Sitting Shot," a 22-by-28-inch, black-and-white head shot of Monroe, to $7,900 for "Marilyn With Roses," a 30-by-40-inch work of the actress with colored chiffon roses covering her breasts. (Six of these were sold, and Ms. Forte said they were the most expensive items ever sold on QVC.) The top seller, however, was "Marilyn in Vogue," an image of the star in a black dress that cost $350. More than 175 prints were sold in a two-minute spot, Mr. Goldstein said.

Serious Entertainment From a Rare Resource

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Wim Kayzer, a Dutch television producer, had a simple idea: bring together several eminent American and British intellectuals for open-ended conversation. The result, more than a dozen hours of talk that broke viewing records in his country last year, arrives Sunday and dominates Channel 13's prime-time schedule through the week.
Starting with the neurologist and psychiatrist Oliver Sacks, "A Glorious Accident" continues with Rupert Sheldrake, cell biologist and biochemist; Daniel C. Dennett, philosopher; Stephen Toulmin, philosopher of science; Freeman Dyson, physicist, and Stephen Jay Gould, paleontologist. On Saturday they all join Mr. Kayzer for a three-and-a-half-hour chat. And on Sunday, June 19, viewers can fill in anything they missed, or if they missed it all, can make up the entire series, from 7 A.M. to 12:45 A.M. 
 This sort of crash-course approach, with interruptions for fund-raising, scarcely does justice to the material. The speculations floated here about mankind and nature take a little absorbing; a week between programs might have given a hooked viewer a chance to do some catch-up or preparatory reading.
But the opportunity to listen in on such heady talk by such talking heads is not so common on television that one can afford to quibble. Except for a needless gesture at visual scene-setting (the opening pictures make New York City seem like a ward in a hospital for the deranged), the project soon gets down to business. Mr. Kayzer, unseen until the final get together, takes the role of an informed auditor, tossing in a remark now and then to keep the evening's performer rolling along without pressing him to stay on any particular track.
Oliver Sacks, who leads off Sunday, tends to muse over personal experiences, especially with patients troubled by neurological ailments, like those he wrote of in "Awakenings." In the disordered workings of their minds, he finds glimpses of the order of things in the universe. The definition of "order" is a theme of the week. Dr. Sacks says he is looking for "an order which was created autonomously and spontaneously in the universe, not one which has any sort of external, divine or Platonic archetype." Take that, God.
Dr. Sacks is fascinated by memory (which he believes is closer to imagination than to replication), by smells (which he suggests are among the earliest memories), by the amorality of nature and of man. For him, life is not programmed but a matter of choices and responsibilities. ("We're not very elegantly designed. We've been improvised.") He extols the brain's powers of spontaneous creation, and he can become lyrical: "I think we dream nonstop, until we come to the sleep at the end."
But these discussions should not be reduced to print bites. Mr. Sheldrake, who holds that organisms pass on information across generations, takes exception to Mr. Dennett's more mechanistic concept of evolution. Mr. Toulmin speaks of humans as the inheritors and transmitters of tradition. Mr. Dyson tells of wartime calculations on how to murder people most economically. And Mr. Gould manages to get in a comment or two about baseball.
Although Mr. Kayzer does not go out of his way to help viewers catch the allusions tossed around casually, the drift is not hard to follow. At one point in their final get-together, the men give way to expressions of mutual admiration as though they were trapped at a testimonial dinner, but mostly the conversation stays serious without being ponderous. These estimable thinkers flounder in the face of enormities like the Holocaust, just the way the rest of us do.
Toward the end, Mr. Dyson confesses that theories don't help much in understanding why things work the way they do: "The world is much stranger than we imagined." A case in point: Who could have predicted a week's worth of such talk on national television?

HEADLINE: Before Talks With North Korea

 BODY:
To pressure North Korea into compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Clinton Administration is trying to mount a credible threat of U.N. sanctions. Now Japanese misgivings and flat-out Chinese opposition have temporarily set back that effort.
This is discouraging news. Without China's acquiescence in the Security Council, there can be no U.N. sanctions. Without full Japanese participation, there can be no meaningful economic pressure on Pyongyang. 
 The Administration, which has differences in its own ranks over how tough a stand to take, is still struggling to develop an international consensus. The latest signs of diplomatic gridlock provide new arguments for reckless Washington hawks who already clamor impatiently for a more belligerent unilateral American stand. Fortunately, however, North Korea, along with its daily array of fiery threats against Japan and South Korea, has provided an opening of sorts toward moving the crisis back to a negotiating track.
On Wednesday, North Korea's Foreign Minister proposed elements of a diplomatic deal. Pyongyang now offers to guarantee "inspection" of nuclear fuel at its facilities, provided the U.S. renews the diplomatic dialogue it broke off when North Korea refused to set aside the fuel rods that International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors wanted to analyze during the unloading of its reactor last month.
Given the North's history of wriggling through verbal loopholes, the State Department understandably characterized the offer as insufficient. By failing to set aside the fuel rods the I.A.E.A. wanted to analyze, North Korea immensely complicated the inspection issue. That straightforward method of establishing precisely how much plutonium Pyongyang may have removed in the past is no longer available.
There may be alternative, albeit less satisfying ways to reconstruct at least some of this history. But the North needs to agree unambiguously to these procedures before high-level talks with the U.S. can resume.
While the effort to clarify past plutonium management continues, North Korea also needs to demonstrate good faith in safeguarding the larger quantities of plutonium it has just unloaded.
Most urgently, that means letting the I.A.E.A. verify that the unloaded fuel is not removed for reprocessing, potentially into nuclear bomb material. And it means not abandoning the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. These are points former President Carter could usefully reinforce when he visits Pyongyang on a private visit next week.
What the United States needs to do now is spell out, though not necessarily in public, its own conditions for resuming talks. North Korean bad faith has increased the temperature of the crisis and narrowed the scope for a negotiated solution. Yet even as Washington seeks to build a consensus on sanctions, continued diplomacy is in everybody's interest.
In the best case, it could still produce a breakthrough on the key proliferation issues. In the worst, further diplomatic efforts could help convince China and Japan that every reasonable alternative has been explored.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Budget Reflects a Strategy to Make Poverty a Crime

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies joins in the effort to restore funds for youth, educational, social, health and housing services in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's first executive budget for New York City, we wish to focus on the philosophical direction the budget reflects. 
 By exempting the police and fire departments from cutbacks while slashing the supports on which the poor depend, the Mayor has expressed his view that the poor are expected to solve the social problems of the city. When the cuts to youth services throughout city agencies are added up, it is difficult to conclude otherwise than that this budget is a strategy to give our young people over to the criminal justice system.
In "Cause for Alarm: The Condition of Black and Latino Males in New York City," a study we published in 1991, we found that at the center of the problems for black and Latino men is their exclusion from jobs and disproportionate inclusion in the prison system. One of the most alarming statistics was that in 1990 for every 100,000 black males 16 and older in New York City, 3,123 were in prison; for every 100,000 Latino males, 2,270 were in prison. Between 1980 and 1990, the number of Latino men arrested increased by 146 percent; black men, by 95 percent.
Young people in trouble could once turn to truant officers and community agencies. Using police officers to round up truants may prove more expensive, as well as labeling troubled youngsters as criminals before they have committed a crime.
The administration has also proposed that recipients of home relief, aid to families with dependent children and Medicaid be fingerprinted. The city is willing to invest millions in this program when there is no evidence or data to demonstrate that fingerprinting will reduce fraud or alleged abuse of the welfare system. If fingerprinting saves money, it will not be because of fraud indictments or convictions, but because it will deter eligible people -- our poorest and most vulnerable citizens -- from applying for assistance they so desperately need.
Stigmatization of the poor is also contemplated in the administration's proposal to arrest and imprison unemployed homeless people -- squeegee people. Further, the chairman of the City Planning Commission is contemplating a plan to remove homeless people from residential communities and put them instead in manufacturing zones. Does this imply that the homeless are not worthy of living in communities? Why are they being treated like social pariahs, to be cut off from shops, trees, neighborhoods, parks and services?
Rather than education and training, the Mayor has proposed eliminating or reducing youth services, including summer employment, after-school and drug prevention programs, job training and intergenerational programs, with devastating cuts to community colleges and parks. These cuts are doubly damaging because the young people who provide services lose their jobs.
The future for our youth and our city depends on a vision that seeks to expand opportunities, not to criminalize or shame those who are less fortunate.

HEADLINE: Wilson? Quayle? Dole? Anyone?

BYLINE: By David Frum; David Frum is author of the forthcoming book "Dead Right."

 BODY:
The Republicans have to nominate somebody for President in 1996. But who? Pete Wilson looks less promising since he lost 34.2 percent of the vote to a relative unknown in California's gubernatorial primary Tuesday. Dan Quayle's candidacy has hardly been advanced by his book "Standing Firm."
Bob Dole is likely to fizzle early -- if he runs. It is Republicans in the provinces who pick nominees, not Washington's press corps, and only once in this century have they nominated a sitting senator (Barry Goldwater, 1964). 
 The frustration that has gripped Republicans since they lost control of the Senate and the national agenda in 1986 has not only aggravated internal quarrels, it has rendered the Reagan-era categories for understanding the party nearly obsolete. What do "conservative" and "moderate" mean when the supposedly super-conservative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, interrupts a journalist's remark -- "As a conservative, you basically want to minimize the role of government" -- with a brutal "no"?
Reagan conservatism -- tax cuts, controls on spending, broad deregulation -- still figures large in Republican rhetoric. But except for a few loyalists like Senator Phil Gramm, Reaganism does not really describe what G.O.P. politicians believe, and does not predict very accurately what they will do.
Nor is it accurate to describe the party as teetering on the verge of a coup by fundamentalists. The conventional wisdom that they control perhaps six state organizations is nonsense. It's true that in low-turnout off-season local contests and in party conventions governed by complex rules (like Virginia's, at which Oliver North won the senatorial nomination) Christian conservatives can win a few dramatic victories. But when large numbers of Republicans vote, the fundamentalists' clout dissipates, as Pat Robertson's humiliating performance in the 1988 primaries showed.
With rare exceptions, G.O.P. politicians become vulnerable to challenges from religious conservatives only if, like the Governor of Minnesota, Arne H. Carlson, they have also alienated economic conservatives. Republicans who have gained the loyalty of economic conservatives -- like Senators Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas -- can win despite moderate stances on abortion.
To understand G.O.P. politics, discard "moderate" or "conservative" and forget the religious right. Think instead of three big categories.
Dull and worthy. The most popular Republican on the banquet circuit -- after Jack Kemp -- is Dick Cheney, the former Defense Secretary. He formed an exploratory committee last year and has given only one on-the-record speech in 18 months. It made two points -- foreign policy is important and our health system is not in terrible condition. His popularity testifies to the institutional Republican Party's yearning for solid, unexciting small "c" conservatism.
Like Mr. Cheney, the governors most frequently mentioned as Presidential candidates -- "moderates" like Mr. Wilson and "conservatives" like Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan -- show scant enthusiasm for a Reaganesque economic agenda. They favor cautious domestic reforms that would be tougher than the Democratic alternatives, but only incrementally.
Mr. Wilson has made illegal immigration his issue. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Engler have devoted their attention to welfare and education. None has shown the radical discontent with the cost and intrusiveness of the Government that conservatives felt in the 70's, when Washington spent less than two-thirds what it does today. If former Secretary of State James Baker runs, he will be the dullest and worthiest of all.
Spacemen. In a 1984 speech, Mr. Gingrich posed the question "Why do liberals oppose a strong American presence in space?" His answer -- they hate America -- was less striking than his question. Robert Taft, Mr. Republican of the 40's, would have derided any Republican who would spend hundreds of billions to land men on Mars. Today, Washington is full of conservatives who would use the Government for transforming purposes like star-trekking and uplifting the underclass. Mr. Kemp is the most prominent of these dreamy Republicans.
Unlike the dull and worthy, the spacemen possess political vision. Their problem is that their visionary policies, like school vouchers and tenant ownership of public housing, threaten the interests and values of core G.O.P. voters. Tenant ownership would transfer assets worth tens of thousands of dollars each to the most dependent welfare recipients. School vouchers would fill fancy suburban schools with inner-city children.
The anxious. The conservatism of the 70's attacked high taxes and depreciating currency; the conservatism of the 90's focuses on race and sex. Anxious conservatives like William Bennett, Patrick Buchanan, Mr. Quayle -- even Ross Perot -- worry more about the character of society.
The "need for families," Mr. Quayle wrote, "is what the Republican Party should embrace as its cause" -- not, apparently, tax cuts. Mr. Buchanan has bitterly observed, "We are two countries, and many Americans in the first country are getting tired of subsidizing and explaining away the deepening failure of the second."
While 70's Republicans brimmed with ideas for conquering inflation and reducing taxes, anxious Republicans offer few practical suggestions. Some, like Mr. Buchanan, would preserve America's ethnic balance by capping immigration. But about the only proposal offered for achieving Mr. Quayle's hopes of promoting the traditional family is a drastic reduction in welfare payments. That might discourage single parenthood among the five million families on welfare, but it would have little impact on the 95 million households who are not.
The 90's have proved a fallow intellectual period for the right. Republicanism fades into vacuity when Republicans stray from their role as opponents of Big Government. This is why the party seems headed for disappointment, in November and in '96.

HEADLINE: HOW THEY DO IT;
A Credit Card With a Little Bonus for Retirement

 BODY:
David DuBois, 37, of Norwalk, Conn., is the chief operating officer of a drug rehabilitation center based in Minneapolis, and trevels around teh country on business. Last year, he got a credit card called the Start card, which funnels a small portion of his total purchases into a tax-deferred annuity.
 He said he checked into other rebate cards but found most useless. "I don't need frequent flier miles because I travel so much anyway," he said. "And I found that the others were so confusing, I couldn't figure out how to make them work for me." 
 Mr. DuBois charges less than $2,000 a month on the card, and generally pays his bill in full each month. If he continues spending at his current rate, his annuity account will have at least $10,000 when he is 65. Of course, the value of the money will have been eroded somewhat by inflation. "I'm not under the illusion that this is the best instrument for saving for retirement," Mr. DuBois said, "but I need a credit card anyway." This is money "I wouldn't have had otherwise."

HEADLINE: U.S. BARS FLIGHTS AND MONEY DEALS WITH THE HAITIANS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
President Clinton announced two measures today to increase pressure on Haitian military leaders and their wealthy supporters: a halt to commercial flights between Haiti and the United States and a ban on financial transactions between the two countries.
Administration officials said the ban should hit rich Haitians hard because many of them have bank accounts or investments in the United States. The ban, which takes effect immediately, will prevent Haitians from wiring money from their American accounts to Haiti or from making deposits in American accounts. 
 William H. Gray 3d, the President's special adviser on Haiti, said the measure would affect hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions, including letters of credit that Haitian companies use to import goods.
The ban on commercial flights, which begins on June 25, affects American Airlines, the only United States carrier with flights to Haiti. Canada joined the ban today, and American officials said that together, the two countries account for more than 75 percent of the flights in and out of Haiti.
The new measures are part of the President's revised strategy of putting the threat of military intervention on the back burner while increasing economic pressure to topple Haiti's military rulers, who ousted the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September 1991.
"These steps represent an important new stage in our efforts to restore democracy and return President Aristide to Haiti," Mr. Clinton said at a White House news conference. "The message is simple: Democracy must be restored; the coup must not endure."
After months of an embargo that has mainly hurt Haiti's poor, the new sanctions represent a mid-course revision. The Administration now is directing its economic fire more at Haiti's elite in the hope that they will be squeezed so hard that they will join the international call to oust Haiti's military rulers.
"What we're trying to do," said a senior Administration official, "is say to the ruling class who support the military, that if you think you can sit out these sanctions for six months or a year and by that overturn the election because President Aristide's term ends at the end of next year, well, we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to say, 'Let the masses and the middle class suffer, but the very wealthy don't have to pay a price.' "
Mr. Gray said other countries with close economic ties to Haiti, like France, have indicated that they, too, would soon announce bans on commercial flights and financial transactions.
The State Department announced today that it was withdrawing embassy dependents and 120 of about 200 employees because the tension in Haiti has increased and because the flight ban would make it hard for Americans in Haiti to return to the United States.
At the State Department's daily briefing, Christine Shelly, a spokeswoman, urged the 8,000 Americans in Haiti to leave as soon as possible.
 
To Hurt Supporters of Coup
 Mr. Gray said the new sanctions would "hurt those people who are the supporters of the coup, who presently can now go and get on an Air France plane, go to Paris, shop and come back, or get on an American Airlines plane and come to New York."
"I assure you that not too many of the poor children or the poor people of Haiti are flying American Airlines, either economy or business or first class, coming to Miami or New York," he said.
After repeatedly saying in recent weeks that military intervention was an option for ousting Haiti's military rulers, Mr. Clinton did not even mention the idea at today's news conference. With new sanctions, it appeared as if his Administration has stared the prospect of military action in the face and, sobered by the gravity of such a move, taken a step back, redoubling efforts to exhaust all economic sanctions and diplomatic means to oust Haiti's military.
Mr. Gray said today that military intervention has not been ruled out, but refused to say how long the United States would wait for the sanctions to succeed before it took stronger action.
 
Easing Burden on Poor
 To ease the burden on Haiti's poor, Mr. Gray said there would be one exception to the ban on financial transactions: Haitians living in the United States would be permitted to send up to $50 a month to relatives in Haiti so long as they do not belong to the military.
Although Mr. Gray said that sum may sound small, he explained that it should be of significant help in the hemisphere's poorest country, where per capita income is only about $350 a year.
American Airlines operates a 266-seat A-300 Airbus from New York and Miami to Port-au-Prince.
Timothy Smith, an American Airlines spokesman, said that between June 16 and June 24, the airline planned to increase its service to accommodate the flow of people it expects out of Haiti.
Administration officials said the new measures aim to show Washington's resolve after a series of moves that have sent mixed signals to Haiti's rulers over the last two years. The Administration is looking at further measures to turn up the heat on the elite, including denying all visas for travel to the United States.
 
Little Haitian Reaction
 There was little official reaction to Mr. Clinton's announcement, with both the military and the country's army-backed civilian Government keeping quiet.
The ban on financial transactions will not apply to the activities of the United States Government, the United Nations, foreign embassies and nongovernmental agencies providing food and other relief.
The ban on financial transactions differs from a freeze on personal assets. The Administration has frozen the assets of more than 630 Haitians, most of them military officers or members of the Haitian Government. Under the freeze, these Haitians may not touch their money in the United States. Under the ban on financial transactions, a family with a child attending college in the United States would be allowed to withdraw money from a bank account in the United States to pay for the child's tuition.
Administration officials acknowledged that Haitians might be able to transfer money from their American accounts to banks in Switzerland or France.
 
Canadian Is Freed
 The Coast Guard today returned 396 fleeting Haitians, bringing to 1,855 the number sent back over the last five weeks, a spokesman at the American Embassy in Haiti said. The Administration has repeatedly said it would send back all Haitian refugees until it opened a shipboard processing center off the Jamaica coast, a center that a senior official said would begin operating on Monday.
This morning in Haiti, a Canadian citizen missing for two days was released from a military prison. He bore obvious signs of mistreatment, international officials said.
Victor Edmonds, 38, was set free from a military jail known for its brutal treatment of inmates. His face was swollen, two teeth were broken, and parts of his clothing were covered in blood, said a human rights official from the joint observer mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States who saw him.
While many Haitians, particularly those supporting Father Aristide, have been regular targets for the military, foreigners had always been considered off limits, because of the potential backlash harming them could provoke. This incident is believed to be the first time a foreign resident has been beaten or mistreated by the Haitian military or their allies.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Given Pledges For More Aid

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 10

 BODY:
Facing a severe cash flow problem just as they begin administering Gaza and Jericho, Palestinian authorities obtained some relief today as international donors pledged an additional $42 million worth of aid to cover start-up costs.
Nabil Shaath, who headed the Palestinian delegation to a two-day meeting with donors here, said the outcome was "much better than expected" and would help set up a Palestinian national authority "that can survive on its own." 
 Mr. Shaath said he was hopeful that another $35 million worth of emergency aid would be pledged at another donors' meeting scheduled to be held here on July 10 and 11. "I think they understand the timing of the aid is as important as the amount," he added.
 
Several Donors
 A detailed breakdown of the new aid was not made available, but Mr. Shaath said the United States, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Japan had all contributed additional resources. He added that the 12-nation European Union, which has already pledged $600 million through 1999, was still the largest donor.
The chairman of the meeting this week was Jan Egeland, Norway's Deputy Foreign Minister, whose Government helped broker the peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel also sent Uri Savir, a senior Foreign Ministry official, to support the Palestinian case.
"We believe the Palestinian side has created the necessary conditions for progress," Mr. Savir said at a news conference. "We need the economic ingredient to make the Palestinian authority a success. This is a boost for the Palestinian economy and for continuing the peace process."
Last October, donors led by the European Union, the United States, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia pledged $2.4 billion in aid over five years, with some $700 million due to be disbursed in 1994 to set in motion programs to improve hospitals, schools and local infrastructure.
 
Short-Term Needs Slighted
 But the P.L.O. was slow in establishing mechanisms that reassured donors of accountability in the use of their funds, and the donors themselves minimized the short-term costs involved in setting up the new governing authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
"In hindsight, we might have been better at seeing the need for recurrent costs," Mr. Egeland said. "We went in with long-term projects. Few donors made allocations for the Palestinian police. Maybe we should have done so, but we did not. So we're having to shift some long-term aid toward start-up expenses."
The Norwegian official said that donors had been asked to assign 25 percent of their 1994 pledges to cover these immediate needs. "We hope not to have to convert development resources into current expenditure in the years ahead," he said.
Mr. Shaath, the chief negotiator of the Palestinian self-rule agreement with Israel last month, said the Palestinian police, now numbering close to 7,000, had received their salaries for April and May. After the $42 million is disbursed, he added, the police budget should be covered through the end of August.
"We're not interested in recurrent expenses that need recurrent aid," the Palestinian delegate said. "But it was this critical gap that scared us. We were going into a venture for which we lacked the start-up money."
Caio Koch-Weser, a World Bank representative, said he was confident the crisis had passed. "This is a partnership between the Palestinian authority and the donors that now works," he said, adding that the Palestinians' budget for 1994 is fully financed and the new Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction is "up and running."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Pressing Sanctions for North Korea

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
As North Korea threatened to sever all ties with international nuclear inspectors, the Clinton Administration sought today to signal its determination to win approval of tough economic sanctions against the North, a message intended in part to overcome news reports of internal and international divisions.
In an unusually explicit speech, a senior Defense Department official also announced that the United States had intensified its intelligence operations in the region to analyze how and when North Korea might use nuclear or other weapons if fighting began on the Korean Peninsula. 
 At the White House, President Clinton spoke for more than an hour by telephone Thursday night with President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, then joined top foreign policy advisers this morning for part of a four-hour meeting about the tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said separately that the United States hoped "within a few days" to present the United Nations with a proposal to punish North Korea for refusing to allow inspectors access to critical evidence about its nuclear weapons capability.
 
Trip Was Cut Short
 "I think I would not want to tie myself down to a particular time, but it's time to move forward with a resolution," Mr. Christopher said in Turkey as he cut short a foreign trip to return to Washington and join in the Administration's attention to the issue.
The new show of intransigence by North Korea came today after the International Atomic Energy Agency suspended technical aid to the Government as a penalty for its refusal to grant access to agency inspectors seeking evidence of a secret nuclear bomb. North Korea countered by saying it would no longer guarantee the continuity of measures intended to safeguard the security of its nuclear plants and would ask the only two United Nations inspectors still in North Korea to leave.
That would leave the world without any way to monitor whether North Korea begins to reprocess the spent fuel rods it has been withdrawing rapidly from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor into nuclear weapons-grade plutonium.
With Republicans voicing increasing criticism of Mr. Clinton for failing to prepare Americans for a possible war, and China, Japan and even the Pentagon clearly reluctant to embrace certain sanctions, much of today's public display by the Administration appeared part of an effort to respond with an image of seriousness and resolve.
 
No Precise Proposal
 But Mr. Clinton, who left the meeting of his principal advisers to announce a toughening of policy toward Haiti, left the White House briefing room abruptly rather than answer questions about North Korea. Even after the marathon gathering, White House aides acknowledged that they have yet to settle on a precise sanctions proposal to present to the United Nations.
And in Istanbul, Mr. Christopher announced the Administration's support for an international conference on North Korea, a step intended to reiterate to its Government that there are rewards if it changes its behavior and lives up to its treaty obligations by reopening its nuclear installations to international inspection.
The White House also made clear its support for a planned private trip by former President Jimmy Carter to North Korea next week, and officials described him as a potentially important emissary who could carry Washington's views to the Government and report back to Mr. Clinton on what he had learned.
Mr. Carter was briefed at a Washington airport this afternoon by Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and White House officials said the former President would meet this weekend with State Department specialists assigned to fill him in on American policy.
With Mr. Carter scheduled to visit Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, at a time when the United States, China and Japan are likely still to be wrangling over the terms of proposed United Nations sanctions, a senior White House official expressed hope that North Korea might see Mr. Carter's visit as an opportunity to seek "a face-saving resolution" to the standoff.
 
Identifying Steps to Take
 While today's White House meeting was intended mostly to identify the punitive steps against North Korea that might win approval by the Security Council, Administration officials said it also included extensive discussion of "prudent" military steps the United States might take if tensions on the Korean peninsula increase.
They said the comments made in the speech today by Ashton B. Carter, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, reflected some of that concern. In an address that outlined problems posed by the spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, Mr. Carter said the United States was "significantly increasing our intelligence assets" in the Korean Peninsula and was analyzing "scenarios" in which North Korea might use such weapons if the diplomatic standoff turns to war.
In separately holding out the prospect of an international conference on North Korea, the Administration appeared to have intended to send two simultaneous messages. First, it signaled American willingness to embrace a proposal that originated in Moscow, which has not yet publicly embraced the idea of sanctions against North Korea.
It could also serve to lower the volume of war talk in Washington by showing North Korea that there are rewards for better behavior. But the decision may also have the unintended consequence of signaling to North Korea that the United States does not have a clear plan for stopping the world's most isolated and authoritarian Government from developing nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: Dow Posts Gain of 20.31; Volume Is Uninspiring

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market rose moderately yesterday, aided by a modest rise in blue-chip stocks like Aluminum Company of America and Bethlehem Steel and a strong rise in computer-related stocks like Microsoft and Intel after the release of an unexpectedly favorable computer-industry index.
But despite the price rise, traders continued to hold back. In the 14th consecutive session of below-average trading, volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 222.6 million shares, compared with the average this year of 296 million shares. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.31 points, to 3,773.45, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.81 point, to 458.67. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.37 points, to 734.25.
The week's listlessness was reflected in the industrial average's track record. The Dow ended just 1.23 points above its close a week ago.
 
Few Trends in Trading
 There seemed to be few trends in yesterday's stock activity. The Dow, for example, rose mainly because of five stocks: Alcoa, up 1 3/4, to 73; Caterpillar, up 1 5/8, to 105 1/8; Bethlehem Steel, up 1 3/8, to 21 1/8; Chevron, up 1 1/8, to 90 3/4, and Texaco, up 1, to 64 3/4. But none of the five stocks seemed to be affected by any immediate news.
If there was a trend, it was the strong lift given to the Nasdaq index by four computer-related stocks: Oracle Systems, a developer of computer networking software, which rose 23/16 , to 36 3/4; Intel, the leading semiconductor maker, which rose 63/64 , to 5963/64 ; Novell, another developer of computer networking software, which rose 5/8, to 17 1/8, and Microsoft, the developer of personal-computer software, which rose 5/16 , to 529/16 .
All these stocks benefited, if only indirectly, from the Semiconductor Industry Association's report late Thursday of the book-to-bill ratio, an indicator of future demand for semiconductors. The ratio was expected by Wall Street to drop sharply to 1.12 in May from 1.14 in April.
 
Strong Demand for Chips
 Instead, the ratio dropped only modestly to 1.14 from a revised 1.15, indicating continued strong demand as the industry heads into its slower-selling summer season. The number means that for every $1 of semiconductors shipped, the industry received $1.14 worth of new orders.
The lift from the semiconductor report overcame negative news for Microsoft, the subject of an unfavorable court ruling regarding versions of its mainstay MS-DOS software. The ruling, which Microsoft is appealing, concerned a patent infringement allegation involving data-compression technology.
Stocks rallied despite a rise in long-term interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose 4 basis points, to 7.31 percent. Rates shot up after a mixed report on producer prices showed that overall prices fell a tenth of a percent while the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose four-tenths of a percent.
Bond traders may have paid even more attention to the Commodity Research Bureau index, which rose 1.21 points, to 232.88, the fourth rise in a row. The index is a proxy for commodities traders' inflation outlook.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose five-tenths of a point, to 253.59, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,189 to 878. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.66 point, to 441.84.
Of the 30 components of the Dow industrials, 18 rose, led by Alcoa, which helped to lift the average by 4.3 index points. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 217 rose.
In Tokyo, stocks finished slightly lower yesterday, failing to maintain an early rally after the Bank of Japan released its quarterly "tankan" corporate survey showing some signs of improvement in the economy. The Nikkei index of 225 issues ended down 7.60 points, or four-hundredths of a percent, at 21,395.18. It had risen as high as 21,559.81 earlier in the day.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Send Mixed Signal

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
In a mixed report on inflation, prices received by American producers edged down one-tenth of 1 percent for the second consecutive month in May, but only because of big declines in food and energy prices, Labor Department figures showed today.
Without those components, which often swing erratically in response to the weather or political developments, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods climbed four-tenths of 1 percent, a pace a little faster than expected. 
 "This economy is tightening up and we are getting a little bit of inflation at the producer level, but it's not very serious," said L. Douglas Lee, chief economist for NatWest Markets in Washington.
 
Selling in Bond Market
 The Labor Department's report prompted some selling in the bond market, pushing interest rates modestly higher, as traders and other operators seemed to be unnerved more by the rise in so-called core, or underlying, inflation than reassured by another slight easing in the overall index. [Page 46.]
Separately, a panel of 52 forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators trimmed its estimate of inflation at the consumer level this year by one-tenth of a point, to 2.7 percent, the same as last year, while maintaining its prediction of 3.3 percent for 1995. Blue Chip, based in Sedona, Ariz., reports its findings on the 10th day of each month.
Analysts said the producer price figures did not seem likely to hasten any additional tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
The increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in the core rate -- exceeded only in January and matched only in November during the last year -- was concentrated mainly in tobacco and motor vehicles, the department found.
But tobacco prices were unchanged before the department adjusted them statistically to account for seasonal factors.
"I don't think volatile tobacco prices are enough to fire up the Fed to raise rates again," said Jay Goldinger, investment strategist at Capital Insight in Los Angeles.
The higher prices for light trucks and passenger cars -- up 2 percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent, respectively -- reflected the recent weakness of the dollar against the Japanese yen that has made Japanese cars relatively more expensive and thereby has given American producers an umbrella under which to raise prices.
The Producer Price Index, unlike the Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled to be issued on Tuesday, excludes imported goods and most services.
Without the inclusion of tobacco and motor vehicles, Merrill Lynch calculated, the core Producer Price Index would have moved up just one-tenth of 1 percent, and the overall index would have fallen three-tenths of 1 percent.
A main source of unease today seemed to involve prices at the intermediate stage of production, just before finished goods. The overall intermediate index rose two-tenths of 1 percent, but a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for the intermediate core was slightly faster than the January-April period that was itself slightly faster than the average in 1993.
"There are signs of incipient inflation pressure," said Carl J. Palash, economist at MCM MoneyWatch, a New York advisory firm.
Crude materials, on the other hand, dropped 1.4 percent over all last month, and 1.1 percent without food and energy, the report also showed.
The finished-goods index, in which energy was down 1 percent, reflected a drop of 2.8 percent in gasoline prices and declines for residential gas and electricity that were larger than in April. But home heating oil turned up.
Food prices fell nine-tenths of 1 percent as declines accelerated for red meats, fresh and dry vegetables, eggs and processed chickens while dairy products and processed turkeys turned down. Fresh fruits and melons jumped 5.6 percent, reversing a decline in April.
Capital equipment rose four-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month, with increases for motor vehicles and commercial furniture more than offsetting a decline for civilian aircraft.
In intermediate goods, like a bolt of cloth, the main upward pressure was from materials used in manufacturing.
Durable materials jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent as prices for copper and brass mill shapes surged 6.9 percent, after falling about 1 percent in April, while indexes also turned up last month for hot and cold rolled steel sheet and strip, plywood, copper cathode, flat glass and aluminum mill shapes. Partly offsetting those were declines for building paper and building board and smaller increases for aluminum ingots and cement.
Nondurable manufacturing materials rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, a bit less than in April, as primary and intermediate basic organic chemicals, fertilizer materials, woodpulp, paperboard, paper and plastic resins and materials all advanced. Basic organic chemicals declined.
Construction materials rose two-tenths of 1 percent after falling twice that much in April, the Labor Department also found in its survey, which is conducted by mail questionnaire to cover prices for the Tuesday of the week containing the 13th of the month.
Consumer prices, by contrast, are surveyed throughout the month.
Crude prices in today's report showed energy up 1 percent -- in contrast to declines at later stages.

HEADLINE: Even Wealthy Haitians Starting to Feel Pinched

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, June 8

 BODY:
The BMW's and bougainvillea of the hilltop neighborhood of Juvenat sometimes make it difficult to remember that Haiti is the hemisphere's poorest country, or that for more than two years it has been subjected to a series of ever tighter international embargoes.
This enclave of mostly newly made fortunes is shaken only by the rumble of earth-moving equipment rushing to complete private roads whose access will be monitored by the latest in electronic security devices. Despite a worldwide ban on trade with Haiti, great cement and marble mansions are still going up here that would make denizens of Beverly Hills blush. 
 But if the holders of Haiti's unexplained fortunes seem anything but eager to release their grip and allow the restoration of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, for many others, increasingly including many well-to-do Haitians, the pressures of the outside world are beginning to tell.
Haiti's national bank has been the scene this week of angry confrontations as holders of Government checks have been told they will have to return to collect their funds because of a run on cash reserves.
 
Scramble for Cash
 In times of unrest, people here have long been used to paying a premium to buy American dollars. Lately, however, even the local currency, the gourde, has become scarce, as nervous Haitians stow away whatever savings they have to wait out the crisis.
Many say the scramble for cash is likely to get worse. A tightening of the international embargo announced this week will suspend all financial transactions with Haiti. This measure will end an estimated flow of $200 million to $300 million sent by Haitians living abroad to their families here each year.
Since sanctions were first imposed shortly after the coup in September 1991 against Father Aristide, economists here say those funds, along with large profits from cocaine trafficking, are the only things that have kept Haiti's economy afloat.
At the Port-au-Prince airport, the mood is also growing more and more frenzied as wealthy Haitians send their smartly dressed children off to the United States before a total ban on commercial air traffic takes effect later this month.
 
Rising Efforts to Leave
 Counterfeit American visas and fake immigration cards have been turning up in record numbers as those wanting to leave seem willing to try any ruse to board the last remaining flights.
Airline officials in Haiti say that in an incident that was hushed up last week, an airport worker was shot in the leg by a desperate traveler whose papers were rejected as invalid.
"This country has always been chaotic, we are used to that," said a Haitian airline official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But lately, with all the uncertainty over the future, it is taking on the feel of the Wild West."
For Haiti's elite and professional classes, for the first time in months there has been a suspension of disbelief over the determination of other countries and especially the United States to restore Father Aristide.
 
Much Nervous Waiting
 Each day has become a ritualized wait for news from the outside world on the latest measures to force the surrender of the Haitian military leaders, with no question more nervously debated than if and when a foreign military intervention might be undertaken.
With speculation running high, pure rumor and Byzantine interpretations of events have overtaken the news in a society that was already given to the mysterious.
Lately, as has regularly happened during the more tense moments of the long-running crisis, the reading of tea leaves has turned to supposed divisions between top army leaders.
The latest ruminations along these lines had for their unlikely inspiration a short news item broadcast by local radios about the violent eviction of a prominent lawyer from his downtown offices.
 
'Arm Wrestling by Proxy'
 One explanation was that the lawyer, Osner Fevry, simply owed 16 months of back rent. But for much of the country's elite, the circumstances, from the trashing of the office by shadowy police auxiliaries to the mysterious disappearance of a judge who had been involved in the matter, hinted at what one diplomat called "arm wrestling by proxy" between the powerful police chief, Col. Michel Francois, and the army Chief of Staff, Phillipe Biamby.
Diplomats with direct recent experience with the military confirm that tensions in that institution are rising too, but caution against drawing wishful conclusions.
Army irregulars stopped members of the United Nations human rights observer mission at a roadblock here this week, seizing their walkie-talkies and destroying radios mounted in their vehicles.
Making clear that the mood of the army had not changed from confrontation to surrender, the observers' verbal protest was met with the response, "You should feel lucky you are alive."

Treasury Prices Decline On Inflation Concerns

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday and interest rates rose as investors became increasingly concerned about whether inflation would remain subdued.
The bond market found mixed signals in the Labor Department's report on producer prices in May, which posted a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent -- but only because of big declines in food and energy prices. 
 Moreover, rising commodity prices -- another closely watched gauge of inflation -- also rattled bond investors. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices rose for a fourth day, gaining 1.21 points, to 232.88.
Investors are still worried about the re-emergence of inflation, which diminishes the value of fixed-income securities. "It's going to take more signs of slowing in the economy" for bond yields to fall, said Monty Cleworth, who handles $300 million in fixed-income investments at Denver's Founders Asset Management.
 
Yield Rises to 7.31%
 In trading yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 of bonds. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.31 percent, from 7.27 percent on Thursday.
Yields on intermediate- and short-term Treasury issues also rose, with the yield on the 10-year note climbing to 7.01 percent, from 6.95 percent.
Many bond traders focused on the Labor Department's report showing that excluding food and energy costs, the core rate for its Producer Price Index jumped a larger-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent.
"The message from the rise in the core rate is that it's not all quiet on the inflation front," said Brian Hilliard, economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London.
Yesterday's trading marked the first time this year that the bond market had failed to rally after the release of the Producer Price Index. On the other hand, it was also the first time in 1994 that bond yields were lower, not higher, than in the previous month.
Some traders noted that with Treasury yields at their lowest in weeks, investors would need more than a report on inflation for bonds to rally.
Inflation indicators reflect what prices were, not where they are going, said Craig Coats, who oversees $16 million in capital at Coats Asset Management, a leveraged Treasury bond firm in Palm Beach, Fla.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, supported the notion that inflation measures were not perfect forecasting tools. Mr. Greenspan said this week in London that measures of inflation, while "clearly restrained," were "history."
"If the best news on the inflation front is over, I'm not sure the Fed won't have to raise rates again," said Michael Marzano, head of bond futures trading at Yamaichi International (America).
 
Costs Seen Rising
 Thomas Rooke, director of futures research at Paine Webber, said the chief executives of United States companies were telling the securities firm that their costs were starting to rise.
The next guidepost for the bond market will come on July 8, when the Labor Department releases the June employment report, Mr. Coats said. The economy added 191,000 nonfarm jobs in May, fewer than economists had expected.
Treasury bond yields were about 6.30 percent before the Fed began pushing up interest rates in February. The 30-year bond ended at a record low yield of 5.78 percent on Oct. 15, 1993.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Grain Prices Up on Forecast Of Continued Dry Weather

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Volatile grain prices turned higher yesterday following forecasts of at least a few more days of rain-free weather in the already parched Corn Belt.
Because of higher prices for grain, coffee, cocoa and lumber, the Commodity Research Bureau index rose 1.21 points, to 232.88. The index is a key guide of commodity inflation. 
 The dry spring has worried farmers in a swath from Iowa through northern Illinois and to Ohio and southern Michigan. A high pressure ridge that moved over the Great Plains was likely to keep the region dry, weather experts said.
"Everybody wants to be bullish on the ridge coming in to keep the West dry," said Paul Haugens, trading specialist for Rodman & Renshaw.
"There wasn't very much volume today because they were afraid of what's going to happen Monday," Mr. Haugens said, noting several forecasts calling for a breakup of the ridge next week that could usher in needed rains.
 
Violent Price Swings
 July soybeans jumped 9.25 cents, to $6.82 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while July corn added 2 cents, to $2.73 1/4.
The grain markets have experienced violent price swings recently on the changing weather outlooks, with trading on Mondays particularly sensitive to weekend weather.
The market is sensitive because of relatively low stocks of grain after last year's flood-damaged harvest.
Wheat prices also strengthened, with July wheat gaining 3 cents, to $3.38 3/4 a bushel.
Equally volatile coffee prices rose slightly in New York ahead of important crop estimates from the United States Department of Agriculture. July coffee rose 0.35 cent, to 125.20 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, while July cocoa gained $24, to $1,325 a metric ton.
After the close of trading, the Government estimated the global green coffee crop at 90.6 million 132-pound bags, down by 4 percent from last year's production.
 
Income Crippled
 Brazil, the world's largest coffee grower, was expected to produce 23.5 million bags, down 5 million bags from last year. Colombia, the second-largest producer, was expected to produce a crop of 12.5 million bags, the lowest since 1988-89.
The report said low world coffee prices were crippling growers' income and causing a downturn in production.
Elsewhere, oil prices finished lower after spending most of the session focused on the expiration of options contracts. When the July strike price of $19 a barrel was seen as unattainable, the market dropped off and finished lower. July crude oil fell 19 cents, to $18.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"Once it became clear it wasn't going to make it, people decided to take profits ahead of the weekend," said Morris Greenberg of Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: ROWING;
Oarsman From Croatia Helps Brown Dominate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE 

 BODY:
An enduring feature of college rowing is losing your shirt. Tradition dictates that after the races those who have lost come around and hand over their shirts, each with its distinctive school color and design, to the victors.
Igor Boraska, a world-class oarsman from Croatia, says he has collected "about 80 shirts," and no wonder. Boraska rows in the seven seat for Brown, the No. 1 crew in the nation, which has won its last 16 races over two seasons and goes for No. 17 on Saturday at the national championship regatta on Harsha Lake, Ohio, near Cincinnati. 
 Boraska and the other Bears in the boat can each expect to collect six more shirts, including the highly sought crimson one from Harvard. It will take a miracle, or an accident, for the Bears to lose because, said the Dartmouth coach, Scott Armstrong, "They are so powerful, it's ridiculous."
Crews from California-Berkeley, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton and Washington will chase Brown, which has beaten all of these eights except Washington at least once this season (Dartmouth and Princeton thrice). Brown has thus ended Harvard's long reign as the titan of intercollegiate rowing.
Steve Gladstone, the Brown coach, has been the subject of criticism from other coaches for his worldwide recruiting, but he has an easy defense. He points to Boraska as an ideal athlete, devoted, hard-working, an excellent student and so grateful for the opportunities that were given him in his two and a half years at Brown.
Boraska, who just graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and economics, is from Split, a city on the Adriatic physically untouched by war. Before Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, Boraska was a member of the national team along with Dennis Zvegelj, the No. 2 oarsman in this Brown varsity. Zvegelj is from Bled in Slovenia.
Between the Eastern Sprints at Worcester, Mass., on May 15 and last week's Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta at Syracuse, Boraska first went home to Split and then won a gold medal at an international regatta in Duisberg, Germany.

HEADLINE: A Stronger Case for Police Cuts

 BODY:
Rudolph Giuliani was elected Mayor of New York as a relentless crime-fighter. The police union gave him strong support, and he is now engaged in difficult negotiations over the next police contract. So his ritual rejection of critics who tell him to cut the police budget is understandable. But a little mayoral flexibility would serve the city better.
New analyses by State Comptroller Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan Hevesi expose the weakness of his position. Also, the City Council is pressing for a small cutback that would let it restore some of the brutal cuts he proposes for other agencies, cuts made deeper by exempting police, firefighters and teachers. 
 Granted, both Comptrollers and the Council majority are Democrats. The critics could thus be dismissed as politically motivated. But this is a budgetary issue in which economies can be achieved without sacrificing public safety. No one proposes weakening the city's police force. Indeed, everyone wants to strengthen it. The critics are rightly alarmed by the awful waste of expensively trained police on office work.
The debate centers on a "memorandum of understanding" between former Mayor David Dinkins, Gov. Mario Cuomo and the leaders of the Legislature, under which the city was authorized to raise taxes and earmark lottery revenues to build its uniformed police forces to a total of 38,310. There is a growing consensus that, rather than counting the number of bodies in uniform, the proper target is "patrol strength" -- the number of officers actively involved in enforcement work, as distinct from desk duty. Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner William Bratton remain fixed nonetheless on total numbers, insisting it is the only measure that leaves the department free to deploy the force in the ways it feels are most effective.
State Comptroller McCall, in an audit of the police buildup, said the department had failed its "promise to New Yorkers" to move police out of desk jobs that do not need uniformed personnel and put them in the street. The city could save $11 million in just one year, and more in the years following, by substituting civilians for police in those slots.
In a separate report, City Comptroller Hevesi said nearly 1,500 police officers could be replaced with civilians who are paid less and get substantially less generous pension benefits. Mr. Hevesi's report also offered dramatic examples of what will happen to other services if the police remain sacrosanct. Too often, money saved now in shortsighted ways would cost the city lots more down the road -- like the cut in rat control that can only worsen public health problems.
The budget deadline is still three weeks away -- time enough for more jockeying and a rational compromise that strengthens the patrol strength of the New York City Police Department while reducing its cost.

HEADLINE: Why Does U.S. Let Beijing Tell Us What to Do?;
Our Best Leverage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Trade, the Real Engine of Democracy" (Op-Ed, May 25), Senator Bill Bradley has sought the stillbirth of linking trade privileges to human rights before the concept gets a chance to experience life. In dealing with China, he ignore our nation's proud heritage of principles over crass commercialism.
For example, there has been overwhelming support in Congress and the Presidency for economic sanctions as a tool to end apartheid in South Africa and restore democracy in Haiti. China's harsh repression of political dissidents, students and trade unionists is no less deserving of available nonmilitary actions to influence that government's behavior. 
 Trade sanctions are not always successful but are the best leverage we have. Senator Bradley talks about our growing exports to China, but is silent about the huge and growing part of our market China is taking. We have close to a $25 billion trade deficit with China, counting legal and illegally transshipped exports from there. Why should American consumers support a regime that doesn't respect many of the principles our country was founded on?
Since unions or any other collective action by workers are illegal in China, the country is in effect subsidizing its huge exports on the backs of its own people. Working conditions -- wages, required hours, health and safety -- are appalling, with no opportunity for the workers to change them. We should not put our stamp of approval on this type of trade.
Equally disturbing is the huge commercial operations of the People's Liberation Army. That China's military has an enormous source of revenue in the billions of dollars not subject to government oversight or control is, I believe, unique in the world. If the army wants to use the money to make secret chemical or biological weapons, who can tell it no? How can we negotiate a nuclear disarmament treaty with China when the military doesn't need the Government as its source of revenue? This independence is very dangerous, mainly to China's Asian neighbors.
China's trade surge has come mainly at the expense of other third world countries that export to us. It is these countries, most of which treat their citizens with dignity and legal protections, whose development we should aid by our consumer dollars.
I concur in cutting off trade with tiny Haiti, but it's hypocritical not to do the same with China just because it's big and we can earn more profits there.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
The President and First Lady have achieved remarkable consensus on a truly revolutionary principle: All Americans must be entitled to adequate medical services without regard to ability to pay or risk of ill health. Now it's up to Congress to embody that principle in law, a historic opportunity comparable to the enactments of Social Security in 1935 and Medicare in 1965.
Unfortunately, excessive solicitude for existing institutions and interests, and the difficulties of reconciling them with the Clintons' fundamental principles, have made their proposal a bureaucratic and legalistic morass. 
 The biggest flaw in the Administration proposal is the requirement that employers pay the premiums -- a mandate whose awkwardness and unfairness stand out starkly in a system dedicated to universal coverage.
Employer-based medical insurance is a historical accident -- one that no one would choose now if given a clean slate. During World War II, trade unions and employers circumvented Federal wage ceilings by offering medical fringe benefits. Their popularity and generosity boomed after the war, as Congress sheltered them without limit from income and Social Security taxes.
The fact that employers write the checks for medical care does not mean that they bear the full costs. They can generally shift some costs to workers in reduced take-home pay and some to customers in higher prices. The sure losers are taxpayers who have to make up the revenue lost to the tax shelter.
Much of the Administration's 1,300-page proposal is devoted to expedients intended to mitigate the difficulties and anomalies of employer mandates. It's a hopeless task. Some families have no employed members. Some have two or more. Many employees work part time. Some have more than one job. Americans frequently change jobs, employers, work locations, places -- even states -- of residence.
Under an employer mandate, responsibilities for paying a family's premiums would frequently be divided among several sources -- various employers, governments and the family itself -- in proportions varying month to month. Keeping track of these liabilities would surely involve extensive paperwork and administrative hassle, contrary to Mrs. Clinton's claim that an employer mandate eliminates the need to track individuals.
Nor would the new system be equitable. Equity demands that public subsidies, direct or via employers, be a larger share of premiums and of income the poorer the family. Equity also requires that families' subsidies be the same if their incomes are the same.
But in the Clinton plan, subsidies depend more on the size of employers' payrolls than on families' ability to pay. The system is also full of bad incentives -- for example, not to hire workers with dependents.
It's individuals who get sick and need medical services. It's individuals and families whose ability to pay is the natural criterion of equity. It's individuals who must be guaranteed coverage. So it's individuals who must be required to have insurance. Let employers help pay the premiums if they wish, but count those payments as taxable income. Treat the self-employed exactly the same as employees.
Let people choose where they will buy insurance. One option should be a version of Medicare or a selection of the health plans made available to Federal employees. Let's call this option Fedmed.
Fedmed would offer the basic universal medical insurance package at premiums that in total would cover the costs. Let private health plans offer the same package, provided they do not pick and choose members or charge higher premiums for risky cases. As in the Clinton plan, it would probably be necessary to collect money from plans that happen to have low-risk clienteles and distribute them to plans with high-risk members.
With these provisions, Fedmed would be protected against becoming the last-resort insurer of bad risks. As in Medicare itself (which would continue as at present), people could choose their own physicians and other providers.
Fedmed would have low administrative costs and would wield enough clout to limit payments to providers. It would also let people change employment status, residence or family situation without losing coverage. But it need not be a monopoly.
Federal subsidies to individuals would take the form of refundable tax credits, "vouchers" or a credit card payable to Fedmed or other insurers. For low-income families the subsidies would cover the whole premium of the basic package; most other families would receive vouchers at least as valuable to them as the current tax exemption for employer-provided insurance.
A family of four in the 28 percent tax bracket with a $4,300 insurance package would receive vouchers of $1,204 -- 28 percent of the premium. No family would face an out-of-pocket cost of more than 10 percent of income for the basic package.
This plan would not require new broad-based taxes or new burdens on employers. One source of financing would be redirecting the Clintons' proposed subsidies to employers and low-income people, about $100 billion in 1999. Eliminating the tax shelter for employer-paid premiums would contribute $125 billion, and our plan would replace Medicaid acute care for those under 65 (about $75 billion more).
Robert Reischauer of the C.B.O. destroyed a semantic attraction of employer mandates when he testified recently that federally required purchases of insurance should be included in the budget. Their popularity is waning among businesses and in Congress, where support appears to be growing for the plans of Representative Jim Cooper and Senator John Chafee; unfortunately, these plans do not assure universal coverage in this century.
Our proposal is not a radical reconstruction. It builds on the best of existing institutions. A victory for it would be a victory for the basic principles that the Clintons have so eloquently set forth.

HEADLINE: A Bridge Too Far?;
Benjamin Chavis

BYLINE: Alex Kotlowitz writes about race and urban issues.

 BODY:
AS THE Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. finishes his fiery address at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J., he readies himself for the inevitable Farrakhan question. A middle-aged white man leans into a microphone set up for the audience. Does he, Chavis, refute the anti-Semitism of the Nation of Islam minister? Doesn't Chavis think it unusual that he, the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, would invite Farrakhan to a conference of national black leaders?
Chavis (pronounced CHAY-vis) moves stiffly away from the podium, his arms folded across his chest. He reminds the questioner that in a speech at the Smithsonian Institution in January -- just weeks after a senior Farrakhan aide had delivered a hate-filled speech at Kean College in Union, N.J. -- he had denounced anti-Semitism as a "hideous form of racial hatred and bigotry." The N.A.A.C.P., Chavis continues, does not condone bigotry of any kind. Then, with his right arm slashing the air, he asserts, "The N.A.A.C.P. will not be dictated to." The blacks in the auditorium, most of whom are middle-aged and middle-class, pepper their applause with shouts of "Amen." 
 Earlier that evening, as we drove from Newark Airport to the college, Chavis had predicted just such a response. Civil rights leaders in recent years "had punked out" (street lingo for having backed down), he said, and that if he and the N.A.A.C.P. are to win the hearts and minds of blacks, he must not "punk out early."
In April, Chavis, who is 46, completed his first year as executive director of the Baltimore-based N.A.A.C.P., and it is fair to say that in that short time Chavis has not punked out. He has placed himself at the epicenter of a vigorous, heated debate over what direction the once-vital civil rights movement should take. In the simplest of terms, the debate has pitted longtime integrationists against a growing black nationalist sentiment. It is what one historian calls "a timeless conundrum" that ripens with each new generation of black leaders. W. E .B. Du Bois debated Booker T. Washington on just that subject; the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. tangled with Malcolm X.
In entering the fray, Chavis has pushed the N.A.A.C.P. back into the spotlight, sharpening the edges of what one member describes as "a genteel, lace-curtain organization." This is, after all, an organization that in recent years has been widely known for its televised Image Awards.
While Chavis insists he has not abandoned the N.A.A.C.P.'s long march toward integration, he sees its future as a champion for self-help and economic empowerment. By placing an emphasis on building and strengthening black institutions, including small businesses and black colleges, Chavis hopes to revive, if not redefine, the N.A.A.C.P. -- and by extension the civil rights movement, which has been languishing since the extraordinary victories of the 1950's and 60's. Indeed, the 85-year-old N.A.A.C.P. saw its membership plummet from one million in the early 1960's to under 500,000 in the early 1990's.
The N.A.A.C.P. has, in its recent past, represented largely middle-class, politically moderate blacks and has historically been reluctant to form coalitions. But Chavis hopes to broaden the organization's base, which means engaging the disparate and sometimes oppositional forces within the black community, including Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. Chavis is awed by Farrakhan's ability to turn out blacks -- more than 20,000 at a recent speech in Houston; Chavis himself barely filled half the 961-seat auditorium at William Paterson.
Although Chavis has begun a much-needed crusade to involve young blacks in discussions about their future, some of his efforts have been controversial. He has supported and attended gang conferences in cities like Chicago and Kansas City. He has proposed opening N.A.A.C.P. chapters for Hispanic- and Asian-Americans. And two months ago in Detroit he met with leading black nationalists and pan-Africanists, including Leonard Jeffries and Lenora Fulani, taking considerable heat from his own board. In fact, Chavis has so riled some N.A.A.C.P. members that there is an effort underfoot to remove him as executive director.
Chavis's most ambitious undertaking to assemble the varied elements of the African-American community begins today in Baltimore. He has convened a three-day conference of black leaders to thrash out differences over, among other things, economic, educational and criminal-justice concerns. Those invited include Farrakhan; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Coretta Scott King; the members of the Congressional Black Caucus; business leaders like John Johnson and scholars like Cornel West.
"I'm a child of the N.A.A.C.P.," Chavis says, "but I'm also a child of the broader movement." As he steers the N.A.A.C.P. on a course of black self-help, Chavis views integration as more of a byproduct than a goal in the struggle for racial equality. Building stronger black institutions and communities, he argues, will create economic and social parity -- and common ground -- between whites and blacks.
"Empowerment and integration are not mutually exclusive," he says. "They are in fact inextricably linked."
CHAVIS SEES HIMSELF FOLLOWING in the footsteps of W. E. B. Du Bois, the activist and intellectual who helped found the N.A.A.C.P. in 1909. Du Bois wrestled hard with whether black Americans should assimilate or separate. In effect, Du Bois "invented the idea of racial and ethnic hyphenization," wrote the historian Eric Foner in The Nation. According to Foner, Du Bois concluded that "blacks did not have to choose. . . . Their destiny was to be African-Americans."
Chavis would agree. But despite this common ground, his political journey seems the mirror image of Du Bois's. Where Du Bois ultimately moved to the left, joining the Communist Party and eventually becoming a citizen of Ghana, Chavis went from wearing black power tams to muted-color business suits.
Along with three sisters, Chavis was raised in Oxford, N.C., a small town nestled among the rolling hills near the Virginia border. Chavis's father was a bricklayer, his mother a teacher, and like many blacks of the time, they passed down family history, in part to prepare their children for the inequities they would face in their own lives.
When he was 4, Chavis sat on his father's knee and listened to the story about his great-great-great-grandfather, John Chavis, one of the first blacks to attend the precursor to Princeton University, some 150 years earlier. He then returned to North Carolina to teach the sons and daughters of slave owners. He also surreptitiously tutored slave children and free blacks, and for that, the family lore goes, he was murdered.
"My father told the story in a way that didn't make you afraid," Chavis recalls. "It made you curious. Why did that happen? What was wrong with teaching black children to read and write?"
Much of Chavis's childhood memories revolve around his and his family's resistance to the Jim Crow laws of the South. He remembers mischievously drinking out of a whites-only water fountain; of receiving his first N.A.A.C.P. card, from his father, at age 12, and of angrily turning the Boy Scouts' three-fingered salute into a half-raised fist at a statewide jamboree where blacks were shunted to one end of the arena. Chavis became so defiant by age 12 that his parents sent him to live with his oldest sister, June, in Lenoir, N.C., a larger town where his antics might be less noticed.
Chavis went to college, first to St. Augustine's, his father's alma mater in Raleigh, N.C., and then to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he majored in chemistry. Planning to become a doctor, he became active instead in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. After King's assassination, he became more militant. In 1969, he ran for the Charlotte City Council, posing for his campaign photo in a leopard-skin dashiki. He was also ordained in the Black Christian Nationalist Church, based in Detroit.
His life then took another turn when he was recruited as a full-time organizer by the United Church of Christ, a predominately white, Protestant congregation active in liberal causes. "I was looking for someone with his boldness," says the Rev. Leon White, who hired Chavis.
White soon sent the young black activist to Wilmington, a coastal North Carolina city where black high-school students were protesting racial discrimination in the school system. The town was subjected to small acts of vandalism. Then, on Feb. 6, 1971, a white-owned grocery store was firebombed. Chavis and nine others were found guilty of arson and sentenced to long terms in prison. The Wilmington 10, as they came to be known, insisted that they had been framed. Amnesty International considered them political prisoners. Liberals rallied to their defense. After four and a half years in prison, during which time he received his divinity degree from Duke University, Chavis was paroled in late 1979. A Federal Appeals Court later overturned the convictions because, among other things, the defense had been denied access to a key prosecution witness.
In 1980, Chavis was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Christ. He continued his work for the church's Commission for Racial Justice, becoming its director in 1986. During his tenure there, he coined and popularized the term "environmental racism," commissioning a study that showed the propensity for industrial polluters and waste sites to be placed in or near minority neighborhoods. His work became so respected that he joined the Clinton-Gore transition team as an authority on environmental justice issues.
By his own measure, Chavis has become "more mainstream," although his prison experience and his flirtation with black nationalism have given him a certain cachet among young people, whom he is trying to recruit into the N.A.A.C.P. In his travels, he has made a point of visiting and talking with inner-city youth. "I know the lingo," says Chavis, who peppers his conversation with such street terms as "hood" and "homeboy." In his first year, Chavis has brought 160,000 new, mostly young members into the N.A.A.C.P., lowering the median age from 52 to 38 and increasing the membership by an astounding one-third. It is his most tangible and significant achievement as the N.A.A.C.P.'s new head.
"How does the weather look?" Chavis asks.
It is 1:30 A.M., hours after Chavis's New Jersey speech, and he is sprawled on his hotel bed, on the phone to his staff in Jackson, Miss. He is scheduled to catch a 7 A.M. flight to the state capital, where he plans to lead a march protesting the planned closing or reduction of three black colleges. He is so tired that he falls asleep while completing the next day's details.
Chavis keeps such a frenetic schedule he occasionally has his family join him on the road so that he can spend more time with them. He lives with his wife, Martha, and their two young children in a suburb of Baltimore. He also has three grown children from a first marriage (a fourth child recently died of liver failure). This usually guarded man is fiercely intense, his freckles the only, albeit unintentional, bow to playfulness. His detractors describe him as humorless, and he is uncomfortable with small talk or the idea of leisure. Avocations? He thinks for a minute. "I read chemistry books," he offers.
Chavis may indeed not have the luxury of taking a respite given the critical issues facing African-Americans. Black-on-black violence and the ever-growing drug plague are destroying families and unraveling communities. A Harvard University study shows the number of black students in schools with predominately minority enrollment is rising. And even the burgeoning black middle class -- in the words of Ellis Cose, author of "The Rage of a Privileged Class" -- "is in excruciating pain," because of the pricks and slights that have accumulated over the years.
Given such frustration and anger among both poor and middle-class blacks, integration as a goal is not a priority for Chavis. That reflects a growing sentiment in the black community that integration, as it has been practiced, has fallen far short of expectations. In a study financed by the Russell Sage Foundation, 47 percent of the blacks polled support the idea of an independent black political party.
So divided are blacks on the subject of integration that in St. Louis the black leadership is split over a plan that buses 14,500 mostly black children to suburban schools. In Mississippi, black leaders who want increased funds for state-financed black colleges find themselves somewhat defensively explaining that no, that doesn't mean they endorse separate-but-equal facilities. And tune into black talk-radio shows across the nation and you will hear about "nation building" or "opting out."
"We in the N.A.A.C.P. are engaging that sentiment, to get it to evolve from an isolationist stance," says Chavis. This is why he extends his hand to separatists like Farrakhan and Kwame Ture (the former Stokely Carmichael).
As Chavis mines such alienation among blacks, he risks being criticized for trying to be everything to everybody. And his message at times can seem jumbled. In his efforts to reach out to black youth, he has participated in highly publicized deliberations with street gangs, seemingly helping to perpetuate the very myth he denounces in speeches: that the majority of young blacks belong to such gangs. He says he backs the kind of community-based schools supported by Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. of St. Louis, but he also endorses the vigorous defense of voluntary school busing by the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. And he praises Farrakhan's self-help efforts while denouncing anti-Semitism, a seeming keystone to the Nation of Islam minister's world view.
Chavis's invitation to Farrakhan has met with stinging rebuke from critics and allies alike, particularly since Jews played such a prominent role in the N.A.A.C.P.'s early years. But Chavis appears unwilling to bend on this issue -- Farrakhan's strong following among young blacks can't be ignored. "There comes a time when even enemies must sit at the table to talk about the future," he tells the William Paterson crowd, even as he says later in his speech that the N.A.A.C.P. "doesn't retreat from its position" on anti-Semitism "because we sit down with Farrakhan."
Chavis has an ingenuous confidence in his ability to sway people, and one suspects that that extends to his relationship with Farrakhan -- or at least to his followers. There are few organizations besides the N.A.A.C.P., he says, "that pose an alternative to Louis Farrakhan." Nonetheless, his relationship with the Nation of Islam minister has drawn attention and energy away from his efforts to redirect the N.A.A.C.P. toward his philosophy of self-determination.
With nearly one out of every two black children living in poverty, Chavis knows that he can't afford such diversions. "We have millions of people because of economic inequality who are consigned to deprivation and degradation," he says. "And if you want to know what is the new beachhead, the new mandate of the civil rights movement as we move into the 21st century, it is the question of economic empowerment."
On the plane ride from Newark to Jackson, Chavis checks off what the N.A.A.C.P. has undertaken to bring capital into the black community. Agreements with more than 60 companies to hire and promote more blacks, as well as to buy supplies from black-owned vendors. Agreements with two banks to finance N.A.A.C.P.-staffed, neighborhood-based lending offices. An entrepreneurial training program for high-school and college students. The theme of next month's annual N.A.A.C.P. convention is "Accepting the Torch: New Initiatives for Community and Economic Empowerment."
"I'm a composite," he says, wanting to assure the old guard while appealing to the young. "Empowerment isn't about choosing between separatism and integration.
Not everyone agrees. One outraged N.A.A.C.P. member, Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, is mounting a campaign to oust Chavis. "Our strategy should not be one of gilding the ghettos but opening up the suburbs to blacks," he argues. "The N.A.A.C.P. should help students integrate white colleges. Instead they're screaming and yelling about saving black colleges."
Chavis's most difficult challenge, however, may come from within the N.A.A.C.P., as some of the 64 board members have protested his efforts to build alliances with more radical blacks. "We are a mainstream, integrationist civil rights organization," says Joe Madison, a board member and radio talk-show host. "We never have pitched a broad tent."
Moreover, William F. Gibson, the chairman and a South Carolina dentist, has long viewed himself as the N.A.A.C.P.'s true chief, according to some people close to the organization. When Chavis was appointed executive director, the N.A.A.C.P. officially referred to the appointment as a "partnership" between Chavis, Gibson and the board.
"Clearly there's a struggle for control," says one insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Gibson says that is "a myth." He adds, "We talk two or three times a week; our philosophies of running this organization are parallel." Nonetheless, differences between the board and Chavis have become public enough that a recent N.A.A.C.P. news release made a point of affirming the board's support for Chavis.
"I'm going to steady the course of the ship and keep going forward; I'm not going to do battle." says Chavis, who refuses to discuss publicly his relations with Gibson and the board.
ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON in late April in Jackson, Miss., Chavis leads 15,000 blacks, most of them college students, on a three-mile protest march from Jackson State University to the Capitol. It begins to rain, first a slight drizzle and then an unrelenting downpour. A sea of umbrellas unfolds. But not for Chavis, who, despite the casual dress of his brethren -- T-shirts, jeans and sneakers -- is in a gray suit and wing tips.
Unprotected and clutching a blue N.A.A.C.P. cap in his hand, Chavis marches, his body erect as a young marine's, his gaze fixed straight ahead. He seems invigorated by the warm rain. It is as if he sees this small act of nature as a test of his commitment, of his perseverance, of his capacity not to punk out. It is as if he is girding himself for further downpours.

HEADLINE: 72 Hours of Iceland (On New York Time)

BYLINE: By Peter Passell; Peter Passell writes on economics and other subjects for The Times.

 BODY:
Hmm. . . . Where to go this weekend? The Robertsons invited us to the Berkshires. But their furniture is covered with cat hair, and all they ever want to do is ransack the flea markets for Fiestaware.
Some guy in accounting was talking up a new bed-and-breakfast near Brattleboro. But the last time we tried one of those, the towels smelled of mildew and the syrup on the pancakes was strictly Log Cabin. 
 Well, then, how about a weekend in Iceland?
Yes, Iceland.
It costs a bit more -- well, a lot more -- but the flight doesn't take much longer than driving to the Hamptons on a Friday afternoon. And even three days in this pristine Scandinavian outpost perched amid glaciers, volcanoes, hot springs and waterfalls beats any number of the same-old, same-old getaways. And if you do it the way I did, you won't even have any jet lag to endure.
Here's the strategy: Take Icelandair's red-eye, which leaves J.F.K. every night of the week at 8:50 P.M. Formalities are a breeze at Keflavik, surely the most hassle-free international airport in the world. Then taxi straight to Reykjavik (glancing only occasionally at the lava-blasted moonscape along the road) and take a long nap.
The idea is not to fight the four-hour time change in summer but to ignore it, eating and sleeping by the New York clock. That turns out to be a cinch in the land of the midnight sun, since many restaurants in Reykjavik stay open till 11 P.M. or midnight to accommodate revelers.
Where to sleep? Icelandair's own hotels are pleasantly anonymous -- and cheap if booked as part of a package. But the freshly restored Hotel Borg is a treat: a prewar Art Deco building with a good restaurant and a sushi chef from Tokyo. (Even if you don't stay there, check out the racy decor in the restrooms.) Or consider the Hotel Odinsve, a calm and airy little place that, like much of Iceland, looks as if it were decorated by Ikea.
O.K., now it's noon, local time, and you are rested and ready to roll. Where to? You might head for any of a dozen farms outside Reykjavik for a leisurely ride on a pint-sized Icelandic horse. Trekking with these gentle creatures is said to be a fine way to get into the mood of the brooding valleys near the capital. I prefer pedals or motors, so I headed to the closest big glacier, the Myrdalsjokull, some 600 square miles of ice that covers a dormant volcano two hours southeast of Reykjavik.
In the winter, Benedykt Bragason organizes cross-country odysseys for snowmobilers frustrated by the lack of roaming room back home. In summer, he offers novices a chance to skim the glacier's hills and dales at warp speed.
The first hour of glacier-mobiling took pure concentration, learning to control the howling machine with a combination of throttle and body English as I followed Bragason's track through the snow. Once I was into the rhythm, it was like downhill skiing turbocharged: 95 percent thrill, 5 percent terror plus glorious vistas of the snowfields. Bragason commands $140 for two hours in the saddle. You can phone Snowmobile Expeditions at 011-354-1-682-310.
Back in Reykjavik, it's dinner at 10. The sushi-sashimi combo at the Hotel Borg is good, and -- unlike other restaurant food in Iceland -- a bargain. Afterward, there's time for a walk through the twilight, buttoning up against the chill of the island's springlike summer.
First impressions of this city of 100,000 aren't favorable: too much concrete, too little history. It's not that Reykjavik has bulldozed its past. There just wasn't much of it until Iceland struck it rich on fish exports after World War II. But the town, blissfully free of street crime, litter, pollution and psychotic drivers, does grow on you.
Don't miss the waterfront, where trim little fishing boats prepare for sea and larger whaling vessels wait in mothballs for the green light to kill Willy. Window-shopping turns up overpriced European clothes and ultrawarm Icelandic woolens. Puzzle over the surprising architectural consequences of substituting corrugated steel for more expensive wood siding. Painted, it is Lego-like charming; unpainted, it catches the light at sunset to produce an unearthly glow. The swans on the Tjnorin, the springfed pond in the center of town, are ravenous. Bring bread.
And if it's birds you want to see, along with the detritus of an active volcano, the place to go is the Westman Islands, an easy day tour from Reykjavik by commuter plane. Heimaey, the largest of the islands, was nearly buried by lava during an eruption in 1973. A third of the houses and a handful of farms are now buried under a pile of steaming stones and cinders that towers some 700 feet above the town of 5,000 hardy souls.
It was fun to climb the lava mountain on foot, pausing at the top for a candy bar and great view of the local daredevil motorcyclists, who bounce off the walls of the crater like skateboarders at a Santa Monica playground. Cruising the islands later, our local tour boat cozies up to seafront cliffs and inches into black lava caves lined crevice-to-crevice with nests.
Cutesy-poo puffins, which the unsentimental Icelanders net as game, are the prize attraction. But I was equally charmed by guillemots, diving birds all suited up in black and white, like ushers at a wedding. And a pod of killer whales hunting herring left me awestruck.
So that's two days which leaves part of a third before taking the late-afternoon plane back to New York.
White-water enthusiasts might want to get up a little early to make the trip to Gullfoss, a major waterfall not far from the 1,000-year-old ruins of Iceland's first republican assembly. I chose a more leisurely drive in the direction of the airport, through the windswept lava fields of the Reykjanes Peninsula.
Stop first at Krisuvik, where sulfurous gases bubble up from the gray mud and a vent in the rock has been blowing boiling water into the sky for as long as anyone can remember. But save the best -- or at least the weirdest -- for last.
At first glance, the Blue Lagoon seems to be the chemical waste-water pond for the smoke-belching industrial plant beside it. That's just what it is, but the smoke coming from the stacks is harmless steam, and the waste is a benign mixture of hot water and powder-blue mud from a geothermal electricity plant. Take a dip (towels and suits are for rent) and watch Icelandic teen-agers cavort in what might have been the set for an Antonioni movie. If you're as lucky as I was, you'll see one of the periodic gatherings of the Miss Iceland contestants practicing their smiles.
Is a lightning visit to Iceland worth the $1,000-plus price, not to mention the 10-hour round trip in a Boeing 757?
As a soul-cleanser, it sure beats the ritual luxuries of the pleasure palaces closer to New York. And besides, when was the last time you visited a place so strange that the phone book is alphabetized by first names?

HEADLINE: STAGE VIEW;
On Stage, Survival Of the Fizziest

BYLINE: By DAVID RICHARDS 

 BODY:
IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN AS THE fabulous invalid and the Great White Way, but we may have to start calling it Six Flags Over Broadway.
While there has always been a raffish, thrill-seeking side to theatergoing, the distinction between Broadway and a theme park grew decidedly narrower during the 1993-94 season. 
 It wasn't just because the Walt Disney Company came to town, commandeered the Palace Theater with the stage version of one of its biggest animated features, "Beauty and the Beast," turned the lobby into a mammoth souvenir boutique and proclaimed its intentions of renovating a theater of its very own on 42d Street. Nor was it just because the producers of "Grease!" painted the Eugene O'Neill Theater shocking pink, scrawled some of the show's mindless lyrics on the facade and then, to complete a dubious effect, piped 1950's rock-and-roll hits out onto the sidewalk.
Still, as signs go, those were clear and unequivocal. You bought your ticket, took your seat and went on a ride. The seats just didn't move.
The season was woefully short on quality, although the 48th annual Tony Awards, broadcast from the Gershwin Theater tonight (on CBS at 9), will try to convince viewers otherwise. It was, however, long on glitz, special effects, flashing lights and scenery outperforming the performers -- all in the service of the enduring American fallacy that bigger is, if not better, at least better for box office.
To a degree, that has always been so. Ziegfeld didn't forge a name by shaving corners, after all, and it has been more than a decade since "Cats" launched the vogue for the megamusical (which costs megabucks and, presumably, weighs a megaton). Still, it used to be that spectacle was only a part of what Broadway offered its customers. Now it is very nearly everything, and the pressure to go for broke can be felt in the dramas and one-person shows too.
That "Wonderful Tennessee," Brian Friel's imperfect but questing play about three Irish couples experiencing a collective middle-aged crisis, was the first dramatic flop of the Broadway season was sadly prophetic. Ireland's greatest living playwright was writing about the unslaked thirst we all have for the spiritual or, as one character defined it fumblingly: "What is beyond language. The inexpressible. The ineffable." Broadway is no longer particularly receptive to the ineffable. The effable has become its specialty in the mid-90's.
In lieu of the ever more elusive theatrical magic, we get magic tricks, which are far easier to engineer. At the end of "Beauty and the Beast," the lifeless body of the beast (Terrence Mann) rises off the castle floor, spins in midair like a propeller and emerges from the ordeal as a suitably handsome prince. Understandably, everybody gasps, although it's merely the latest development in stage machinery that has already brought us helicopters lifting off and chandeliers crashing down.
Leave it to Ricky Jay, the charming sleight-of-hand artist whose one-man show "Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants" was a runaway Off Broadway hit, to demonstrate that magic is not a trick. It's the irresistibly beguiling patter surrounding the trick. The mind has to be seduced before the eye can be amazed. Broadway seemed to get it backward this season. As if to underscore the point, Mr. Jay's 52 assistants were a deck of playing cards.
Size and money do not necessarily preclude quality, of course. The opening montage of "Carousel," the season's most artful musical revival, gives you the impression you're 10 years old again and standing inside a kaleidoscope. With each turn of the revolving stage, the director, Nicholas Hytner, alters the picture, until the gloom of a 19th-century New England mill has been supplanted by the giddy, come-hither colors of a traveling carnival.
Ian MacNeil's surrealistic set for "An Inspector Calls," which depicts the mansion of the wealthy Birling family as a glittery doll house isolated in a cobblestone moor, puts J. B. Priestley's socialist thriller on dazzlingly fresh footing. And Diana Rigg's rigorously intelligent performance in the title role of "Medea" certainly justifies the final coup de theatre, in which the rusted metal walls of the palace crash to the ground, leaving her triumphantly profiled against the racing clouds.
Writing down to the wire, Tony Kushner successfully delivered "Perestroika," the brilliant concluding installment of "Angels in America," his epic examination of AIDS and an ailing land and the front-runner to win tonight's Tony for best play. Everything about this two-part work has proved large -- its emotions, its themes, its running time (seven hours). Largest of all, though, is the compassion the playwright extends to each of his characters -- Roy Cohn, the drama's archfiend, included. The production is not without its own plethora of special effects (including an angel who somersaults in mid-flight), but the drama would probably be equally gripping on a bare stage. To prosper in today's climate, however, "Angels in America," lauded to the skies, has to be an eye-popping event as well.
Why else would "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," Anna Deavere Smith's compelling investigation of the rioting triggered by the police beating of Rodney King, come with sophisticated videotape, glide-on-glide-off scenery and space-age lighting? The real fascination is how Ms. Smith, playing nearly 40 real-life characters, changes -- no, mutates -- from one character to the next. No scenery needed.
Unfortunately, to envision (and promote) theatergoing as an event is to acknowledge that it is no longer a habit. While there will always be people to shell out $75 for a ticket (next season's top price for "Show Boat"), chances are they'll do so only once or twice a year. Under the circumstances, they expect to be bowled over. The clear loser in all this, as it has been for years, is the straight play, which, far more than the musical, lures audiences with intangibles -- the lies of the mind, the shifts of the heart, silence and suggestion. With the exception of "Perestroika," none of the Tony-nominated dramas -- "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," Arthur Miller's "Broken Glass" and Robert Schenkkan's two-part epic "The Kentucky Cycle" -- acquired must-see status, for all their respective virtues. And without it, survival is impossible.
The underlying danger here is that while producers desperately want to give spectators their money's worth, no one seems to know what that means any longer. Some of the indecision is reflected in the fact that more than half of Broadway's 13 musicals this season were revivals, and there were almost as many old plays (10) as new (12). When you're unsure of the future, the tendency is to fall back on the past and refurbish it.
To my mind, Christopher Plummer's wickedly mischievous performance in the Roundabout Theater Company's "No Man's Land" (four characters, one set) was worth anyone's money. Increasingly, the strategy is simply to give audiences more to gape at. Theatergoing becomes an adjunct of tourism, indoor sightseeing, if you will. To say that the revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," once a humble school oratorio, looked like a Las Vegas stage show this time around vastly understated the case. It looked like a Las Vegas hotel.
Every square inch of "Beauty and the Beast" has been profligately illustrated, and you could no doubt mount an Off Broadway show for the price of one of Ann Hould-Ward's extravagant costumes. The musical is doing brisk business, however, and after an especially snowy winter that turned the theater district into an arctic wasteland some weeks, the business is highly appreciated. Since Disney is also a major player in the long-awaited redevelopment of 42d Street (the New Amsterdam Theater will be its Broadway base), "Beauty and the Beast" is officially held to be a good thing and its Tony nomination for best musical is applauded.
At the same time, the show is a scary harbinger. Broadway still likes to think that it is receptive to individual artistic initiative, and the corporate hubris of Team Disney -- determined to have a hit, and hang the costs -- was troublesome. In the Palace lobby, $25 will buy you a black sweatshirt with the "Beauty and the Beast" logo and the inscription "My first Broadway show." The unmistakable implication is that Disney will attract a whole new category of spectators, young and old, who have evinced no interest in theater as it has been practiced up to now.
If "Passion," Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's study of obsessive love, wins the Tony tonight (my bet), it will be as much an anti-Hollywood vote as an endorsement of the downbeat musical itself, which is flawed. Better to reward flawed Sondheim, the feeling goes, than to throw open the town to "The Little Mermaid" live in an onstage tank. "Passion" is, at least, an adult musical that allows Donna Murphy to give a spellbinding performance, as a sickly 19th-century Italian woman, consumed by her love for a dashing soldier. You can discuss it afterward. "Beauty and the Beast," whatever its visual appeal, is very nearly content-free.
Under duress, the Tony nominating committee coughed up two additional candidates for best new musical. One, "A Grand Night for Singing," was no musical at all but an expanded nightclub revue of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs. The other, "Cyrano," would have been a huge hit, if breathtakingly opulent costumes made for high drama. But they don't, so it wasn't, and $8 million went up in battle smoke. The producers of "The Red Shoes" managed to lose another $8 million, by massacring a beloved movie, while the wizards behind "The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public" spent $7 million for neon and the privilege of financing Broadway's most vulgar flop in years. The "Whorehouse" debacle was all the more disheartening because its co-director and co-choreographer was Tommy Tune, long thought to be one of the few remaining Broadway showmen capable of combining splash and class.
CHEERING NEWS OF ANY SORT was in short supply this season. Off Broadway generated what little there was. None proved more satisfying than the rehabilitation of Edward Albee, heralded as Broadway's savior in the 1960's, which now seem light-years away, as does the Broadway he was supposed to save. Mr. Albee began the season as a critical pariah and ended it, at age 66, with his third Pulitzer Prize for drama. "Three Tall Women," the playwright's acerbic profile of his autocratic mother on her deathbed, staged by the Vineyard Theater, was responsible for the turnaround. But an industrious Off Off Broadway troupe, the Signature Theater Company, helped by devoting its entire season to Albee plays, most of which had never been seen before in New York.
The most provocative works -- "Pterodactyls," Nicky Silver's loopy family drama; "All in the Timing," David Ives's antic one-acts; "Lonely Planet," Steven Dietz's lovely play about AIDS and friendship; "The America Play," Suzan-Lori Park's cryptic but hypnotic meditation on black history, and "Suburbia," Eric Bogosian's scorching study of lost youth -- turned up Off Broadway or in not-for-profit theaters. But even some usually dependable not-for-profit institutions (Playwrights Horizons and the financially strapped Circle Repertory Company) drifted artistically.
And the much anticipated renaissance of the Joseph Papp Public Theater that was to take place under its new producer, George C. Wolfe, had yet to happen, partly because Broadway continued to exercise a strong claim on Mr. Wolfe's time and energy. Both "Perestroika" and "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," which he directed, had protracted birthing pains.
Lincoln Center Theater alone appeared capable of combining innovation and tradition, Broadway's proclivity for spectacle and an Off Broadway spirit of adventure without losing its soul or developing a split personality. Its revival of Robert Sherwood's 1938 drama "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" featured Sam Waterston in a stovepipe hat, and 48 -- count 'em, 48 -- supporting actors, unthinkable for a straight play by today's commercial economics.
It's hard to imagine that "Carousel" will ever look as darkly beautiful as it does right now at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. What's more, under the umbrella of the Festival of New American Plays, Lincoln Center produced some stunning fare downstairs in the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater: Mr. Bogosian's "Suburbia"; "The Lights," Howard Korder's ferocious canvas of urban rot, and "Hello Again," Michael John LaChiusa's chronicle of seduction.
Mr. LaChiusa's smart, beguilingly world-weary work was the best original musical of the season, although ineligible for Tony honors, since it wasn't staged in a Broadway house. Stay tuned, however. A lot of healthy nurturing was going on at Lincoln Center Theater. The organization's sense of purpose and its eagerness to get on with the future merely underscored the wavering and confusion of Broadway.
Because escalating the stakes is Broadway's habitual way of dealing with a crisis, it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that the forthcoming season will see the big grow bigger, the stagecraft more amazing and the hype shriller, just as the thin patch of ground between the blockbuster hit and the instant flop will continue to shrink. Already a contest is shaping up between two super-musicals -- the revival of "Show Boat" directed by Harold Prince and Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard." "Show Boat" has one of the all-time classic scores. "Sunset Boulevard" has one of the all-time spectacular sets. "Show Boat" has a cast of 71. "Sunset Boulevard" has Glenn Close in the role of a lifetime. Each, we're being told in ad campaigns, will be unlike anything we've ever seen before.
Yet, this quest for the experience to end all experiences is suicidal, a death wish in disguise. A taste for sensationalism may be built into the American temperament. But catering to it will not save Broadway. One of Mr. Friel's characters inadvertently offered another solution. Replenishment, she speculated, as she gazed wistfully out to sea, may have something to do with recapturing "the wonderful, the sacred, the mysterious."
It's just possible.

Her Mission: To Stir Up More Fun

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
IN 1964, RUDOLF BING, THE GENERAL MANAGER of the Metropolitan Opera, said of the newly formed Lincoln Center that it was "deteriorating into a free-for-all jungle." The next five years saw almost constant conflicts among the Met, the New York City Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet, organizations that had at great risk and expense made the experimental arts center their new home. In 1967, John D. Rockefeller 3d, the chairman of the center's board, noted "feelings of mistrust, fear, competition and even bitterness" among the center's constituents. With recurring budgetary crises, it often looked doubtful that the institution that had created the phrase "performing arts" would survive.
Tomorrow, Beverly Sills -- retired soprano, virtuoso fund-raiser, ebullient former director of the New York City Opera and member of the board of the Metropolitan Opera -- will assume the post Rockefeller once filled, heading the Lincoln Center board. Miss Sills recently discussed her latest career move in her comfortable ninth-floor office in the center's new Rose Building, overlooking the complex. 
 "Nat came to me and said, 'I think we should be having a lot more fun,' " she explained, referring to Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center. "He felt I could bring a little more cheer to the constituents, so they could feel they had a friend in court. I can see both sides."
Cheeriness may be too much to hope for. Problems of competition still exist, particularly as Lincoln Center itself becomes more active in fund-raising and programming; it presents more than 300 events annually and raises more than $16 million a year. But Miss Sills need not fear a free-for-all. The constituents cooperated in Mozart bicentennial celebrations, and Lincoln Center is now far from the fledgling operation that once seemed to lurch precariously from season to season. Its budget has grown from $11.2 million in 1975 and $30.5 million in 1985 to $56.2 million in the coming fiscal year. The center has become precisely what its founding president, William Schuman, predicted it would: the "new establishment" in the arts.
Miss Sills clearly relishes the opportunity to jump in. She praised Mr. Leventhal and expressed satisfaction at the financial condition of the center, which recently completed its largest construction project, the $160 million Rose Building, which houses dormitories for the Juilliard School as well as offices. She discussed new compositions, praising Hugo Weisgal's "Esther," which was performed last fall by the City Opera. She waxed enthusiastic about the future supertitle system at the Met, calling it "the best I've ever seen," and tentatively revived the recurring notion of a chamber-opera-size mini-Met. She dismissed reports of the center's plans to replace Mostly Mozart as "rumors," so they may remain just that. But Miss Sills, who will work closely with Mr. Leventhal, would not disclose her ambitions. The day-to-day struggle for financial survival during her City Opera tenure, she said, taught her to keep them to herself.
But any ambitions must take into account the profound ways the performing arts have been changed as a result of the center's success. Those changes have not always been for the better. The Met may have an acoustically satisfying house, but its stage is gargantuan, and its lobbies are uncomfortable and contorted; it nearly bankrupted the company and permanently decreed an oversize budgetary and artistic scale. Avery Fisher Hall was built because Carnegie Hall was to be torn down, leaving the Philharmonic homeless; the hall's acoustic history, which may finally be reaching a satisfactory conclusion, has been an epic of disillusionment. And as for the City Opera. . . .
"Listen," Miss Sills said about the company that was once her musical home, "you're looking at the girl who said, 'We should never have left City Center.' We should have asked the city for possession." She cited City Center's small downstairs theater for workshop performances, the more manageable budget, the character the 55th Street location gave the company -- all traded for another acoustically troubled building that now costs $80,000 a week even when it is idle. That move also had artistic consequences. But there is no turning back, and Miss Sills hastened to point out the benefits: the attractiveness of a central location, the clout of leadership, the possibility of an international impact.
OVERALL, HOWEVER, THE CHANGE IN economic scale has created a change in substance. The stakes are higher; fewer chances are taken. Mr. Leventhal may have begun to focus attention on these problems. The center added another small hall to the city with the Walter Reade Theater. Jane S. Moss, a vice president at the center, is attempting to design new programming. And Miss Sills said she wanted to expand educational programs, attract teen-agers with dances and get young listeners into the halls so they could find out that the center is "not as intimidating, not as formal, not as stuffy a place as they think."
More fun? Perhaps, but in the search for immediacy and responsiveness, the center can also risk diluting its artistic mission. Similar problems face many musical institutions that have grown up on the Lincoln Center model.
"I always stretched myself, taking risks," Miss Sills said of her singing years. She preferred learning difficult roles to repeating old ones. What she most misses, she added, is opening a new score and beginning work. The project she has undertaken this time requires a different kind of risk and virtuosity; her words are just the cheerful overture.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Laying Out the Route to a Fairer Assessment System

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
DURING their study of how to reform the New York City tax assessment system last year, members of a commission appointed by former Mayor David N. Dinkins came upon a steep cliff. They then proved themselves no mountaineers.
The steep cliff, to use the description of Stanley E. Grayson, chairman of the Real Property Tax Reform Commission, is the underassessment and undertaxation of Class 1 property -- 600,000 parcels most of them one- to three-family houses -- relative to other property. Higher effective tax rates on this class of property are widely considered a prime condition of moving toward equity in the property tax system. 
 Effective tax rates are the ratio of taxes imposed to the market value of property. New York's jerry-built assessment system over the years has produced widening disparities in effective rates. To make recommendations for improving the system there would have to have been a "consensus on objectives" in the commission, Mr. Grayson said. So the commission made none.
The fact that Rudolph W. Giuliani, as mayoral candidate, disdained the study hardly encouraged the Dinkins appointees to make a set of recommendations that would inevitably stir up controversy. So it made none, limiting itself to a description of how the problem evolved, the views of various parties and a financial analysis of alternative solutions.
Even if there were agreement on the need to raise effective tax rates taxes on homeowners as a class, there are other issues. The rates vary greatly within classes of property, as well as between classes. One reason in Class 2 (rentals, co-ops and most condominiums) is that co-ops and most condominiums are by law assessed in relation to their value as rentals.
Therefore, a very low valuation occurs for older co-ops in older but prime locations where rent regulation has held rents -- and therefore building income, from which an assessment is derived -- below market levels. Should co-ops and condominiums be assessed in relation to their sale value, or their value as market-rate rentals, instead?
There is also the question of how classes should be realigned. Should rentals be classed with residential property, or with commercial property on the ground that rentals and commercial properties are both income-producing. And should a reformed approach begin with a total reassessment of all property at 100 percent of market value? Varying tax rates could then be set for different types of property.
The present system, with assessment caps for Class 1 property and certain categories of smaller buildings within Class 2, promotes inequity within the classes. Over time, market values rise, but more so in better neighborhoods than in poorer neighborhoods. The caps prevent the property-tax system from reflecting this change.
In any new system that implies large tax increases for some payers, the increased tax liability could be capped in any given year. The figure most frequently mentioned for houses is 10 percent.
But that is still higher than the average increase in recent years, and homeowner representatives oppose any new system that would bring higher effective rates. "My constituents feel they are overtaxed already relative to the services they get," said Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Democrat representing northeastern Queens communities.
This month the City Council is setting the budget for fiscal 1995, which starts July 1. The budget will determine the level of property taxes that will be set to achieve the necessary revenue.
What is already anticipated is that the class share of the tax burden will change, the result of changes in the relative market value of property. The market studies used are those done by the New York State Board of Equalization and Assessment.
The city has disputed the board's findings, which are adjusted from data collected in 1991, and the figures are not yet final. But legislators expect they will in the end increase the tax burden for all classes except Class 4 (commercial property) which will decrease about 4.8 percent.
Other classes will increase to the maximum 5 percent allowed by state law in any one year. Two years ago, when the study implied the need for a major increase in Class 2's share (8 percent had it been uncapped), the Legislature stepped in. It capped the increase in Class 2's share at 2 percent and allocated the balance between Classes 1 and 3 (utilities).
ORGANIZED co-op leaders pressed the campaign for assessment reform in the wake of the Class 2 increases. They have been stung by the size of tax increases in Manhattan locations for several years. Part of these increases are the result of the culmination of tax benefits under the J-51 program, which created apartments through conversions of older commercial buildings in the 70's and early 80's. Another factor was the general rise in land assessments in many Manhattan locations in the 80's.
The Finance Commissioner in the Dinkins administration, Carol O'Cleireacain, also was a voice for reform. She set in motion many administrative reforms, several aimed at educating taxpayers about how the system works.
Is there a path to reform that would distribute the tax burden more fairly? In New York City, the variation in effective tax rates appears to be greater than it is anywhere in the country. Businesses pay more and homeowners pay less.
The study found that the average homeowner paid $1,400 a year while the average house is worth $180,000. That produces an effective tax rate of 0.77 percent in Class 1 in the current fiscal year. In single-family neighborhoods outside New York City, it is more typical for the effective rate to be close to 2 percent. At a rate of 1.8 percent, for example, a house worth $180,000 in the suburbs would be paying an annual tax of $3,240.
The effective tax rate on Class 2 property in New York overall was 2.50 percent last year, the study commission found. But disparity within the class is enormous. Many valuable co-ops in prime Manhattan locations pay effective rates as low or lower than those in private homes. Larger rentals as a subcategory of Class 2 pay 4.58 percent. For Class 4 property the effective rate is 4.74 percent.
The reform commission explored many scenarios based on the principle of putting all residential property in one category and all commercial property in another. The Real Estate Board of New York, representing commercial owners, contended that that should be done only if a fixed, permanent ratio of effective tax rates were established between the classes. Otherwise they would be vulnerable to the inclination of legislatures to systematically shift the burden to commercial property, a tendency well proved by experience.
Under one plausible scenario for a two-class system, an effective tax rate of 1.56 would be established for the new residential class, consisting of all houses, rentals, co-ops and condominiums. That rate is a blend of the existing rates for various forms of residential property.
To achieve revenue neutrality under this scenario, the new commercial class would have to have an effective rate of 4.49 percent, creating a ratio of commercial-to-residential tax burden of 2.88 to 1.
"The total levy from the current Class 1 would double, with the tax on a typical $200,000 house rising from $1,557 to $3,124," the tax commission says. "The overall levy on current Class 2 properties would decline by 37.5 percent."
The magnitude of the decline results mainly from the benefit this would give to rental property. Older rentals in low-income neighborhoods pay high effective tax rates.
For those residential owners whose taxes would rise, the increase in tax liability could be capped at 10 percent a year. The homeowners paying $1,550 a year would never see an increase of more than $150.
But 10 percent is unacceptable, said Councilman Leffler. He maintained that equity might be established in residential property while keeping rentals in the commercial category, where taxes should be a "separate issue."
MANY high-end co-ops in exclusive Manhattan neighborhoods might also pay higher taxes in a two-class system. Assessors would have to be freed of the requirement that comparability to rental buildings is the only method permitted for valuing co-op buildings, now the case under Section 581 of the Real Property Tax Law. If Section 581 remained in place, homeowners would pick up an even larger share of the burden.
But taxes in many other co-ops, especially outside Manhattan, would probably be decreased in a the two-class system.
If rentals were omitted from the merger with Class 1 property, and only co-ops and condominiums are taken, there becomes a 22 percent reduction on the levy on co-ops and condominiums, the tax commission found. Then the tax on a $200,000 house goes up to $2,744 instead of $3,124. But that approach fails to correct some of the worst features of the present system, overtaxation of rentals.
The virtues of reform in the assessment system could be far reaching. "As the system works now there are excessively high taxes on less affluent New Yorkers who live in older rental buildings and older co-ops in less affluent neighborhoods," said Dick Netzer, professor of economic and public administration at New York University. Thousands of low-end rentals should be taken off the tax rolls entirely, in his view.
He also noted that the current system of assessment caps within classes works to the disadvantage of people living in poorer neighborhoods -- by definition those where market values are not rising as fast as they are in other neighborhoods. Assessors bound by the cap rules cannot take the relative changes in neighborhood values into account.
But as the history of rent regulation in New York demonstrates, reforms that hit voters in the pocketbook are slow in coming. There is no evidence yet that Mayor Giuliani will get behind assessment reform.

HEADLINE: Reading the Giuliani Spending Blueprint

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
WHILE Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's first capital budget has drawn the most attention for what it doesn't finance, like a new Police Academy in the Bronx, the $5.294 billion spending plan does include dozens of significant real estate projects.
These range from the enhancement of neighborhood institutions (a new Flushing branch of the Queens Borough Public Library) to the creation of entirely new neighborhoods (the first streets, sewers and parkland in the Queens West development on the Hunters Point waterfront). 
 Money has been earmarked to plan, design or build major new courthouses in the Melrose section of the Bronx, lower Manhattan, downtown Brooklyn and Jamaica, Queens. There is money for the reconstruction of the Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn. The long awaited renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater on West 42d Street is funded in the plan, as is the acquisition by the city of privately owned buildings nearby where pornography outlets still thrive.
Because the capital budget deals with construction, reconstruction and acquisition, it profoundly influences the shape of the city, even though it is overshadowed by the high-stakes political battles over the operating budget, which governs day-to-day spending.
The City Council is to adopt both budgets in coming days. It is not expected to make many significant changes to the capital plan that Mr. Giuliani proposed in April, although it may well restore the new Police Academy, for which the Mayor allocated exactly zero dollars.
Last week, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx said the prospects for reviving the Police Academy were "pretty good," adding that the $230 million project "may be scaled back a little bit" in the process.
Playing it closer to the vest, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whose support would be critical, would say only that the academy "was in the budget last year and clearly is still the subject of negotiations this year."
With hundreds of commitments that stretch out over years, if not decades, the capital budget is less susceptible than the operating budget to dramatic reshaping, either by the Council or by a Mayor who has held office only six months. So the first Giuliani budget is, in part, an extension of the spending plans from the mayoralties of David N. Dinkins and even Edward I. Koch.
"The primary goal of the capital program, as it has been revised by this administration, is to achieve a state of good repair in the city's capital plant," said Mark Page, deputy director and general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget. "It's focused very strongly on things like bridges but it also includes money for mundane but necessary items like strengthening the floors in firehouses so they can actually support the weight of trucks."
"The political appeal of a capital program is to open new facilities," he said, "and there's actually little of that here. Even when you're talking about new facilities, you're talking about court facilities that we are required by the state to build or prison construction for increased capacity."
UNDER Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget, New York would commit almost one-third of its capital budget next year on city operations and facilities -- courthouses, sanitation garages and plants, prisons, municipal office buildings, police stations, parks and fire houses. In all, such projects would amount to $1.633 billion, up from $1.052 billion in 1990, making this the largest major category of spending in the capital budget.
"The first capital budget of the Giuliani administration is an activist budget that will give the people of the city many of the facilities that have so long been lacking," said William J. Diamond, commissioner of the General Services Department, which would develop many of these projects on behalf of other agencies.
At the same time, Mr. Diamond acknowledged that "every year there are more mandates" that dictate the nature of capital spending. But he said the city was "taking charge of what has to be done" in building courthouses and prisons, as well as in renovating structures to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
Housing and economic development projects, on the other hand, would amount to $627 million, down from $816 million five years ago, making this the smallest major category. (Other categories include water and sewer projects, mass transit, bridges, highways, schools and hospitals.)
During his term, Mr. Dinkins began to shrink New York's capital budget to take pressure off the operating budget, which pays the debt service on the bonds used to finance capital projects. Mr. Page said Mayor Giuliani "has followed through on the commitment made last year to reduce the size of the capital program."
Indeed, the Giuliani capital budget for the fiscal year 1995, which begins next month, is about 25 percent less than the budget forecast for this year by the Dinkins administration, said Stuart Klein, associate director of the city's budget office. The 25 percent reduction does not apply to certain projects like hospitals, water supply and sewers.
Smaller capital budgets have strained the resources and tested the ingenuity of institutions that depend on city support, like the New York Public Library. It began an "Adopt-a-Branch" program in 1991, seeking private partners to supplement city funds.
The latest product of that partnership is the Sedgwick Branch Library at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (University Avenue) and East 176th Street in the Bronx. The small structure, designed by David W. Prendergast, is to open Tuesday.
Almost one-third of its $1.6 million cost was met by the Louis Calder Foundation. City funding came through Mr. Ferrer, using that portion of the capital budget -- 5 percent -- over which borough presidents are given discretion by the City Charter.
"We've had very little funding from the executive branch," said Catherine Carver Dunn, the library's vice president for government affairs. "Our capital funding has predominantly come from borough presidents and the City Council."
Mr. Ferrer said he tried to use his discretionary allocation as leverage. "The pot isn't big enough to create grand projects all by itself," he said. "The best strategic use is to induce the investment of other funds, both public and private."
The trend toward smaller capital budgets in which emphasis is shifted away from development is one that has been noticed approvingly by the Citizens Budget Commission, a private research and watchdog group. Its deputy research director, Brian Perlee, said: "The cutback of the capital program is something initially committed to by Mayor Dinkins in response to concerns by rating agencies. Mayor Giuliani has decided that's really the way to go."
Mr. Perlee cited the city's efforts to find ways to ship sludge out of state rather than building composting plants on Newtown Creek in Maspeth, Queens, and at Newark Bay on Staten Island. He also mentioned the Giuliani administration's push to lease space for schools rather than building anew.
"It seems to be a movement toward maintaining what we have," Mr. Perlee said. "In the long term, it'll end up saving the city money. It's a wise decision."
Others, like the New York Building Congress, see the trend as short-sighted.
"ATTEMPTING to preserve what we have by itself is simply not good enough," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the group, which includes builders, developers, contractors and architects.
He said the Giuliani budget was a "reasonable effort" that "fails on important counts: to keep the city in a state of good repair, to address an enormous capital needs backlog and to invest in our longterm future."
"It's business as usual with marginal modifications," Mr. Anderson said. "They're still spending billions for major social service, environmental, education and transportation projects and millions for economic development. That, to me, doesn't square with the administration's announced emphasis on economic development and jobs."
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan also warned that diminished capital investment for building new apartments and preserving existing units would "only worsen the city's longtime housing shortage and exacerbate homelessness."
In addition, Ms. Messinger said, "Cuts in capital spending for mass transit would make this an infinitely less attractive city for future business development."
In Brooklyn, the principal concern was the fate of the $1 billion Kings County Hospital Center reconstruction project, on which the Giuliani administration declared a moratorium in February in the midst of long delays and cost overruns. Last month, however, the Office of Management and Budget included Kings County in the capital plan.
"We're very hopeful that the project will proceed," said Greg Brooks, executive assistant to Borough President Howard Golden. "That is a critical capital project to the borough, to the health-care system and to the people who use the hospital. We were very pleased to see that it was included."
The reconstruction of the Queens Hospital Center is a "very high priority" in that borough, said Peter Magnani, Deputy Borough President of Queens, noting that the administration had allocated $220 million for the project in its four-year capital plan.
"We're very pleased that the Mayor included most of our high priorities," Mr. Magnani said. "We don't really have a problem with what's not included."
Another significant budget line, he said, was more than $14.5 million for the first phase of infrastructure at the enormous Queens West development.
The president of the Queens West Development Corporation, Rosina K. Abramson, said: "This is capital money that will leverage Federal money and private money."
Ground will be broken in the next couple of weeks, she said, for streets and sewers around the block where the first building, a 550-unit co-op apartment tower, is to be developed by M.O. Associates, an American and Japanese group, with mortgage insurance from the Federal Government.
Phase one also includes an entrance boulevard to the project from 48th Avenue, as well as a one-acre park between Fifth Street and Vernon Boulevard. "The new building will be tied to the existing community," Ms. Abramson said, "so it won't be a lone pioneer in the wilderness and so the existing community will have an immediate benefit."
OTHER economic development items in the capital plan include the 42d Street project, the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park in Washington Heights, pier reconstruction and the continuing renovation as a light-industry center of the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park.
As part of the courthouse program, there is money in the capital budget for a new civil and housing court on Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens; for a freestanding annex on State Street to the Brooklyn Central Court; for the first two phases of a "superblock" court complex between 161st and 163d Streets in the Bronx and for a new criminal court in lower Manhattan, perhaps atop an existing building at 80 Centre Street.
On a smaller scale, the budget for the coming fiscal year provides the first $8 million toward the $15 million Flushing Regional Branch Library, at Main Street and Kissena Boulevard, a glass-fronted structure designed by Polshek & Partners Architects.
City money only goes so far -- in this case, as far as the third floor of what is meant to be a four-story structure. The Queens Borough Public Library is seeking $6 million to build and equip the fourth floor as an Asian center, said a spokeswoman, Dianne Blancato. "The fourth story at this point is more of a vision than a reality," she said.
Perhaps the single most contested line in the capital budget is item No. PO-0205: "Construction of a New Police Training Facility, the Bronx . . . $0." Instead, there is a $10 million commitment for the redesign of the existing Police Academy in Manhattan.
"That's like putting money in a pile and setting fire to it," said Councilwoman Lucy Cruz of the Bronx, speaking of the plan to renovate the Manhattan structure, which is "obviously quite obsolete." Building the academy at East 153d Street, she said, was a priority both for the Bronx delegation and the black and Latino caucus.
The cause is also championed by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Its president, Bartholomew Voorsanger, said the Police Academy project had attracted international notice thanks to a design competition that was won by Peter Pran of Ellerbe Becket in association with Michael Fieldman & Partners.
"It sends a very difficult signal that the first thing that's cut is a building of such design distinction," Mr. Voorsanger said. "There has been a long, long policy of make-do in the city. The inventory of our public buildings is in a deplorable state which needs a huge capital investment. What was extraordinary was the possibility of lifting everyone's vision."

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

10-Year Battle Over Rent
 
Q On Aug. 1, 1984, my wife and I took out a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village at $1,100 a month. We then received apartment registration showing that the apartment was rent-stabilized. The previous (controlled) tenant had paid $184 a month. We filed a fair market rent appeal that Dec. 11. 
 The owner, a New York limited partnership, was notified of the appeal by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal and given time to respond. Their response showed no cause for extra rent increase, and in December 1989 (five years later) D.H.C.R. ordered the rent reduced and the overcharge refunded. By that time we were paying $1,361 a month, which was reduced to $399. Retroactive reductions brought the original lease down to $308 a month. Overcharges totaled more than $55,000.
The owner continued to attempt to collect the illegal rent, so we began withholding rent completely. At this time a lawyer stepped in with a verbal agreement to receive 20 percent to handle the recovery. He advised us to resume paying rent, as at least one of the owners was a "millionaire" and we were sure to receive the full amount plus interest.
After several months the owner did reduce the rent to the legal level. As we began paying rent again, we had withheld $4,400. There was no sign of the refund, however, and the owner began to file PARs (petitions for administrative review) with D.H.C.R. Following two PARs, the ruling stood.
Our lawyer then served a summons and complaint to the owner, and the New York State Supreme Court index number was obtained on April 4, 1990. The owner was then allowed to petition D.H.C.R. again.
After the filing of the third PAR, the owner proceeded to allow the obviously unprofitable building to go into receivership in July 1991, and apparently this dissolved the partnership, though it is not shown at the County Clerk's office as being dissolved. The final PAR was rejected in May 1992, with 60 days allowed for objections. No objection came from the now-silent partnership.
Around this time my lawyer decided to stop answering my calls. I could get no information from him by letter, either. Though it appeared to me that a request for judicial intervention could have been filed as of July 1992, I waited until the end of November 1993 before releasing him and filing the request myself.
This was served on the owner, who continued not to respond, and the case was then resolved by the Supreme Court. The owner was ordered to pay the full amount plus interest. Now, of course, I'm told by the owner's lawyer that no recovery can be made since the partnership was dissolved.
D.H.C.R. had made it clear that this ruling was binding on the owner who overcharged me; a free market rent appeal is not passed on to later owners. So, in order for the bank to sell the building, I didn't mind signing a document stating later owners would not be liable.
Was it legal for the partnership to dissolve without notice or settlement while this case was under way? Am I actually out $51,000? . . . Brad Bealmear, Manhattan
 
A Getting the money back will not be easy, said Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, but it is possible.
"If the prior landlord were a corporation, Mr. Bealmear probably could not succeed, but since the prior landlord was a limited partnership, if the general partners have money he has a viable judgment to pursue," Mr. Finder said. "The tenant's claim against the prior limited-partnership owner is not extinguished merely by reason of the alleged dissolution of a partnership. The dissolution does not eliminate the liability of the general partners and perhaps against the limited partners as well."
Enforcing the judgment against the partners, however, will not be easy. "Mr. Bealmear is first required to go after partnership assets before he can seek to go after the personal assets of the partners," Mr. Finder said. "Assuming the only partnership asset was the building, which they have since lost by foreclosure, the tenant will probably need some post-judgment discovery of the individual partners in order to try to locate their other assets."
That discovery can take the form of depositions of the partners or written interrogatories seeking written answers. "Depositions are more costly, because you have to pay a stenographer," Mr. Finder said, "but if cost is not an issue lawyers prefer depositions because that way the other side doesn't get a chance to nonspontaneously formulate their answers."
Although the D.H.C.R.'s position is that the current owner is not liable in this situation, Mr. Finder said there were a few court decisions that would support an action against the new owner. In addition, Mr. Bealmear might want to consult with a lawyer as to whether there is any impropriety in his previous lawyer's not responding to his calls and not taking aggressive action in the case.

HEADLINE: Vote in House Primary May Signal End of Era

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
THE Kean era in New Jersey Republican politics appeared to some Republicans to have ended last week in a bitterly fought primary for Congress in southern New Jersey, in which Assemblyman Frank A. LoBiondo of Vineland, a conservative, defeated a better-known moderate, State Senator Bill Gormley of Margate.
Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, the longtime leader of the party's moderate wing, had endorsed Mr. Gormley and campaigned for him over the final weekend of the campaign, but Mr. LoBiondo's strong opposition to taxes and big government carried the day. Mr. LoBiondo was able to tap into these core Republican issues after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman made them the hallmark of her victory last November. 
 In an interview after the primary election, Mr. Kean said that he was concerned about where New Jersey Republicans were headed and that he intended to become more involved again.
"I worry about the party ideologically," he said. "And I intend to get involved on that side, not on picking candidates.
"The party has to get more comfortable with people, including blacks," he said. "I think this is the best time to begin addressing some things that are not being addressed."
He said the trend toward low taxes and tight government had always been a tenet of the party, but added the party could find itself too far to one side politically if it did not also recognize a responsibility to try to improve social conditions for all citizens. He said Mrs. Whitman was basically from the wing of the party that is economically conservative but socially moderate.
The race in the Second District, which includes Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties and parts of Burlington and Gloucester, became the most closely watched of the party contests for House nominations after Representative William J. Hughes, a conservative Democrat who won his first term in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, decided against running again this year.
Republicans say they have an excellent chance in November to recapture the seat they held before Mr. Hughes's victory, but Louis N. Magazzu, a Vineland lawyer who won the Democratic nomination, said he planned to keep the seat in the Democratic column.
Stephen A. Salmore, a consultant to the LoBiondo campaign, said, "We were able to picture the race as one between a Democrat and Republican, with LoBiondo running as the 'real' Republican."
But conservatives have a history of running well in Republican primaries and then losing in the general election when independents, who make up about half of the state's registered voters, go to the polls. Mr. Gormley's campaign aides were worried about moving too far to the right to try to defeat Mr. LoBiondo and then having a difficult time returning to the middle of the political spectrum for the fall.
Brendan Thomas Byrne, the New Jersey Democratic chairman, said he was happy that Mr. LoBiondo had won the nomination rather than Mr. Gormley, who he believes would have been a more formidable candidate in a general election.
Mr. Byrne also said he did not agree with the post-election analysis that depicts Mr. Magazzu as the underdog, and pointed out that President Bill Clinton carried the district by a narrow margin against President George Bush and that Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who is on the ballot again this year, received 52.9 percent of the vote in his last campaign.
 
Write-In Campaign
 The Democratic primary in the 11th District also attracted wide public attention when the party's choice as a candidate, Daniel G. Tauriello, 34, an administrator at Middlesex County College, was thrown off the ballot after a dozen or so signatures on his nominating petition were challenged by John Kucek, an outspoken Holocaust revisionist. Mr. Kucek became the only name in the Democratic column for Congress in a district that includes Morris County and parts of Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Sussex.
Although the Democratic nomination in the predominantly Republican district has never been considered a prize, party leaders and Jewish groups conducted a successful write-in campaign for former State Senator Frank Herbert, who had represented Bergen County in the State Legislature and who now lives in Sussex County.
Mr. Byrne said he was "thrilled and grateful" for Mr. Herbert's victory. "The first thing we had to do was convince people not to vote for the Nazi," Mr. Byrne said. "Then we had to ask them to vote for Frank Herbert, and lastly, we had to teach them how to work the voting machine to register their write-in vote."
Mr. Kucek, 66, an accountant, has been a vocal supporter of David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader turned Louisiana politician. But he denied being the bigot that his political opponents claim. "I'm not anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish," Mr. Kucek has said. "I'm pro-American."
On Wednesday, the day after they won party nominations to run for the Senate, Frank R. Lautenberg, the two-term Democratic incumbent, and his Republican opponent, Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian, were at the State House to open their general election campaigns.
Each man accused the other of distorting his record and each promised a hard-fought campaign, but no telling points were made during their separate meetings with reporters. Still, Mr. Lautenberg, who has earned a reputation for waging tough campaigns, said he expected his contest with Mr. Haytaian to be "the ultimate roller derby."
In his opening salvo Mr. Lautenberg depicted Mr. Haytaian as a strong opponent of effective gun control. He said that in 1988 Mr. Haytaian sponsored and pushed through the Assembly a bill that would have repealed New Jersey's seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases and would have allowed lifetime handgun permits.
The 70-year-old Democratic incumbent contrasted that with his co-sponsorship of the Brady Bill, which mandates a waiting period and background check before a gun may be bought, and of his support for legislation to ban assault weapons across the country. New Jersey in 1990 enacted its own ban on the sale or possession of a number of assault weapons.
In his first appearance as the Republican standard-bearer, Mr. Haytaian resumed a theme that he began during the primary election campaign, calling Mr. Lautenberg the "silent Senator" who is trying to win re-election without discussing issues.
The 59-year-old state legislator looked back to Mr. Lautenberg's first campaign for the Senate, when he defeated Millicent Fenwick, a popular Congresswoman and the inspiration for the character Lacey Davenport, in the Doonesbury comic strip.
At that time Mr. Lautenberg was the lesser-known candidate, and Mr. Haytaian said the Democrat wrote a letter to Mrs. Fenwick that said, "A select series of public, face-to-face debates is a critical opportunity to evaluate candidates."
Mr. Haytaian then issued a challenge of his own, a series of weekly debates in each of the state's 21 counties -- "with a week off for the Fourth of July."
"I'll debate the silent Senator any time, any place, with no strings attached," Mr. Haytaian said.

HEADLINE: The False Promise of Development by Casino

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
ONCE a forbidden pleasure confined to a few oases of sin, legal gambling is on a roll: From Oregon to Mississippi to Connecticut, communities are betting that betting is the ticket to economic resurrection. And no wonder. Building a gambling industry is widely viewed as the painless route to development -- prosperity, just around the corner, without the cost and effort of retraining workers, negotiating tax breaks for businesses or luring executives with good schools, efficient transportation and low crime rates.
But even as the $30 billion-a-year gambling juggernaut gains momentum, economists and regional planners are predicting that it will chew up more income than it creates. "If we end up with gambling within 100 miles of where virtually every American lives," warns William Thompson of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, "it will be worse than a zero-sum game," leaving most towns with added social problems and nothing in compensation. 
 While casino gambling has been a big-money industry since the rise of Las Vegas in the 1950's, its reach was proscribed both by religious opposition and by lingering associations with wiseguys who made business offers that couldn't be refused. These political barriers were weakened by the success of state lotteries, argues Robert Goodman, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who directed the recently completed United States Gambling Study, financed by the Ford Foundation. And they crumbled after 1988, when Congress required the states to negotiate terms for gambling on Indian reservations and a dozen revenue-starved states decided to permit gambling on their own turf.
Spurred by examples such as the Foxwoods Resort Casino, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' casino in Ledyard, Conn., that is now the most profitable gaming establishment in America, multitudes are rushing to join the fun. Some 70 Indian groups currently operate casinos in 17 states, with the number expected to double within a few years. Riverboat casinos line the Mississippi from Illinois to the Gulf Coast. New Orleans will soon open a giant floating casino; meanwhile Philadelphia, Washington, Providence and Chicago are all salivating for a piece of the action.
But gambling as an economic development tool is, at best, problematic, for reasons that communities with visions of sugar plums are choosing to ignore.
One is the industry's apparent tendency to overbuild. Casinos in communities that are the first off the mark are often overnight successes, drawing crowds from huge areas. But once the competition grows, the party can turn grim. "Two-thirds of the 80 casinos in Deadwood, S.D., are in bankruptcy or in trouble," notes Mr. Goodman. Atlantic City is feeling the shock from the huge casino operation in Ledyard, which is roughly the same distance from New York City. And if, as expected, Philadelphia opts for riverboat gambling, Earl Grinols, an economist at the University of Illinois, predicts that "Atlantic City will be dead meat."
Free markets are supposed to reward productive decisions and punish wasteful ones. Why, then, would savvy entrepreneurs throw money at gambling ventures that are fated to become uneconomic? The gambling industry is unusual, argues Mr. Grinols, because the interests of the casino companies diverge widely from those of the community.
For one thing, a new casino may be risky for a community but a very safe bet for the principals if virtually all the money comes from lenders or limited partners, as it often does. The big gambling companies like Caesar's World and MGM Grand presumably can't make money unless their investors do. But they may earn back their investment plus a hefty profit within a few years, leaving communities to cope with the problems of shrinking tax bases and job opportunities.
EVEN places that avoid the cycle of boom and bust face special economic problems related to gambling. Every business creates "negative externalities" -- costs born by others. A store, for example, may add to traffic congestion, litter and noise. But Mr. Grinols believes that these externalities are exceptionally high for legal gambling.
Compulsive gambling, bred by easy access, reduces labor productivity, he notes, and has been linked to increases in white collar crime -- embezzlement, fraud and the like. Late-night gambling adds to the cost of policing traffic, not to mention the toll from drunk driving and other alcohol-related violence. This isn't precision engineering. But all told, Mr. Grinols estimates that these externalities equal roughly half the revenues of casino gambling -- and these costs, ultimately borne by Government, are far more than the direct and indirect taxes on the industry.
To control gambling's unwanted side effects, "small is beautiful," argues Peter Reuter, an economist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy. The best hope for making gambling compatible with balanced economic development, he suggests, is to mimic the European model of restricting hours and access to discourage gaming by local residents. While towns could hardly bar locals from the casinos (as some in Europe do), the United States Supreme Court has ruled that they can prohibit local advertising. And casinos could be required to charge stiff fees for entering the premises -- fees waived for certified conventioneers or hotel guests.
Mr. Thompson would go further, permitting casinos only as rewards for new hotel construction, and then matching their capacity to the expected number of gamblers who will come, lose and go home. "When more than 50 percent of gambling is by locals," he reckons, "gambling is a sure loser." In Las Vegas, incidentally, just 10 to 20 percent of the gambling revenue is home grown.
But a community's interest in curbing the costs associated with gambling is not shared by those who own the businesses. Nor, equally insidiously, points out Mr. Goodman, is the interest shared by elected officials, who are apt to focus on the immediate benefits of beefing up tax revenues rather than abstract worries about keeping local paychecks out of the slot machines.
State lotteries, initially rationalized as an alternative to illegal "numbers," games, now spend $300 million a year to promote sales. "Don't try to fight it." advised one ad for the Massachusetts game. "It's bigger than you are." And while casino gambling is often adopted with assurances that its reach will be circumscribed, promises have often proved to be only promises.
IN Atlantic City, the casinos successfully pressed for all-night wagering in response to stagnating business. Iowa is now debating the idea of erasing limits on gambling stakes in response to wide-open betting across the river in Illinois.
Most disturbing, in the view of those who want to keep the lid on, is the spread of gambling machines. Slots, along with electronic gizmos for playing poker and the bingo-like keno, attract less knowledgeable and less affluent gamblers, who are more apt to be residents. And the machines are thought to be more addicting than table games, arguably because the time between action and response is reduced.
But casinos like machine gambling, at least in part, says Mr. Goodman, "because they always come to work on Monday and never go on strike." And customers like the machines as well. Since 1990, reports Mr. Goodman, betting at Nevada and Atlantic City table games such as blackjack and craps has fallen 15 percent, while slot machine revenues have gone up by 40 percent.
IF the increased use of slot machines in casinos is seen as an ominous turn, the broader trend toward decentralized electronic gambling is viewed by many as a guarantee that the community-borne costs of gambling will escalate.
In some cases, decentralization has been the paradoxical consequence of sagging revenues from competing games. West Virginia and Rhode Island responded to declining parimutuel betting at racetracks by allowing the tracks to supplement their income with electronic betting machines. And in South Dakota the lottery managed to keep itself financially fit by blanketing the states with 10,500 machines. The state's total annual take from the machines (before expenses) is about $150 per resident.
While not everyone wants to gamble, analysts argue that the likely economic consequences of bringing it within reach of everyone would still be deeply sobering. Once betting on three cherries is as easy as buying a pack of Marlboros, Mr. Thompson reckons that the great bulk of the industry's revenues will come from income now spent elsewhere -- in particular, on entertainment and travel. What's more, the impact of the external costs, such as compulsive gambling, could become large enough to become a measurable drag on economic productivity.
Mr. Grinols prefers to make this latter point in a more colorful way. Extrapolating from areas already saturated with gambling opportunities, he estimates that the loss would average $200 per American, "the equivalent of cleaning up after one Hurricane Andrew each year."

An Accountant in Ad-Land: A Survivor at the Top

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
FOR a change, Charles Scott had something to smile about. The chief executive of the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the world's fourth-largest advertising company, had just gotten word that its London office had won one of the biggest accounts up for grabs in Britain for years, a $68 million campaign to introduce a new national lottery.
"It's exciting news, wonderful," Mr. Scott said. "For whatever reason, new business wins seem to be what send morale sky high." After four and a half grueling years at Saatchi & Saatchi, first as finance director and for the last 14 months as chief executive, Mr. Scott is only now finding sporadic cause for celebration. 
 Mr. Scott, a self-effacing 45-year-old accountant who until coming to Saatchi & Saatchi in 1990 had never worked a day in an ad agency, has never completely quelled doubts that he is the right person to reinvigorate a company that lives and dies by its creativity and marketing savvy.
But he can now point to signs of success in his efforts to restore the company to growth through winning new business at its three big agency networks, especially in the United States, reversing years of lethargy.
He has also won public backing from the board. And at the annual meeting on Thursday in London, it became clear that he had held his own in a running feud with the chairman, Maurice Saatchi, a quarrel that had led to questions about whether the two could continue to work together.
"There is the capacity between any chairman and chief executive in any company for tension," Mr. Saatchi said at the meeting in unusually frank terms. "I am happy to say that although there have been those tensions in our boardroom, they have had a cathartic effect, and good and constructive ways of moving forward have come out of that creative tension."
In an earlier interview, Mr. Scott said that from his perspective there was no problem with Mr. Saatchi, and that the only important thing to him was that the company appeared to be turning the corner.
"My job was extremely unenjoyable for the first two years," Mr. Scott said. "But every day it's getting more enjoyable."
Hired to help clean up the mess from one of the most ill-conceived and ill-executed corporate strategies of the 1980's -- Saatchi & Saatchi's headlong expansion from shrewdly creative London ad agency into a debt-ridden behemoth with delusions of dominating businesses as far-flung as consulting and banking -- Mr. Scott spent several years scrambling just to keep the company afloat.
Along with his predecessor as chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Mr. Scott helped persuade reluctant bankers to refinance the nearly $1 billion in debt run up by the company's founders, Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles. The Saatchis had borrowed heavily as they snapped up agencies like Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel and Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and nonadvertising companies like the Hay Group, a consulting firm, and Yankelovich Skelly White/Clancy Shulman, a market research firm.
At the same time, Mr. Scott helped Mr. Louis-Dreyfus enact a plan to slash employment by 22 percent, to 11,600, and to sell most holdings other than the ad agencies.
Mr. Scott was appointed chief executive last year when Mr. Louis-Dreyfus left to try to turn around another troubled company, Adidas A.G. And with the financial crisis at Saatchi & Saatchi now under control, Mr. Scott has turned his attention to the trickier problem of arresting the slide in the market share and reputation of the company's agencies: Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, Bates Worldwide (formerly Backer Spielvogel Bates) and Campbell Mithun Esty.
There are signs of tentative progress. Mr. Scott has continued a process begun last year of moving some highly successful executives from London to New York to shake up the American agencies, bruising some egos on Madison Avenue but also injecting new energy into drifting operations.
Bates has won several big accounts, including assignments from Miller Brewing and Warner-Lambert, and executives at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York said they expect to announce some prizes soon from their campaign for new business. After years in which recession led companies to slash ad budgets, the economies of the United States and Britain are growing steadily, leading many clients to increase their budgets, albeit cautiously. Elsewhere, Mr. Scott has stepped up investments in local agencies to give Saatchi the global reach increasingly demanded by big advertisers.
But Mr. Scott's job is far from over. With the company having focused so long on mere survival, it still needs considerable work in developing unified cultures and advertising philosophies within the three agency networks, each of which was created out of disparate agencies in the late 1980's.
IT still needs to address some big strategic issues, like whether to fold the three agencies into two, and whether to expand its successful Zenith media-buying agency from Europe into America. And, analysts say, it needs to focus management attention on helping clients and creating good ads.
"The tumor's gone, but the patient isn't back to health yet," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York. "It still needs physical therapy. It still needs vitamins. That's the job that Charlie's doing, and it ain't done yet."
An army brat, Mr. Scott grew up in Africa, Germany, Cyprus. Returning to Britain, he attended Dover College and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1972. In 1977 he went to work for IMS International, a pharmaceutical market research firm, and eventually became chief financial officer.
In late 1989 the Saatchi brothers hired Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, known for his skill at financial restructurings. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a flamboyant Frenchman who had previously run IMS, persuaded the easygoing and far more laconic Mr. Scott to come along.
Mr. Scott has no illusion that he is an advertising executive in the creative mold and does not try to serve as the company's public face. He rarely meets with clients, worrying that he will be wasting their time. His base salary of $450,000 last year was dwarfed by those of Saatchi's agency heads (Carl Spielvogel, the chairman of Bates Worldwide, earned $1.1 million).
Mr. Scott has long pushed for pay to reflect performance, and on Thursday, Maurice Saatchi said he had been converted to Mr. Scott's approach. Mr. Saatchi said he would give up his $900,000-a-year base salary for a $300,000-a-year contract with incentive clauses.
Mr. Scott sees his job as two-fold: lifting from the shoulders of operating executives the task of dealing with financial management, and creating an environment in which the agencies can hire the best people and focus on serving clients' needs.
"I am impressed with what Charlie has been trying to do in bringing greater fiscal responsibility to the operations," said Mr. Spielvogel, who has long been critical of management at London headquarters.
Yet in a company rife with factions, Mr. Scott, lacking experience at any agency, does not have a power base of his own. Maurice Saatchi, although no longer running day-to-day operations, remains a powerful force, especially in London. (Charles Saatchi, once the agency's creative guru, resigned from the board in December and now concentrates on his first love, art collecting.)
Mr. Scott was among those board members who pressured the reluctant Saatchi brothers into moving their offices from a modern, expensive building in London's Berkeley Square into the far dowdier quarters that are home to the holding company and to the Saatchi & Saatchi agency.
APPARENTLY concerned about the company's leadership, the outside directors met at the end of March and discussed whether Mr. Scott, and Mr. Saatchi for that matter, were the right people.
The board quizzed both men, and also quietly canvassed investors and clients. Then, on March 31, as rumors flew in London and New York, it issued this statement: "Following consultation with shareholders, clients and employees, the board has resolved that the interests of the company are best served by the continuation of Maurice Saatchi and Charles Scott in their present roles as chairman and chief executive."
But, the board added, it had also instructed the company to search for and hire a third executive on the corporate level who would be responsible for winning new business.
Now, however, Saatchi & Saatchi has decided it does not need that new executive, Mr. Scott said. "The board was concerned that we were losing market share," Mr. Scott said. "I believe that is the prime responsibility of the chief executives of our agencies around the world and myself and Maurice. It's up to us to prove we can do it. Until the last few months we didn't have any evidence that the things we were doing were working. Now I think everybody's feeling much better about our ability to deal with the problems."
Mr. Scott said he is now happy with the executive lineup in the agencies, and in particular with the new managers sent from London to New York: Michael Bungey, a Briton who formerly headed Bates in Europe and is now chief executive of Bates Worldwide, and Bill Muirhead, the Australia-born former head of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in Europe, as head of that agency's operations in North America.
"We need more business from existing clients and from new clients," Mr. Scott said. "The particular area in which we have not been doing well over the past four years is the United States, which happens to be not only the biggest advertising market but also home to 60 percent of the world's multinational companies. It's one place you don't want to be underperforming."
With the company's outlook improving, Mr. Scott said he can foresee a day when he will have done all he can at Saatchi & Saatchi. But he said he has not gotten there yet.
"I don't know if it's fun," he said. "It will be extremely gratifying when the company starts performing as well as it ought. Satisfaction comes from winning, quite honestly. It's been exceedingly hard work, and at the end of the day you want to win."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Wanna Buy a Bridge to Brooklyn?

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan 

 BODY:
THE day Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., a very busy investment banker, has time to go to lunch with a reporter is a day when the bankruptcy business must be slow.
But when Mr. Ross wants to go to dinner something more must be afoot. "I thought you'd like to know what my next gig will be," he said.
Career changes are seldom big news. But among Wall Street honchos, Mr. Ross is a bellwether banker who has always had an exceptional nose for where the money is. So dinner was called for. 
 An able chameleon, Mr. Ross has reinvented himself once before -- in 1985 when his bread-and-butter corporate finance business wasn't doing anything worth yakking about, and Corporate America was about to be swept up in a wave of big bankruptcies.
Before you could say Chapter 11, Mr. Ross had transformed himself and his firm, Rothschild Inc., into a leading champion of the rights of bondholders against companies in trouble. And at time when so many professionals face the threat of dismissal because of downsizing and bottom-line pressures, the story of someone who lives by the motto, "adapt or die" is instructive.
So here, Wall Street, is Mr. Ross's humble oracle: "Privatizations are going to be the wave of the 90's," he confides. "Every city has assets it has no reason to have that can be probably managed on a more efficient basis by the private sector," he said. "Corporations deleveraged. Now, I think it's time for governments to go through that process."
Got that? Corporate bankruptcies are out. Government workouts are in.
True, Mr. Ross is hardly the first to discover that more and more governments will want to sell their assets or refinance their debts to bridge their financial shortfalls.
Alliance Capital, the money management firm, has just raised a $1 billion war chest from retail investors to invest in government-controlled entities that are about to go private or have recently done so. And others investors appear to be following suit.
Internationally, there have been plenty of deals to feed the demand. According to Privatisation International, a monthly newsletter in London, $53.7 billion worth of securities were sold last year by Britain's telephone company, Argentina's oil company, and other state-owned enterprises. That total was roughly $10 billion more than in 1992, and is the highest yearly figure since the newsletter began keeping track six years ago.
Mr. Ross's point is that even though the business is well-developed overseas, domestic privatization is in its infancy. And his dinner chatter was vintage Wilbur. He had the sweep. He had the statistics and, of course, he had his spin.
In his view, state and local governments are under increasing pressure to maintain services without raising taxes. And one way to do it is to sell off assets that underperform or have little to do with their mission. More than half the cities in the U.S., he notes citing statistics from the National League of Cities, had budget deficits last year.
New York's new Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, for example, is exploring whether to sell the city's FM radio license and its luxury hotel near the United Nations. Likewise, Mr. Ross notes, other cities have stadiums, convention centers, hospitals and other sidelines they might be better off relinquishing. "There's no reason why an offtrack betting parlor should lose money," said Mr. Ross, noting that New York City's $800 million a year gaming business is in the red.
Mr. Ross could, of course, have simply retired a wealthy man. Just one of the many deals he did in his heyday was an investment he engineered in a company called Mego. When his investor group purchased Mego, it was nothing but a shell that had prepaid its taxes for years to come. The company has made his group some $37 million in profits.
But at 54, Mr. Ross is not ready to hang up his spurs. And in looking for his next frontier, he used three criteria. "I'm interested in things where you can create a market, have a big share and have it last a while," he said. "Privatizations and capital-raising by governments will go on for years. And it's a fairly chaotic market. So I thought here was room for someone that knew a lot about markets, turmoil and restructuring."
Rodney Lord, the editor of Privatisation International, gives Mr. Ross a fair shot at success. "He's late by my standards in the sense I started this paper six years ago," said Mr. Lord. "But he's certainly not too late. We could be at the beginning of a something very big in the States."
Mr. Ross has been at his new career a few weeks now, and has one albeit modest deal to show for himself. He has just closed a $75 million bond deal for Bermuda, which earned his firm $375,000. It is the first time the island has turned to the bond markets for its long-term capital.
Mr. Ross, looking tanned from the ten trips he has taken to visit that client so far this year, is a big believer in the notion that when you are doing a makeover on yourself, you have to work with what you have.
He has also elbowed his way into a select circle of ten firms that will be allowed to bid for New York City's privatization business, even though his own track record in privatizations is nothing to speak of. The only performance he can point to is that of his firm's parent company, Rothschild Group, which is based in Europe. Measured simply by the sheer number of assignments it had, though not necessarily by the value of the deals, Rothschild Group edged ahead of First Boston last year as the market leader, according to Mr. Lord. Mr. Ross also understands the importance of doing some unpaid work just to gain experience. For instance, he accepted a spot on President Clinton's Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia that will dispense $500 million to Russian companies. The appointment could ultimately cost him business. "Obviously we can't do things for institutions they're investing in," said Mr. Ross. "But you have to get credentials somewhere."

HEADLINE: DRIVING SMART;
Looking Ahead at Headlights: Improvements Down the Road

BYLINE: By MARSHALL SCHUON 

 BODY:
MY first car was a well-used 1936 Ford, and I loved it dearly, although it did have some problems, particularly in its electrical system. For a while, when I stepped on the brakes the horn would blow, a difficulty I remedied by yanking out the horn.
But the headlights were something else. The lenses were hinged, and inside were little incandescent bulbs that emitted almost no light. Their failure was abetted by reflectors that had dulled with time. 
 That car was one of the last to use such lights; even when the Ford was new, sealed beams were finding a market. They were a marvelous advance, round and sealed in heavy glass, and they remained essentially the same in this country until 1974, when General Motors developed a rectangular bulb.
Since then, sizes and shapes have changed, but sealed beams are still with us, notwithstanding brighter halogen bulbs and the increasing use of plastics for lenses and housings. Computer design has also helped to put more light on the road and make vehicles safer.
But the latest advance is "high-intensity discharge" lighting, or H.I.D., a system that uses a control module, a transformer and a quartz tube that is filled with gas and contains two electrodes. When current passes through the electrodes, an arc jumps through the gas, producing light.
The Inland Fisher Guide division of General Motors, which supplies G.M. and many other manufacturers with lighting and other components, has been experimenting with this type of lighting, and its engineers say they think the system will be widely used within five years.
Vic Walters, product director of the division's lighting operations in Anderson, Ind., said an arc was far more efficient than a filament. The lights are cooler and they operate at lower wattage, which translates into better fuel economy, since a car burns gas to generate current. Also, Mr. Walters said, "H.I.D. gives you about twice as much light to work with, and you can produce a more desirable beam pattern. It gives you more foreground light, more spread light and so forth."
Barbara Sanders, engineering director of Inland Fisher's advanced development group, added that H.I.D. also produced a different color of light that reflected more brightly from road signs, meaning greater safety and less driver fatigue.
Further in the future, she said, fiber optics offer exciting possibilities. In such a system, a single light source -- say, under the hood -- will distribute light through optic cables. Glass fiber is expensive, however, and widespread use of fiber optics depends on the development of cheaper plastic fibers.
"We will probably light interiors with fiber optics before we do exterior lighting," she said. "Headlights are a more challenging problem, because they operate in a pretty hostile environment."
G.M. will take a big step in lighting this fall by putting daytime running lights on some cars; it will have them on all lines within three years. The system, required in Canada since 1988 and now mandatory in Sweden, Norway and Finland, turns on lights when the engine is running.
Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, says daytime running lights make cars easier to see and thereby reduce two-vehicle daytime crashes. He said research by the institute involved more than 2,000 modified vehicles in commercial fleets and showed fewer accidents than similar vehicles without the running lights.
A Chrysler spokesman said that company had no plan to put daytime running lights on its cars and saw no inherent safety advantage, although G.M.'s progress -- and the popularity of the lights -- will be monitored. Ford has also taken a wait-and-see approach.
In Canada, most cars use reduced-intensity low beams during the day. On vehicles with retractable headlights, however, steady-burning turn signals are lit. Fuel economy suffers a bit, but David Moore, manager of forward lighting at Inland Fisher's operation in Anderson, said the safety factor made it worthwhile.
"In any case," he said, "the impact is very low. We estimate that daytime running lights will cut economy by only about a tenth of a mile per gallon."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Success Overseas Hurts China at Home

BYLINE: By Laurence Zuckerman 

 BODY:
EVERYONE seems to agree that China is the mother of all emerging markets. In recent months the heady prospect of gaining a share in what promises to become the world's largest purchaser of everything from shampoo to heavy industrial equipment has infected not only chief executives and bankers but also ordinary investors.
So why then have China's two domestic-share markets hit the skids? 
 Since last year, the fledgling exchanges in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen have fallen inexorably from record highs. Last month's decision by President Clinton to continue to allow Chinese imports to enter the United States at minimum tariff levels sparked a brief rebound. But it has not been nearly enough to offset the year's heavy losses, which now amount to a 37 percent decline in the all-China stock index compiled by Credit Lyonnais Securities.
Investors and traders attribute the drop to factors that they say befall every emerging market. The seemingly boundless enthusiasm about China's economic boom has given way to worries that an overheated economy and rising inflation may lead to unrest. Politically, traders wonder what will happen after Deng Xiaoping, China's ailing leader, dies.
But the biggest cause of the decline may be the success of China's overall effort to tap the world's financial markets. When shares reserved for foreigners began trading in Shen zhen and Shanghai in 1992, they provided one of the few ways overseas investors could cash in on China's rapid growth. But now Chinese shares are listed on exchanges in Hong Kong, New York, Vancouver and Melbourne.
Because these exchanges are more mature, have more stringent listing and reporting rules, and are overseen by regulators with proven track records, the stocks are more attractive to investors. "If I were a foreign investor, I would prefer to invest in a more liquid market with better disclosure requirements and lower trading costs," said Lawrence Ang, head of China research for Swiss Bank Corporation in Hong Kong.
Now that fund managers have the luxury of choice, they are no longer so willing to look the other way when Chinese companies use their equity capital to play the stock market or make other speculative investments unrelated to their core businesses.
Christopher Legallet, a director of Jupiter Tyndall (Asia) Ltd. and manager of its London-listed China Investment Trust, believes that only a handful of the 50 companies listed in Shenzhen and Shanghai that have issued stock reserved for foreigners, known in the trade as B shares, are worthwhile investments. "Therefore, you are not going to put all your money as a China fund manager into B shares," he said.
Such thinking has caused turnover on both the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges to dry up. That in turn has made it even more difficult for institutional investors -- the primary buyers of B shares -- to accumulate large blocks of stock, creating a downward spiral in share prices.
Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong, known as H shares, have attracted wider interest and trade at a premium compared to the prices of shares in the same companies that are reserved for Chinese. Nine H shares are currently listed in Hong Kong but as many as 17 more are in the listing pipeline.
This has dealt a particularly harsh blow to the stock exchange in Shenzhen, which is only an hour's train ride from downtown Hong Kong. "It's virtually dead." Mr. Legallet said of the Shenzhen market. Last week's turnover was a paltry $2.1 million, and on some days many stocks didn't trade at all.
Shanghai's exchange is viewed more favorably by foreign investors because China's central government has committed its prestige and a large amount of resources to return the city to its pre-revolutionary status as Asia's financial capital.
"I personally don't believe that the Shenzhen market justifies its existence," Mr. Ang said. After Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, he pointed out, there won't be any need for another stock exchange on the city's doorstep.
But Zhang Hongyi, Shenzhen's vice mayor, disagreed. Describing the two exchanges as "complementary," he said "both will exist for a very long time. There is no question of one replacing the other."
Mr. Zhang, who was traveling in New York last week with a delegation of Shenzhen officials, regulators and company executives to drum up support for the exchange, was frank about its shortcomings and counseled patience. "We are fully aware that there is a gap between the domestic market and the international market," he said. "That is why we are here."
For all his criticisms, Mr. Legallet is optimistic. "There are risks," he said, "but the long-term story, based on the growth in the per capita consumption of basic commodities, make China, to me, the most compelling investment opportunity in my lifetime."
Now that B-share prices have fallen, Mr. Legallet finds them increasingly attractive. He prefers companies that manufacture an internationally competitive product but are positioning themselves to take advantage of China's huge domestic market.
One example is Shenzhen China Bicycle Company (Holdings) Ltd., which exports the Diamond Back-brand bicycle to the United States and Europe but has begun developing a distribution network inside China.
"We have an emerging economy," Mr. Legallet said. "We have to accept that and accept the volatility. But to me the volatility is what makes for opportunity."

HEADLINE: When Husbands Can't Find Jobs

 BODY:
Re: "Helping the Wives of the Unemployed" (April 10):
I hope now that their husbands are unemployed, these women have learned not to turn their noses up at other people. I have dealt with some of these women, and they felt that they were better than other people because they had nice homes and mink coats.
Most of them did not vote for Bill Clinton and were against his plan for national health care. I can bet they are singing a different tune today. These women felt that people who could not find jobs were just lazy and wanted to stay home and collect welfare checks. These women all had the same question: "Why did this happen to me? I did everything right."
Just think, most of these so-called affluent husbands had big corporate jobs and college degrees, and they cannot find jobs. They have fancy cars and fancy clothes and never thought the day would come when they would have to use food stamps.
Life has a way of catching us on the blind side, and that is what happened to these women. I hope they have learned the lesson that we need to be understanding of all people -- cashiers, busboys, gardeners, maids, etc. And to the woman who is going to have a second child even though her husband is unemployed: I hope the next time she hears of a woman who is having a baby and neither she nor her husband has a job, she will take a look at her second child and say, "I can understand it."

HEADLINE: Journal;
The Other Agenda

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Bob Woodward is the reporter who helped bring down a criminal Presidency. Mike Wallace is the television muckraker who nailed a thousand malefactors. Put them together on "60 Minutes" to lift the lid on Mr. Woodward's new book, "The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House," and a vast audience has every reason to believe that a scandal of Watergate proportions is about to explode.
The two men did all they could to further that perception last Sunday. Both looked solemn, and Mr. Woodward was seen in such tight close-ups that even his mildest innuendos about the Clintons ("The American taxpayer has gotten two for the price of one") took on the gravity of an impeachable offense. The viewer was also tantalized by shots of Mr. Woodward's vast cache of seemingly incriminating tapes -- containing "deep background" interviews with confidential sources reaching "up to the very top" -- and a replay of Gennifer Flowers. "Are Bill and Hillary Clinton going to like this book?" asked Mr. Wallace, who then answered, "I don't think so." 
 Actually, the Clintons may not mind "The Agenda." Its characterization of them is familiar -- he can't make decisions; she can't stop making them -- and Mr. Woodward provides no new reportage about Gennifer Flowers or any other scandal. But ordinary readers, lured by "60 Minutes" into anticipating a "Son of All the President's Men," may well be peeved. Mr. Woodward's book, a plodding account of the evolution of the Clinton economic plan, has its farcical Washington snapshots, but never reaches the ludicrous heights of the hype surrounding "The Agenda" itself.
"At one point Clinton got so frustrated he used the f-word!" exclaimed Mr. Woodward, posing as America's oldest living Boy Scout, in another promotional television interview. Well, so what? To flog this book, Mr. Woodward has had to turn unexceptional, even flattering "revelations" about the President into spuriously shocking sound bites that make Mr. Woodward and the journalistic profession he so prominently represents look more disingenuous than his subject.
Not only does Mr. Clinton cuss, Mr. Woodward and his TV hosts darkly inform us, but the President also loses his temper, tolerates intellectual prodding by his wife and Vice President, thrives on the detailed debate of policy, makes pragmatic political compromises to win Congressional votes and sows chaos by refusing to enlist a chief of staff who will stifle dissent.
If these are crimes, then no doubt an ideal President would be an ideologically rigid Washington lifer who nurses enemies' lists rather than letting off steam, has a golf caddy for a Vice President and a cipher for a spouse, makes policy pronouncements from index cards written by aides and is too arrogant to get a bill through Congress. The ideal chief of staff? John Sununu.
Presumably voters turned to the Clinton-Gore ticket to reject this status quo. Mr. Woodward, whose own ideology seems to be terminal inside-the-Beltway-itis, finds Mr. Clinton most wanting when measuring him against Lloyd Bentsen.
The President's indecisiveness is indeed a serious flaw. But we hardly need "The Agenda" to tell us that. The book's journalistic flaws are often more newsworthy. The problems begin on the first page, where a breezy conversation between the Clintons in bed sounds fake. (Mrs. Clinton says "Yeah" as much as the Beatles.) While the gist of the conversation, like much of "The Agenda," may be accurate, the book's lifelessly reconstructed scenes show what can happen when a journalist sands down a variety of off-the-record accounts to arrive at a composite reality.
Connie Bruck's recent profile of Hillary Clinton in The New Yorker presents much the same picture of the White House that Mr. Woodward's book does, but because most of her sources are named, speak in their own voices and own up to their sometimes conflicting points of view, the Clintons are seen with the perspective and depth missing in "The Agenda." So prosaic is most of what Mr. Woodward's sources have to say that their Deep-Throated anonymity often seems superfluous -- just another way to puff up the smoke of hot news where there is no fire.
But at least no one can accuse Mr. Woodward of trashing Mr. Clinton to serve a covert political line as he hypes "The Agenda." The only agenda here, and it's not very well hidden, is sales.

HEADLINE: Students Care Far Too Much About Grades

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Making the Grades" (editorial, June 5): Having completed my last final exam as an undergraduate at Stanford University not more than an hour ago, I believe I am in an excellent position to evaluate the media frenzy over alleged grade inflation at Stanford University. 
 Yes, a surprising number of A and B grades are received by students here. But very little coverage has focused on how the nature of Stanford students contributes to this trend.
Students here are motivated almost to a fault when it comes to grades. Most students who come here had a straight-A average in high school. I remember an orientation discussion of my freshman dorm mates titled "What Will You Do When You Get That First B?"
But one need only observe the solemn mass of students staggering out of the library at closing time, observe the playing fields during finals week, empty despite another gorgeous California day, observe the glassy-eyed, sleep-deprived paper writers packed into the computer cluster, to see that Stanford students work too hard for their grades, not too little.
What I find unfortunate, and what most disappointed me about my time at Stanford, is that our narrow focus on letter grades has allowed us to forget that a university should be about learning and knowledge, rather than class rank and one-upmanship. It is a shame that when the national media turn their eyes on a great university, the most interesting thing they can discover are statistics about grade point averages.
But I can hardly blame them. Not while students ask, "Is this going to be on the exam?" Not while our faculty senate spends more time debating how to make the grading system more punitive, than discussing how to improve our education. The letter grade has become a convenient way for students, faculty and administrators to shirk our responsibility to a deeper evaluation of the state of our education.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: The Bondholders Are Winning;
Why America Won't Boom

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
"IT'S the economy, stupid." When James Carville coined the slogan, he meant that his client, Bill Clinton, would be well served by thumping for a stronger economy. Mr. Clinton did, and he won. But now, it turns out, there are an awful lot of people out there who favor a weak economy.
Favor a weak economy? Who would do that? Enter that mysterious and slightly sinister entity, The Bond Market, the pre-eminent force in the economy today. More than any other group, the bond market's members determine how many Americans will have jobs, whether the jobholders will earn enough to afford a house or a car, or whether a factory might have to lay off workers. 
 In sum, the American economy is governed by the bond market -- a loose confederation of wealthy Americans, bankers, financiers, money managers, rich foreigners, executives of life insurance companies, presidents of universities and nonprofit foundations, pensioners and people who once kept their money in passbook savings accounts (or under the bed) and now buy shares in mutual funds. While some would recoil at being called enemies of economic growth, the fact is that the confederation has ruled in recent months that the economy should lose strength, not gain it.
 
The Message: Smaller
 "The bond market's members speak in a monologue, and their message is contract the economy," a senior Administration official said. "They want the weakest economy they can have, as long as it does not get so weak that loans are defaulted."
Through the Bush years they were quiescent. The economy was pretty weak on its own most of the time, and the bond market fraternity did not feel compelled to take action. But the surge in economic activity that started last fall got juices flowing. And with a rapidity that took the breath away, the fraternity exercised its power over interest rates, pushing them up so that people had to pay more for things like mortgages, car loans and new machinery. After rising sharply from February to May, interest rates have leveled off for now, but inevitably the surge in economic growth so evident last winter has lost some of its bloom.
"There are other things that affect interest rates, but point number one is where is the economy going," said Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve. "If you have a weaker economy, you have lower rates. That is not a great world, but that is the way it is."
The Clinton Administration does not aggressively challenge the bond market's preference for subdued economic growth. Top officials argue that the economy is still strong enough to withstand most of the recent drag from higher rates. Congress is similarly reluctant to challenge the bond market's power. And early in the Clinton Presidency, Mr. Carville himself recognized the problem with the aphorism he had made famous. So he came up with a new one.
"I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the President or the Pope or as a .400 basball hitter," he said. "But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody."
Most Americans have only a rough notion of the bond market's nature. The name itself suggests financiers on Wall Street. In fact, the fraternity, which is as old as the Republic, has changed over the decades and has appeared in different eras under different names -- as the Eastern banking establishment, for example, or the sound money faction.
Some of its newest members are ordinary Americans, who enter by buying shares in mutual funds that invest in bonds -- and they may be unaware that they have joined such a heavyweight club.
"A lot of times they move money into the fund from a passbook savings account or a bank certificate of deposit and they don't realize that they are moving into another world where they can get hurt," said James Benham, chairman of the Benham Group, whose various mutual bond funds have 425,000 shareholders.
While Mr. Benham, who manages their money, is definitely concerned about too much economic growth, his shareholders don't always realize that in letting him manage their money they are joining his cause. These shareholders may in fact be on two sides of the argument -- as bond market members favoring slower economic growth and as wage earners rooting for a vigorous economy.
"They may advocate reduced job prospects for themselves and their offspring," said Clare Hushbeck, a senior policy analyst at the American Association of Retired Persons, which is open to anyone over 50, working and retired. "But that is not apparent to them; these are tough connections for most people to make."
What does help to make the connection is some understanding of the essential nature of the bond market. Whatever its name or its membership through the decades, one defining characteristic has endured. The bond market is a huge storehouse of accumulated wealth -- a giant vault, so to speak, from which saved money is loaned out not for a few weeks or months, but for years at a time.
Those multi-year loans totaled more than $10 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve's most recent data. That is a huge sum. If the $10 trillion were somehow to disappear, refilling the vault would absorb the entire national income -- all wages, salaries and profits -- for a year and a half.
Naturally, when they lend from the vault, the people who own the $10 trillion, or their agents like Mr. Benham, want it paid back intact, undiminished by inflation. And keeping down inflation has come to mean weakening the economy.
 
Borrowers All Over
 The loans go to the Federal Government to finance the budget deficit, or to corporations to buy new machinery, or to municipalities to build roads and schools, or to millions of Americans to buy homes and cars.
In the case of a car loan, the vault might lend $10,000 for five years to purchase a new vehicle. When the loan is finally paid back, the amount should be sufficient to purchase the latest model of the same vehicle.
That is the bond market's goal. So if inflation pushes up the car's price to, say, $13,000 -- or if the bond market even thinks this might happen before the loan is repaid -- then it demands higher interest payments, to cover the $3,000 inflation cost, plus some profit for the lenders. The higher interest payments, in turn, eventually discourage more borrowing, weakening the economy.
Inflation, however, is not a problem today. While the economy is stronger than it was a year ago, the inflation rate has barely risen. What's more, the Administration and many private economists believe that it won't rise much, even with brisk economic growth. Even the Federal Reserve's top officials, who usually side with the bond market, don't see much inflation ahead.
Until the 1970's, the bond market fraternity was more willing to accept such a view. Preserving wealth from the inroads of inflation, even at the expense of economic growth, was not such an obsession. But the double-digit inflation in the 1970's vaporized big chunks of the wealth in the bond market's vault. Although interest rates rose above 15 percent for a while, that extra income failed to offset much of the damage. And that memory remains fixed in the bond market's collective mind.
"When economies go through a major bout of inflation, it leaves a lasting imprint," said Paul Romer, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It may be that in the population at large, there is a greater fear of inflation than there was in the 1960's, and a greater willingness to stop it."
More to the point, when the bond market reacts, that reaction is more pronounced than in the past. Interest rates move faster. One reason: some of the $10 trillion can be pulled out of loans in America, converted into marks or yen and lent in Germany or Japan -- if rates in those countries are higher or the dollar is losing value against those currencies. Getting the money back requires higher American rates.
Then there are mortgages. In the past, a bank that issued a $100,000 mortgage at, say, 8 percent interest, kept the loan on its books, whatever the inflation problem. Now the bank packages the mortgage with, say, nine others, each for $100,000, and sells the package as a bond.
The new owner is often quick to sell the $1 million bond if inflation, or the threat of it, erodes its value. That would happen if interest rates were to rise to, say, 9 percent while his bond is paying only 8 percent, or $80,000. To turn that $80,000 into a 9 percent return for a fresh owner, he has to sell the bond for $890,000, losing money. And that sale reinforces the 9 percent rate in the bond market.
Hundreds of billions of dollars in mortgages and car loans, once never traded, are now bought and sold in this fashion. The bond market's influence grows as a result, and the balance between borrowers and lenders, between more growth and less inflation, shifts again -- toward a slower economy.

HEADLINE: The World;
Facing Up to the Legacy Of an Unresolved War

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
In public last week, President Clinton commemorated the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings, one of the boldest and most decisive military strokes of the 20th century. The heroes of 1944 should prompt Americans of today, he said, to make "common cause" with other countries once again; he asked members of his own generation "not only to praise their deeds but to pursue their dreams."
In private he and his aides wrestled with a foreign-policy crisis whose solution, again against daunting odds, will require all the conviction and all the commonality of cause that the United States and its allies can muster: the possession or potential possession of nuclear bombs by a unpredictable, egomaniacal ruler in North Korea. 
 Unlike World War II, which ended in the unconditional surrender that the allies had sought from the start, the conflict in Korea in the 1950's was far more ambiguous. Described in classic double-talk as a "police action" and not a war, it ended in armistice.
It is America's unresolved war, seldom discussed or analyzed, but still there, ticking lethally away. Only the occasional news photo of American troops peering through binoculars across the Demilitarized Zone or television film of American Presidents visiting them serve to jog dormant memories.
Now the danger is that like World War I, also halted by an armistice that left one party full of grievances, it will prove not to have ended at all. The geopolitical situation all around him has been utterly transformed in the last two decades, but Kim Il Sung retains the same goal, dominance in the Korean peninsula, and the same willingness to take big risks.
He is waging a campaign of terror, evident first in the bombings in Burma, in Seoul and on a South Korean airliner orchestrated by Pyongyang. His scientists appear to have been working on nuclear weapons. As with Stalin and his successors, the world fears that an isolated, power-mad, ideologically obsessed leader will hold it to nuclear ransom or through miscalculation blow his corner of it to smithereens -- which is the fundamental fear of the post-war era.
In the United States and Europe, so far, it has been a matter for specialists. However enormous the stakes for Japan and South Korea, and thus for the world's economy, however awful the implications for nuclear nonproliferation and hence world peace, there is an undeniable complacency, not only on the streets of London and Chicago, but even in the chanceries where the crucial decisions are made.
Why? Why, especially in the United States, has no more been done to make the stakes clear to the public? Why have we heard not even the rudiments of a debate over whether Korea, unlike Bosnia, is a place where this country would be willing to use force?
Surely one reason, on this matter as on so many others in the post-cold war world, is that the proper course of action is hard to discern.
Many experts thought for a long time that if only the right package of economic or other incentives could be established, including a reduction in the level or visibility of American military action in South Korea, a deal could be arranged. Give them the means to prop up their failing economy and to preserve their authoritarian rule, it was said, and Kim Il Sung and his heir-apparent son, Kim Jong Il, will give up nuclear projects. If not, economic sanctions, whether voted by the United Nations or not, would do the trick. But last week's promise by Pyongyang that sanctions would produce reprisals against Japan and the devastation of South Korea has given pause to Western policy makers.
Mr. Clinton would rather not spend a lot of time this summer on Korea. His big goal in the weeks ahead, apart from the successful completion of a second European trip, is the passage of health care reform; to that end, he would prefer to keep foreign crises and their inevitable divisiveness as far from center stage as possible.
 
Fuzzy Goals
 But that will only serve to prolong the public complacency about Korea, and to further defer any meaningful discussion about where and under what circumstances certain things are worth fighting for. In his inaugural and again in Normandy, the President spoke of his generation's need to emulate their forebears in sacrificing for the common good, but he has left it all pretty fuzzy.
He said last week that he wanted no "saber-rattling." He and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have drawn tight lines of restraint around the use of American force abroad, allowing only the most symbolic gestures in Bosnia, pulling sharply back at the first signs of trouble in Haiti and Somalia, abstaining in Rwanda. They may well have acted exactly as most of the American people wish, but their policies entail major costs.
So has Mr. Clinton's scattershot method of making policy, the vagueness and seeming contradictions in his message du jour. Socratic dialogues are not the best means of enunciating national goals.
One cost is the loss of confidence of allies. Only the United States is in a position in the current crisis to put some steel into the spines of Japan and South Korea, both fearful that terrorism would result or that their successful economies would be disrupted.
Last week the Japanese were reported to have refused even to contemplate cutting off the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars a year from North Koreans working abroad in Japan to families at home. Such remittances are Pyongyang's largest source by far of hard currency.
In this and other matters, the Europeans are still waiting, as a foreign minister said last week, for the moment "when Mr. Clinton thumps the table, a la Margaret Thatcher, and says, 'This is where we're making our stand, with you or without you.' "
A second cost is making adversaries bolder. That seems to have happened with the Bosnian Serbs; it certainly happened in 1950 when Dean Acheson seemed to suggest in a National Press Club speech, whether he intended to or not, that the United States would not defend South Korea. The repeated changes in policy on Haiti and Bosnia, the sense that the Administration is engaged in on-the-job training, cannot have sent a message of stern resolve to North Korea.
Bill Clinton, the political child of the Vietnam war, had as his first mentor one of the most eloquent of that war's foes, J. William Fulbright, but he sometimes seems to have learned only half of the lesson the former Senator tried so hard to teach his country.
The Fulbright doctrine held that attempting to project power into areas of secondary interest, where the chances of achieving the desired effect were small, only diminished that power. Such was the case in Vietnam, he said, and Mr. Clinton and his team of advisers, many of them old Vietnam hands, think often about the war.
But Mr. Fulbright wanted to maintain American power, wanted to avoid diminishing it, so that it could be used at the right moment. Failing to do so, failing to check the ambitions of a Hitler or a Stalin (or a Kim Il Sung) is as bad as fighting the wrong battles, if not considerably worse.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS CONSIDERING MILDER SANCTIONS FOR NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Senior Clinton Administration officials have agreed on a plan for North Korea that would put off strict economic sanctions while proceeding with lesser measures intended to deepen the country's diplomatic isolation, Administration officials said today.
They say that by withholding stricter sanctions, the plan is intended to deter North Korea from taking further steps to make nuclear weapons.
 But the plan is likely to draw criticism from some in Congress who charge that Washington has failed to turn its tough talk of punishing North Korea for its nuclear program into action and has backed down in the face of resistance from Japan and other allies. 
 The outlines of the Administration plan, which was worked out at a four-hour White House meeting of Cabinet-level officials and President Clinton on Friday, will defer a cutoff in the hundreds of millions of dollars that Koreans living in Japan send to North Korea.
Senior Administration officials said the emerging approach reflects a general consensus among top officials, but one official cautioned that President Clinton has yet to adopt it.
Administration officials said they hoped to discuss the plan next week at the United Nations and to circulate a sanctions resolution. But they say it may take weeks before the Security Council votes on the measure.
Under the emerging plan, Washington would ask the Security Council to quickly impose some modest sanctions such as barring United Nations technical assistance and stopping scientific and cultural exchanges.
But a cutoff in remittances from Japan, an oil embargo and other tough measures would be held in abeyance and imposed later if the North rejected any constraints on its nuclear program and continued down the nuclear path.
"It is designed to build almost unanimous international pressure on the North Koreans with respect to actions they have already taken and to provide a deterrent against further unwise steps," a senior Clinton Administration official said.
Still, some American officials and Asian diplomats said the plan was weaker than the one initially suggested by Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State who is the Administration's point man on North Korea. They said he initially suggested a quicker cutoff of financial transfers to North Korea, while the Pentagon favored a more gradual approach.
In drafting the plan, Administration officials said they were conscious of two main problems.
Washington believes quick steps are needed to signal international concern over North Korea's decision to destroy evidence of past plutonium production. But officials also believe that some tough economic measures must be kept in reserve to dissuade the North from withdrawing entirely from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, reprocessing fuel it recently removed from its reactor to make new weapons and abandoning restrictions on its nuclear program.
Diplomatic considerations are also influencing Washington. The Administration is trying to design a plan that would avoid a Chinese veto in the Security Council and satisfy Japan, which opposes any fast action to end remittances to North Korea.
While Administration officials said there was broad agreement on the plan, some important elements appear to remain unsettled, including whether an arms embargo would be part of the initial sanctions.
And a senior official also cautioned that Washington would reconsider if North Korea evicted international monitors from its Yongbyon nuclear complex or took other steps to proceed with nuclear development.
North Korea's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday that the agency's two monitors there would have to leave. His remarks came after the agency's board of governors voted to cut off $250,000 in technical assistance to North Korea.
 
Inspectors Remain
 But a spokesman for the agency, an arm of the United Nations, said today that the inspectors remained there and had not been told to leave.
Their presence is important because they can provide a quick alert if the North Koreans begin to move fuel rods from a cooling pond to a plutonium reprocessing plant to make material for nuclear weapons.
If the inspectors are evicted, the agency can still monitor the rods using cameras, which will be less reliable.
The Administration's plan follows consultation with Japan, China, South Korea and other countries.
 
A Matter of Leverage
 Some critics have complained that Washington has moved too slowly and that if the United States wants to get North Korea's attention after a year of unproductive diplomacy it needs to press Japan to immediately cut off money to North Korea, which amounts to between $600 million and $1.6 billion a year. By putting off that sanction, Washington may keep Japan happy, but it is unlikely to persuade Pyongyang that it means business, the critics say.
But in a television appearance on Friday, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, defended the idea of holding tough sanctions in reserve.
"Sanctions are a tool so that we can make sure of several things," she said in an interview on the "MacNeil/ Lehrer Newshour."
One object, she said, was to persuade the North Koreans to come back to the negotiating table and to encourage them to let international monitors try to determine how much plutonium might have been diverted in past years.
"But the more important, or as important, part of this is to protect the future so that we can make sure that they do not have the capability to produce more weapons-grade material and weapons themselves," she added.
She also defended the time the Administration has taken to craft a resolution, saying it was more important to achieve some measure of international consensus than to force a vote at the United Nations.
"It's going to take days, if not weeks, to put the sanctions resolution together," she said
North Korea has reacted harshly to the threat of economic sanctions and has sought to frighten the West, describing such measures as an act of war. Today, a report in a North Korean Government newspaper said support of sanctions would be "an act of self-destruction" for South Korea.

HEADLINE: As Military Pay Slips Behind, Poverty Invades the Ranks

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Like other airmen at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, 21-year-old Jason Edwards worries about tensions far away in North Korea that could erupt into fighting and involve his supply base.
But Airman Edwards has more immediate concerns, too. He is worried about how to feed his 22-year-old wife, Beth, and their two small children on his total pay and allowances of $1,330 a month. In desperation, the Edwardses last month began drawing $228 a month in food stamps to get by. 
 "It's a very tight squeeze for us," Mrs. Edwards said. "We haven't bought any steaks since we've been here, and whenever I want to cook something with ham, I substitute Spam for it."
In a trend that has senior Pentagon officials deeply troubled, an increasing number of military families are turning to food stamps to make ends meet. Three-quarters of America's enlisted forces earn less than $30,000 a year, and the gap between civilian and military wages is growing.
To be sure, no one ever joined the military to get rich. But neither did they expect to have to go on welfare. Military officials worry that a growing demand for food stamps and other Government assistance may signal larger personnel problems in a culture that preaches self-reliance and self-discipline.
The overall number of military personnel on food stamps is small and difficult to measure because the Government does not track military recipients.
But a 1992 survey by the Defense and Agriculture Departments found that about 3 percent of the 1.7 million service members qualified for food stamps and that 1 percent, or about 17,000 people, received them monthly. The Agriculture Department manages the food stamp program.
The Defense Department said the total value of food stamps redeemed at military commissaries increased to $27.4 million last year from $24.5 million in 1992. That amount included those redeemed by retired military recipients. Food donation centers are bustling at bases from Hawaii to Florida.
And in Liberty County, Ga., which serves Fort Stewart, 30 percent of the 2,400 households receiving food stamps each month are military families.
Top military officials voice concern that Pentagon budget cuts in areas like pay could impair both morale and retention of service members. The Clinton Administration tried to freeze military salaries this year and increase them by 1.6 percent for next year. Congress instead approved a 2.2 percent increase for this year and will probably approve a 2.6 percent raise for next year, but neither raise will keep pace with inflation, which is about 3 percent.
"We cannot expect service members to lay their lives on the line when back home their families have to rely on food stamps to make ends meet," said Adm. William A. Owens, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 
Conflict in Cultures
 The vast majority of service members on food stamps are sergeants or below in the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force and petty officers or below in the Navy. The families usually have more than two children, and the spouse does not work. Very few officers qualify for food stamps.
In a culture that promotes a fierce ethic of taking care of one's own, soldiers' reluctant embrace of food stamps and other financial assistance has wounded military leaders.
"We've always told our soldiers that we'll provide for them a quality of life that's at least equal to the civilians for whom they serve," Richard A. Kidd, the Sergeant Major of the Army, the senior enlisted soldier, said in an interview. "It's getting tough to do that now."
For most people who join the armed forces, the lure is not money but adventure, education and patriotism. The military also offers good medical and commissary benefits.
But since 1982, the gap between civilian and military wages has widened to 13 percent, and it is projected to be near 20 percent by the end of the decade. The military wages include housing and other allowances.
At the same time, the rising pace of deployments abroad is placing greater strains on the shrinking number of service members and their families. "There's only so long you can ask them to do more without recognizing it before people just start to leave," said Sydney T. Hickey, associate director of government relations for the National Military Family Association in Alexandria, Va.
In addition, more young people than ever are entering the military with spouses and children -- and added financial burdens.
 
'The Military Poor'
 Seventy percent to 80 percent of all enlisted men and women earn less than $30,000 a year, including housing and food allowances, according to a study by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican on the Armed Services Committee. Among those, 45 percent in the Army and 46 percent in the Marine Corps earn less than $20,000 a year. Mr. McCain coined a new term for these people: "the new military poor."
Specialist Kimberly Southworth, a 29-year-old Army truck mechanic stationed at Schofield Barracks outside Honolulu. She is separated from her husband and living with her three children on post. Specialist Southworth said her monthly income was $1,700, but after taxes and bills, including $6 an hour for baby sitters, she has about $50 left each month.
"I don't like having to apply for food stamps, but I don't have a choice," said Specialist Southworth, who has received $390 a month in food stamps since January 1992. "The cost of living is so high in Hawaii and the pay for my rank is so low. If I didn't have food stamps, I'd be in debt up to my neck."
At the Navy base in Norfolk, Va., Petty Officer 1st Class Gary Benfield and his wife, Suzanne, said they and their four children -- ages 5 months to 7 years -- rely on another Federal program, this one for nursing mothers and children under 5, the Women, Infants and Children program, for $100 a month in food coupons.
Over all, the value of W.I.C. coupons redeemed at military commissaries increased to $15.2 million last year from $12.4 million in 1992. "It bothers me because no employee of the Federal Government should qualify for Federal assistance," Mrs. Benfield said.
Eligibility for food stamps is based on a combination of income, other financial resources and household size. Federal officials say as many as 40 percent of military families on food stamps live in free military housing. They qualify for stamps because their incomes are not raised above the cutoff by the housing and food allowances they would receive if they lived off base.
 
Personal Conditions
 Pentagon spokesmen say the issue is not strictly pay but individual family circumstances. "We don't compensate people for having nine people in their family," said Maj. Bill Buckner, an Army spokesman.
Military officials say they encourage service members with financial problems to take advantage of food stamps, and a variety of other programs, from emergency loans to financial planning seminars. But many families balk at stepping forward for what they consider a handout.
"We've tried to identify them, but they just don't come forward," said Chief Master Sgt. Eddie Morgan, the senior enlisted airman in the 33d Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. "It's a pride thing."
To get around that, the senior enlisted airmen at Eglin manage a fund called Operation Care that distributes $10,000 in yearly donations from other service members to needy families, usually around the holidays. Last year, 247 families, some with as many as seven children, received gifts of $25 for each family member.
Some branches of the military are reluctant to discuss the subject at all. When asked to help contact families on food stamps who would be willing to talk about their plight for this article, a Marine Corps spokeswoman, Lieut. Col. Robin Higgins, declined, saying, "The commandant prefers to emphasize the positive things about the quality of life in the Marine Corps." She was referring to Gen. Carl E. Mundy Jr., the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
 
Paying More Off Base
 So painful is the perceived stigma of using food stamps that some service members pay more to avoid being seen using them. A highly decorated chief petty officer in Norfolk, who received $200 to $400 a month in food stamps from 1982 until 1993, said he and his wife shopped in supermarkets rather than Navy commissaries, even though commissary food prices are on average about 25 percent cheaper.
"We didn't want to be seen by anyone we knew, so we went to the community store even though it was more expensive," said the chief petty officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Defense Department officials say that about 50 percent of military spouses have full-time jobs to help pay the bills. Since military personnel transfer frequently, however, spouses often must start over each move and miss out on promotion opportunities.
Many service members work part-time as fast-food servers, gas station attendants, grocery baggers and hotel-room cleaners. A 22-year-old combat medic in an artillery unit at Fort Carson, Colo., started his second job today as a security guard in a city park. The medic said he needed the $4.25-an-hour weekend job to supplement his $1,000 monthly base pay, not including allowances, to support his wife and their three children, a 2-year-old boy and year-old twin boys.
"When I joined the Army, I expected good benefits, decent pay and job security, just like the commercials say," said the medic, a Persian Gulf war veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it's been a lot harder than I ever imagined."
Commanders expressed concern that working two jobs could hurt military performance. "It's something we pay attention to," said Chief Master Sgt. Mike Burbage, the senior enlisted adviser at Eglin Air Force Base. "But it's tough to tell a guy to quit a job if he needs it to feed his family."

HEADLINE: New York Area Climbs Out of Recession

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
After its worst downturn since the Depression, the economy in and around New York City is once again generating more jobs and higher incomes for a wide array of residents throughout the region.
Initially propelled by Wall Street's prosperity, which has spilled over into other sectors of the economy, the recovery is now being driven by entertainment businesses and the news media, culture and tourism, health services and a resurgence of consumer spending on cars, home furnishings and other big-ticket items. 
 The rebound, borne out by new figures released this month that showed a sharp drop in unemployment in the region, comes after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut lagged far behind much of the rest of the country in coming out of the recession.
The rate of the region's recovery is still slower than in past expansions. Employment gains are being held back by new rounds of layoffs at major corporations like Nynex, which plans to cut almost 17,000 more jobs in the next two years, and further cutbacks expected in the defense industries centered on Long Island and in Connecticut. A critical worry is that Wall Street, which has been a driving force behind the regional recovery, is threatened by unstable financial markets and higher interest rates that may weaken the upturn even before it can gather steam.
Still, for all the negatives, almost everywhere one looks, the economy in the New York region is clearly coming back to life.
On the avenues and side streets of Manhattan south of midtown, all the way to Canal Street, young businesses like the Voyager Company, a publisher of sophisticated CD-ROM disks that moved to New York this year from southern California, are establishing fresh business beachheads in the city.
These new businesses are being joined at street level by dozens of popular specialty stores -- from Bed, Bath and Beyond and Pottery Barn to Comp U.S.A. and Barnes & Noble's flagship bookstore -- that have followed Barney's and ABC Carpet to turn Chelsea and the Flatiron district into New York's snazziest new shopping areas.
And at the remodeled Army Terminal and Navy Yard in Brooklyn, scores of smaller industrial companies, like Edgar Berebi Associates, a rapidly growing jewelry maker, are spearheading a remarkable, if still modest, revival of manufacturing.
The recovery is taking root in the suburbs, too. On South Moger Avenue, the main shopping street of Mount Kisco in Westchester County, a new Starbucks expresso bar opened last weekend, the first suburban link of what may soon be an extensive New York chain of the popular gourmet coffee bars from Seattle.
Hiring by businesses like these has helped add more than 50,000 jobs to the region's economy since the beginning of the year. That figure may be modest, but it represents the first solid gains in the last five years and should lead to a year-over-year rise of more than 1 percent. Roughly 7.5 million people are employed in the 18 counties that make up the metropolitan area.
Unemployment, which averaged 9 percent in 1992 and slightly more than 8 percent in 1993, now appears to be close to 7 percent.
 
A Slow Expansion From Wall Street
 To be sure, the regional economy is a long way from regaining its previous vitality. While the United States economy surpassed its previous employment peak early last year, the New York region has restored only about one in seven of the 750,000 jobs lost in the recession.
Analysts now believe that the region actually began emerging from the recession more than a year ago. The initial improvement, however, was fitful and confined mostly to the plush offices of Manhattan's financial elite and along the edges of the region in the suburban townships of central New Jersey and the commercial centers of affluent Fairfield County, Conn.
Only in the last few months has growing economic activity started to seep into the nooks and crannies of daily life across much of the nation's largest urban conglomeration.
At her day-care center at a church in New Providence in Union County, N.J., for example, Blanca Knoll has recently expanded to the point where she employs up to 19 other people. She is opening a second day-care center in another local church and has started a popular language school to teach Spanish. She started caring for children in her own home in the late 1970's, with just her mother and aunt.
Demand for high-quality child care is strong because more parents are working, said Ms. Knoll, adding, "I've got a waiting list three years long with the names of 80 families." Three couples with children already in her program are on the list even though the women are not even pregnant.
Rail commuting, which closely tracks the economy, is up this year. Traffic on the PATH trains between New Jersey and Manhattan rose 2.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994 and is running almost 10 percent above its low point in late 1991. Both Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road are currently outpacing their 2 percent gains of last year, when the number of passengers rebounded after falling two years in a row.
Business failures in New York City were down sharply in the first quarter, according to Dun & Bradstreet, which reported 444 failures, compared with 635 during the same period in 1992 and 532 last year.
Contrary to popular belief, the economic fates of 17 million residents in the New York metropolitan area now appear more intertwined than ever. This comes despite a vast buildup of shopping centers and offices in outlying areas that broke the physical and emotional connection millions of suburbanites once felt toward New York City, with its dominant business center in Manhattan.
But instead of actually sundering those ties, the exodus of many headquarters and back offices out of Manhattan to the rest of the region helped knit the city and the suburbs together more closely by forging an elaborate network of business relationships and telecommunications links within the metropolitan area.
"More than ever, we're all in this together," said Richard W. Roper, the economic director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "Unlike the past, both the urban core and suburbs entered the recession at about the same time. The sharp pattern of job losses was similar and the timing of the recovery followed in close step. All this suggests a much higher level of regional interdependence than is generally recognized."
The regional recession has already taken its toll on Democratic chief executives in New Jersey and New York City. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who presided while New York State lost more than 500,000 jobs in the hard times, hopes the emerging recovery will help him escape voters' wrath this fall.
 
Where Profits Lead, Taxes Follow
 At the heart of the region's fortunes, for both good and ill, is the financial industry. Just as the stock market crash of October 1987 ushered in the end of New York's economic boom of the 80's and foreshadowed the onset of the severe recession that began in early 1989, the immense wealth generated by Wall Street in the last three years has finally helped pull the local economy out of its slump.
"This is a recovery that started at the top," said Rosemary Scanlon, a leading regional economist who is now deputy state comptroller for New York City, "and then filtered everywhere else with all that money earned on Wall Street kicking around the region."
Nearly one-third of all the wages earned in New York City are produced by the finance, insurance and real-estate sector alone, even though those services account for only 14 percent of the city's jobs.
Local government revenues reflect the nature of the recovery. Profits in banking and securities translated into a 100 percent gain in New York City banking tax receipts in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Sales taxes, which have been depressed for several years, are now expected to rise 6.2 percent for the fiscal year that ends this month. Meanwhile, despite a sharp upturn in leasing, rents are still a bargain and new office construction is practically nonexistent, leaving property and commercial rent taxes to lag $105 million behind expectations.
Randy Gerner, who runs KPF Interior Architects on West 57th Street, can testify to the recent burst in New York business. "In literally the last two months, the number of requests for our services has been phenomenal," he said. "Now that real estate and office rental prices have bottomed out, everybody seems to have decided all at once that this is the time to move."
Known for its stylish office make-overs for companies including Bear, Stearns and Viacom International, KPF's business in New York City has almost doubled in little more than a year, from projects involving about 1.2 million square feet to 2 million square feet today.
While still down from 3.5 million square feet in projects at the height of the 1980's building boom, "we haven't seen the New York atmosphere this active in years," Mr. Gerner said. "It's being driven by investment-banking and entertainment firms."
 
More Money, Travel And New Businesses
 There are other straws in the wind, too.
Air traffic finally took off this winter at the region's three major airports, with passenger traffic up 20 percent in March at Newark International from a year earlier and about 10 percent at both La Guardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports.
State personal-income tax receipts are also up in the region, with Connecticut reporting a 10.7 percent increase for the first quarter, New Jersey up 12.7 percent, and New York registering a more modest 5.9 percent.
Vacancy rates in prime midtown Manhattan office buildings, helped by a 50 percent increase in leasing this winter, fell to 14.5 percent, down from 16.3 percent a year earlier. Except for the Hudson Valley, suffering because of I.B.M.'s retreat, suburban office vacancy rates are also heading down sharply.
Over all, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded in a recent report to Washington that economic developments in New York and New Jersey "were by and large more favorable, suggesting that the pace of economic activity has been picking up."
Voyager, the multi-media publishing company that moved from California, is an example of the new types of businesses that are beginning to cluster in New York. It prides itself that its CD-ROMs, which are used on personal computers and carry titles like "Poetry in Motion" and "The Society of Mind," are not just mindless fun and games.
Together with Interval Research, a computer research center, and Wired, the magazine for the multi-media industry, Voyager is sponsoring a New Voices, New Visions contest. "Do Not Enter," reads a sign at the entrance to its office on lower Broadway, "if you want home shopping, encyclopedias and video games to define the information superhighway."
"The intellectual life here is more exciting than in California," said Robert Stein, who started Voyager a decade ago. "We're surrounded by innovative artists and authors we want to work with and who want to work with us."
 
Some Gaps Widen As Confidence Builds
 Still, there are vast stretches of poor urban areas in New York City, Paterson, N.J., Bridgeport, Conn., and other cities that remain bleak and forbidding zones, largely out of touch with the mainstream economy and dependent mostly on Government support and income from illegal activities. The shift to higher-skilled jobs makes it harder for those areas' residents, mostly minorities, to escape their plight.
And New York, never an easy place to live under the best of circumstances, has become even meaner and harder as the gap between the rich and the poor in the city widened to a point far in excess of anywhere else in the nation.
For all its problems, economists see many more bright spots in the region these days. Even areas like Long Island and Connecticut, hardest hit by the collapse of military orders, are reporting a turnaround.
"The recession is over, and the retail sector is leading a recovery here," said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "But because the process of corporate downsizing has yet to run its course, we're not going to reach our full growth potential for several years."
While several large corporations continue to cut jobs, the hidden strength of the regional economy is its vast array of mid-sized companies. Chemical Bank, which dominates lending to companies with $10 million to $500 million in annual sales, reports that demand for loans improved over the last few months.
"Our customers feel a lot better than they did two years ago," said Frank Lourenso, the Chemical Bank executive responsible for middle-market banking. "It won't be an explosive recovery, but this expansion should build a better foundation than the last one."

HEADLINE: Old Southern Documents Give Lie to Theory of Happy Slaves

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C., June 11

 BODY:
For the past three years a history professor has been unearthing thousands of court documents that he says debunk a popular theory about slavery: that wealthy slave owners were a paternalistic lot who treated slaves like children and that enslaved families stayed together while making the most of their lives by singing and telling stories.
The professor, Loren Schweninger of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, says the long-forgotten records of court petitions and pleadings from slaves and their owners tell of lost loves (slaves were forbidden to marry), broken promises and the selling of babies. 
 For example, Joseph Antoine, a free black in the late 1700's, fell so deeply in love with a Virginia slave that he indentured himself to her master for seven and a half years to gain her freedom. But when the time came to free them both, the master reneged and sold them.
Mr. Antoine sought justice from a chancery court and eventually won. But it was too late. The woman had died enslaved.
The court record that chronicles Mr. Antoine's despair is one of more than 12,500 petitions collected over the past three years by Professor Schweninger from courthouse basements in 10 of the 15 slave-holding states. He has been using $100,000 in grants from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, part of the National Archives, to amass the records, dating from 1775 to 1866.
There was Hannah, an elderly slave in Kentucky who brought only 50 cents at auction in 1830 because of her "age and decrepitude."
And in 1845 in the same state a slave trader sued a man for selling him two babies, a 4-month-old and a 9-month-old, who the trader said were "worth nothing at all" because they were too sick. He had traded a horse, worth about $160, for the babies.
As to the theory of paternalistic owners and happy slaves, Professor Schweninger said: "The harsh realities were different in most cases. The family was under severe, severe strains and the economic aspects are shown so clearly, it's difficult to see the family survive. It's very bleak."
Only one in four white families in the 10 states owned slaves, because they were expensive. Two slaves were often worth more than a man's land, house and all his belongings, according to the records.
"They show the impersonal market forces that were at work everywhere slavery was," Professor Schweninger said. "Even in areas where there were large numbers of free blacks, there was a tremendous pressure pushing them back toward slavery."
In South Carolina, where laws prohibited free blacks from returning if they left the state, a man who had once managed a prominent Charleston hotel pleaded for permission to return to his home state to die.
 
Turner Uprising Survivor
 In Virginia, a petition from a family member sought the return of property swindled from a woman driven crazy from having watched her family killed in the slave uprising led by Nat Turner in 1831. The woman, Harriet Whitehead, had hidden under a bed in her home. In all, more than 50 whites were killed in the uprising.
Professor Schweninger said he stumbled on the documents in Equity and Chancery Courts in the late 1960's while working on a doctoral dissertation about James Rapier, the black Reconstruction leader from Alabama. He found a deed of emancipation for Mr. Rapier's uncle, which told the family's history.
In 1991, Professor Schweninger obtained the first $25,000 grant, which has been annually renewed. He plans to finish his work in the five remaining former slave-holding states by August 1995.
Professor Schweninger will publish an edited version of the collection in two volumes next year. In addition, all the names will be fed into a computer database that can be used by used by genealogists and others.

HEADLINE: Legal Gambling Bedevils Louisiana

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 7

 BODY:
Asked about the indictments and accusations lurking like buzzards around Louisiana's gambling industry, Mary Palmer looked up from her 25-cent Double Dollars slot machine at the Showboat Star Casino recently and gave her best "Does-a-crawfish-love-mud?" shrug.
"It's Louisiana," said Ms. Palmer, a 45-year-old hairdresser from the New Orleans suburb of Harvey. "Louisiana's crooked. It's true. It's a fact. What's to be surprised about?" 
 No one expected an innocent stroll in the moonlight. Louisiana, after all, is famous for its elastic ethics. This is a state that has lurched toward legalizing almost every form of gambling known to man, a state where big-time gambling in America reached its first flower after the Civil War in an infamous $30 million dollar lottery run by ex-Confederate generals.
But with a high-stakes gambler, Edwin W. Edwards, now the Governor and with the indictments of organized-crime figures accused of skimming proceeds from video poker machines, Louisiana's reborn gambling industry is already being viewed inside and outside the state as the gambling boom's train wreck in progress.
 
But Is Louisiana Alone?
 "You just look at what the whole thing represents, there's just one word for it, and that's sick," said William N. Thompson, an expert on the gambling industry at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.
Still, at a time when casino earnings nationally jumped to $10.1 billion in 1992 from $4.2 billion in 1982, the real question may be how much is unique to Louisiana and how much reflects the state's brassy tradition of doing flamboyantly what other places like to do furtively.
Last week, 17 men with links to organized crime were charged with plotting to skim profits from some of the 13,256 video poker machines proliferating in bars and truck stops around the state. Since November, a grand jury in Baton Rouge has been investigating how the state awards licenses for riverboat casinos amid allegations that political ties are more important than economic merit. The grand jury has heard from Governor Edwards once and expects to call him again, although there is no indication he is a target of the investigation.
There have been new reports about the way his four children have tried to get casino business, with one of them handling business inquiries from the Governor's Mansion and another involved in negotiations with his father at the mansion over a disputed gambling license.
The companies that have obtained the 13 riverboat casino licenses that the state has granted thus far have been laced with longtime Edwards friends and associates; moreover, the Governor's son Stephen is the lawyer for four of the companies.
Governor Edwards has said that his children did nothing improper, but aside from Stephen Edwards's legal representation, the children have agreed to stop their business transactions with casinos.
 
Edwards a Gambling Winner
 There is also Mr. Edwards's $308,000 in casino gambling winnings last year; the wild scramble to get a piece of what is scheduled to be the world's biggest casino in New Orleans, and a top New Orleans police official dismissed after it was disclosed he had also been working for a video poker company in Las Vegas.
It might have seemed like business as usual when the president of the State Senate, Sammy Nunez, ambled through the chambers the other day handing out $2,500 campaign contributions from one of the state's gambling boat owners.
But critics say the combination of back-scratching politics and boatloads of casino money are creating the potential for corruption that is off the charts even by Louisiana standards. "It's huge amounts of money interacting with bad old-fashioned Louisiana politics," said State Representative David Vitter, a Republican, who has been one of the Legislature's few outspoken critics of gambling. "That's a very deadly combination."
Proponents of the industry say the public relations may be bad, but the process is not.
 
'We've Been Flamboyant'
 "These are highly regulated companies," said Steve Rittvo, a gambling industry consultant in New Orleans. "They will not take a chance in doing something that is illegal or really unethical for fear they're going to lose their licenses in other locations. I don't think we've done anything wrong. I think we've been flamboyant."
Governor Edwards, who has been regarded as the ringmaster of the gambling circus, took pains this week to stand up for his own integrity when he stunned state legislators by announcing he would not run for a fifth term. "Regardless of what was said, I went by the rules and obeyed the rules," he said.
And, for all the furor, it appears Louisiana has cut a tough deal with gambling operations. Because of Louisiana's higher tax rate, the four riverboat casinos already operating provided the state with $44 million in tax money for the first four months of the year, while the 24 casinos in Mississippi contributed only $36 million to that state.
 
Big Casino Opening Delayed
 There are at least five major areas of concern in Louisiana: the chaotic licensing process and bitter legal battles that have stymied the land-based casino in New Orleans; the involvement of Mr. Edwards's family; allegations that political insiders have had the upper hand in securing licenses for riverboat gambling; the video poker indictments and the games' willy-nilly spread, and a disjointed regulatory process some say has made gambling in Louisiana almost impossible to regulate.
Louisiana's Legislature approved a single land-based casino in New Orleans in 1992. A temporary casino that was expected to open in the spring is now scheduled for December. The permanent casino will not be open until a year after that at the earliest.
"I can imagine going back to Edwards's election, and having him say, 'Listen, folks, I want to have legalized gambling, and I want the casino run by 10 of my best friends,' " said a lawyer in one of anti-casino lawsuits, Thomas Tucker. "Ninety-five percent of the people would have said, 'No.' But that's what happened."
A broad concern is that the state has established a toothless, disjointed regulatory framework in which each form of gambling is regulated by a separate body. Almost everyone agrees that events thus far have not inspired confidence.
"The surprise isn't that all this is happening, but that it all happened so quickly," said C. B. Forgotson, who last year represented the state's anti-casino forces. "I went to Houston recently to talk to some folks who are worried about casino gambling there. I told them I now know exactly what to do, because we've done everything wrong here."

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Plant's Expansion Raises Neighbors' Concerns About Safety

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORKED RIVER, N.J., June 9

 BODY:
Several hundred yards from the giant concrete cube that houses the nuclear reactor of the Oyster Creek electric generating station, Scott Hook, 32 years old, whipped a baited fishing line into the middle of the plant's wide discharge canal and waited for a bite.
Water used to cool the reactor and tons of nuclear waste stored inside the plant is about 10 degrees warmer in the canal than in Barnegat Bay, where it is headed, a condition that attracts baitfish and larger fish like striped bass that feed on them. 
 "I eat a lot of fish out of here, and I ain't glowed yet," joked Mr. Hook, repeating a line heard from oldtimers: that the danger of a nuclear plant as a neighbor is overstated.
 
New Fears Over Safety
 Recently, however, there is less joking and more nervous grumbling about the safety of the 25-year old Oyster Creek plant, located about midway between New York City and Philadelphia, the oldest operating nuclear plant in 11 northeastern states.
The change in attitude has been focused around the recent decision by GPU Nuclear Corporation, which operates the 630-megawatt plant for Jersey Central Power and Light Company, to open a $15 million storage site in concrete bunkers outside the plant's current containment building. The bunkers would be closer to Route 9, a busy highway paralleling the Garden State Parkway along most of the Jersey Shore.
Without the "dry" storage capacity, the plant would run out of storage space by 1996 and would be forced to shut down, company officials say; with it, the plant can continue operating until its license expires in 2009. Moreover, there is new worry here that the site will remain a storage depot for nuclear waste long after the plant stops generating electricity.
 
A Change in Attitudes
 A permit for the change in storage was granted by Lacey Township, where the plant's 1,416 acres are located. But anti-nuclear advocates and some local officials recently filed suit in Superior Court to force the township to review the action, on the grounds that no environmental impact statement was required.
The suit reflects a change in attitudes about Oyster Creek, which have always been dominated by the economic benefits provided by the plant -- 960 jobs and some $10 million in local taxes annually.
In recent years many new residents have moved into the waterfront communities and retiree villages in the eastern reaches of Ocean County, with much of the recent growth in the Forked River area, about 80 miles south of New York City. The county's population has doubled to about 450,000 residents since the Oyster Creek plant began operations in 1969.
The increased population, combined with summer congestion, have added to concern about evacuation along crowded shore routes in case of a nuclear accident. And many of the new residents have fewer economic ties to, and more questions about, the Oyster Creek plant.
"I have a real problem with them sticking plutonium on the side of Route 9," said Tim O'Connor, a professional planner who lives about four miles from the site. "Isn't that what's behind all the trouble we are having with North Korea, accounting for the plutonium in their nuclear plants?"
 
Terrorists Discounted
 While plant officials say there is plutonium in the stored waste (about six parts per thousand, or 12 pounds for every ton), they say ample safeguards are being taken to protect the bunkers from potential terrorists, or natural or manmade disasters.
Mr. O'Connor was one of about 100 local people who turned out for a meeting tonight on the plant held in the neighboring town of Berkeley. Its Mayor, Bill Zimmerman, a party to the suit, said he opposed keeping the plant and wanted leaders of other towns to present their views at a meeting he hoped to arrange.
No problems are expected in the transition to dry storage, said Keith M. Bromery, an Oyster Creek spokesman. He said radioactive waste removed from the spent-fuel pool would be packed in helium, to inhibit corrosion, and sealed inside 15-foot steel canister assemblies placed in outside vaults protected by three-foot thick walls of concrete.
Twenty vaults could eventually hold 2,600 assemblies, each weighing about 900 pounds, representing all the uranium-235 and its byproducts used over the 40-year lifetime of the reactor, he said.
The vaults are seen as temporary storage, but the Federal Government is still at least 15 years away from creating an underground national nuclear fuel repository at a proposed site at Yucca Mountain, Nev.
In case that option does not materialize, the N.R.C. has issued a general permit allowing plants like Oyster Creek to continue storing the canister assemblies up to 120 years. Skeptics say that the assemblies at Oyster Creek are not fitted for transportation off the grounds.
 
Reactor a Main Concern
 It was clear from the tone of the meeting that the safety of the reactor itself, not the storage adjunct, was what concerned most people.
The plant's reactor is one of 15 still operating around the country that were identified in a Nuclear Regulatory Commission report last year as possibly subject to failing metal strength before their licensing terms expired. Another veteran reactor, Yankee Rowe in Massachusetts, was retired last year for this reason.
Federal officials notified Jersey Central two months ago that a review found "no abnormal concerns" with the reactor's wall.
Nonetheless, beginning in September, the reactor will undergo extensive ultrasonic inspections for cracks and other flaws, Ron Hernan, a senior N.R.C. project engineer in Washington, said in an interview.
At tonight's meeting, two officials of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a clearinghouse in Washington for groups concerned with nuclear safety, questioned whether an aging boiling-water reactor like the one here could contain a potentially disastrous meltdown.
Paul Gunter, director of the Washington group's Reactor Watchdog Project, called Oyster Creek "one of the most controversial plants in the country" and said deficiencies in its 1960's design "continue to plague it."
Instead of addressing the danger, he said, the commission has called the chance of a meltdown remote.
But Jerry Beer, a mechanic with 19 years of service at the Oyster Creek plant, said Mr. Gunter was distorting quotes from the N.R.C.'s experts.
Newcomers, he said after the meeting, should not have been surprised to find they had bought a house next to a nuclear power plant with a venting stack as high as the Washington Monument. "They either should not have moved here or, once here, keep quiet," he advised.
 
Fearing the Unknown
 Residents of the area have mostly followed his advice. Dan Siracusa, a retired New York Housing Authority worker, said he was untroubled by the talk. "Everyone's dealt with it this long, so I don't know what the fuss is about," said Mr. Siracusa, 67, as he sat on a railroad trestle and reeled in fish from the discharge canal.
"Some people tend to be scared of anything they don't understand," mused Joe Ruiz, an insurance broker from Colonia, N.J., who lives on a boat at the Southwinds Harbour marina several months of the year.
A neighbor in the marina, Richard Morehouse from Chatham Township, a retired clothing executive who lives aboard a 38-foot sailboat, said he had confidence in the safety of nuclear technology. "They do their normal shutdowns and inspections and I trust them," he said.
Willie deCamp, president of the Izaak Walton League of Ocean County, an environmental group, had a different view.
"The risks we feel are evident at Oyster Creek are not ones faced only by people at the Shore," he said. "We are just 80 miles from New York. Ask people in Kiev, which is 50 miles from Chernobyl, if they feel lucky to have survived that disaster because the wind was blowing the other way."

HEADLINE: At S.R.O.'s, Quality Varies Yet Squalor Is Common

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
They range from the squalid, degrading and dangerous at the bottom to the spare, poor but reasonably clean and safe at the top.
At 111th Street just off of Riverside Drive, for example, the exterior of one building housing mostly destitute single men afflicted with AIDS is so well maintained that it blends into a gracious neighborhood of co-ops and brownstones. 
 On West 17th Street, by contrast, is a place of drugs, crime and prostitution, of dangling wires, unattached radiators and scabrous walls.
On West 45th Street, diagonally across the street from the Martin Beck Theater, where "Guys and Dolls" is being performed, is the Longacre Hotel. It is a place of tiny rooms but clean hallways and bathrooms where, as one staff member put it, "There is no drug dealing here -- never."
All three buildings are single-room-occupancy hotels, generally known as S.R.O.'s, and they demonstrate that there is a certain variety in the quality of this particular form of housing, which the city defines as a building for single people in which the residents share baths, toilets and, sometimes, small kitchens.
 
The Kenmore's Owner
 Last week, the largest S.R.O. in the city, the Kenmore on East 23d Street, was seized by Federal authorities because it had become infested with drug dealers who were terrorizing residents. But the man who owns the Kenmore, Tran Dinh Truong, also owns the Longacre, a building in reasonably good condition which seems at the opposite end of the S.R.O. scale from the Kenmore, which he had evidently allowed to deteriorate.
In general, residents, building managers and officials at social service agencies, which often use S.R.O.'s to house their clients, characterize the Kenmore as unusually squalid and dangerous, more so than almost any other building of the same type. But even though other S.R.O.s are generally not as bad as the Kenmore -- and even though some stand out as efficiently run and are regularly cleaned -- the typical S.R.O. is still rundown and depressing, with some having conditions of filth and danger similar to those found at the Kenmore.
"The Kenmore is reasonably typical, but it is the bottom of the barrel," said Gene M. Estess, executive director of The Jericho Project, a nonprofit organization that provides housing and services for homeless and indigent people in several S.R.O.s on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
For many, S.R.O.'s are often the last thread saving them from a life on the streets. Mired in controversy for decades because of their often poor conditions, homeless advocates nevertheless acknowledge that they often provide a vital function in housing people who are unable to afford a place to live. Their tenants are often people on the margins who are dependent on government help or, sometimes, the underground economy, which can make these buildings breeding grounds for crime.
"The saddest thing about these buildings is that most of the elderly persons in them are afraid," he said. "Inasmuch as these places are dumping grounds for people who are really down and out in New York City, then inevitably things are going to happen that will scare the hell out of the elderly."
Among the problems at many S.R.O.'s are deteriorating physical conditions, rats, mice and roaches. A man at an S.R.O. on West 107th Street, just off Broadway, described as common the menacing people in the hallways who do not live in the building, drug use in the rooms, thefts in rooms with chronically broken locks, the yelling and the banging of mentally disturbed people, and a pervasive seediness.
"But it's O.K.," the man, who would not give his full name, said of the brick building he has lived in since November. "It's not the best, but there are worse places, believe me."
In all, according to an official at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, there are more than 40,000 rooms in S.R.O.'s in the city, a substantial reduction from the 52,000 rooms in 1986 and more than 100,000 in previous decades.
 
Demand Is High, Supply Low
 S.R.O.'s in New York have had a long and often troubled history. Many of the current S.R.O.'s were once reputable apartment houses or hotels that were converted to single-room buildings to accommodate the flood of single workers who came to the city during and after World War II. When the demand for new apartments began rising in the 1970's, many were converted to ordinary rental buildings or co-ops. In 1983, the city, worried about the shortage of cheap, single-room housing, imposed a moratorium on such conversions, but the courts struck down the moratorium in 1989.
Meanwhile, with the drug epidemic, the advent of AIDS, and the increase in homelessness during the 1980's, S.R.O.'s became places where destitute and indigent people, including many elderly people, ended up. Some of these tenants were mentally unstable or used drugs, creating dangerous living conditions.
Social welfare agencies that place people in S.R.O.'s find themselves in a curious position. On the one hand, they are critical of the conditions prevailing in many of these buildings. On the other, they do not want the authorities to close them down, because they are, in many cases, the only places left to house the drug the homeless and the AIDS patients who have no place else to go.
"Some are in horrible shape," said Elizabeth Kane, the director of West Side S.R.O. Project, a private group that tries to improve conditions for S.R.O. residents. "But this is housing of last resort for poor, single adults who would otherwise be homeless."
In unannounced visits to S.R.O.'s in Manhattan, many were found to be in far better condition than the Kenmore, even though every one of the dozen or so buildings suffered from cramped conditions and a seediness that no amount of new paint or cleaning could cover up.
"The management really makes a big difference," Mr. Estess said. "You can have a building that's poor, but if you keep out the criminal element, you can be all right.
"But, when management allows drug dealers to set up inside, then everybody is high, everybody is a danger, and the little people huddle fearfully in their rooms."
The building on 610 West 111th Street, the one that is virtually indistinguishable from others on the street, is run with firm control by Sajid Ali, an immigrant from Pakistan who is both part owner and manager. About 80 percent of its 87 rooms are occupied by single people who are H.I.V. positive, Mr. Ali said, adding that most of them were homeless men placed in the hotel by the Department of AIDS Services, which pays their rent of $210 a week.
 
The Tour of the Hotel
 Mr. Ali showed a visitor through the hotel, asking residents to open their rooms for inspection. The hallways were clean. Each cluster of rooms had a bathroom and a small kitchen, which, Mr. Ali said, are cleaned twice a day. The rooms were very small and unadorned. There were beds on metal frames, stained carpets, small chests of drawers.
"The most important thing is that the front of the place be clean," Mr. Ali said. "This is an expensive neighborhood and we don't want our people hanging around outside.
"There is nobody selling drugs," Mr. Ali continued, "but most of them are drug users and they can walk two blocks to Amsterdam Avenue and buy what they want."
Downtown, an S.R.O. at 105 West 17th Street is in far worse condition. In fact, neighborhood residents have issued public statements complaining that the building is, as one press release put it, "overrun by crack dealers and prostitutes."
 
<gfcrossline>No Lock or Doorknob
 The front door has no lock or doorknob. The vestibule door, adorned by a no soliciting sign, is off its hinges. Anybody can walk into the building unchallenged, and, according to some residents, many of the rooms are occupied by squatters who did just that.
Extension cords have been attached to the exit sign and used to carry electricity into the rooms. The plumbing leaks onto exposed wires that dangle from ceilings. Tenants complain that there is no heat and usually no hot water. The walls and ceilings have flaking paint. Pools of water lie on the bathroom floors. Shower fixtures are nonexistent. The bathtubs have large black stains.
"There's too much drugs," said Mirabel Baez, who has lived in the building since 1979. "There's no heat. The walls would collapse if you pushed on them. The toilets work one day a week so you have to run up and down the stairs to find a toilet you can use. There are people who are sick."
 
S.R.O.: Single Room Occupancy
S.R.O. stands for Single Room Occupancy and is considered by the city to be housing where tenants have single rooms but share bathrooms or kitchens.
Beyond that definition there are housing types that are sometimes grouped with S.R.O.'s, including Class B hotels, which do not have full baths but sometimes provide linen and maid service; rooming houses, and Section 248 S.R.O.'s, units in former tenement buildings that have been converted to S.R.O.'s.
In the 1980's, when the city was overwhelmed with homeless families, many hotels, like the Holland and Martinique in Manhattan, were used as emergency housing for homeless families with children.
Many of the places the city used were decrepit and dangerous, but had room rates that were affordable. These came to be known as welfare hotels.
Most tenants of S.R.O.'s are poor, single adults.
Each year the Rent Guidelines Board sets rent increases for long-term tenants of S.R.O.'s.

HEADLINE: Korean Worries Transcend the Bomb

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 9

 BODY:
The plot of this country's best-selling thriller seems right out of the evening news. South Korea's longtime enemy threatens it with annihilation, and the Government in Seoul, after deceiving the White House and the C.I.A., secretly develops its own nuclear weapon in self-defense. Overheated oratory and misguided diplomacy eventually lead to war, and to protect its factories and airfields from bombing the South launches its first nuclear missile.
But in "The Rose of Sharon Has Blossomed," the enemy invader is Japan, and the Americans prove to be useless wimps, unwilling to live up to their treaty obligations to defend South Korea. In a triumph of Korean nationalism over ideology, the capitalist South is saved by an alliance with the Communist Government in North Korea, which contributes its own nuclear expertise to save the Korean Peninsula. 
 The novel's success -- the tale is spread over three volumes that have sold a total of 2.7 million copies -- says much about South Korea's nervous ambivalence these days as to who is its real enemy. On the streets of Seoul, many South Koreans say they simply do not believe the North Korean Government of Kim Il Sung would use nuclear weapons -- if it has them -- against other Koreans. And even many who denounce the North's Government as a crazed and desperate regime wonder aloud about the motives of the American talking heads who, from the safety of Washington, beam into their living rooms talking about preparing for war.
 
Worry Increases Overseas
 One of the many oddities of the North Korean nuclear standoff, from its start several years ago, is that the sense of crisis increases the farther one is from Korea.
The Europeans and the United States have been the most insistent on taking a hard line, saying the future of limiting the spread of nuclear weapons is at stake. The Japanese, Chinese and Russians, all within missile range, have shared one idea above all others: Preserve the status quo, because anything else is too horrible to contemplate. And the South Korean Government has swung wildly from conciliation to hardline -- this has been a hard-line week -- prompting the country's leading newspaper to say that President Kim Young Sam "has no consistent principle on this issue."
Principles may be hard to come by because the confrontation with the North has conjured up a contradictory mix of national emotions, and a sense that Korea, once again, is becoming the playground of bigger powers with their own agendas. Lee Hong Koo, a scholar and now the country's Minister of Unification, laughed the other day when a visitor mentioned the popular trilogy.
"I have to admit, though, it hits every insecurity in the South Korean psyche," Mr. Lee said. "The small-country mentality, the fear of being a pawn of bigger powers, the Japanese. It's all there."
 
Easy Artillery Range
 That is hardly to say no one is worried about the North Koreans. A few months ago people waved off the threat; these days they are a little twitchy, wondering if the North might possibly mean what it says when it declares that economic sanctions would constitute an act of war.
Before, people would say that when you live in a city within easy artillery range of the Demilitarized Zone and only a 10-minute flight for North Korean bombers, one or two untested nuclear weapons didn't seem to change the equation much. Now, as the Government is checking thousands of underground air raid shelters to see if they are stocked with water, no one seems quite so sure.
In Seoul's prosperous financial district, workers say that while they are worried about the North, they are more worried the United States will mishandle the talks and push the North into a corner.
"When you think about the size of their economy and ours, I think the chances of the North attacking the South are not so high," Kim Kwang Hyung, a computer salesman, said the other day. "If they have a bomb, it is just for diplomatic advantage. But if we all push too hard, they may strike out."
 
Fear of Reunification
 War scenarios aside, what really scares people about economic sanctions against the North is that they just might work -- causing the Government in Pyongyang to collapse and speeding a ruinously expensive, socially disruptive reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
Long gone are the days when ordinary South Koreans talked dreamily of reunification, when the DMZ would be wiped away and families torn apart by war four decades ago would reunite once more. While reunification is still the supreme national goal and the source of endless political platitudes, it was easier to talk about when it did not seem like a real possibility.
Now the nuclear confrontation has made that possibility seem even more real, and the talk is about a "soft landing," -- that is, a reunification that comes with a minimum of costs and social disruptions.
Every Government study has suggested that in fact the costs would be staggering, far greater than the price of reunifying Germany. Though the North was by far the richer of the two through the early 1960's -- it got the rich natural resources, and the United States thought the South would be a perpetual basket case -- in pure economic terms South Korea now grows a new North Korea every year.
 
High Costs and Refugees
 So it is no surprise that when television programs here talk about reunification, the heartwarming stuff of sisters and brothers finding each other quickly gives way to more practical concerns. What will happen when cheap Northern labor floods the market, pulling down South Korean wages? Who will handle millions of refugees pouring into Seoul, an island of wealth 30 miles from the DMZ? Who will pay for rebuilding the decayed infrastructure of the North?
In Japan, many ask the same questions. The Government in Tokyo, never known for its generosity when it comes to taking in immigrants, is already struggling with contingency plans in case North Korean boat people come ashore.
"The reason everyone in Asia is handling the nuclear issue so gingerly is that no one in the area wants a collapse," Sung Chul Yang, a political science professor at Kyunghee University and author of one of the most detailed comparative studies of the North and South Korean political systems. "But they all know that if we push the North, we are precipitating collapse.
But there is another level to the arguments, a sense among some South Koreans that the confrontation is being directed by outside powers. The suspicion is often directed at the Japanese, who first invaded the Korean Peninsula in 1592 and colonized it for the first half of the 20th century.
 
Japan Seen as Threat
 These days, polls consistently show that South Koreans view Japan as a bigger long-term threat to the country than the North. Some prominent South Koreans voice the opinion, usually in private, that Japan would like to see Korea remain divided because, once unified, it would become a far tougher competitor.
"The collapse of North Korea has to happen some time," Oh Yun Joon, the president of a small pharmaceutical company, said the other day on his way back from lunch in Seoul's financial district. "But we don't want a lot of pain and suffering, because in the end the national power of the Korean people will be lessened."
Similarly, young people here often express suspicion that the United States has its own agenda, and that it is using the Korean situation to reassert militarily the influence it has lost in Asia economically.
Some of this may be paranoia in a country that has always been overwhelmed by more powerful neighbors. But even South Korean officials who are delighted with the cooperation of Washington and Tokyo in facing down the North say the various sides are driven by very different motives.
"We all see this through a different lens," a senior South Korean official who has been dealing with the North's nuclear program since the late 1980's, said here this week.
"Washington cares about the nonproliferation treaty, especially because it is up for renewal next year," he said, referring to the 24-year-old treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear arms. "It is worried about how to prevent the export of nuclear weapons to other places, places it is going to have to police."
"The North Koreans could care less about the treaty," he said. "For them, the issue is their relationship to the South. One or two bombs, or the plutonium for it, is sufficient in the North Korean mind to make a new North-South balance of power. They are not irrational. They know that anything beyond that, a truly big nuclear arsenal would incite a huge reaction from the U.S."
And the Japanese? "What you would expect," he said. "Wars are bad for exports."

HEADLINE: German Postal Union Is Resisting Benefit-Cutting Plans

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, June 11

 BODY:
Workers' benefits have to be cut to improve Germany's economic competitiveness, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government and its big business allies keep saying.
But determined resistance by labor unions this week against plans to slim down postal and telecommunications services before privatization showed this is easier said than done. 
 The Government plans to turn postal services, telephone and telecommunications and the postal bank, with their 670,000 employees, over to the private sector beginning next year. But those plans were thrown into doubt when negotiations with the Postal Union over post-privatization fringe benefits broke down Thursday.
On Friday, as millions of letters piled up in post offices closed by a wave of strikes called by the union, newspapers began reporting what the unions said they were battling to save after privatization. About 300,000 of the employees are civil servants with lifetime job security who are barred by law from striking. They have not taken part in the strikes.
A negotiator for the Postal Union, Gunter Heidorn, said the employees' organization opposed the privatization plan, which the Government hoped to get approved by Parliament on June 29.
The Government, he said, was trying to force "a massive cut in our standards of welfare" and reduce the number of seats employees have on worker-management councils of the private enterprises. About 90 percent of postal employees take home only about $350 a week, the union says.
It appeared to be counting on support from the opposition Social Democratic Party, which could block approval.
The most important of the union demands, spokesmen said, was the guarantee of a clear basis for employees' pensions and health insurance funds after private industry takes over.
Some things accepted as normal by all German workers and undreamed-of by most Americans are not even in dispute now, like an extra month's salary at Christmas and a vacation pay bonus. After privatization, postal employees would have to negotiate for the vacation bonus with their employers, but so far the Christmas bonus has been sacrosanct, even in private industry.
But the Government wants to keep private buyers from being frightened away by the need to guarantee such longtime benefits to postal workers as these:
*A cold soft drink for postal employees in hot weather, when the outside temperature exceeds 80 degrees.
*A warm beverage for employees working outside when the weather is colder than 14 degrees Fahrenheit.
*Funeral-wreath payments for families of employees and retirees -- $100 in summer, and $112 in winter.
*Interest-free salary advances of up to $3,000 for newlyweds.
A spokeswoman for the postal service said that some additional benefits would continue for existing employees, but that management would not guarantee them indefinitely.
These include such things as 90,000 subsidized rental apartments in Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and other big cities for low-paid employees.
The postal authorities also keep 3,200 places in 12 German summer vacation resorts for low-income employees, and underwrite 7,000 places in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France and the Netherlands.
"These self-designated employees' representatives apparently think cold drinks and a vacation on the Cote d'Azur are more important than future guaranteed jobs," said Helmut Ricke, chairman of Telekom, the German telecommunications giant.
Telekom, the postal service and the postal bank were split off as separate entities at the beginning of 1990 to set the stage for privatization. Next year, all three are to be converted to joint stock companies.
Unions and Government negotiators are to resume talks on Sunday night.

HEADLINE: Time Out From Bond Market Craziness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a psychiatrist and avid investor, I read with interest Thomas J. Friedman's "A Bond Market That Could Use a Psychiatrist" (Market Watch, May 22). In the old days, a psychiatric patient would go to an analyst for many years, spending four or five hours a week on the couch. It was expected that through extensive exploration of the unconscious mind patients would develop insight into the nature of their essence and that this process was therapeutic. Today, however, in the age of information superhighways, "900" numbers and Prozac, the need for ever quicker, painless fixes is the mode. 
 Likewise, in the old days investors would buy stocks and bonds, hold them over time and achieve a steady, regular inflation-beating return. Today, with derivatives and super-derivatives, the search for increasing returns and the technology to move vast sums, we have stopped searching for meaning and insight.
As it is with therapy, it is with investing: today, the baby-boomer generation just doesn't want to do the work necessary to understand the nature of markets. With knee-jerk responses to everything but the fundamentals, the bond market will continue its wild ride. What we need is to take a time out, evaluate the economic fundamentals and invest accordingly. If not, the craziness will continue.

HEADLINE: Students Care Far Too Much About Grades;
Love of Knowledge

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Making the Grades" (editorial, June 5) makes professors like me who opposed the change in Stanford's grading -- to restore the failing grade and to award C's and D's -- seem obstacles to intellectual life, opponents of excellence by students, lazy and dishonest, "pandering to consumers." A fine tribute, in my case, to 33 years of teaching at Stanford! 
 We were arguing that a record of achievement, rather than a historical record that includes failure and late withdrawal from courses as well as achievement, has served Stanford's students well and that the "dazzling" student transcripts -- not all of them dazzling -- are far from being "misleading" because they announce that they are precisely a record of achievement. We believe that potential employers, deans of graduate and professional schools and committees awarding scholarships need to know what our students know, not what they are ignorant of.
If our transcripts were perceived as misleading, our students would not, for example, have won this year alone six Marshall Scholarships, two Truman Scholarships and one Churchill Scholarship. I served on the California Rhodes Scholarship Committee for six years, and no one ever questioned the integrity of a Stanford transcript. If our transcripts were perceived as misleading, our students would not be accepted, as they are, in first-rate graduate and professional schools and, despite the bad job market, in good jobs.
Failure and late withdrawal from courses are usually the result of intellectual curiosity gone awry: students realize toward the end of a busy quarter, sometimes not soon enough, that they have taken on too many courses. I would rather have them take on too much than play safe by taking only the courses they know they can pass.
As for grade inflation, I'm not sure it exists in the fields I know. Our students are extremely bright. Admitting 1,600 undergraduates from a pool of more than 14,000 and, in the English department, 12 graduate students from more than 500 explains why we have bright students.
If, in a class of a reasonable size, I can't get achievement up to a level where students deserve a B or an A, I am a poor teacher. Your argument that students have a "false sense of their own worth" because they have been "operating in a mistake-proof system" is fatuous. Students know when they have failed and internalize a sense of failure without needing it inscribed on a piece of paper.
The unfortunate consequence of Stanford's debate and change, and the publicity that it has received is that students will become more conscious of grades as motives for learning. Love of knowledge, not fear of failure, should be the motive for learning that teachers at every level should encourage. In every other respect, Stanford's new policy and your editorial are solutions seeking a problem.

HEADLINE: Students Care Far Too Much About Grades;
Bring Back the C

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Making the Grades" (June 5) is a true and timely editorial. Grade inflation, however, has not inflicted equal injury upon all parties. The smartest undergraduates may now need an A+, but they still are admitted to the best graduate schools. The "gentleman C" student may have become a gentleperson B-, but he or she still receives the treasured diploma and cares for little else. 
 It is the considerable number of hard-working high achievers who have suffered by our overgenerosity. When I began teaching in 1966, B or B+ was an honorable grade, evidence of intelligence, understanding and steady effort. The grade of B+ now indicates either dullness or just exactly nothing at all. Students who 25 years ago would have been delighted by a B+ are now insulted by it and don't hesitate to say so.
Stanford's restoration of the F will probably have little effect; national restoration of the C might benefit us all.

HEADLINE: GET IN LINE FOR SUMMER JOBS

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
WITH an infectious smile, youthful optimism and a disarming knack for conversation, 18-year-old Shawn Thomas seemed a model candidate the other day when he walked into the Manhattan office of the New York State Department of Employment in search of a summer job.
He had done everything right. Having checked for job listings at Julia Richman High School, where he will graduate in two weeks, he then canvassed clothing stores and restaurants in his South Bronx neighborhood. On this day, looking sharp in a denim jacket and sport shirt, he had set out on his own for Manhattan, saying he was determined to "go where the jobs are." 
 So impressed was his job counselor that she sent Mr. Thomas to two interviews the same day: for sales positions at the Gap and the Sharper Image. But more than a week later, he is still waiting to hear back from both stores and confronting the harsh reality of youth employment in New York City.
"There is so much competition," said Iris Burroughs, the counselor who interviewed Mr. Thomas. "Even when somebody stands out, like Shawn, you know that employers will have lots of others to choose from."
Although his experience so far has done little to shake Mr. Thomas's buoyant self-confidence -- "He is sure to find something," insisted Ms. Burroughs -- Mr. Thomas has become part of a huge population of 16- to 22-year-old New Yorkers who are scrambling for work in what may be the glummest summer, jobwise, in many years.
For decades, the market for summer jobs, as well as part-
time, after-school employment, has been worse in New York City than elsewhere in the nation. But the outlook has darkened in the last five years, as the city's economy has moved from deep recession to prolonged slump and more than 350,000 adult workers have lost their jobs.
"This is the bleakest aspect of the city economy," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not only does the lack of work deny young people income to pay school expenses, and in many cases to help support struggling families, he said, it leaves them unprepared for the adult working world and vulnerable to the lures of drugs or other criminal activity.
Still, with summer vacation just weeks away, many jobs do remain unfilled. And while many will involve simple and repetitive tasks, performed at the minimum wage of $4.25
an hour, New York does offer some of the best summer jobs anywhere in the country.
That is because of the city's vast concentration of multinational corporations, communications organizations, arts groups and other large companies able to provide teen-agers with invaluable experience just by giving them a foot in the door.
In almost all cases, the best jobs go to young people who can demonstrate a winning combination of good academic records, experience in volunteer or part-time work and a keen sense of ambition that makes them stand out from the crowd.
"You've got to start young and pound the pavement," said Dawn Monik Coleman, a 20-year-old honors student from Crown Heights, who began her search for summer jobs four years ago and since then has been among the winners in the city's youth-employment sweepstakes.
For the last two summers, she has worked in film production for ABC Television in Manhattan, first as an assistant for a series of Barbara Walters specials, then as a summer intern for the program "20/20."
But even Ms. Coleman, who three weeks ago finished her freshman year at Morgan State University in Baltimore and made the dean's list, had to start low on the summer-jobs ladder: She spent the year before her first job with ABC as a volunteer in Crown Heights, first as a clerk and a dance instructor for a community center, then as a tutor for elementary-school children in her church.
Ms. Coleman learned about, and applied for, the jobs at ABC through the city's largest summer-employment initiative, the New York Partnership's Summer Jobs program, which places thousands of young people at large corporations like Time Warner and NYNEX, along with a broad spectrum of smaller companies, stores and service organizations.
But in one of many reflections of the problems facing young job seekers, the Partnership program, despite its support from the city's business elite, has been shrinking.
Last year the program had 380 companies participating and placed young people in 36,000 jobs, according to Nelson Smith, a vice president of the New York City Partnership. That followed two years of steep decline: in the summer of 1991, the program found jobs for 45,000 young people with 508 companies.
This year, Mr. Smith said, the number of jobs that will be filled remains unknown as the Partnership mounts a last-minute rush to recruit corporate employers.
"We are hoping for more than last year, but it is too early to tell," he said. Even though no more sweeping job cuts appear to be on the horizon for New York City companies, he said, that is hardly cause for celebration among young job seekers.
"The economy looks like it's a little stronger," he explained, "but that does not necessarily translate into easily accessible summer jobs."
 
A RECURRING PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY IN NEW YORK
 According to economists, urban planners and business executives, New York's perennial summer-job problem is the product of a complex mix of forces, all of them rooted in the city's size and changing economy.
More than in any other American city, jobs in New York are centralized in the urban core -- Manhattan -- far from the neighborhoods where most of its young people live. That prevents many high school students from finding summer jobs or after-school work without enduring hours of commuting time on subways or buses.
An even greater constraint is that the city, to a far greater degree than other places in the nation, has always put young people and adult workers in direct competition for the same jobs. Instead of hiring teen-agers for entry-level filing, mail-room or maintenance jobs, big companies can hire adults, who are eager to work for as little as the minimum wage.
Fueling the competition is the city's huge population of recent immigrants, who are often forced to work long hours at low wages to support their families. Young people also find themselves competing for some jobs -- as waiters, dishwashers and retail clerks -- with aspiring actors, musicians and other people in the arts.
And to make matters worse, cutbacks at many companies have forced laid-off adult workers to take any jobs they can find, which means that jobs that not long ago went to entry-level workers are now being performed by veterans who have had to accept lower pay and less responsibility if they are to work at all.
"When companies are laying off senior employees, it is incontestable that they will find it awkward to bring kids on board," Mr. Smith said.
Finally, while competition between young and older job seekers is hardly new, it has been heightened by technology. Indeed, with telephone clerks being replaced by voice-mail systems, messenger services being wiped out by fax machines and office clerks being required to master Word Perfect, Lotus Ami Pro and other word-processing systems, vast layers of jobs that were once considered suitable for inexperienced young people no longer exist.
In what may be the most striking measure of the problem, Federal data show that fewer than 15 percent of New York City's young people, aged 16 to 19, held full- or part-time jobs in 1993, and that the percentage increased only slightly, to 18.6 percent, during the peak of summer employment from July through September.
For the nation as a whole, the Government said, roughly 40 percent of young people in the same age category held jobs last year, with 48 percent holding summer jobs.
One young New Yorker who has beaten the odds is George Gonzalez, a 20-year-old college student who started two weeks ago as a computer operator and file clerk at the Manhattan headquarters of Deloitte & Touche, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, where he held a similar job last summer.
But Mr. Gonzalez's success in landing a summer job may come as little surprise. Besides his experience -- his resume includes part-time work in a real-estate brokerage and as a nursing-home volunteer -- he brings top academic credentials to the market. A graduate of Manhattan's prestigious Trinity School, he has just
finished his freshman year at Yale.
"Even for someone going to Yale, this is a tough market," he said. "I'm sure a lot of kids just aren't being given a chance."
 
OTHER PROGRAMS TO TRY, AND PLAIN DETERMINATION
 To be sure, government and not-for-profit groups offer a variety of programs intendedto help.
For teen-agers from low-income families, the city's Department of Employment administers the Summer Youth Employment program, in which it expects to place 35,000 teen-agers in jobs this summer. Although the application deadline for the program passed more than a month ago, young people who meet the income guidelines may want to plan on applying next year.
The program places youths in jobs at hospitals, day-care centers, arts organizations and other not-for-profit or government agencies. All of the jobs pay the miniumum wage and are paid for by a Federal grant, which this year amounts to $33 million.
Each year far more students apply for the program than can be placed, and final selection is based on a lottery system. City officials said they had 63,000 applications for the 35,000 jobs to be filled this summer.
The New York Partnership's program offers the widest variety of jobs and accepts young people from all income levels.
Though the Partnership has already placed some young people for this summer, many more jobs are expected to become available and be filled over the next month. Fewer than 20 percent of the companies that the partnership expects to offer jobs had done so by the end of last week, Mr. Smith said, and a flurry of activity is building as jobs become available and young people line up to apply for them.
"It's time to really start knocking on doors," Mr. Smith said.
Job openings available through the partnership program are listed with dozens of community-based organizations, high schools, all branches of the City University of New York and New York State employment offices.
Smaller and more specialized programs are available to prepare minority young people for part-time and summer employment. One is Upward Inc., based in Harlem, which sets up interviews for young people at grocery stores, restaurants and other employers.
Another is INROADS/New York City Inc., which places minority students who have top academic standing in internships at companies on Wall Street and in telecommunications, insurance and other fields. To qualify, applicants must be black, Hispanic or Native American, have at least a 3.0 grade point average and be a high school senior or in their first two years of college.
While thousands of young people are served each year by the job programs, many others, like Kedway Urena, have had better luck setting out on their own with a combination of gritty determination and a willingness to seize whatever job opportunities exist.
Mr. Urena, 18 years old, who is finishing his junior year at Chelsea High School in Manhattan, said he had been looking for part-time or summer work for more than two years. He had been turned down in more than 15 applications to the Gap, grocery stores and other retailers.
Last month, finally, he got a job. Now his problem is getting there. He is working 33 hours a week after school -- and making $4.25 an hour -- cooking chicken and hamburgers at a Roy Rogers in Yonkers, which requires him to endure a marathon two-hour ride on subways and commuter buses after school lets out at 2:30 P.M. Then, finishing work at 11 P.M., and sleeping over with a relative in Yonkers, he awakens early for the trip back to Chelsea, where classes begin at 8:30 A.M.
It is, after all, a job, and he is grateful for it.
"The minute I heard they had an opening I jumped," said Mr. Urena, who said he learned of the Roy Rogers position from friends in Yonkers and now expects to work full time at the restaurant after school ends on June 28. "It's a real job, and I'll take what I can get."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN;
Latest Wave of Immigrants Is Splitting Chinatown

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
For more than 100 years, Chinatown has absorbed the different waves of Chinese immigrants, from the Taishanese earlier this century to the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam in the 1980's. But now, there are growing strains between the established Cantonese community and the latest group of immigrants, the Fujianese, who have poured in from mainland China in the last four years.
Many businessmen and longtime residents are expressing resentment of the new Fujianese, saying they are overwhelming Chinatown, causing an increase in crime and a major unemployment problem. Non-Fujianese workers complain that the sheer number of these immigrants, many of whom have been smuggled in, creates unfair competition by flooding the market and driving down wages. There is also concern over image. 
 "It's an embarrassment to us," said a Cantonese businessman, who insisted on anonymity. "When people come to Chinatown and see this mess, they think all Chinese are bad. Why should everyone take the blame for one group?"
But the Fujianese say the problems created by their arrival are being exaggerated, pointing out that earlier waves of immigrants faced the same predicament. They also say the established immigrants are overly concerned about their image being tarnished because of the publicity surrounding the grounding last year of the Golden Venture, a ship carrying 300 illegal Fujianese immigrants, and the prosecution of the Fuk Ching, a notorious Fujianese gang.
"Every immigrant group faces hardships when they first arrive, even the Pilgrims," said Steven Wong, a journalist of Fujianese descent. "Why make the Fujianese the scapegoat? These people are the backbone of the economy. That's why prices in Chinatown are so cheap. They have to work under harsh conditions because they don't speak English and the mainstream world would not give them jobs."
The tension stems partly from political divisions. The more established Cantonese immigrants, many of whom are loyal to the Taiwanese Government, are suspicious that the immigrants from Fujian, a province on the mainland, are sympathetic to the Communist Government.
Whatever the reason for the strain, people familiar with Chinatown say, it may be adding to the difficulties of assimilation. Because of their numbers, their inability to speak the Cantonese dialect and the illegal status that often makes employment difficult, many Fujianese have been left desperately poor and huddled in crowded apartments in the perimeter of Chinatown, between Eldridge and Jefferson Streets and as far north as Houston Street. The Fujianese claim that the Cantonese businessmen won't give them jobs, even as they they use the existence of the illegal immigrants to drive down wages. Some have resorted to extortion and robberies.
The tension has kept the institutions of Chinatown -- the family, the village and business associations -- from reaching out beyond their own groups to help the new immigrants, something that would be unusual but would be especially helpful under current conditions. Adding to the problem is that the Fujianese immigrants are often too ashamed to seek help. Both groups say the American Government has been inconsistent, encouraging the Fujianese to come, through President Bush's 1990 Presidential order, then failing to provide any help.
Many Cantonese complain that established Fujianese, who began entering the country in small numbers in the 1960's, are not helping out their own. In interviews, three wealthy Fujianese said that the sheer number of immigrants made it impossible to make a difference. But one, a prominent Fujianese businessman, said people also feared that by helping the new wave they would antagonize their Cantonese business associates as well as Fujianese businessmen who have been harassed by some new immigrants.
"I want to show my support, but that would alienate my friends who have been harassed by them," he said. JANE H. LII

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Unwanted Neighbor

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
WHEN Richard Salyer thinks of the program he operates on West 97th Street, he sees success: His agency has rehabilitated a derelict building and now houses mentally ill people there who might otherwise have nowhere to live.
When some of Mr. Salyer's critics think of the program, they think of the most infamous incident that occurred there: A resident ran into the street with a knife, attempted to cut off his penis and jumped into the Hudson. 
 That difference in perception is one that Mr. Salyer has learned to live with as the president of Volunteers of America-Greater New York, one of the largest and more controversial social-service agencies in New York City and surrounding counties.
Over the last 12 years, Mr. Salyer has transformed his nonprofit organization from a little-known group into the operator of dozens of programs for the homeless, former prisoners, recovering alcoholics and others.
In the process, he has had to serve as a kind of social-services advance man in neighborhoods in which the initial reaction often starts off chilly and gets worse. In the end, however, it seems that Mr. Salyer usually gets his way.
He may make compromises and fine-tune the details to accommodate critics, but only once, he says, has public opposition forced him to abandon a project -- in New Jersey, when the financing agency backed out.
Mr. Salyer insists that his programs are needed. And, whether they acknowledge it or not, he argues, communities benefit.
As an example, Mr. Salyer points to a halfway house for recovering alcoholics in New Rochelle, N.Y. When an elderly neighbor needed to have a tree cut down, men from the house spontaneously volunteered.
"We know that even though the process is difficult, the neighborhood is going to be better because we're there," he said. "We are an ideal neighbor."
If some New Yorkers think otherwise, perhaps it points again to a problem of perception -- one that Mr. Salyer tries to correct in innumerable public presentations, tours of his programs and meetings with edgy neighbors and in his capacity as the chairman of the City Council's Advisory Commission on Homelessness.
"I really don't blame our opponents," he said. "I think there's a massive misunderstanding about what our programs are."
Mr. Salyer chooses his words carefully. He speaks evenly and has a guarded manner. For a recent interview, he brought along a public-relations woman and a tape recorder.
He is 49 years old, single, and lives on the Upper West Side, where many of his programs are situated. He has an apartment in the building on 85th Street that houses his agency's headquarters and a program for recovering alcoholics.
The agency is the largest of 51 affiliates of one of the country's biggest nonprofit groups, founded in 1896 in New York City by Maud Booth, a prison reformer, and her husband, Ballington Booth, the son of the founder of the Salvation Army. The national organization, based in New Orleans, runs 400 programs, from adoption agencies to low-income housing. It is also legally designated a church. Service to others, the organization says, is a form of worship.
Mr. Salyer, who grew up in Phoenix and has a bachelor's in educational psychology, went to work for Volunteers of America in 1978, running homes for mentally retarded adults in Louisiana. When he took over the New York affiliate, in 1982, it had just four programs and a budget of $3 million.
But it had been the first nonprofit group to run a homeless shelter under contract with New York City, Mr. Salyer said. So he built on that base. Now, two-thirds of its local programs are services for the homeless, offering shelter, vocational counseling and some mental-health care.
The agency's annual budget has ballooned to $51 million. Ninety-six percent of the money comes from government agencies. Its programs, which the agency says serve 40,000 people, are spread across 50 locations in New York City, northern New Jersey and Westchester and Putnam Counties.
As Mr. Salyer sees it, homelessness is usually a symptom of other problems, like drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness or a kind of outcast mentality. His agency's task, he says, is not simply to house people but to help them "turn their life around."
As a result, Mr. Salyer says, his agency has shifted its focus from simply sheltering people to offering them "professionally staffed services" like job counseling and mental-health services. While some of Mr. Salyer's critics suggest his agency has a kind of discount-department-store approach, he prides himself on providing good services at an economical cost to the city and state.
Housing the mentally ill is a relatively new interest of the agency. In the late 1980's, it was picked by the State Office of Mental Health to set up one of the first "service-enriched" single-room-occupancy hotels for some of the people who were once in psychiatric hospitals and are now on the streets.
To date, the project has produced one of the more public and protracted social-service-program battles in Manhattan in recent memory -- this in a city where such battles are increasingly common. Now on its third site, it is scheduled to open this summer on Broadway at 100th Street.
But it has spawned a neighborhood group dedicated solely to fighting it, a lawsuit and a lobbying blitz that has drawn the offices of the Mayor and Governor into the fray. Now, another social-service agency may take over much of the program -- a step state officials hope might win over the neighbors.
"We want to be flexible," Mr. Salyer said simply, when asked about that notion. "We are adamant that the facility will open; we are adamant that we will be involved when it opens. People are dying in the streets. It would be a crime to delay a facility like this even a day."
Once again, Mr. Salyer is wrestling with a perception gap.
Toni Rachiele, who lives two blocks from the building and formed Neighborhood Survival to fight the program, suspects that it may be wishful thinking to imagine, as Mr. Salyer does, that severely mentally ill people could live independently in the area. If they are placed there, Ms. Rachiele wants them to be tested regularly for illegal drug use and tuberculosis and monitored to make sure they take their prescribed medications. She and other neighbors worry that residents will have histories of violent crime, and that the security and proposed levels of medical and counseling staffing are inadequate.
Mr. Salyer, on the other hand, points out that most mentally ill people are not criminals. He also says the rate of illegal drug use and infectious diseases like tuberculosis and AIDS is not much higher among mentally ill people receiving housing and counseling than it is among the general population.
"Most mentally ill people, in fact, live in the community," he said. "They live with their families, they live in apartments. And because a person's mental illness has resulted in their being in the homeless system doesn't mean they are a lost cause."
Mr. Salyer said the state should begin educating the public about the nature of mental illness and about the state's plans to house increasing numbers of mentally ill people in community settings.
"The government is involved in educating us about smoking, about heart disease, about condoms," he said, in what seemed like a rare display of frustration. "Now, for heaven's sake, why, when this is such a contentious issue, why can't government take a larger role and in a dispassionate way inform people?"

BYLINE: By Howell Raines

 BODY:
It did not take a psychic to know that the time was ripe for health care reform. For one thing, major social welfare legislation seems to run in a three-decade cycle. Medicare was created 30 years ago, Social Security 30 years before that.
Then in 1991, a long-shot candidate, Harris Wofford, won a Senate election in Pennsylvania by running on health care. Republicans got the hint. At the start of the 1992 campaign year, President George Bush promised a "comprehensive health reform program."
But then Mr. Bush's natural passivity kicked in. White House interest faded, handing Bill Clinton the issue that became the centerpiece of his campaign. It is also the issue that may well determine whether Mr. Clinton's is remembered as a notable Presidency.
One reasons is that universal health care has been both a crying national need and a potently divisive social and legislative issue for a long time. The American Medical Association used the specter of "Socialized medicine" to defeat Harry S. Truman's plan for national health insurance in 1945.
The same demagoguery still works, but that does not change the agreed facts. Health care consumes one-seventh of the gross national product, far more than what other industrialized democracies spend to extend health care to all their citizens.
Even so, the U.S. system leaves 37 million people without health insurance. And while American who can afford it get the best care in the world, the current system makes little sense in terms of economic competitiveness or social equity.
It is possible to study the problem and come up with a number of solutions, including, for example, a Government financed, or single-payer, system like Canada's. The Times's editorial page has advocated the managed competition model, which borrows the mandatory participation feature of government programs -- guaranteeing that everyone is covered -- but relies on carefully structured competition between private plans to deliver health care.
Mr. Clinton deserves credit for specifying universal coverage with private insurance as the anchors of his plan. By so doing, he set the boundaries for the ideological debate. The legislative struggle now under way has to do with how much of the Clinton ideology will survive and also with the architecture and mechanics of the new system.
Although Mr. Clinton has shaped the debate in a positive way, the White House team has made tactical mistakes. The most serious was its decision to draft its health care proposal in secret sessions presided over by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner. The lack of public hearings wasted a opportunity to build public support and increase the pressure on Congress to respond to public need rather than the health care lobbyists.
The task force wound up alienating many of the experts that Mrs. Clinton gathered in the White House to create policy. They saw virtually no imprint of their work on the bill that the First Lady's inner circle put together.
Another tactical misstep was to send to Capitol Hill a 1,300-page mega-bill that purports to solve every medical problem the country has ever experienced. A tighter bill would have been a tougher target for critics to hit. Political necessity also warped the Clinton plan when the task force decided to propose only those reforms that would not require a broad-based tax. That single decision shaped virtually every feature of the reform, from the controversial purchasing alliances to cost controls, and produced a bill that many in Congress have declared unworkable.
These missteps made the job of the Democratic Congressional leaders immeasurably harder. They weren't helped by Republicans like the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, who characterized the Clinton effort as "A massive overdose of Government control." But other Republicans, like Senators John Chafee and John Danfoth, have struggled to find a consensus plan.
Until the past few weeks, the White House vacillated between trying to ram a bill through Congress with a slim majority of Democratic votes and reaching for a bipartisan compromise. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy received President and Mrs. Clinton's blessing for his modified version of their plan, that was an important signal. It meant that the season of bipartisan bargaining had begun.
June is the critical month. If the committees do not finish most of their work this month, Congress will run out of time before the lawmakers break for the November elections and the entire effort could collapse.
Whatever the flaws in the process of writing the bill or in the bill itself, the Clinton health reform has now created a sene of urgency on the Hill. And by assigning his wife to lead the effort, Mr. Clinton made a pact not to ditch health care reform no matter how tought the fight. For him, the real test of success will be coming away with some viable form of universal coverage. Then he can take credit for a landmark achievement in social policy that will earn him a place in history no matter what else occurs in his tenure.

HEADLINE: Navigating the Health Swamp: A Primer

 BODY:
Nearly everyone agrees that the U.S. health care system needs fixing. But how much, and how to do it? This guide to the problems and the main proposals before Congress was prepared by Diane Rowland and Peter Long of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a national health care philanthropy.
 
PROBLEMS
 
The Uninsured: 37 Million
Millions of Americans become uninsured each year, most of them because they do not get insurance on the job and cannot afford to buy it. In 1992, 37 million Americans -- 15 percent of the non-elderly population -- were uninsured on any given day. Because the elderly have Medicare coverage and the very poor and disabled generally have Medicaid, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured (84 percent) are full- or part-time workers and their families.
The high cost of insurance limits coverage. Seven in 10 uninsured Americans make less than $30,000 a year. Although the uninsured do get care, they get less, get it later and end up sicker than people with insurance.
 
The Vulnerable
While most Americans have insurance, changing jobs can often mean losing coverage: two-thirds of companies with fewer than 25 employees do not offer coverage. In the course of a year, one in five Americans -- more than 50 million people -- will be uninsured at least temporarily and one-third will be without insurance for at least a year. Only 7 percent of uninsured adults say they are uninsured by choice. Six in 10 say they cannot afford coverage and 22 percent cite loss of a job or lack of on-the-job insurance. Three percent can't get coverage because of health problems.
 
The Cost of Care
The U.S. is the only major industrial nation that does not provide universal health coverage, yet it spends far more than any other country on health -- more than $800 billion a year, 14 percent of the gross domestic product. And the portion is growing: without cost-containment measures, it is expected to top 18 percent by the year 2000. From 1988 to 1993, the average family premium for employer-based group health insurance doubled, from $2,500 to $5,200. Families wanting to buy health insurance directly from an insurer can spend as much as $10,000 a year.
 
CHOICES
 
Single-Payer
The single-payer plan would create a universal public system of health insurance coverage with comprehensive benefits financed by income and payroll taxes instead of premiums. All Americans would be covered, in much the same way the elderly are now covered by Medicare. Employerbased coverage, private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid would be replaced by a single plan. Costs would be controlled through administrative simplification and by a national budget with Government-regulated payment rates for doctors and hospitals. (Example: McDermott-/Wellstone bill.)
 
Employer Mandate
Employer-based approaches build on the already extensive system that provides private insurance to two-thirds of the non-elderly population. To achieve universal coverage, all employers would have to offer insurance to employees and help pay the premiums. The Government would provide coverage or help pay for private insurance for nonworkers; Medicare would be kept for the elderly.
To contain costs, some plans would regulate prices and set spending limits; others would expand use of managed care, and promote increased competition among health insurance plans. Some plans call for regional alliances, which would spool the purchasing power of small business and promote price competition among plans. (Examples: Clinton plan, House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee bill.)
 
Individual Mandate
This approach places the responsibility for obtaining coverage on individuals and families, rather than employers or the Government. To achieve universal coverage, people would be required to obtain insurance either through their employers or by buying it on the private market. The Government would subsidize premium costs for low-income individuals and families. Employers could cover some of the premium costs, but would not be required to.
Costs would be controlled by promoting increased consumer consciousness, greater use of managed care and greater competition among health plans. (Examples: Thomas-Chafee bill, Stearns-Nickles bill).
 
No Mandate
Voluntary plans build on the existing system by providing incentives to expand coverage and control costs, but do not mandate coverage. Expanded coverage would be encouraged through reforms in the private health insurance market (Like eliminating ineligibility for those with pre-existing conditions), subsidies for low-income people and alliances to help small companies and individuals buy insurance.
This approach would control costs and make coverage more affordable by increasing competition among proivate insurance plans and cost consciousness among consumers. (Examples: Cooper-Breaux bill, Michel-Lott bill.)
 
ASSESSING THE PLANS
 
Single-Payer
All Americans would have comprehensive health benefits through a single system, regardless of income or employment. This approach would reduce much of the complexity of the present system, but it would shift most of the financing from employers and the private sector to the tax system. It would virtually eliminate a role for private insurance and would concentrate control of the health care system under the Federal Government. It would greatly expand the role of the Government in health, but also provide Government with greater purchasing power to control costs.
 
Employer Mandate
Employer-based approaches expand insurance coverage with the least disruption to current arrangements and would minimize change for most Americans. They rely on employers to cover workers and on the Government to provide coverage for nonworkers. Employers and their employees, rather than the Government, pay most of the cost for insuring all workers and their families.
Employer mandates would mean higher health insurance costs for some businesses, especially small companies that do not offer insurance today. Government assistance to businesses could help avoid wage cuts, job losses and other potential effects.
The mobility of the work force makes this approach administratively complex and requires explicit mechanisms to assure continuous coverage. Cost control based on greater use of managed care and competition among health plans would require much restructuring of the market, without assured effectiveness.
 
Individual Mandate
Making individuals responsible for insurance would break the link between employment and insurance coverage -- easing the mobility of the labor force, but also potentially removing business as a source of financing and a force in controlling costs.
Government subsidies could be directed to low-wage workers and low-income families rather than more broadly applied to businesses, but the loss of employer contributions would mean substantial tax increases for Federal subsidies to make insurance affordable, without adequate subsidies, coverage could remain beyond the reach of many Americans.
An individual-based program would substantially alter current insurance arrangements, and would be complicated to administer and hard to enforce. Increasing consumer awareness could help restain costs, but unless they join alliances, consumers would lack the purchasing power that big employers have now.
 
No Mandate
Voluntary approaches provide incentives for cost control and for reaching the uninsured and the vulnerable, but no assurances that these problems will be fully addressed. Market reforms and expanded coverage for low-income people would reduce the number of uninsured but not assure universal coverage.
Expanded coverage of low-income people would require additional Federal revenue. Cost containment would depend largely on the success of free-market competition in restraining premium increases.

CONTESTING CASTRO
The United States and the Triumph
of the Cuban Revolution.
By Thomas G. Paterson.
Illustrated. 352 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $30. 
THE headaches and humiliations associated with recent United States involvements in crisis spots like Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti have led to a certain nostalgia for the apparent clarity and simplicity of the cold war. One aspect of the cold war that should occasion no nostalgia, however, is the regrettable history of Washington's relationships with "friendly tyrants" in the third world, particularly in Latin America. An early, emblematic instance of such a relationship was the cozy, doomed friendship between the United States and Fulgencio Batista, the strongman who seized power in Cuba in 1952 and ran the country for seven tawdry years before falling to Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement.
It was a case with all the elements that would appear repeatedly during the cold war: a corrupt, repressive leader backed by the United States for his anti-Communist and pro-business views; a rising but poorly understood nationalistic insurgency; a policy of strong support for the dictator until his imminent collapse prompted a vain, hurried search for some moderate alternative; and the fall of the dictator coupled with the emergence of a revolutionary Government that viewed the United States with suspicion and hostility.
The story of this failed policy is well told in "Contesting Castro." Thomas G. Paterson, a distinguished diplomatic historian who teaches at the
University of Connecticut and has written extensively on the cold war, has turned his considerable research energies and narrative skills to a critical period of relations between the United States and Cuba. The picture he presents of Washington's policy in that period is not flattering, but it is a persuasive answer to the central question he poses: "How did the United States, the hegemonic giant in the hemisphere, let this one, just 90 miles off the Florida coast, get away?"
Mr. Paterson shows Washington policy makers, secure in their belief that Cuba was inextricably dependent on the United States, persistently failing to appreciate the damaging consequences of Fulgencio Batista's corruption and repression, or the significance of Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement. He effectively refutes the view of some historians that the United States Government was passive or neutral in the struggle between the two men by chronicling the political, moral, economic and military support provided to Batista.
Despite this support, Mr. Paterson explains, Batista was an uncooperative client who resisted pressures for reform and then sabotaged the 1958 elections that the State Department hoped would ease him out of power. In any event, these pressures remained inconsistent and ineffective until the sudden crumbling of Batista's rule in late 1958 sent the Eisenhower Administration scrambling to replace him with some "third force" and prevent a Castro takeover. By that time, however, Batista was too dug in to be eased out, the Castroites were too powerful to give up and no viable third force was still standing.
Meanwhile, the United States' obsession with the Communist issue was a poor substitute for a serious effort to understand Fidel Castro's appeal and Fulgencio Batista's failings. As Mr. Paterson emphasizes, "During the period of insurrection, American officials searched more for signs of any Castroite flirtation with Communist dogmas than for the profound sources of Cuban discontents." Yet, he says, every time Washington investigated the issue, it concluded that Mr. Castro was not a Communist.
A particularly unflattering but colorful portrait emerges of Earl E. T. Smith, the United States Ambassador to Cuba during the two years before Batista's fall. Ambassador Smith, a wealthy investment banker and high-society figure who believed he knew Cuba well, ardently backed Batista and decided that Mr. Castro was a Communist -- in part because anyone who was anti-American must also be a Communist. He resisted all pressures from Washington to push Batista to reform and believed almost to the bitter end that Batista had the situation under control.
"Contesting Castro" does not delve deeply into the subtleties of Cuban politics in the 1950's or bring to life Fidel Castro in his rebel years. Nor does it develop substantially the broader context of the Eisenhower Administration's evolving anti-Communist policy toward Latin America. It succeeds admirably, though, in telling a story that is crucial to understanding the frigid standoff that has defined relations between the United States and Cuba for the last 30 years. With potentially turbulent times ahead for Cuba as the Castro regime confronts its own post-cold-war realities, the seemingly distant events of the 1950's may soon be of quite immediate relevance. Let us hope that whatever role the United States seeks to play in Cuba's future, it is based on a thorough understanding of that inglorious past.

HEADLINE: With the World Cup Near, Teams Pick Practice Sites in State

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES 

 BODY:
SOCCER'S megastars have been landing on the shores of one of the few countries in the world where the sport is not the national pastime. Twenty-three teams have been arriving in the United States to work out at training camps in preparation for the World Cup series next week.
For the first time in the tournament's 60-year history, the Federation Internationale de Football, soccer's ruling body, allowed the host nation to choose the practice sites. Forty-seven schools vied to be named designated sites, many of them regarding selection as a wonderful opportunity to enhance their equipment and fields. 
 Five New Jersey schools were ultimately selected by World Cup teams: Princeton, Rutgers and Drew Universities, Kean College and the Pingry School.
While proximity to Giants Stadium was a factor in site selection, the job of giving a grade to the other components fell to Charles Stillitano, the director of the World Cup operation at Giants Stadium.
"A number of schools under consideration were dropped when officials said they did not want their teams to travel through tunnels or over long bridge spans to get to Giants Stadium," Mr. Stillitano said. "Having made it this far, they didn't want to be waylaid in a traffic jam."
Working with Bob Reasso, Rutgers's soccer coach, he devised a point system that became the model for training sites at eight other World Cup sites in the United States.
 
Offering a Package
 "Because these soccer players are regarded in their country as everybody's prized possession," Mr. Reasso said, "we had to offer a package that combined perfect training facilities along with excellent accommodations at nearby hotels."
Every facet of practice and workouts was considered in the site analysis, including the condition of the soccer fields, the training rooms and even the swimming pools, Mr. Stillitano said.
But even before the sites were named over a year ago, International World Cup officials had scouted the area deciding where teams might also practice.
Saudi Arabia was the first World Cup team to arrive in the United States, deciding to train for a month starting in mid-May at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey (formerly Stockton State College) in Pomona. Because of its distance from Giants Stadium, Stockton College was not a sanctioned training site, Mr. Stillitano said, although its 1,600-acre campus was adequate in every other way.
The list was narrowed to 20 schools, with Princeton University garnering the first spot, followed by Rutgers. Much to the dismay of Mr. Stillitano, a Princeton alumnus who was an All American soccer player there, Princeton officials did not immediately agree to a contract with the World Cup.
"The university had to consider the proposal in light of its economic effect, insurance and all legal aspects," he said. But the major consideration was how the World Cup team would affect Princeton's own program.
"I got a taste of harsh reality when Princeton did not jump at the opportunity, but it opened my eyes to what goes on on the other side in making a decision on the use of a university's facilities," Mr. Stillitano said.
Princeton University officials finally did agree, and the Norwegian team scheduled a June 10 arrival to train there. The Irish team began its workout in Orlando, Fla., early last week but also scheduled practices at Drew University on Thursday, and June 26 and 27 in preparation for games with Italy and Norway. The German team, if it qualifies for the quarterfinals, will also spend time at Drew.
After its early training period at Stockton, Saudi Arabia will get ready for its meeting with Morocco by training at Kean College starting June 22. Morocco has chosen to work out at Rutgers beginning June 20.
The Italian team arrived last week to train on the 200-acre campus of the Pingry School in Martinsville. Italian officials had looked long and hard before making their decision.
On seeing the school's soccer field, an Italian official said the field was a little too close to the road, which could have been a problem for a team that is seeking privacy during its practice sessions.
The solution was to construct a new soccer field in the rear of the campus, far out of sight of the road.
For Pingry, the new field was an investment for the school, said Jack Lewis, the school's assistant headmaster. It was built by the Burton F. Clark Company, which is also overseeing the condition of the grass growing at Giants Stadium for the tournament. The new soccer field at the Pingry School, covered with Kentucky bluegrass, will be clipped at exactly the same height as the Bermuda grass in place at the stadium.
Fans of the Italian team will have little chance to catch a glimpse of the players even as they travel on buses from the hotel to the training site escorted by the State Police. Parking will not be permitted on Martinsville Road, which leads to the campus.
 
The Irish Team
 The picture will be different for fans of Ireland's team. After the draw in December, when Ireland was scheduled to play its first game at Giants Stadium, it was assumed that practice would be in New Jersey. But that changed.
Tom Harris, an assistant vice president at Drew University, said, "Getting adjusted to a warm climate was a deciding factor for the Irish team to train in Orlando." He added, "The good news s that they will be here for several days in June."
"Fortunately for their fans, the Irish team approaches the event with an open, congenial outlook," he said. "With security in place, some of the practice sessions may be open to the public."
Mr. Harris said the team would arrive just in time to use the new $12 million William E. and Carol G. Simon Forum and Athletic Center.
Just recently, representatives from the German team checked out Drew to make sure they could relay television programs to Germany in the event that the team makes it to the quarterfinals at Giants Stadium.
As for matching up a team in a community, Kurt Kehl, director of athletic communications at Princeton University, said, "Princeton and Norway just go together." While Norway will use Princeton training rooms, it will bring its own medical staff, masseurs and trainers.
"With key in hand, we are here to open the doors to our equipment," said Dick Malacrea, Princeton's director of athletic training and physical therapy.
 
Field Was an Attraction
 The Lourie Love Soccer Field at the university was another attraction. The field is enclosed by a fence with a windshield that can be put up if privacy is desired. There is also a grandstand and night lighting.
The unexpectedly harsh winter damaged the grass, but it has since been improved by re-seeding, said Jeff Graydon, the Princeton agronomist.
At nearby Rutgers University, in addition to the Moroccan team training there, two World Cup teams faced off at the university's new soccer stadium when the Saudis and the United States met on May 25 in an exhibition game that ended in a tie. Mr. Reasso said that after the first round of play, another team would probably train there also.
Not all the international scouting for a preparation site had the desired results. Last year, anticipating France's appearance in the World Cup, French officials toured the grounds of Stockton College and the nearby Seaview resort hotel, and decided the French team would do its preliminary training at the college.
 
'Relative Isolation'
 Tim Kelly, a spokesman for the college, said: "When France lost to Bulgaria in the last four seconds of the game, we thought we were without a team. But, fortunately, the Saudi Arabia group chose this as their site. They like the relative isolation of the college and the seclusion of the hotel."
Noting that the team scrimmages were conducted on a field surrounded by the Pine Barrens, Mr. Kelly said, "Such a quiet setting is a marked contrast to what the team will face when 10,000 of their Saudi fans land in New Jersey and make known their passion for their team."

HEADLINE: The Job Outlook for Current Graduates

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
SHOES shined and resume in hand, 21-year-old Jason S. Gardner waited on the station platform here last week for the train to Manhattan, where he would begin his job search. Mr. Gardner, a 1994 Cornell University graduate, recently joined the ranks of an estimated 1.1 million new bachelor's degree holders nationwide who are looking for work in what economists say is a fiercely competitive market.
The good news is that following a four-year drought on the employment scene, jobs are difficult but not impossible to find, although recent graduates like Mr. Gardner will have to work hard to ferret them out. 
 Career counselors at colleges report that in the scramble for a relatively few available positions, job seekers with an exemplary college record and previous work experience are faring best.
 
Carving a Niche
 "The outlook for this class is slightly better than it has been in quite a while, but the competition is keen," said Jody Queen-Hubert, director of cooperative education and career services at Pace University. "Employers are looking for the brightest students, with the best grades, who are also outgoing and have been involved in campus activities. A degree alone is not enough."
To stand out from the crowd, Mr. Gardner, who majored in business management and marketing, is promoting his bent for turning ideas into cash -- what he called "the entrepreneurial, go-getter side of me." In career-counselor jargon, he is carving a niche for himself in the job market.
High on Mr. Gardner's resume is a description of a business he started at Cornell selling used compact disks. He said that as director of sales, promotions and marketing for the fledgling company, he generated revenues of $2,500 in three months and realized a 700 percent return on his investment.
"I'm featuring what makes me unique," he said, "because I know this is a buyer's market."
But the competition for jobs is not only among peers. Graduates are also up against highly experienced displaced workers who are willing to re-enter the marketplace at competitive prices, said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor.
In Westchester -- where downsizing among large corporations has forced many workers onto unemployment lines -- the jobless rate for April, the latest month for which figures are available, was 5.3 percent, up from 4.6 percent for the same month a year ago. Meanwhile, the number of jobs grew only slightly, to 371,300 this April from 370,800 last April.
While this year's graduates offer youth, freshness of vision and a willingness to accept entry-level salaries, observers say they often lack the needed experience.
"Learning on the job is not a realistic option anymore," Ms. Queen-Hubert said. "To compete, graduates have to be able to hit the ground running." And while job market analysts suggest that practicality is the key to success in 1994, Mr. Gardner -- who said he wants to put his skills to work in the music industry -- added that for now, at least, he will hold firm to his ideals.
"At this point in my life, it's not just the dollars that matter," he said. "I want to work hard and get ahead, but I also want to do something I love. I'm not willing to be stuck in a cubicle turning figures for a big-name company just to take home $40,000 a year."
Michele Caporusso, 22, who graduated summa cum laude from Pace University in Pleasantville with a major in human resources management, is also worried about finding a job. Despite her good grades, part-time work experience and outgoing personality, she has received only one job offer -- at what she said was "a shockingly low salary."
 
Willing to Supplement Income
 Disappointed so far with the results of her job search, she recently moved back into her parents' house to save money, although she remains optimistic about eventually obtaining work in her field.
"All I want is to get my foot in the door," she said. "It's not like I expect the perfect job right off." For now, she said she would accept a part-time job in a personnel department, supplementing her income with work as a hostess at a restaurant.
Mr. Gardner, who has also moved home to hold down expenses, said, "This may be the prudent thing for now, but it's not what most of us want for the long run."
While the job outlook is guarded for most college graduates, it has proved even more difficult for those holding only a high school diploma.
"That's the bare minimum for a select number of lower-end jobs," said Mr. Surdey at the Department of Labor, "but it certainly won't put the world at your feet."
At Mount Vernon High School, Richard Brass, a counselor, said that he did not encourage any student to settle for just a high school diploma. "It's unrealistic," he said.
Last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that almost 25 percent of high school graduates who did not go on to college and wanted jobs were still unemployed by October, compared with 21 percent of each year's new graduates in the 1980's and 16 percent in the 1970's. In other words, the statistics showed that even though the economy was growing, the options for students with just a high school diploma have diminished.
 
Higher Metropolitan Area Salaries
 Mr. Surdey said that high school diploma holders typically worked as home health workers, correction officers, travel agents and security guards -- with some positions paying only slightly more than the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage. Many highly paid blue-collar jobs, on assembly lines, for example, were vanishing, with those duties being increasingly performed by robots.
By contrast, starting salaries of college business majors like Mr. Gardner average $23,820 nationwide, according to the College Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pa. That figure is as much as $10,000 higher in metropolitan areas.
At Pace, Ms. Queen-Hubert said that accounting majors could expect to earn close to $30,000 a year with large firms and $22,000 to $25,000 at a smaller company. Graduates accepting jobs in insurance, sales and marketing were typically earning in "the low 20's," she said.
Many companies, which discontinued yearly recruitment drives at college campuses during the recession, have resumed the practice.
"We saw an increase for the first time in five years," Ms. Queen-Hubert said. "Not a lot, but an increase."
 
Some Temporary Openings
 At Armonk-based International Business Machines, where the work force dropped to 256,000 a year ago worldwide from 406,000 in 1986, a spokesman, Scott Brooks, said the computer giant was "still doing some hiring, although it was down from previous years."
"We are out there recruiting people in the computer sciences, engineering and programming," he said. "But it's incredibly competitive."
At Nynex in White Plains, there are no new jobs to be had in Westchester, said Jaimie DePeau, a spokeswoman. There are, however, some temporary job openings in the New York City area for splicers, installers and service technicians. Ms. DePeau referred to those positions as "craft jobs for those with high school diplomas."
"For business managers, administrators, we have nothing," she said.
At Bradlees Department Store in Yonkers, which employs more than 300 workers, Ray Polayes, the general manager, said he was hiring clerical and sales help at above-minimum wages. And for those with college degrees, there were managerial and administrative job openings in new stores in the expanding chain, paying "in the 20's and 30's," he said.
Ms. Queen-Hubert at Pace University said students would be wise to look at small- and medium-size companies that are growing, like Bradlees.
But she also cautioned that many firms are hiring new workers on a temporary basis only, as a way to avoid paying benefits.
"The concept of gaining permanent employment has become a dinosaur," she said. "My advice to students is to be flexible. Don't rule out any options."

BOND OF IRON
Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge.
By Charles B. Dew.
Illustrated. 429 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $27.50. 
 AN overwhelming majority of slaves in the Old South worked in agriculture, producing the cotton, tobacco and rice that supported the region's vibrant economy. Yet by the 1850's, some 200,000 bound laborers, approximately 5 percent of the unfree work force, toiled in industry. In "Bond of Iron: Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge," Charles B. Dew presents a detailed study of a single industrialist and the black labor force he and his heirs employed for a half-century in antebellum, Civil War and Reconstruction Virginia.
Extraordinarily rich sources, which Mr. Dew discovered in archives and in private collections across the United States, have enabled him not just to describe the business and management decisions of William Weaver and his deputies, but also to reconstruct the lives of the slaves who lived and worked at Buffalo Forge. From these materials Mr. Dew, a professor of history at Williams College and the author of "Ironmaker to the Confederacy: Joseph R. Anderson and the Tredegar Iron Works," has fashioned the portrait of a slave force empowered and partly liberated by its indispensable skills, of a slave institution far more flexible than even the most paternalistic vision of its plantation counterpart and of a distinctively Southern variety of industry, shaped -- indeed retarded -- by the necessities of managing and manipulating bound labor.
William Weaver came from Philadelphia to Virginia in 1814 in search of investment opportunity. A businessman and manufacturer, Weaver, together with a partner, purchased a forge, two charcoal blast furnaces and 6,000 acres of ore and woodland in the Shenandoah Valley just southeast of Lexington. Ruthless in his business dealings, Weaver seemed unconstrained by his German Pietist origins; he demonstrated no qualms about the use of bound labor in his new enterprise, determining simply to keep the nature of his work force secret from those who shared the antislavery traditions in which he had been raised.
Placing little faith in the reliability of free white laborers (who tended to alcoholism and absenteeism), Weaver determined first to hire slaves, then, as he accumulated more capital, to purchase them for his furnace and forge. By the time of his death at the age of 82 in 1863, Weaver would own 70 slaves, many of whom were highly skilled ironworkers.
Weaver himself did not move to Virginia until 1823, attempting at first to run his new business through the efforts of Thomas Mayburry, a resident partner and a fellow Pennsylvanian. Mr. Dew chronicles the erosion and ultimate dissolution of their partnership, which deteriorated into squabbles, hostility and finally chancery suits as Weaver relentlessly struggled to seize control and advance his own interests. "Rings of controversy and litigation," Mr. Dew tells us, "spread out from Weaver," who evidently was thoroughly disliked by almost every business associate of his long career.
Yet curiously, oral traditions still surviving among the descendants of Weaver's slaves represent him rather differently -- as "basically a decent man." William Weaver, who ran roughshod over business associates, acquaintances, even relatives, was compelled by his dependence on his slaves' skills and labor to treat them with at least a degree of consideration and humanity.
In the early years at Buffalo Forge, Weaver used a largely hired force of slaves whom he recruited from all over Piedmont Virginia and employed on one-year contracts, renewable each Christmas. Owners of these slaves interrogated their bondsmen about their work and treatment, so that Weaver, like other industrial employers, soon recognized that "cultivation of a certain amount of good will among his hirelings was essential" if he was to continue to procure the laborers he needed.
But as he gradually built a slave force of his own, the necessity of pleasing his laborers increased rather than diminished. Mr. Dew emphasizes that positive incentives and not physical coercion were central to industrial slavery. Sabotage was all too easy and dangerous around a forge; even work slowdowns or careless performance could undermine operations. Thus Weaver, like most Southern industrialists, emphasized rewards, not punishment. Mr. Dew finds no indication that any slave forge worker was ever whipped during Weaver's years in the valley. Instead, he finds that they were cajoled into high levels of productivity with payment for "overwork" beyond specific daily tasks. In the rare cases where a slave proved intractable or threatening, he was not punished but sold -- removed entirely from the system of incentives in which he had refused to participate.
With the money that slaves received for overwork, they bought coffee, tea, fancy cloth, silk hats. Some accepted cash credits instead of their annual clothing allowance in order to be able to select and purchase their own garments. And at least two of Weaver's slaves, Sam Williams and his wife, Nancy, held savings accounts, investing their overwork payments with a local bank.
Industrial labor not only meant that Buffalo Forge slaves possessed valuable skills -- often passed on, as with Tooler Sr. and Tooler Jr., from father to son, or, as with Harry Hunt, through four generations of Virginia slave ironworkers. The organization of industrial labor also gave slaves remarkable independence -- even within the bounds of the peculiar institution. By law, slaves in the Old South could not own property or participate in market transactions; yet in actuality, the slaves of Buffalo Forge were avid and discriminating consumers and even investors. They also exerted significant control over the pace and intensity of their daily labor. In the summer of 1860, for example, Sam Williams, a valued forgeman, found the heat too oppressive and simply took a four-week vacation.
The war first brought unparalleled prosperity to Buffalo Forge and to Weaver, who characteristically exploited the military need for iron to advance his prices at double the rate of inflation. But with Southern defeat and emancipation, the enterprise failed. This collapse, however, stemmed not from the impact of changed labor relations under freedom or from the departure of newly liberated African-Americans from the site of their enslavement. In fact, most of the laborers chose to remain, for as vigilante groups terrorized the freed people of the valley, Mr. Dew speculates, Buffalo Forge "probably represented one of the freedmen's best hopes for physical security and fair treatment in the chaotic period following the end of slavery."
The demise of the industry arose instead from its inability to compete with cheaper iron being produced by more technologically advanced rolling mills in the North. Buffalo Forge, and Southern iron manufacturing in general, had remained essentially unchanged since the era of the Revolution. The failure to modernize, Mr. Dew contends, "had absolutely nothing to do with the talents and abilities of Weaver's slave artisans." Rather, the conservative influence slavery exerted over industry lay in the centrality of the bargain inherent in the task and overwork system, a precarious balance of the interests of master and slave that Weaver, like other Southern entrepreneurs, was reluctant to disrupt through innovation or change. As Mr. Dew explains, "Buffalo Forge had retained the traditional tilt-hammer technology because Weaver had chosen to keep his slave forgemen doing things the way they always had."
Paradoxically, industry undermined the traditional controls and restraints of slavery, while slavery at the same time captured Southern iron manufacturing in a technological traditionalism that would prove its ultimate downfall. With the story of William Weaver, Sam and Nancy Williams, Harry Hunt and the dozens of other black and white residents of Buffalo Forge, Charles Dew complicates and enriches our understanding of the human as well as the larger social and economic meaning of American slavery.

HEADLINE: Logical Alliances

BYLINE: By Paul Starr; Paul Starr, professor of sociology at Princeton University, worked on the development of the Clinton plan and is author, most recently, of "The Logic of Health Care Reform."

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The obituaries are already being prepared for the regional purchasing alliances that are central to both the Clinton plan for health reform and Representative Jim Cooper's alternative.
But before the final verdict, the public has a right to know whether the critics have any real answers to the problems the alliances would address. 
 Today, insurers compete to avoid sick people, marketing selectively to the healthy and screening out those at high risk of illness through a variety of practices both crude and subtle. As a result, Americans' access to coverage and the price they pay for it depend on their personal characteristics, especially job and health.
As health costs soar, people in the smallest firms, the self-employed and those outside the work force face the greatest barriers to coverage. Staggering administrative costs accentuate the problem: these Americans typically get only 60 cents in health-care benefits for every dollar they or their employers pay for premiums.
Rising health costs have also prompted many large employers to cut benefits or introduce a single health plan that restricts choice of physician. The employer's power to choose an insurer mattered little when virtually all companies offered a traditional fee-for-service plan. But with the rise of managed care, employers now choose which doctors and hospitals their workers and families use. This is an extraordinary usurpation: no one would tolerate an employer's dictating its employees' choice of schools or housing.
The alliances would shift the choice of a health plan from employers to individuals; they would not be insurers themselves but rather new gateways to the array of plans available in a community. They would use the economies of joint purchasing to cut the high administrative costs that plague the insurance market for small groups. And they would change the ground rules for insurance; any insurer wanting to do business would have to accept all comers, healthy or sick.
Under the Cooper and Clinton proposals, the alliances would have to offer all qualifying plans -- with a few key differences.
Mr. Cooper's alliances would serve only small businesses, Medicaid beneficiaries and those otherwise uninsured. The President's plan would extend choice to all consumers: more than 80 percent of those under 65 would participate in regional alliances offering a much broader array of health plans than individual employers can provide. Only the largest private companies (those with more than 5,000 employees) could run alliances of their own, and they would also have to provide a choice of at least three plans.
Also unlike the Cooper plan, the Administration's would require alliances to offer a fee-for-service option, in which people could continue to choose their own doctors, and would give the regional alliances and states the rate-setting authority to keep fee-for-service plans affordable.
Critics suggest that the President's aims can be achieved without the alliances, by such reforms of the insurance market as requiring insurers to charge the same premiums for all consumers regardless of health, employment or other personal characteristics. But the alliances are needed precisely to carry out those reforms.
If insurers can sign up individuals directly, they will seek out the healthy and shun the sick as surely as water rolls downhill. So it is critical that an independent body -- the alliance -- conduct the enrollment and prevent such "cherry-picking."
If alliances are purely voluntary, as some Senate Republicans propose, employers with relatively affluent and healthy workers will stay out to avoid sharing in the costs of the unemployed and the poor. The secession of the healthy would sharply increase premiums, administrative costs (the alliances would need to market their services) and Government subsidies to make coverage affordable.
Critics object that the alliances represent a "new layer of bureaucracy." But the alliances would subtract more bureaucracy than they would add, eliminating costs associated with brokers and underwriters.
At the annual open enrollment, consumers would choose a plan -- and for most, that would be their only contact with the alliance all year. For the first time, benefits would come in easily compared standard packages with uniform definitions and claim forms. If employees changed jobs while remaining in the same region, their coverage would generally be unaffected. This is simpler than today's system.
The idea of purchasing alliances is hardly new or untried. The Federal employees' health plan and the California Public Employee Retirement System have been buying health care for large groups of employees for years. They are easy to use, and their administrative costs are low.
To be sure, alliances would have additional functions; for example, under the Clinton plan the alliances would determine the Government subsidies for low-income people. But that function must be lodged somewhere, even by the conservative proposals.
The great irony of the charge that the alliances would be too bureaucratic is that the moderate and conservative plans generally leave the current bureaucratic thicket unpruned and just add more complexity to it.
Lobbying on the issue has been lopsidedly against alliances for the simple reason that the groups that now dominate the health care industry do not want to confront the organized purchasing power of broad-based alliances. But if Congress doesn't create soundly structured alliances, it will have to find another way to provide coverage at an affordable cost.
That might involve opening Medicare to people under 65, as some members of Congress are now discussing. Medicare could compete with private carriers, operating an insurance plan that would be available to employers or individuals. But insurers would be likely to "cherry-pick," leaving Medicare with the most costly enrollees; that risk could be minimized by requiring insurers to offer any plan through alliances that they offered to employers, at no less favorable rates. This may not be what the industry wants, but guaranteed access to Medicare and private plans would be a powerful assurance to the public that choice will be preserved.

HEADLINE: Battle of the Clipper Chip

BYLINE: By Steven Levy; Steven Levy is the author of "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" and a columnist for Macworld Magazine.

 BODY:
On a sunny spring day in Mountain View, Calif., 50 angry activists are plotting against the United States Government. They may not look subversive sitting around a conference table dressed in T-shirts and jeans and eating burritos, but they are self-proclaimed saboteurs. They are the Cypherpunks, a loose confederation of computer hackers, hardware engineers and high-tech rabble-rousers.
The precise object of their rage is the Clipper chip, offically known as the MYK-78 and not much bigger than a tooth. Just another tiny square of plastic covering a silicon thicket. A computer chip, from the outside indistinguishable from thousands of others. It seems improbable that this black Chiclet is the focal point of a battle that may determine the degree to which our civil liberties survive in the next century. But that is the shared belief in this room. 
 The Clipper chip has prompted what might be considered the first holy war of the information highway. Two weeks ago, the war got bloodier, as a researcher circulated a report that the chip might have a serious technical flaw. But at its heart, the issue is political, not technical. The Cypherpunks consider the Clipper the lever that Big Brother is using to pry into the conversations, messages and transactions of the computer age. These high-tech Paul Reveres are trying to mobilize America against the evil portent of a "cyberspace police state," as one of their Internet jeremiads put it. Joining them in the battle is a formidable force, including almost all of the communications and computer industries, many members of Congress and political columnists of all stripes. The anti-Clipper aggregation is an equal-opportunity club, uniting the American Civil Liberties Union and Rush Limbaugh.
The Clipper's defenders, who are largely in the Government, believe it represents the last chance to protect personal safety and national security against a developing information anarchy that fosters criminals, terrorists and foreign foes. Its adherents pose it as the answer, or at least part of the answer, to a problem created by an increasingly sophisticated application of an age-old technology: cryptography, the use of secret codes.
For centuries, cryptography was the domain of armies and diplomatic corps. Now it has a second purpose: protecting personal and corporate privacy. Computer technology and advanced telecommunications equipment have drawn precious business information and intimate personal communications out into the open. This phenomenon is well known to the current Prince of Wales, whose intimate cellular phone conversations were intercepted, recorded and broadcast worldwide. And corporations realize that competitors can easily intercept their telephone conversations, electronic messages and faxes. High tech has created a huge privacy gap. But miraculously, a fix has emerged: cheap, easy-to-use, virtually unbreakable encryption. Cryptography is the silver bullet by which we can hope to reclaim our privacy.
The solution, however, has one drawback: cryptography shields the law abiding and the lawless equally. Law-enforcement and intelligence agencies contend that if strong codes are widely available, their efforts to protect the public would be paralyzed. So they have come up with a compromise, a way to neutralize such encryption. That's the Clipper chip and that compromise is what the war is about.
The idea is to give the Government means to override other people's codes, according to a concept called "key escrow." Employing normal cryptography, two parties can communicate in total privacy, with both of them using a digital "key" to encrypt and decipher the conversation or message. A potential eavesdropper has no key and therefore cannot understand the conversation or read the data transmission. But with Clipper, an additional key -- created at the time the equipment is manufactured -- is held by the Government in escrow. With a court-approved wiretap, an agency like the F.B.I. could listen in. By adding Clipper chips to telephones, we could have a system that assures communications will be private -- from everybody but the Government.
And that's what rankles Clipper's many critics. Why, they ask, should people accused of no crime have to give Government the keys to their private communications? Why shouldn't the market rather than Government determine what sort of cryptosystem wins favor. And isn't it true that the use of key escrow will make our technology so unattractive to the international marketplace that the United States will lose its edge in the lucrative telecommunications and computer fields? Clipper might clip the entire economy.
Nonetheless, on Feb. 4 the White House announced its approval of the Clipper chip, which had been under study as a Government standard since last April, and the Crypto War broke out in full force. Within a month, one civil liberties group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, received 47,000 electronic missives urging a stop to Clipper. "The war is upon us," wrote Tim May, co-founder of the Cypherpunks, in an urgent electronic dispatch soon after the announcement. "Clinton and Gore folks have shown themselves to be enthusiastic supporters of Big Brother."
And though the Clinton Administration's endorsement of Clipper as a Government standard required no Congressional approval, rumblings of discontent came from both sides of the Capitol. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat whose subcomittee has held contentious hearings on the matter, has called the plan a "misstep," charging that "the Government should not be in the business of mandating particular technologies."
Two weeks ago, an AT&T Bell Laboratories researcher revealed that he had found a serious flaw in the Clipper technology itself, enabling techno-savvy lawbreakers to bypass the security fuction of the chip in some applications. Besides being a bad idea, Clipper's foes now say, it doesn't even work properly.
Yet the defenders of Clipper have refused to back down, claiming that the scheme -- which is, they often note, voluntary -- is an essential means of stemming an increasing threat to public safety and security by strong encryption in everyday use. Even if Clipper itself has to go back to the drawing board, its Government designers will come up with something quite similar. The underlying issue remains unchanged: If something like Clipper is not implemented, writes Dorothy E. Denning, a Georgetown University computer scientist, "All communications on the information highway would be immune from lawful interception. In a world threatened by international organized crime, terrorism and rogue governments, this would be folly."
The claims from both sides sound wild, almost apocalyptic. The passion blurs the problem: Can we protect our privacy in an age of computers -- without also protecting the dark forces in society?
The crypto war is the inevitable consequence of a remarkable discovery made almost 20 years ago, a breakthrough that combined with the microelectronics revolution to thrust the once-obscure field of cryptography into the mainstream of communications policy.
It began with Whitfield Diffie, a young computer scientist and cryptographer. He did not work for the Government, which was strange because in the 1960's almost all serious crypto in this country was done under Federal auspices, specifically at the Fort Meade, Md., headquarters of the supersecret National Security Agency. Though it became bigger than the C.I.A., the N.S.A. was for years unknown to Americans; the Washington Beltway joke was that the initials stood for "No Such Agency." Its working premise has always been that no information about its activities should ever be revealed. Its main mission involved cryptography, and the security agency so dominated the field that it had the power to rein in even those few experts in the field who were not on its payroll.
But Whitfield Diffie never got that message. He had been bitten by the cryptography bug at age 10 when his father, a professor, brought home the entire crypto shelf of the City College library in New York. Then he lost interest, until he arrived at M.I.T.'s Artifical Intelligence Laboratory in 1966. Two things rekindled his passion. Now trained as a mathematician, he had an affinity for the particular challenges of sophisticated crypto. Just as important, he says, "I was always concerned about individuals, an individual's privacy as opposed to Goverment secrecy."
Diffie, now 50, is still committed to those beliefs. When asked about his politics, he says, "I like to describe myself as an iconoclast." He is a computer security specialist for Sun Microsystems, a celebrated cryptographer and an experienced hand at Congressional testimony. But he looks like he stumbled out of a Tom Robbins novel -- with blond hair that falls to his shoulders and a longish beard that seems a virtual trademark among code makers. At a Palo Alto, Calif., coffeehouse one morning, he describes, in clipped, precise cadence, how he and Martin E. Hellman, an electrical engineering professor at Stanford University, created a crypto revolution.
Diffie was dissatisfied with the security on a new time-sharing computer system being developed by M.I.T. in the 1960's. Files would be protected by passwords, but he felt that was insufficient. The system had a generic flaw. A system manager had access to all passwords. "If a subpeona was served against the system managers, they would sell you out, because they had no interest in going to jail," Diffie says. A perfect system would eliminate the need for a trusted third party.
This led Diffie to think about a more general problem in cryptography: key management. Even before Julius Caesar devised a simple cipher to encode his military messages, cryptography worked by means of keys. That is, an original message (what is now called "plaintext") was encrypted by the sender into seeming gibberish (known as "ciphertext"). The receiver, using the same key, decrypted the message back into the original plaintext. For instance, the Caesar key was the simple replacement of each letter by the letter three places down in the alphabet. If you knew the key, you could encrypt the word help into the nonsense word khos; the recipient of the message would decrypt the message back to help.
The problem came with protecting the key. Since anyone who knew the Caesar key would be able to understand the encoded message, it behooved the Romans to change that key as often as possible. But if you change the key, how do you inform your spies behind enemy lines? (If you tell them using the old code, which may have already been cracked, your enemies will then learn the new code.) For centuries, generals and diplomats have faced that predicament. But a few years ago, it took on added urgency.
With computers and advanced telecommunications, customers outside Government were discovering a need for information security. Cryptography was the answer, but how could it be applied widely, considering the problem of keys? The best answer to date was something called a key-management repository, where two parties who wanted secrecy would go to a trusted third party who would generate a new key for the private session. But that required just what Diffie deplored -- an unwanted third wheel.
"The virtue of cryptography should be that you don't have to trust anybody not directly involved with your communication," Diffie says. "Without conventional key distribution centers, which involved trusting third parties, I couldn't figure how you could build a system to secure, for instance, all the phones in the country."
When Diffie moved to Stanford University in 1969, he foresaw the rise of home computer terminals and began pondering the problem of how to use them to make transactions. "I got to thinking how you could possibly have electronic business, because signed letters of intent, contracts and all seemed so critical," he says. He devoured what literature he could find outside the National Security Agency. And in the mid-1970's, Diffie and Hellman achieved a stunning breakthrough that changed cryptography forever. They split the cryptographic key.
In their system, every user has two keys, a public one and a private one, that are unique to their owner. Whatever is scrambled by one key can be unscrambled by the other. It works like this: If I want to send a message to Whit Diffie, I first obtain his public key. (For complicated mathematical reasons, it is possible to distribute one's public key freely without compromising security; a potential enemy will have no advantage in code-cracking if he holds your public key alone.) Then I use that key to encode the message. Now it's gobbledygook and only one person in the world can decode it -- Whit Diffie, who holds the other, private, key. If he wants to respond to me with a secret message, he uses my public key to encode his answer. And I decode it, using my private key.
It was an amazing solution, but even more remarkable was that this split-key system solved both of Diffie's problems, the desire to shield communications from eavesdroppers and also to provide a secure electronic identification for contracts and financial transactions done by computer. It provided the identification by the use of "digital signatures" that verify the sender much the same way that a real signature validates a check or contract.
Suddenly, the ancient limitations on cryptography had vanished. Now, perhaps before the millennium, strong cryptography could find its way to every telephone, computer and fax machine -- if users wanted it. Subsequent variations on the Diffie-Hellman scheme focused on using crypto algorithms to insure the anonymity of transactions. Using these advances, it is now possible to think of replacing money with digital cash -- while maintaining the comforting untraceability of bills and coins. The dark art of cryptography has become a tool of liberation.
From the moment Diffie and Hellman published their findings in 1976, the National Security Agency's crypto monopoly was effectively terminated. In short order, three M.I.T. mathematicians -- Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard M. Adleman -- developed a system with which to put the Diffie and Hellman findings into practice. It was known by their initials, RSA. It seemed capable of creating codes that even the N.S.A. could not break. They formed a company to sell their new system; it was only a matter of time before thousands and then millions of people began using strong encryption.
That was the National Security Agency's greatest nightmare. Every company, every citizen now had routine access to the sorts of cryptographic technology that not many years ago ranked alongside the atom bomb as a source of power. Every call, every computer message, every fax in the world could be harder to decipher than the famous German "Enigma" machine of World War II. Maybe even impossible to decipher!
The genie was out of the bottle. Next question: Could the genie be made to wear a leash and collar? Enter the Clipper chip.
When illustrating the Government's need to control crypto, Jim Kallstrom, the agent in charge of the special operations division of the New York office of the F.B.I., quickly shifts the discussion to the personal: "Are you married? Do you have a child? O.K., someone kidnaps one of your kids and they are holding your kid in this fortress up in the Bronx. Now, we have probable cause that your child is inside this fortress. We have a search warrant. But for some reason, we cannot get in there. They made it out of some new metal, or something, right? Nothing'll cut it, right? And there are guys in there, laughing at us. That's what the basis of this issue really is -- we've got a situation now where a technology has become so sophisticated that the whole notion of a legal process is at stake here!"
Kallstrom is a former head of the Bureau Tech Squad, involved in the bugging operation that brought John Gotti to justice. Some have described him as the F.B.I.'s answer to "Q," the gadget wizard of the James Bond tales.
"From the standpoint of law enforcement, there's a superbig threat out there -- this guy is gonna build this domain in the Bronx now, because he's got a new steel door and none of the welding torches, none of the boomerangs, nothing we have is gonna blast our way in there. Sure, we want those new steel doors ourselves, to protect our banks, to protect the American corporation trade secrets, patent rights, technology. But people operating in legitimate business are not violating the laws -- it becomes a different ball of wax when we have probable cause and we have to get into that domain. Do we want a digital superhighway where not only the commerce of the nation can take place but where major criminals can operate impervious to the legal process? If we don't want that, then we have to look at Clipper."
Wiretapping is among law enforcement's most cherished weapons. Only 919 Federal, state and local taps were authorized last year, but police agencies consider them essential to fighting crime. Obviously if criminals communicate using military-grade cryptosystems, wiretapping them becomes impossible.
For two years, the F.B.I. has been urging Congress to pass the proposed Digital Telephony and Communications Privacy Act, which would in essence require that new communications technologies be designed to facilitate wiretapping. Even if the bill should somehow pass, overcoming the opposition of the communications industry and civil libertarians, the extra effort and expense will be wasted if the only thing the wiretappers can hear is the hissy white noise of encrypted phone conversations and faxes. If cryptography is not controlled, wiretapping could be rendered obsolete. Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the F.B.I., surely fears that prospect. He has told Congress that preserving the ability to intercept communications legally, in the face of these technological advances, is "the No. 1 law enforcement, public safety and national security issue facing us today."
Some people criticize Clipper on the basis that truly sophisticated criminals would never use it, preferring other easily obtained systems that use high-grade cryptography. Despite Clipper, kidnappers and drug kingpins may construct Kallstrom's virtual fort in the Bronx with impunity, laughing at potential wiretappers.
The Government understands the impossibility of eradicating strong crypto. Its objective is instead to prevent unbreakable encryption from becoming rountine. If that happens, even the stupidest criminal would be liberated from the threat of surveillance. But by making Clipper the standard, the Government is betting that only a tiny percentage of users would use other encryption or try to defeat the Clipper.
At a rare public appearance in March at a conference on computers and privacy, Stewart A. Baker, then general counsel of the National Security Agency, tried to explain. "The concern is not so much what happens today when people go in and buy voice scramblers," said Baker, a dapper, mustached lawyer who worked as an Education Department lawyer in the Carter Administration. "It is the prospect that in 5 years or 10 years every phone you buy that costs $75 or more will have an encrypt button on it that will interoperate with every other phone in the country and suddenly we will discover that our entire communications network is being used in ways that are profoundly antisocial. That's the real concern, I think, that Clipper addresses. If we are going to have a standardized form of encryption that is going to change the world, we should think seriously about what we are going to do when it is misused."
Not all law-enforcement experts believe that cryptography will unleash a riot of lawlessness. William R. Spernow, a Sacramento, Calif., computer crime specialist who works on a grant from the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance, has encountered a few cases in which criminals have encrypted information unbreakably, including one involving a pedophile who encrypted the identities of his young victims. Yet Spernow sees no reason to panic. "In cases where there's encryption, the officers have been able to make the case through other investigative means," he says. "If we hustle, we can still make our cases through other kinds of police work."
But crime is only part of the problem. What happens to national security if cryptography runs free? Those who know best, officials of the National Security Agency, won't say. When the agency's director, Vice Adm. John M. McConnell testified before a Senate subcommittee on May 3, he withheld comment on this question until the public hearing was terminated and a second, classified session convened in a secure room.
Still, the effect of strong crypto on N.S.A. operations is not difficult to imagine. The agency is charged with signals intelligence, and it is widely assumed that it monitors all the communications between borders and probably much of the traffic within foreign countries. (It is barred from intercepting domestic communications.) If the crypto revolution crippled N.S.A.'s ability to listen in on the world, the agency might miss out on something vital -- for instance, portents of a major terrorist attack.
No compelling case has been made, however, that the key-escrow system would make it easier for authorities to learn of such an attack. The National Security Agency would take the legal steps to seek the telltale keys after it had first identified those potential terrorists and wiretapped their calls, then discovered the inpenetrable hiss of encryption. Even then, the keys would be useful only if the terrorists were encoding conversations with Clipper technology, the one kind the Government had the capability to decode instantly. What sort of nuclear terrorist would choose Clipper?
The Government response has been to say that potential terrorists might indeed use alternative crypto methods to converse among themselves. But if Clipper were the accepted standard, the terrorists would have to use it to communicate with outsiders -- banks, suppliers and other contacts. The Government could listen in on those calls. However, the work of the Bell Labs researcher, Matthew Blaze, casts serious doubt on that contention. Blaze has uncovered a flaw in Clipper that would allow a user to bypass the security funtion of the chip. Anyone who tinkered with Clipper in this way could communicate in privacy with anyone else with a Clipper phone and Government wiretappers would be unable to locate the key to unscramble the conversations.
Nonetheless, it was the terrorist threat, along with national security concerns, that moved the Clinton Administration to support the key-escrow inititative. White House high-tech policy makers share a recurrent fear: one day they might be sitting before an emergency Congressional investigation after the destruction of half of Manhattan by a stolen nuclear weapon planted in the World Trade towers and trying to explain that the Government had intercepted the communications of the terrorists but could not understand them because they used strong encryption. If Clipper were enacted, they could at least say, "We tried."
Obviously the Government views the Crypto revolution with alarm and wants to contain it. For years, much of its efforts have focused on the use of stringent export controls. While cryptography within the United States is unrestricted, the country's export laws treat any sort of encryption as munitions, like howitzers or nuclear triggers. The National Security Agency is the final arbiter and it will approve exports of cryptosystems in computer software and electronic hardware only if the protective codes are significantly weakened.
The N.S.A. stance is under attack from American businesses losing sales to foreign competitors. Listen to D. James Bidzos, the 39-year-old president of RSA Data Security, the Redwood City, Calif., company that controls the patents for public-key cryptography: "For almost 10 years, I've been going toe to toe with these people at Fort Meade. The success of this company is the worst thing that can happen to them. To them, we're the real enemy, we're the real target."
RSA is making a pitch to become the standard in encryption; its technology has been adopted by Apple, AT&T, Lotus, Microsoft, Novell and other major manufacturers. So imagine its unhappiness that its main rival is not another private company, but the National Security Agency, designer of the key-escrow cryptosystems. The agency is a powerful and dedicated competitor.
"We have the system that they're most afraid of," Bidzos says. "If the U.S. adopted RSA as a standard, you would have a truly international, interoperable, unbreakable, easy-to-use encryption technology. And all those things together are so synergistically theatening to the N.S.A.'s interests that it's driving them into a frenzy."
The export laws put shackles on Bidzos's company while his overseas competitors have no such restaints. Cryptographic algorithms that the N.S.A. bans for export are widely published and are literally being sold on the streets of Moscow. "We did a study on the problem and located 340 foreign cryptographic products sold by foreign countires," says Douglas R. Miller, government affairs manager of the Software Publishers Association. "The only effect of export controls is to cripple our ability to compete."
The real potential losses, though, come not in the stand-alone encryption category, but in broader applications. Companies like Microsoft, Apple and Lotus want to put strong encryption into their products but cannot get licenses to export them. Often, software companies wind up installing a weaker brand of crypto in all their products so that they can sell a single version worldwide. This seems to be the Government's intent -- to encourage "crypto lite," strong enough to protect communications from casual intruders but not from Government itself.
In the long run, however, export regulation will not solve the National Security Agency's problem. The crypto business is exploding. People are becoming more aware of the vunerability of phone conversations, particularly wireless ones. Even the National Football League is adopting crypto technology; it will try out encrypted radio communication between coaches and quarterbacks, so rivals can't intercept last-minute audibles.
Anticipating such a boom, the N.S.A. devised a strategy for the 90's. It would concede the need for strong encryption but encourage a system with a key-escrow "back door" that provides access to communications for itself and law enforcement. The security agency had already developed a strong cryptosystem based on an algorithm called Skipjack, supposedly 16 million times stronger than the previous standard, D.E.S. (Data Encryption Standard). Now the agency's designers integrated Skipjack into a new system that uses a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) that adds a signal to the message that directs a potential wiretapper to the approriate key to decipher the message. These features were included in a chip called Capstone, which could handle not only telephone communications but computer data transfers and digital signatures.
Supposedly, this technology was designed for Government use, but in 1993 the National Security Agency had a sudden opportunity to thrust it into the marketplace. AT&T had come to the agency with a new, relatively low-cost secure-phone device called the Surity 3600 that was designed to use the nonexportable DES encryption algorithm. The N.S.A. suggested that perhaps AT&T could try something else: a stripped-down version of Capstone for telephone communications. This was the Clipper chip. As a result, AT&T got two things: an agreement that Uncle Sam would buy thousands of phones for its own use (the initial commitment was 9,000, from the F.B.I.) and the prospect that the phone would not suffer the unhappy fate of some other secure devices when considered for export. There was also the expectation that AT&T would sell a lot more phones, since private companies would need to buy Clipper-equipped devices to communicate with the Governmment's Clipper phones.
It was an ingenious plan for several reasons. By agreeing to buy thousands of phones, and holding out the promise that thousands, or even millions more might be sold, AT&T phones gained a price advantage that comes with volume. (The original price of the Surity 3600 was $1,195, considerably less than the previous generation of secure phones; Mykotronx, the company making the Clipper chip, says that each chip now costs $30, but in large orders could quickly go as low as $10.) That would give the phones a big push in the marketplace. But by saturating the market, Clipper had a chance to become the standard for encryption, depending on whether businesses and individuals would be willing to accept a device that had the compromise of a government-controlled back door.
This compromise, of course, is the essence of Clipper. The Government recognizes the importance of keeping business secrets, intimate information and personal data hidden from most eyes and ears. But it also preserves a means of getting hold of that information after obtaining "legal authorization, normally a court order," according to a White House description.
The N.S.A. presented the idea to the Bush Administration, which took no action before the election. Then it had to convince a Democratic Administration to adopt the scheme, and started briefing the Clinton people during the transition. Many in the computer industry figured that with Vice President Al Gore's enthusiastic endorsement of the high-frontier virtues of the information highway, the Administration would never adopt any proposal so tilted in favor of law enforcement and away from his allies in the information industries. They figured wrong. A little more than two months after taking office, the Clinton Administration announced the existence of the Clipper chip and directed the National Institute of Standards and Technology to consider it as a Government standard.
Clipper was something the Administration -- starting with the Vice President -- felt compelled to adopt, and key escrow was considered an honorable attempt to balance two painfully contradictory interests, privacy and safety.
The reaction was instant, bitter and ceaseless. The most pervasive criticisms challenged the idea that a Clipper would be, as the standard said, "voluntary." The Government's stated intent is to manipulate the marketplace so that it will adopt an otherwise unpalatable scheme and make it the standard. Existing systems have to cope with export regulations and, now, incompatibility with the new Government Clipper standard. Is it fair to call a system voluntary if the Government puts all sorts of obstacles in the way of its competitors?
Others felt that it was only a matter of time before the National Security Agency pressured the Government to require key escrow of all cryptographic devices -- that Clipper was only the first step in a master plan to give Uncle Sam a key to everyone's cyberspace back door.
"That's a real fear," says Stephen T. Walker, a former N.S.A. employee who is now president of Trusted Information Systems, a company specializing in computer security products. "I don't think the Government could pull it off -- it would be like prohibition, only worse. But I think they might try it."
But mostly, people were unhappy with the essence of Clipper, that the Government would escrow their keys. As Diffie notes, key escrow reintroduces the vulnerability that led him to invent public key cryptography -- any system that relies on trusted third parties is, by definition, weaker than one that does not. Almost no one outside the Government likes the key-escrow idea. "We published the standard for 60 days of public comments," says F. Lynn McNulty, associate director for computer security at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. "We received 320 comments, only 2 of which were supportive."
Many people thought that in the face of such opposition, the Administration would quietly drop the Clipper proposal. They were dismayed by the Feb. 4 announcement of the adoption of Clipper as a Government standard. Administration officials knew they were alienating their natural allies in the construction of the information superhighway but felt they had no alternative. "This," said Michael R. Nelson, a White House technology official, "is the Bosnia of telecommunications."
If clipper is the administration's Techno-Bosnia, the crypto equivalent of snipers are everywhere -- in industry, among privacy lobbyists and even among Christian Fundamentalists. But the most passionate foes are the Cypherpunks. They have been meeting on the second Saturday of every month at the offices of Cygnus, a Silicon Valley company, assessing new ways they might sabotage Clipper. The group was co-founded in September 1992 by Eric Hughes, a 29-year-old freelance cryptogapher, and Tim May, a 42-year-old physicist who retired early and rich from the Intel company. Other Cypherpunk cells often meet simultaneously in six or seven locations around the world, but the main gathering place for Cypherpunks is the Internet, by means of an active mailing list in which members post as many as 100 electronic messages a day.
Cypherpunks share a few common premises. They assume that cryptography is a liberating tool, one that empowers individuals. They think that one of the most important uses of cryptography is to protect communications from the Government. Many of them believe that the Clipper is part of an overall initiative against cryptography that will culminate in Draconian control of the technology. And they consider it worth their time to fight, educating the general public and distributing cryptographic tools to obstruct such control.
Both Hughes and May have composed manifestos. Hughes's call to arms proclaims: "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it."
May's document envisions a golden age in which strong cryptography belongs to all -- an era of "crypto anarchism" that governments cannot contain. To May, cryptography is a tool that will not only bestow privacy on people but help rearrange the economic underpinnings of society.
"Combined with emerging information markets, cryptography will create a liquid market for any and all material that can be put into words and pictures," May's document says. "And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property."
At a recent meeting, about 50 Cypherpunks packed into the Cygnus conference room, with dozens of others participating electronically from sites as distant as Cambridge, Mass., and San Diego. The meeting stretched for six hours, with discussions of hardware encryption schemes, methods to fight an electronic technique of identity forgery called "spoofing," the operation of "remailing" services, which allow people to post electronic messages anonymously -- and various ways to fight Clipper.
While the Cypherpunks came up with possible anti-Clipper slogans for posters and buttons, a bearded crypto activist in wire-rim glasses named John Gilmore was outside the conference room, showing the latest sheaf of cryptography-related Freedom of Information documents he'd dragged out of Government files. Unearthing and circulating the hidden crypto treasures of the National Security Agency is a passion of Gilmore, an early employee of Sun Microsystems who left the company a multimillionaire. The Government once threatened to charge him with a felony for copying some unclassified-and-later-reclassified N.S.A. documents from a university library. After the story hit the newspapers, the Government once again declassified the documents.
"This country was founded as an open society, and we still have the remnants of that society," Gilmore says. "Will crypto tend to open it or close it? Our Government is building some of these tools for its own use, but they are unavailable -- we have paid for cryptographic breakthroughs but they're classified. I wish I could hire 10 guys -- cryptographers, librarians -- to try to pry cryptography out of the dark ages."
Perhaps the most admired Cypherpunk is someone who says he is ineligible because he often wears a suit. He is Philip R. Zimmermann, a 40-year-old software engineer and cryptographic consultant from Boulder, Colo., who in 1991 cobbled together a cryptography program for computer data and electronic mail. "PGP," he called it, meaning Pretty Good Privacy, and he decided to give it away. Anticipating the Cypherpunk credo, Zimmermann hoped that the appearance of free cryptography would guarantee its continued use after a possible Government ban. One of the first people receiving the program placed it on a computer attached to the Internet and within days thousands of people had PGP. Now the program has been through several updates and is becoming sort of a people's standard for public key cryptography. So far, it appears that no one has been able to crack information encoded with PGP.
Like Diffie, Zimmermann developed a boyhood interest in crypto. "When I was a kid growing up in Miami, it was just kind of cool -- secret messages and all," he says. Later, "computers made it possible to do ciphers in a practical manner." He was fascinated to hear of public key cryptography and during the mid-1980's he began experimenting with a system that would work on personal computers. With the help of some colleagues, he finally devised a strong system, albeit one that used some patented material from RSA Data Security. And then he heard about the Senate bill that proposed to limit a citizen's right to use strong encryption by requiring manufacturers to include back doors in their products. Zimmermann, formerly a nuclear freeze activist, felt that one of the most valuable potential uses of cryptography was to keep messages secret from the Government.
Zimmermann has put some political content into the documentation for his program: "If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy. Intelligence agencies have access to good cryptographic technology. So do the big arms and drug traffickers. So do defense contractors, oil companies, and other corporate giants. But ordinary people and grassroots political organizations mostly have not had access to affordable 'military grade' public-key cryptographic technology. Until now."
He has been told that Burmese freedom fighters learn PGP in jungle training camps on portable computers, using it to keep documents hidden from their oppressive Government. But his favorite letter comes from a person in Latvia, who informed him that his program was a favorite among one-time refuseniks in that former Soviet republic. "Let it never be," wrote his correspondant, "but if dictatorship takes over Russia, your PGP is widespread from Baltic to Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary."
Early last year, Zimmermann received a visit from two United States Customs Service agents. They wanted to know how it was that the strong encryption program PGP had found its way overseas with no export license. In the fall, he learned from his lawyer that he was a target of a grand jury investigation in San Jose, Calif. But even if the Feds should try to prosecute, they are likely to face a tough legal issue: Can it be a crime, in the process of legally distributing information in this country, to place it on an Internet computer site that is incidentally accessible to network users in other countries? There may well be a First Amendment issue here: Americans prize the right to circulate ideas, including those on software disks.
John Gilmore has discovered that Government lawyers have their own doubts about these issues. In some documents he sued to get, there are mid-1980's warnings by the Justice Department that the export controls on cryptography presented "sensitive constitutional issues." In one letter, an assistant attorney general warns that "the regulatory scheme extends too broadly into an area of protected First Amendment speech."
Perhaps taking Phil Zimmermann to court would not be the Government's best method for keeping the genie in the bottle.
The Clipper program has already begun. About once a month, four couriers with security clearances travel from Washington to the Torrance, Calif., headquarters of Mykotronx, which holds the contract to make Clipper chips. They travel in pairs, two from each escrow agency: the NIST and the Treasury Department. The redundancy is a requirement of a protocol known as Two-Person Integrity, used in situations like nuclear missile launches, where the stakes are too high to rely on one person.
The couriers wait while a Sun work station performs the calculations to generate the digital cryptographic keys that will be imprinted in the Clipper chips. Then it splits the keys into two pieces, separate number chains, and writes them on two floppy disks, each holding lists of "key splits." To reconstruct the keys imprinted on the chip, and thereby decode private conversations, you would need both sets of disks.
After being backed up, the sets of disks are separated, each one going with a pair of couriers. When the couriers return to their respective agencies, each set of disks is placed in a double-walled safe. The backup copies are placed in similar safes. There they wait, two stacks of floppy disks that grow each month, now holding about 20,000 key splits, the so-called back doors.
Will this number grow into the millions as the Government hopes? Ultimately the answer lies with the American public. Administration officials are confident that when the public contemplates scenarios like the Fortress in the Bronx or the Mushroom Cloud in Lower Manhattan, it will realize that allowing the Government to hold the keys is a relatively painless price to pay for safety and national security. They believe the public will eventually accept it in the same way it now views limited legal wiretapping. But so far the Administration hasn't recruited many prominent supporters. The main one is Dorothy Denning, a crypto expert who heads the computer science department at Georgetown University.
Since endorsing Clipper (and advocating passage of the Digital Telephony initiative) Denning has been savagely attacked on the computer nets. Some of the language would wither a professional wrestler. "I've seen horrible things written about me," Denning says with a nervous smile. "I try to actually now avoid looking at them, because that's not what's important to me. What's important is that we end up doing the right thing with this. It was an accumulation of factors that led me to agree with Clipper, and the two most important areas, to me, are organized crime and terrorism. I was exposed to cases where wiretaps had actually stopped crimes in the making, and I started thinking, 'If they didn't have this tool, some of these things might have happened.' You know, I hate to use the word responsibility, but I actually feel some sense of responsibility to at least state my position to the extent so that people will understand it."
The opponents of Clipper are confident that the marketplace will vote against it. "The idea that the Government holds the keys to all our locks, before anyone has even been accused of committing a crime, doesn't parse with the public," says Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "It's not America."
Senator Leahy hints that Congress might not stand for the Clinton Administration's attempt to construct the key-escrow system, at an estimated cost of $14 million dollars initially and $16 million annually. "If the Administration wants the money to set up and run the key-escrow facilities," he says, "it will need Congressional approval." Despite claims by the National Institute of Standards and Technology deputy director, Raymond G. Kammer, that some foreign governments have shown interest in the scheme, Leahy seems to agree with most American telecommunications and computer manufacturers that Clipper and subsequent escrow schemes will find no favor in the vast international marketplace, turning the United States into a cryptographic island and crippling important industries.
Leahy is also concerned about the Administration's haste. "The Administration is rushing to implement the Clipper chip program without thinking through crucial details," he says. Indeed, although the Government has been buying and using Clipper encryption devices, the process of actually getting the keys out of escrow and using them to decipher scrambled conversations has never been field tested. And there exists only a single uncompleted prototype of the device intended to do the deciphering.
Leahy is also among those who worry that, all policy issues aside, the Government's key escrow scheme might fail solely on technical issues. The Clipper and Capstone chips, while powerful enough to use on today's equipment, have not been engineered for the high speeds of the coming information highway; updates will be required. Even more serious are the potential design flaws in the unproved key-escrow scheme. Matthew Blaze's discovery that wrongdoers could foil wiretappers may be only the first indication that Clipper is unable to do the job for which it was designed. In his paper revealing the glitch, he writes, "It is not clear that it is possible to construct EES (Escrow Encryption Standard) that is both completely invulnerable to all kinds of exploitation as well as generally useful."
At bottom, many opponents of Clipper do not trust the Government. They are unimpressed by the elaborate key-escrow security arrangements outlined for Clipper. Instead, they ask questions about the process by which the Clipper was devised -- how is it that the N.S.A., an intelligence agency whose mission does not ordinarily include consumer electronics design, has suddenly seized a central role in creating a national information matrix? They also complain that the Skipjack cryptographic algorithm is a classified secret, one that cryptographic professionals cannot subject to the rigorous, extended testing that has previously been used to gain universal trust for such a standard.
"You don't want to buy a set of car keys from a guy who specializes in stealing cars," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "The N.S.A.'s specialty is the ability to break codes, and they are saying, 'Here, take our keys, we promise you they'll work.' "
At the March conference on computers and privacy, Stewart Baker responded to this sort of criticism. "This is the revenge of people who couldn't go to Woodstock because they had too much trig homework," he said, evoking some catcalls. "It's a kind of romanticism about privacy. The problem with it is that the beneficiaries of that sort of romanticism are going to be predators. PGP, they say, is out there to protect freedom fighters in Latvia. But the fact is, the only use that has come to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a guy who was using PGP so the police could not tell what little boys he had seduced over the net. Now that's what people will use this for -- it's not the only thing people will use it for, but they will use it for that -- and by insisting on having a claim to privacy that is beyond social regulation, we are creating a world in which people like that will flourish and be able to do more than they can do today."
Even if Clipper flops, the Crypto War will continue. The Administration remains committed to limiting the spread of strong cryptography unless there's a back door. Recently, it has taken to asking opponents for alternatives to Clipper. One suggestion it will not embrace is inaction. "Deciding that the genie is out of the bottle and throwing our arms up is not where we're at," says a White House official.
The National Security Agency will certainly not go away. "The agency is really worried about its screens going blank" due to unbreakable encryption, says Lance J. Hoffman, a professor of computer science at George Washington University. "When that happens, the N.S.A. -- said to be the largest employer in Maryland -- goes belly-up. A way to prevent this is to expand its mission and to become, effectively, the one-stop shop for encryption for Government and those that do business with the Government."
Sure enough, the security agency is cooking up an entire product line of new key-escrow chips. At Fort Meade, it has already created a high-speed version of the Skipjack algorithm that outperforms both Clipper and Capstone. There is also another, more powerful, encryption device in the works named Baton. As far as the agency is concerned, these developments are no more than common sense. "To say that N.S.A. shouldn't be involved in this issue is to say that Government should try to solve this difficult technical and social problem with both hands tied behind its back," Stewart Baker says.
But Phil Zimmermann and the Cypherpunks aren't going away, either. Zimmermann is, among other things, soliciting funds for a PGP phone that will allow users the same sort of voice encryption provided by the Clipper chip. The difference, of course, is that in his phone there is no key escrow, no back door. If the F.B.I. initiated a wiretap on someone using Zimmermann's proposed phone, all the investigators would hear is static that they could never restore to orderly language.
What if that static shielded the murderous plans of a terrorist or kidnapper? Phil Zimmermann would feel terrible. Ultimately he has no answer. "I am worried about what might happen if unlimited security communications come about," he admits. "But I also think there are tremendous benefits. Some bad things would happen, but the trade-off would be worth it. You have to look at the big picture."

HEADLINE: As Life's Questions Get Harder, Magic Casts a Wider Spell

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
Like the lady who vanished and then reappeared at the wave of a wand, magic is back. And not just on the nightclub and Off Broadway circuits.
Americans are increasingly enchanted with products and notions that promise a simple route to transformation, salvation or cure. More and more marketers are imbuing some foods, cosmetics, folk cures and forms of exercise with magical powers to fight aging and disease. And magical themes abound in plays, movies, books and music. 
 Experts who observe American culture have noticed the resurgence of interest in magic. And many consider it a logical response to contemporary life.
"Magic," said Lionel Tiger, a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., "is a way for an industrial society to recreate a sense of danger without experiencing real danger, and a way of creating the imponderable in full knowledge that a simple gimmick is at work. It is a clear reach into the anthropological past."
Sleight-of-hand and escape artists, spiritualists and mediums appear whenever society feels powerless or overwhelmed, Dr. Tiger said.
And James Randi, a k a "The Amazing Randi," a 50-year veteran of the trade and the author of "Conjuring," a history of magic (St. Martin's Press, 1993), said wars and times of economic uncertainty had always been good for the magic business.
"Today people are contending with a deluge of often conflicting information, as well as insecurity on the job, on the street and in their homes," Mr. Randi said. "People want simple scenarios, which magic is, and simple answers, which magic can provide."
George Rosenbaum, a market research executive in Chicago, looks at current fads and sees a society hungry for simple belief systems. "The rise of tattoos, which are magical amulets, the explosion of state lotteries and legalized gambling, which both court Lady Luck, are manifestations of this hunger," Mr. Rosenbaum said. "So is the disaffection with traditional religions and growing appeal of mysticism, and the proliferation of 'cures' that rely on eating regime."
These diverse phenomena share one characteristic, Mr. Rosenbaum said: "They are simple convictions. None require soul-searching or serving a demanding or complicated god. Each requires, and in turn yields, a simple 'yes' or 'no,' which is the hallmark of magical thinking."
Today's "time-pressed, high-tech society," he said, "makes people want to short-circuit complicated, rational decision-making and put their faith in a simple belief system."
 
Balm for a Quizzical Itch
 The hunger for a simple faith helped make the magic show "Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants" one of the hottest tickets of the New York theater season this year. The growing appetite for magic also brings lines to plays like "Beauty and the Beast," and movies like "Lorenzo's Oil," "Like Water for Chocolate" and "The House of the Spirits" are balms to the itch for simple answers. As the magical realism pioneered by Latin American writers is echoed by American writers, including Alice Hoffman, Leslie Marmon Silko, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, literature offers increasing options to those seeking magical answers. Even shopping malls play music that evokes magical Caribbean themes.
The popularity of magic has waxed and waned through history. While organizing a display about the history of food and magic last year, Barbara Wheaton, an honorary curator of the culinary collection at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., found that, in any given era, the magical qualities assigned to specific substances often reflected what people thought they could not control.
Take tomatoes.
"In the 17th century," Dr. Wheaton said, "people characterized food by what it did for them morally. Today, we're so obsessed with mortality that we infuse something like cholesterol with the power of working bad magic. Yet is our real knowledge about how cholesterol works that much more definitive than the evidence during the 1600's that tomatoes caused wanton behavior?"
Today, part of the desire for magic may stem from the desire for a spiritual life. Noting the rise of Santeria, an African-inspired Caribbean faith that uses idols, food rituals and dancing to promote closeness to a variety of deities, Robert Farris Thompson, a professor of African and African-American art at Yale University, said that "the precision and speed that computers demand robs everyday life of contemplative, mystical moments and contributes to a rise of a deeper spiritual hunger."
 
Computer Magic
 Computers can whet the appetite for magic, and they can sate that hunger as well. As Bruce Tognazzini, an engineer at Sun Microsystems in Mountain View, Calif., put it: "Like the magician, the computer appears to be powerful and intelligent. In fact, computers are only capable of responding to yes-or-no commands."
An amateur magician, Mr. Tognazzini was well aware of the similarities between stage magic and computer programs when he worked on the human interface design for several generations of Macintosh computers.
"A stage magician uses the esthetics of his performance to distract from the mechanics of his trick," he said. "A software designer relies on consistency to provide the seamless and believable illusion that what is appearing on the screen is a reflection of what is actually happening in the machine. If the lay users didn't believe this to be the case, they'd be paralyzed in front of their PC's and incapable of working."
Both stage magic and computers require suspension of disbelief, he said, adding that "once you have suspended disbelief in one area, you are ripe for takeover in any number of other areas."
Food manufacturers, too, increasingly use "scientific data to bolster magical thinking about food," said Michelle Stacey, whose book "Consumed: Why Americans Love, Hate and Fear Food" was released by Simon & Schuster last month.
Analyzing the manias for low-fat or cholesterol-free eating, Ms. Stacey contends that conflicting scientific studies have fostered different fashions in eating. "We know more about health and nutrition than at any other time in history," she said in an interview. "At the same time, we are more susceptible to magic bullets."
In his newest novel, "Millroy the Magician" (Random House), Paul Theroux exploits the craze for assigning magical properties to food. By dint of his preachings about the healthful and potentially transforming powers of biblical foods, Millroy, a carnival magician, rises to become a television impresario and cult leader.
 
Reality, and Virtual Reality
 "People are vulnerable to messianic personalities and fad cures when there is a confusion between reality and virtual reality," Mr. Theroux said. "The confusion is so pronounced right now that people have become preoccupied with their poor, weak flesh and are very interested in taking magical measures that promise simple results."
The recent spate of "anti-aging" cosmetics, for instance, promises a magical way of thwarting Father Time, as a brief visit to a cosmetics counter at Barneys New York showed recently. Demonstrating Mending Solution, a potion by Origins, the sales clerk said: "This product magically moves below the surface to repair invisible cells. It doesn't simply mask biology; it actually changes it."
For whatever reason, consumers have developed an Achilles' heel for magical fixes, said Mr. Rosenbaum, the Chicago market researcher. Like Mr. Tognazzini, Mr. Rosenbaum is concerned that the suspension of disbelief about the powers of food, computers and cosmetics makes the culture, at least temporarily, ripe for Millroy-like messianics and sets the stage for virtual reality to grow smarter while real people grow dumber.
But he expects the romance with magical thinking -- and its effectiveness in the marketing of products -- to be fleeting.
"We are in the midst of accommodating huge leaps in technology and a revolution in the ethnic and social fabric of life," Mr. Rosenbaum said. "Once the culture accommodates these changes, it will once again become more skeptical."
But right now, illusion and delusion in art and commerce are wrapped around daily life like an impossibly knotted necklace.
Many legitimate magicians say they wish they could wave a wand and untangle the chain. But they don't believe in magic.
"Magic is just a well-executed illusion," said Micah Lasher, a 12-year-old magician from Glen Rock, N.J., whom professionals view as a prodigy. Last month, Micah patiently explained the mechanics of several of his illusions to a group of 20 professionals in the basement of a bar in Yonkers.
On the street above, one billboard advertised "anti-aging cream," another "whole foods for a long life"; yet another carried an announcement for the movie "The House of the Spirits." In the bar itself, a Paul Simon record played, full of rhythms used to summon magical African deities. Two patrons used numerology to select a lottery number for the next day.
Downstairs, Micah told his colleagues that the best way to distract from the mechanics of an illusion was to tell a story.
"I find stories about everyday life work best," he said. "Last night, for instance, I woke up thirsty. It was dark, but I decided to go down to the kitchen. The . . . uh, excuse me, sir, could you pick a card? Any card. Thank you. . . . So I fumbled around for the lights. . . . "

HEADLINE: Ukraine Hints It Won't Close Nuclear Plants at Chernobyl

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Two months ago Ukraine pledged to shut down its nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, but American officials are concerned that Ukrainian leaders are having second thoughts, and the Americans are at odds over what to do about it.
New evidence, including a secret directive by President Leonid Kravchuk, suggests that Ukraine may not close the two reactors still operating at Chernobyl because it needs the energy. 
 In fact, Administration officials say, Ukraine appears to be planning to restart a third reactor that was shut after a fire in 1991. That would leave only one of the plant's four reactors closed -- the one destroyed eight years ago in the catastrophe that made Chernobyl synonymous with nuclear disaster.
Western scientists and government nuclear experts fear that as long as the flawed and unstable reactors at Chernobyl operate, the danger remains that another disaster could spew radioactivity across much of Europe.
The agreement worked out in April between the United States and Ukraine was significant because it was the first time a former Soviet republic had bowed to Western pressure to shut down such reactors.
Western leaders are to review the issue next month when they gather in Italy for a Group of Seven meeting, and the White House is scrambling to persuade Ukraine to stay its promised course. But the task has already prompted a battle within the Administration over what price the West should pay to finally close the dangerous plant completely.
The State Department approach, with cost estimates ranging into the hundreds of millions of dollars, calls for the West to help Ukraine complete at least three Soviet-style nuclear reactors now under construction. But the Energy Department strongly opposes the idea, saying the West should not help start up reactors that critics regard as flawed.
To compensate for the energy Ukraine would lose if Chernobyl is shut down, Energy Department officials have urged that the West help Ukraine to become more energy-efficient and to build plants that use renewable resources like wind and solar energy.
Both France and Germany favor completing the three reactors under construction, raising the possibility of a dispute within the Group of Seven, the world's major industrial democracies. Aides to President Clinton say there will be little time at the Group of Seven meeting, from July 8 to 10 in Naples, for any last-minute resolution of differences.
But with memories still vivid of the failure of past calls for Chernobyl's demise, American officials say they are determined that the Naples meeting make clear not only that the major industrial nations want the plant closed, but that they are willing to make it worthwhile for Ukraine to close it.
In an interview last week, Deputy Energy Secretary William H. White, who worked out the agreement with Ukraine to shut Chernobyl "at the earliest possible date," expressed some urgency about sealing the deal.
"I think the Group of Seven will push for a plan that will detail and outline the steps Ukraine should take in closing down Chernobyl, and what would be planned in terms of the role of the West," Mr. White said. "And I believe there are many who will want the communique to discuss specific timetables."
 
The Unstable Graphite
 All four reactors at Chernobyl, including the two still running, are of a design known as R.B.M.K., notorious since the 1986 disaster for a reliance on graphite instead of water to assist in the nuclear reaction. Graphite is inherently unstable.
Ukraine had once promised to shut down the plant altogether by 1993. But in October, Russia began to reduce shipments of oil and gas to Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Parliament voted to keep the plant in operation.
The new pledge in April was made by Vice Prime Minister Valery Shmarov, who signed an agreement saying Chernobyl would be closed once the country "reached a balance in the energy system and found resources to take the plant out of operation."
But American officials now say the "commitment in principle" appears far from solid. Many Ukrainian officials are convinced that nuclear power represents the only realistic alternative to dependence on Russian gas, and they have drafted ambitious plans to build their energy capacity.
Although the two reactors still operating at Chernobyl produce just 1,700 megawatts of power, about 3 percent of Ukraine's needs, officials there are suggesting that they are not prepared to shut them down until five new reactors supplying 5,000 megawatts are in operation.
Perhaps even more troubling, Administration officials say, are indications that Ukraine is preparing to restart Chernobyl Unit 2, which has been out of service since the 1991 fire.
A copy of President Kravchuk's directive, made available this week by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has expressed alarm at Chernobyl's continued operation, lists the reactor as one that Ukraine should "bring on line" in 1995.
In seeking to block that plan, Administration officials say they have agreed that the West should at least pledge to upgrade any new reactors to meet Western safety standards. In looking ahead to the Group of Seven meeting, they also say there is consensus within the Administration that a communique being drafted this week by an Italian-led working group is too permissive in declaring that Chernobyl should not be closed until Ukraine's domestic energy demands can be satisfied at economical prices.
Administration officials say the dispute between the State Department and the Energy Department leaves unclear how far the Administration would go in promising Western aid to complete or build Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in Ukraine. The two departments plan more meetings next week.
 
The Czech Example
 The Administration has already approved $317 million in loan guarantees to allow the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to complete two such reactors at Temelin, in the Czech Republic. At the State Department, advocates of adopting a similar approach in Ukraine contend that the advanced VVER-1000 design of the reactors at Temelin makes them a relatively low safety risk.
But Energy Department officials opposed to that plan contend that the West should refrain from any connection to the Temelin reactors, in part because the International Atomic Energy Agency has said they too suffer from design problems. The energy officials say the West should instead make an aggressive effort to persuade Ukraine that the power lost by closing Chernobyl could be replaced through non-nuclear means.
"If the international community is willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on some form of energy supply for Ukraine," a senior Administration official said this week, "it might as well make sure it explores the energy-efficiency and renewable-energy options before plunging into this new territory of building brand-new reactors or reactors that still have a substantial amount of work toward completion."

HEADLINE: Lessons in Survival: Robeson High, '94 -- A special report;
Graduation: Where 500 Began, 150 Remain

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 11

 BODY:
Very soon now, what is left of the senior class at Paul Robeson High School will walk up the narrow steps and across the stage at the Third Baptist Church on the South Side for the 1994 commencement. The boys will wear red caps and gowns. The girls will wear gold. An alumna who is an engineer will give the commencement address. "Pomp and Circumstance" will play.
The seniors who managed to avoid being swallowed by the streets will finally touch a diploma, some becoming the first in their families to do so. The teachers expect it to be an exuberant occasion when their pleas for silence are likely be ignored by overjoyed aunts and foster parents. 
 The class does not look like it did freshman year before some girls had babies and some boys started selling crack and the shootings began to take their toll in the Englewood section of Chicago. From a class that began with 500 students, some 350 names will be missing from the program.
Gabrielle Joiner died in his junior year in a drive-by shooting over, people at Robeson say, some bad drugs a customer thought he had sold. Nikia Bell, a pallbearer at Gabrielle's funeral, is in Cook County Jail on drug charges. Johnny Elverton, a popular senior who helped paint the school mural in the front hall, is at Oak Forest Hospital in a coma after being shot outside his house last October. Irving Willis would be with his classmates, but he fell behind sophomore year and is now in the Class of '95. Many others have transferred or dropped out or will go to summer school in hopes of graduating later.
The seniors who will wear the robes on June 27 include Felicia Cribbs, who works at Popeye's and wants to be a nurse, and Carlos Burnes, the football captain who says he is sick of the violence, is going away to college and hopes never to live in Chicago again. At least 30 seniors are parents, and 3 girls are now expecting.
For those who make it to commencement, the journey has not been one simply from grammar school to the 12th grade. Some people at Robeson have taken to calling them the survivors of '94, not the seniors of '94 because they live lives with no guarantees.
"When I'm walking to school, I think about what would happen if someone drives up and pulls a gun on me," said Maurice Hill, a 19-year-old senior who was shot in the leg four years ago. " 'Would you be able to react to it in time? Are you going to run or try to get out of the way?' You got to think like that."
At big-city schools like Robeson, violence is a fact of life. The football team, which lost the city championship this school year by two points in the closing seconds, was real good, one coach said, at dropping to the ground when members heard the popping of gunfire across the practice field.
In a survey of 40 seniors, two-thirds said they had friends who had died violently. Rabashia Wright said she had lost eight friends since her freshman year.
Asked where they thought they would be in 10 years and what their dreams were, one girl said: "A wonderful husband and beautiful children. I will be teaching the second grade." One boy said, "I don't have a dream."
In official measures like truancy or dropout rates, Robeson is neither the worst nor the best school in Chicago. It may be on the rougher side of average and shows what many urban high schools must do to have any graduates at all. Teachers and staff members buy disposable diapers for students' babies, visit students in jail, find shelter for them if their parents put them out or pick up assignments from students who are at home after a birth but still want to do their work.
A big fear for counselors is that a family will run out of money to pay the telephone bill. "We can save them if they don't lose that phone," said Eudell McKenzie, a counselor. "I can keep bugging them then. But when the phone is disconnected and then the emergency number is disconnected, that child is almost lost."
Robeson sits in a gang war zone where a detente has been reached, but peace is theoretical. The school administration does what it says it must to keep the building safe. Students are neither permitted to use lockers nor encouraged to carry knapsacks that could be used to conceal weapons or drugs.
Class periods are twice the normal length -- 100 minutes -- to cut the time students could spend hanging out in the halls. Coats and sweaters are carried from class to class and hung on peg boards. Students pick up textbooks and notebooks from the day before and put them back when class is over.
Teachers say they do not have enough books to go around, and students say they rarely do homework because they cannot take the books home. In classes like physics, students try to write down as much as they can from the book to study at home.
While it seems that almost anything could happen in the streets, there have been no shootings in the school, which was named in 1977 for Paul Robeson, the black actor. The building, with its plain brick face, scratched plexiglass windows and house plants across from the metal detectors, has become a safe house of sorts. Students stay well past the final bell, and teachers sometimes have to shoo them out of the building.
The teachers know the students and their stories. "See that boy in the Bulls jacket?" Rosemarie Nicholes, the instructional coordinator said, standing in the hall. "Smart as a whip -- doesn't want anyone to know it. See that one in the black jacket -- both his parents are dope addicts and another lady took him in."
Most students return at the end of the day to homes headed by a single mother, many on welfare. Only 15 out of 100 seniors surveyed by the school last month were living with both parents. One in five does not live with a parent at all.
Chaunti Bryla lives with a cousin. Latrell Shelton lives with an aunt. Anthony Currie and Theresa Stilwell live by themselves.
School may be the safest part of their day. "I don't worry about them when school is in session," said Dr. Jacqueline Simmons, Robeson's principal. "But on weekends and spring break, I worry. I can't wait to read the papers to check whether anything has happened to one of them."
The senior class overflows with dreams and war stories. Here are four members who will be among the graduates:
 
The Gang Widow
Dropout Becomes An Honor Student
 In her starter jacket, baseball cap, big gold earring in the shape of a Nike logo and attitude from here to Ohio, Marlo Willies may not fit everyone's image of an honor student. But last quarter she earned one A, two B's and two C's, enough to make the honor roll.
She is also a gangster widow. Two years ago she bore the son of a high-ranking member of the Black Disciples street gang. Last year the father was killed by some rival Vice Lords. Her position means that she can depend on her late boyfriend's associates to give her rides, buy things for the baby and warn her if shooting is about to break out.
She is a Disciple herself -- in "the organization" as members call it. "Ain't too much I'm scared of," she said. "I ain't scared of nobody."
She dropped out of school before her son, Keitero, was born and came back because she wanted to make a better life for him. She is in a dropout prevention program. Counselors call and prod the students to come to school, often showing up in their living rooms if the students miss a class. Since joining the program, Marlo has gone from mostly F's to most-improved student.
 
'The Downtown People'
 Her father, who once worked in the post office, reared her after her mother left. He learned to braid Marlo's hair by buying a doll at Toys R Us and practicing until he got it right. "Being raised by my daddy, I'm not a typical girl," Marlo said. "Blood doesn't bother me. I can put a worm on a hook with no problems, and I don't mind getting dirty."
Right now she says she wants to be a nurse or work in a bank. She is dreaming of being one of those purposeful people she sees running to catch buses or trains to the Loop. Her fantasy is to work in an office and wear stockings like them. "The downtown people," she calls them.
"I see them walk by every day," she said. "I like the pretty white stockings and the gym shoes and the purse and umbrella. The downtown people -- they got money and self-esteem. Sometimes they look tired. They probably feel good about themselves. They're working and getting paid. They don't have to wait on no aid check or no man."
 
The Loner
One Finds School Easier Than Life
 The yellow school bus pulled from the curb next to Robeson filled with sequined students dressed a few octaves higher than the time of day would call for. It was 10 A.M., and some were in full evening gowns. They were headed to the senior luncheon aboard the Odyssey 2 and the first boat ride for many of them.
Their group pictures on deck had tall glass buildings in the background. The Gangster Disciples showed up in their black suits and fedoras. The G.D.'s had their own picture taken and did not let any boys who weren't G.D.'s in it. One G.D., Davion Fleming, came in a limousine, set his fedora, crown down, on the table to eat his roast beef and potato salad, did not dance to Snoop Doggy Dog at all and left in a limousine after it was over.
Hiram Hill did not go to the senior luncheon. He did not have the $37 for the cruise or money for a suit. He did not have a grandmother to give him some of her Social Security check or any money stashed away from a side job dealing drugs. That's not the kind of guy he is. He has one set of clothes -- jeans, a black T-shirt and an Adidas jacket.
Hiram, who is not related to Maurice Hill, saw the classmates off that morning, hands tight in his pocket, looking down at the sidewalk. Then he headed home.
His teachers say he is a nice boy who never gets a break. There were times in the last four years when there was no food in his refrigerator, no heat or hot water and no coat to get him through the winter. His mother, who always seems to be between jobs, has had trouble with alcohol. His father, a janitor, left the family years ago because "he could not deal with her addiction," a teacher said.
Some days Hiram would come to school late because it took extra time to heat the bath water on the hot plate. "School is easy compared to my life," he said.
Hiram will be the first of the four Hill brothers to graduate from high school. One brother is in jail. One has a son and a girlfriend who live with Hiram and his mother. "It seems like the only one proud of me is me," Hiram said.
He wanted to be different from his brothers and finish school. "If I get killed, I just get killed," he said. "I wasn't going to let it keep me from coming to school."
He did not go to the prom. His girlfriend -- it took him two years before he got the nerve to call her that -- broke up with him last week. But he said he would not have gone anyway because he could not afford it.
Recently he found an after-school job as a stock boy at a Walgreen's drug store, paying $4.25 an hour. It took a year of constant searching to get the job. "I'm doing this by myself," Hiram said. "I don't know where I'll be in 10 years. I don't even know if I'll be alive."
He keeps mostly to himself, says he does not trust anyone and has no role models. He seems to confide only in the journal in his social studies class. This is how Hiram explained his world earlier this semester in an essay where emotion gets more attention than spelling:
"The reason why teenagers are killing each other is because teenagers are struggling to survive more than animals are. It is not the teenagers that are to blame. The government does not want to put any recreation or counseling in the community. All of these drug addict parents are the real reason teenagers are killing each other. I think everybody knows what the problem is. It's just nobody wants to do a dam thing to help 'cause they are all scared.
"It is like haveing a broken step on your stairs and haveing the tools to fix it but not fixing it 'cause you are scared you will hurt your finger or something."
Hiram says he wants to go into marketing or maybe psychology. He heard there is money in that. A teacher got him to apply to Barber-Scotia College in Concord, N.C., but Hiram does not know whether he will even go. He had to confront the issue a few weeks ago when he filled out the school's senior survey. On the line for career choice, he wrote, "N.A." for "Not Applicable."
 
The Valedictorian
A Student Leaves The Others in Awe
 In home economics class the other day, a knot of students sat staring impatiently at a television screen, waiting for a glimpse of their hero. They were watching a replay of the state track finals in the 800-meter run and were getting antsy because, even though they knew the outcome, they could not see Nathaniel Omar. Why didn't those other runners get out of his way?
A blur of red, a corner of his jersey, appeared at the edge of the screen. "That's him! That's him!" one said.
"Come on, Omar! Come on, Omar!" another yelled.
"He's locked in now," said a third.
Nathaniel Omar came in sixth that day, but the Robeson students did not care about numbers. When the winner crossed the finish line, one girl said, "He runs like Omar."
They call him Omar, and he can do no wrong. When he walks into a room, the girls check their pin curls and ponytails. The boys rush over to slap him on the back.
He is everything at Robeson -- the valedictorian, track star and football player with a 3.6 grade point average, who works at Walgreen's after school. He has an amiable, angular face. Everybody knows him.
The seniors voted him Most Popular, Most Athletic, Most Articulate, Most Intelligent, Best Personality, Best Physique, Most School Spirited, Most Confident and Most Likely to Succeed.
Even the roughest gang members seem to be in awe of him. They leave him alone. He is aware of the violence and takes precautions but does not like to worry about it. "You have to keep your eyes open and pay attention to who's around you," he said. "You got to have a mind of your own. I don't follow what other people do. Can't nobody tell me nothing."
Ivy League schools do not come recruiting at places like Robeson. He did not apply to the prestigious area institutions like Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, which want higher scores than his on standardized tests. He is going to Southern University in Baton Rouge, La. and plans to major in business administration.
One of the few Robeson seniors in a two-parent home, he is the only boy among 10 children. His twin sister, Salimah, is also in the top five in the class. Unlike most other parents, their mother, Carolyn, is often at school, helping decorate the bulletin board or chaperoning the senior class luncheon.
 
The Model
Changing Vanity Into a Motivation
 For weeks, Monika Williams, the shortstop on the girls' softball team and the most fashionable girl at Robeson, walked around school toting a shopping bag filled with the paperwork of her twin obsessions. One is the prom. Tucked into her little shopping bag was a glossy catalogue with a picture of the navy sequined prom dress she had put in layaway in April. She would peek at the picture occasionally or warily show it to a few people who she knew would not copy it.
The other obsession is college -- her ticket to the fame and fortune she feels she was born to have. To Monika, it is an accident of circumstance that she lives in the Robert Taylor housing project and not in Beverly Hills. She carries business cards with a picture of herself announcing her availability as a model, shops the sales racks for the floppy hats and palazzo pants she sees in magazines and has little patience for the girls who have babies by different men.
"It's not slip-ups all the time, you know," she said.
She has bigger plans for herself. "I'm not going to be another sister out here struggling," she said, "knocked up with two or three babies, on aid and the father's out there with somebody else. You're sitting on the porch and he's out in the street somewhere. He's just sucking up oxygen."
 
Trying for Grambling
 Monika has turned vanity into a motivational tool. "I'm pretty much into myself," she said. She is the second oldest of six children and lives with her mother, who is on welfare. Her father is disabled and lives in Louisiana.
To reach her goal to be either a broadcast personality or chairwoman of her own company, she has to go to college. So, in her shopping bag are the letters and forms from Grambling State University in Louisiana, where she plans to be next fall.
One letter last week brought bad news. She would not receive the financial aid she needed. Grambling said she missed a financial aid deadline and would have to come up with $3,500 her family does not have.
All of this happened before the most important day of her life -- that of the prom. The whole thing cost her $697.41, including her dress, shoes, gloves, the prom ticket and a garter she got for 50 percent off because the sales clerk was flirting with her.
Thursday, the day before the prom, she had her hair styled into pin curls that made her look like Josephine Baker and slept on her right side, careful not to toss and turn too much. She had to look perfect because she was certain to be prom queen. She said she hoped she would get roses. She likes roses.
Omar was king, to no one's surprise. Monika braced for the sound of her name. But a girl named Jessica Silas, who wears glasses and said she did not think she had a chance, got the tiara and roses Monika wanted. She was near tears but tried to make the best of it. She remembered the good news she got that morning. Grambling extended the financial aid deadline. She would be going to college after all, and she said maybe she could become Miss Grambling.

HEADLINE: A Wary Congress Retreats From Bank-Rate Legislation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
When the most populist panel of the House Banking Committee -- the subcommittee on consumer credit -- met on Thursday, the most remarkable development lay in what was not said.
Democrats criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, and assailed commercial banks for passing along the increase to borrowers, but not to depositors. But nobody suggested that solutions lay in legislation. 
 The general cautious tone reflected the extent to which Congressional Democrats, like Clinton Administration officials, have become wary of upsetting financial markets and regulating interest rates.
The subcommittee has the most liberal Democrats on the already liberal House Banking Committee. This year, the panel has fought to slow the expansion of big commercial banks into other states. It has also tried to force credit report companies to correct errors quickly and to make copies of credit reports free to consumers. But when it comes to proposing legislation on interest rates, the subcommittee has sat on the sidelines.
While enthusiasm for financial regulation has been eroding on Capitol Hill for years, the watershed seems to have been an unsuccessful effort two and a half years ago by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, to impose a 14 percent limit on credit card interest rates. Senate approval of the idea contributed to a 120.31-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Nov. 15, 1991; the idea quickly died in a House-Senate conference.
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the consumer credit subcommittee and ran the panel hearing, cited that experience as having discouraged any new legislative proposals on interest rates this year. "It's very difficult, as I have found out over the years, to legislate anything to do with interest rates," he said after the hearing.
Representative Stephen L. Neal, a North Carolina Democrat and 20-year veteran of the Banking Committee, said the wariness at Thursday's hearing was an example of a worldwide loss of faith in the ability of government to run financial markets. "Look around the world," he said. "People are electing governments that don't do such things -- these ideas are just generally discredited and are thought not to work."
Even if members of Congress were inclined to introduce legislation, nobody knows what it should say, said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat on the consumer credit panel.
"People are trying to come up with something that will be effective, but that something has not yet materialized," he said. "I don't think anybody has any solutions at the moment."
 
Following the Fed
 Banks have raised rates for many loans in step this spring with the Federal Reserve's four increases in short-term interest rates, totaling 1.25 percentage points, and the accompanying sharp rise in long-term interest rates for bonds. Rates on highly competitive loans, like those for autos, remain low, but others, like mortgages and small-business loans, are on the rise.
At the same time, rates for checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit have risen much more slowly.
Testifying on Thursday, Lawrence B. Lindsey, one of the five sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board, cited a study by the Consumer Federation of America that indicated banks were raising their loan rates faster than their deposit rates and keeping the difference. The study was made public last month.
"The evidence shows that rates on NOW accounts, savings deposits and money market deposits have been very sticky," he said. "They have been especially slow to respond to upward movements in market interest rates, although they have also been sluggish in the downward direction."
But Mr. Lindsey also said that no legislative action was needed concerning the widening spread between the rates. "The key here is for consumers to shop around," he said.
Politicians and financial industry analysts cited other reasons why interest rate legislation is unlikely this year. The rates remain relatively low by recent standards, so any limits would be set at levels that would seem cheap by the standards for most of the 1980's. President Clinton has said little about rising rates, making it harder for Congressional Democrats to move on their own. Also, Congress will be in session only a few weeks in the five months left before the November elections, with health care legislation tying up the House and Senate for much of that time.
The high cost of the savings and loan bailout may also have made Congress more reluctant to limit profits that strengthen the capital bases of banks. "The populists just finished paying for the savings and loan bailout," Karen D. Shaw, president of the Institute for Strategy Development, a bank consulting company, said. "They really understand that the deposit insurance funds make up the losses."
To be sure, members of Congress have not renounced all interest in regulating banks. Considerable enthusiasm exists on the committee for strengthening laws aimed at forcing banks to lend money in poor neighborhoods, for example.
Asked after Thursday's hearing whether his views on banks were softening, Mr. Kennedy replied, "Where I come from, you do particularly well taking on the banks."
But Mr. Neal seemed to express the general sentiment in Congress when he said, in an interview on Friday, "There have been times when these ideas have been much stronger -- of the Government setting rates and doing other things that people don't think are a good idea now."

HEADLINE: China Tells Why It Opposes Korea Sanctions

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to the New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 12

 BODY:
China said today that it still believed that United Nations sanctions against North Korea would be "ineffective" and warned against using "violence" in trying to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program, a Japanese spokesman said after a meeting between the Chinese and Japanese Foreign Ministers.
At the same time, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, told his Japanese counterpart that Beijing would play a "positive" and "constructive" role in the coming Security Council debate over punitive measures aimed at forcing North Korea to give up its nuclear program, the spokesman said. 
 The Japanese Foreign Minister, Koji Kakizawa, reportedly did not press Chinese officials in two and a half hours of talks on whether Beijing would use its veto to block a resolution on sanctions in the Security Council.
"We did not come here expecting a detailed discussion with China on what measures are to be taken at the United Nations," the spokesman said.
He said one purpose of his trip "was to stress the importance of China's role" as the nation best suited to "transmit the atmosphere of the international community in the best manner" to the Government of President Kim Il Sung.
In its account of the meeting, China said sanctions "could only intensify the contradictions and even lead to results that all parties would not like to see."
The official New China News Agency also reported that Mr. Qian had expressed regret that the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency had voted to end its technical assistance to North Korea in response to North Korea's refusal to allow inspections of nuclear installations.
"We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open dialogue, mitigate contradictions and seek a way of settling the problem step by step," Mr. Qian was quoted as saying.
The visit by Mr. Kakizawa, after an agreement by the United States, Japan and South Korea to press ahead with a graduated set of sanctions in the Security Council, reinforced the image that China was going to remain engaged in the United Nations debate while continuing to express reservations about sanctions.
"The Chinese told us they have been making a variety of contacts," the Japanese spokesman said. "Mr. Qian Qichen told us that applying sanctions to North Korea would be ineffective judging from the fact that it has been already isolated and has little economic contacts with the rest of the world."
The spokesman also referred to China's "behind the curtains" role of carrying on a dialogue with the North Korean Government in Pyongyang. That dialogue came into sharper view last week as President Jiang Zemin was host in Beijing to the chief of staff of North Korea's Army, Choi Kwang. It was the highest-level visit by a North Korean since the nuclear crisis began more than a year ago.
Photographs of President Jiang greeting the North Korean military leader were prominently featured in Chinese newspapers.
"China deems it an unshakable policy to strengthen and develop the blood-bound friendship between the two countries," Mr. Jiang was quoted as saying by the official China Daily.

HEADLINE: A Haiti Invasion Wins Hemisphere Support

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
A majority of Western Hemisphere countries have quietly told United States officials that they are prepared to support military intervention in Haiti if sanctions fail to oust its military rulers, senior Administration officials say.
Although the leaders of several countries have publicly attacked the idea of intervention, United States diplomats have received quite a different message in private meetings over the last two weeks with officials from about 30 Caribbean and Latin American countries: most support intervention, although often with strings attached. 
 "A majority are willing to consider intervention if all else fails," a senior Administration official said. "There are some countries that are prepared to join a multilateral intervention force if sanctions don't bring these folks down."
The renewed emphasis on sanctions by the Administration, and its playing down of immediate intervention, are meant in part to show that Washington is intent on exhausting all diplomatic and economic means in hopes of lining up as much support as possible before any military action.
"This ratcheting up of the pressure is part of an effort to bring people along with you toward stronger measures," a senior Administration official said.
According to United States diplomats, several nations that just a few months ago attacked calls for intervention have warmed to the idea because the repression in Haiti has grown worse and Haiti's military leaders have shown only contempt for international pressures.
"A lot of countries are increasingly concerned about the implication of the coup leaders' being successful and how that might encourage coups elsewhere," a senior Administration official said. "They're wondering what does this mean for democracy in the hemisphere."
At a meeting of the Organization of American States in Brazil last week, foreign ministers from several countries made it clear to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, that they would support intervention now.
Others nations backed intervention but first wanted to try tougher sanctions for several months. Several others indicated that they would support an invasion, but only after receiving a mandate from the United Nations or the Organization of American States. Several said they were strongly opposed. More nations say they would back intervention than would contribute troops to an invading force.
In Congressional testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Gray said the Caribbean nations were the biggest supporters of force. Comparing the hemisphere to a large neighborhood, he suggested that Haiti was a burning house and that those who lived nearby, who see the repression up close and are being swamped by Haitian refugees, are the most eager for intervention.
Barbados, the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago have all strongly backed intervention, while officials from Jamaica say they will support it only if the United Nations or the Organization of American States first gives the green light.
"Those whose house is adjoined, next to Haiti, are very concerned and don't want to debate how many buckets of water will be thrown on the fire per minute," Mr. Gray said. "Those who are across the street have a different point of view."
Several officials at the Brazil meeting said Venezuela and Argentina also supported intervention. On the other hand, several of the hemisphere's heavyweights, most notably Mexico and Brazil, remain strongly opposed. That is why United States officials acknowledge that it might be harder to win approval for intervention from the 34-member Organization of American States, which works by consensus, than from the United Nations Security Council.
With the international community fed up with the intransigent and repressive Haitian regime, which ousted the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President in September 1991, United States officials voice confidence that they can persuade the Security Council's 14 other members to approve intervention.
In the view of Administration officials, some Latin American officials have denounced intervention mainly to play to their domestic audience. In a hemisphere where the image of Yanqui imperialism still lingers, many people have unhappy memories of Washington's sending in the Marines in the past to install leaders to its liking. But Administration officials say that if there is intervention, most of these Latin American officials will either keep silent or announce grudging support.
 
'Sense of Some Urgency'
 The Clinton Administration has often said it will not wait indefinitely for sanctions to work. Mr. Talbott and Mr. Gray refuse to give any deadline for sanctions, although they say the Administration will assess day to day how well the embargo is working.
"We do feel a sense of some urgency here, for the very simple reason that people are dying," Mr. Talbott told reporters last week.
According to ABC News, Dante Caputo of Argentina, the United Nations special envoy on Haiti, sent a memorandum to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali saying Mr. Talbott had told him that Washington was considering a July 31 deadline for intervention. In an interview this weekend, Mr. Talbott denied that he had said any such thing or that there was any deadline. In addition, Mr. Caputo issued a statement denying that there was a deadline.
Some countries have eagerly and publicly backed President Clinton's suggestion that force should not be ruled out. At the Organization of American States meeting in Brazil, Peter Laurie, the Foreign Minister of Barbados, said his Government "will support whatever measures are necessary, including a lawful multilateral armed intervention."
Echoing the views of his own Government, Mr. Caputo, a former Argentine Foreign Minister, delivered an equally tough message. "There is still room for a final diplomatic and political effort," he said, "but the message has got to be, 'This is your last opportunity.' "
Describing the results of recent talks about the crisis over Haiti, a senior Administration official said: "Some nations want the force to be multilateral. Some first want a mandate from the U.N. All want to make every diplomatic effort. They say, 'If you do all possible sanctions and it doesn't work, you either have to walk away or take stronger action,' and they don't want to walk away."
 
Sanctions Are Tightened
 Administration officials say they have not approached other nations to contribute troops to a multi-nation invasion force. They have, however, asked other nations to contribute soldiers and civilians to a United Nations task force of more than 3,000 to retrain Haiti's military and police and maintain order if the military cedes power.
On Friday, President Clinton tightened sanctions by barring commercial flights and financial transactions between Haiti and the United States, three weeks after the United Nations stepped up the embargo to exempt only food and medicine.
United States officials say their preferred solution is for the United States Ambassador in Haiti to receive a phone call soon from Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the head of the army, Col. Joseph Michel Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief, and Gen. Philipe Biamby, the army Chief of Staff, saying they are ready to cede power and flee to another country.

HEADLINE: Lillehammer Journal;
Snug Future Sought in the Snows of Yesteryear

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LILLEHAMMER, Norway

 BODY:
The only snow is on the highest mountain plateaus, far above the pitched roofs and pastel houses of Lillehammer, the site of the 1994 Winter Olympics. But all through the town and the greening countryside, the glow of the Games still lingers like the long northern twilight.
At City Hall, clerks have been keeping the world's love letters to Lillehammer on public display, neatly arranged in loose-leaf binders. A note from Charlotte, N.C., asks for an autographed picture of Audun Tron, the town's Mayor. A letter from a Minnesota woman says she is determined to visit Norway. 
 "What a great host country," she wrote. "You cheer for everyone!"
By nearly any measure, the Games were a boon to Lillehammer. Not only did the town win rave reviews for its cheerful and seamless handling of the Olympics, but it has also inherited, debt free, millions of dollars worth of new roads, sewers and sports arenas, which were built for the Games by the Norwegian Government.
Still, for all the good vibrations and shiny new installations, the more enduring challenge facing Lillehammer's civic boosters still lies ahead: what does this dozy sub-Arctic town of just 23,000 people do now to keep the tourists coming to this remote corner of Norway?
"The rest of 1994 and 1995 should be very good, but we need to think beyond that," said Steinar Soerlie, the city manager. "We must convert what we accomplished during the Games into real commercial possibilities."
For now, Lillehammer is getting back to normal. On the edge of town, convoys of flatbed trucks are still hauling away the hundreds of modular buildings erected as temporary housing for the Games.
There have been a few sour notes. In May, for example, a handful of business people filed for bankruptcy after their investments in land deals and tourist camps tied to the Olympics did not work out.
Like other Olympic hopefuls, Lillehammer embarked on its quest to land the Games nearly a decade ago because it saw them as a way to spur the economy of Norway's sleepy central mountain region, a scenic but remote area fewer than 400 miles south of the Arctic Circle.
"The preparation and the Games themselves have jumped this city forward 30 or 40 years in just one decade," said Petter Ronnigen, a local banker who was the deputy director of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee.
Almost overnight, the town acquired a new community college campus, built around what used to be the Olympic press center. Its telecommunications grid is the most sophisticated in Norway. And the area has some 14,500 hotel beds, 75 percent more than just five years ago.
Lillehammer, along with the nearby towns of Hamar and Gjovik, is now home to four world-class indoor sports arenas, which can seat more than 33,000.
Olav R. Spilling, a research fellow with the Eastern Norway Research Institute, said one of the biggest problems would be sustaining the kind of tourism to keep Lillehammer's new hotels and arenas in the black.
According to a study supervised by Mr. Spilling, the main Olympic installations, because of operating costs, will lose money for the foreseeable future. Hakon Hall, for example, the 10,000-seat arena used for ice hockey during the Games, has just one public event on its schedule: the Norwegian national scholastic table tennis tournament.
Still, Lillehammer has been spared the financial burdens that have crippled other Olympic towns. For one thing, Lillehammer and other towns in the region that played host to Olympic events will be able to dip into a special $62 million Olympics fund -- twice as large as projected because of the success of the Games -- to help cover the cost of operating the new sports arenas.
Over the next year, tourism revenues should be strong. Two big conventions, including a Baptist conference, have already booked into Lillehammer. The city is planning a winter cultural festival for next February, and a full schedule of skiing, bobsledding and skating competitions is booked for the coming winter.
The ski jumps have a special porcelain finish so they can be used by competitors and instructors year-round. The town plans to buy wheeled carts that visitors will pay to steer, slalom-style, down the steep face of the hill used for free-style skiing.
North of town, on the bobsled and luge course, tourists are already paying the equivalent of $14 apiece to ride wheeled bobsleds down the winding course. Strapped into helmets, they crouch three at a time behind a Norwegian driver as he steers down the steep valley at nearly 65 miles an hour.
"It rained all day yesterday, and we still had 50 people who wanted to go down the mountain," said a smiling Berndt Harjo, who helps guide the tourists into the bobsleds for the two-minute dizzying ride. "They saw Norway on television, and don't want to miss a thing."
Mr. Soerlie, the city manager, is upbeat about the future. "For five years, it is all you plan for, and then all of a sudden the Olympics are over," he said. Are people depressed? "No," he said. "For the man in the street, for me, I think the Olympics were like a good dessert. We had it, and it is a very nice memory."

HEADLINE: President Would Not Limit Welfare Plan's Public Jobs

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
President Clinton has resolved a central question about his welfare plan by deciding to let recipients placed in government work programs remain there indefinitely, as long as they are genuinely seeking private jobs, officials said.
The decision places the Administration at odds with Congressional proposals sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans. Those plans would let states end all assistance, both cash payments and subsidized jobs, to welfare recipients whether they could find private work or not. 
 "People who play by the rules can keep working," Bruce Reed, a White House aide, said today in a telephone interview. But he added, "One of the rules is that if there are jobs available, you have to go out and get one."
Mr. Clinton's decision ends months of sharp debate among his aides over an issue that cuts to the welfare program's philosophical core. The aides asked Mr. Clinton to resolve the issue last month, sending him a memorandum warning that "this issue is a crucial one for the left."
Mr. Clinton's aides say that in offering extended eligibility for work programs, the President is trying to protect people who simply cannot find private jobs, despite their best efforts. The memorandum warned that denying such people cash and subsidized work could force children into "homelessness or foster care."
 
Criticism is Likely
 Congressional critics might argue that indefinite eligibility would lead to a large and costly work program that would violate Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it." The memorandum, while not advocating a position, warned Mr. Clinton to expect such a charge.
It said that even some Democratic allies might say "the rhetoric of 'ending welfare' requires some sort of ultimate end" and that he might be accused of creating "a large guaranteed-for-life job creation program."
Mr. Clinton is expected to announce his welfare plan as early as Tuesday. His plan would expand the amount of training available to welfare recipients during their first two years of aid but would require those still on the rolls to join the work program.
Mr. Clinton's welfare pledges were a crucial aspect of his claim during the 1992 campaign to be a "New Democrat." But he has slowed the welfare bill to keep it from conflicting with his health care proposal, which must travel through the same Congressional committees. With time running out, few people expect the welfare bill to pass this year.
Unlike Mr. Clinton's bill, a proposal by 163 House Republicans would let states drop poor people from a work program after they had been in it for three years. A bill co-sponsored by 29 Democrats would go further, requiring the cutoff for participants but letting states re-admit 10 percent of those dropped.
It is unclear how many of the five million families on welfare would be unable to move to support from private employment. Administration officials have argued that the number will be very small, but estimates from outside economists have ranged from 300,000 to 800,000 families.
In today's interview, Mr. Reed said Mr. Clinton was keeping his pledge to end welfare "by requiring people to go to work."
Mr. Reed took pains to argue that the Administration's plan would avoid a large Government jobs program by continuously pushing people into the private sector.
Recipients would be required to search for private jobs before they would be placed in the work program, he said, and the subsidized positions would last only one year. Participants would then have to go through another period of searching for a private job before they could re-enroll in the work program.
Those who turned down a private job offer without a good reason would be dropped from the rolls for six months, receiving neither cash nor a subsidized job. That penalty would be much stiffer than the ones in current law, which reduce, but do not eliminate, the grants to welfare recipients who break rules.
The President's plan would also give people an economic incentive to find private work, Mr. Reed said. People with private jobs could receive up to $3,300 a year in refundable tax credits, which they could not get while working in the Government program at the minimum wage.
If recipients received two work assignments without finding private employment, states would be able to enroll them in an "intensive job-search program," Mr. Reed said. That would require poor people to demonstrate that they were going to interviews and making efforts to find private work.
Mr. Reed said that those who were not making a good-faith effort would then lose assistance for six months. After that time, they could re-apply to the work program.
Advocates for the poor had lobbied hard for extended work-program eligibility, and they praised Mr. Clinton's decision.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
It's Still the Economy, but It's Not Helping Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The good news for Bill Clinton is that the economy, the issue that defined his Presidential campaign, is bouncing back. The bad news is that it is not doing him much good.
While Americans give the President reasonably good marks for his handling of pocketbook issues, and increasingly believe that the national economy is improving, there has been no corresponding increase in their enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton himself. 
 "Clinton is not getting the mileage and bounce out of the basic state of the economy," said Fred Greenstein, an authority on the Presidency at Princeton University. "And the fact that he's not getting credit reduces his political clout."
Throughout most of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton's approval ratings in opinion polls have stagnated, at about 50 percent or less, even though the proportion of people who rate the national economy as performing relatively well has risen substantially, to roughly 50 percent from about 30 percent in early 1993.
The inability of Mr. Clinton to ride the economy's coattails is confounding his political advisers. Even if the economy grows stronger in the coming months, the advisers fear that Democrats who face re-election in November may not benefit as they should -- and Mr. Clinton may not be in a position to help them.
But their trepidation is more about 1996. If the economy is soaring, or even coasting comfortably, in the spring and summer of 1996, Mr. Clinton wants to reap the rewards, as have past Presidents. Many experts on President Richard M. Nixon contend, for example, that despite his momentous trip to China and other accomplishments, a turnabout in the economy did as much to assure his re-election in 1972. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan also benefited from a sharp recovery.
Though it is still early, some Presidential advisers worry that Mr. Clinton's failure to gain popularity in recent months may be a sign that he would need an even healthier economy than past Presidents if he is to be re-elected.
 
A Curse of Incumbency
 As evidence of their nervousness, White House aides are already seeking advice from academics on the "political business cycle" -- theories that there is a close connection between the economy and electoral prospects.
In his new book, "The Agenda" (Simon & Schuster), Bob Woodward depicts a White House that is obsessed with the ups and downs in the bond market. The President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, found himself with the unexpected duties of tracking the bond market "like some Wall Street wizard," according to the book.
But for all their concerns that Mr. Clinton is not getting the proper credit, his advisers neglect one curse of incumbency: bad times damage the President and his party more than good times help them.
Were the economy in a slump, the President would surely be in far worse political shape than he is today.
"If this was a bad economy, I think we'd see Clinton's popularity ratings in the 30's," said Allan J. Lichtman, a professor of history at the American University. "Should the economy turn downward, the President would have far greater difficulty than he's experiencing at the present time."
Mr. Clinton and his advisers know only too well the power of the economy as a political issue. They exploited it relentlessly to defeat President George Bush in 1992, and they view it as a ticket to re-election.
But the strong economy has, in effect, given the public time to worry more about other issues, like crime.
Asked to explain why the economic news has not helped Mr. Clinton more, David Wilhelm, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, shakes his head and offers one word: "Whitewater." He said that inquiry into the Clintons' real-estate investments and other problems -- while not in themselves major public concerns -- have distracted attention from Mr. Clinton's accomplishments.
His counterpart in the Republican Party, Haley Barbour, puts forth another theory. People, he said, "don't think the economy is improving because of what Clinton's done but despite what Clinton's done."
Both men are right -- to a point. The emergence of voter concerns about Mr. Clinton's character and his floundering in foreign policy make it even more difficult for the Administration to focus attention on positive economic news.
And some analysts do argue that people are so uncomfortable with Mr. Clinton that they are hesitant to attribute any economic successes to him. For a President who drew only 43 percent of the popular vote, this could be lethal.
Moreover, many Americans remain untouched by the overall economic improvements. Higher productivity statistics, for instance, have not translated into higher wages for everyone.
A nationwide poll by the Gallup organization for CNN and USA Today, conducted May 20-22, found that 56 percent of Americans believed that Mr. Clinton's economic policies were not having much effect on the economy, 16 percent said they were hurting the economy, and 24 percent said they were helping the economy. The survey of 1,005 adults nationwide had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
"Typically, this kind of brightening economy would have had more of an impact on the average American than it has had so far," said Mr. Lichtman, who has examined the links between Presidents and the economy. "The fact that Clinton is not getting as popular as you might expect a President to be in his kind of economy is due to his other problems -- and to the fact that people are still cautious about the economy."
Paul Begala, a Clinton political adviser, said: "There is something deeply ironic about Clintonomics that I don't think anyone has noticed. The benefits from Reaganomics flowed directly from the Government. The benefits of Clintonomics flow from the private sector. I refinanced my house, but I didn't go to a Government agency to do that."
Missing from the debate is the notion advanced by some economists that as Presidents come and go, they often find that controlling the economy is beyond their reach.
In what has been their refrain for months, Mr. Begala and other Presidential advisers said that Mr. Clinton and the Democrats needed to communicate the economic gains better, particularly before this year's midterm elections.
"Here we've got three million new jobs, we've cut the deficit, but I don't think we talk about it enough," Mr. Wilhelm said. "If we can't go out and make the case, well, shame on us."

HEADLINE: In Latin America, a Free Trade Rush

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12

 BODY:
Creating a huge building block for a Western Hemisphere free trade zone, the presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela will meet in Colombia on Monday to place their nations' 150 million people under a duty-free umbrella.
"This is our step into the big leagues," Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia's Minister of Foreign Trade proclaimed in a recent interview in Bogota. "This is a step toward the U.S. market." 
 Many South American business people complain that the Clinton Administration has been slow to expand the North American Free Trade Association, which links Canada, the United States and Mexico. They hope this new trade group, whose three nations have a total of $400 billion in economic activity, will provide momentum for the eventual creation of a Latin American free trade zone stretching from Mexico to Argentina.
Even as the ink dries on the accord, Ecuador will ask to join, and it is likely to be accepted.
For exporters in the United States, the Latin excitement over free trade is good news.
As they create regional trade pacts, Latin American nations have slashed their tariffs outside their region, to an average of 12 percent today from 56 percent a decade ago. As a result, United States exports to Latin America have doubled in the last seven years, reaching $80 billion last year.
"American exports to Colombia have gone up 80 percent" since Colombia opened its borders three years ago, a United States diplomat said. "During the same time, Colombia's exports to the United States have gone up 7 percent."
Further fueling demand for United States goods -- from Jeep Grand Cherokees to jars of peanut butter -- Latin America's economy is expected to grow by 3 percent this year. This expansion is taking place despite political uncertainty surrounding presidential elections later this year in the region's two most populous nations, Brazil and Mexico.
Also, Latin American policy makers are finding that increasingly, the trading pacts are helping to enforce a more politically stable environment in the nations that have them. The pacts, which are predicated on orthodox free market rules -- free exchange rates, free prices, and free access to investment -- are smoothing the policy zigzags that have plagued Latin nations for decades.
"We are discovering that free trade agreements are not just about free trade," said Moises Naim, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment and former Venezuelan Minister of Industry. "Trade agreements lower the risk of sudden policy changes. It now takes more than a stroke of a pen by a new government to undo what a preceding government has done."
Trade among Latin America's 11 largest economies has increased by 50 percent since 1991, reaching $23.5 billion last year.
In a trade revolution with subtle political consequences, country after country in Latin America is discovering that, after the United States, its most important trading partners are its neighbors.
Trade between Colombia and Venezuela, for example, more than doubled after a customs union took effect in 1992, dropping tariffs to zero.
 
A Trip to Caracas
 Reflecting a new political integration between two countries that nearly went to war in 1987, Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, and his entire Cabinet flew to Caracas last month for two days of talks with Venezuela's President, Rafael Caldera, and his Cabinet.
On Colombia's southern border, another free trade pact led to a near-doubling of trade between Colombia and Ecuador last year.
Brazil's trade with Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay has more than tripled since the four countries formed an embryo common market, Mercosul, in 1991.
Throughout Latin America, companies increasingly plan investments in regional terms. Citroen said recently it would set up operations in Uruguay to assemble cars for the Mercosul market. The Eastman Kodak Company has set up a tariff-free shipping depot outside Sao Paulo to distribute $80 million of film and cameras throughout Mercosul.
"For us, Colombia is like another part of our domestic market," said Pedro Vallenilla, president of Venepal, a Venezuelan paper manufacturer. "When we sell to Colombia, we don't even feel as if we are exporting. We are the same market."
With intra-Latin trade the fastest growing trade relationship in the region, new steps are taken daily to abolish centuries-old barriers. By the end of the 1990's, economists predict, most trade within Latin America will be duty-free.
Last week, Chile became the first nation to respond to a Brazilian proposal to expand Mercosul into a continental free trade zone.
"Our project is to establish a South American Free Trade Area that would unite, in a common market, the countries that make up Mercosul, the Andean Group, the Amazon Initiative, and, finally, Chile," President Itamar Franco of Brazil proposed last week at a regional meeting of Latin foreign ministers.
 
Expanded Customs Union
 In response, Chile proposed joining a duty-free customs union with Mercosul nations on Jan. 1. Chile would retain the right to set its own external tariffs. Next year, Brazil hopes to expand this kind of customs union across South America, signing Mercosul free trade agreements with the seven other nations of South America.
In a major step toward regional integration, the five nations of the Andean Pact -- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela -- agreed last month to create the Andean Free Trade Zone on Jan. 1, with duty-free trade.
Mexico, whose trade with other Latin American nations has doubled in the last five years, has also started looking south. Today's agreement with Colombia and Venezuela comes as trade between Mexico and Venezuela has tripled since 1989.
Last April, Mexico signed a free trade treaty with Costa Rica. Next month, Mexico is to start negotiating a treaty with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
As the momentum for free trade builds, leftist opposition has largely shriveled. Last month, for example, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a socialist and a front-runner in Brazil's presidential race, endorsed Mercosul. In Colombia, Ernesto Samper Pizano, the center-left candidate in presidential elections set for Sunday, said recently: "The opening is an irreversible fact. I would like to see Colombia enter Nafta."
Indeed, in the region, Colombia has emerged as the most energetic proponent of free trade. Three years ago, when President Gaviria created a Foreign Trade Ministry, Colombia had no free trade pacts. By August, when Mr. Gaviria's term expires, he expects to have signed such pacts with 22 nations.
On Friday, Colombia and the 13 nations that are members of the Caribbean Community agreed to sign a free trade treaty.
"No other Latin American country has duty-free access to so many countries," Mr. Santos, Colombia's Trade Minister, said. "We slashed tariffs in a planned, deliberate strategy to make our economy more competitive."
Reflecting a new emphasis on trade in United States-Colombia relations, Myles R. Frechette, a career diplomat with trade promotion experience, is to arrive here in July to serve as the United States Ambassador to Colombia. He succeeds Morris D. Busby, a career diplomat with experience in counterterrorism.
In August, Mr. Gaviria is to become Secretary General of the Organization of American States, a post the Colombian plans to use as a pulpit for reinvigorating the vision of a hemispheric free trade region stretching from Alaska to Argentina promoted by President George Bush.
But many Latin leaders sense that United States interest has cooled in expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement. That view has some proponents in the United States, as well.
"The Administration has to send a message that we want a free trade agreement with Chile," Jerry Haar, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's North-South Center, said. "If nothing is done, it sends a really bad sign to Latin America about our belief in free trade."
In Washington, White House attention is concentrated on winning Congressional approval by August for the complex trade agreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world organization that oversees trade.
"The Clinton Administration favors the extension of free trade throughout the hemisphere," Jeffrey E. Garten, the United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said last week. "It's important that regional agreements create more trade and do not create pacts that are inward-looking and that create more barriers."
To demonstrate United States interest in South America's markets, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown is to conduct a one-week trip through Argentina, Brazil and Chile at the end of June. Though the United States has traditionally accounted for half of Latin America's foreign trade, Mr. Brown may find interlopers poaching on what American exporters have long considered their turf.
Encouraged by a 33 percent jump in European exports to Latin America in the last two years, European Union officials traveled to Sao Paulo a few weeks ago to conduct preliminary talks about granting preferential tariff treatment to Mercosur.
In the last three months, Colombia joined two Pacific Basin councils, and Ecuador's President, Sixto Duran Ballen, led a 180-member business mission to Japan.
"This is a fundamental step in our policy of diversifying away from the Paris-London-New York axis and bringing ourselves closer to the world's most dynamic region," Mr. Santos of Colombia said last month after his country joined the Pacific Basin Economic Council, a business group. "Colombia's Atlantic trade is 15 times its Pacific trade."

LUBAVITCH GRAND RABBI DIES
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, whose charismatic leadership built the Lubavitch Hasidic movement into an enormously powerful and sometimes divisive force among the world's Jews, died at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness. He was 92. Within hours of his death, thousands of his followers began gathering on the streets around Lubavitch World Headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to mourn a teacher and scholar that most of them had hoped would reveal himself to be the Messiah before he died. Many took hastily arranged charter flights from Israel, Europe and elsewhere around the world. A1. 
 Rabbi Schneerson was a Russian-born, Sorbonne-educated scholar who took an insular Hasidic group that almost ended in the Holocaust and turned it into one of the most influential and controversial forces in world Jewry. B2.

A MOTHER DIES SAVING HER SON
As a livery cab driven by a drunken motorist sped toward them, a homeless woman walking across a Queens street pushed her 4-year-old son out of the way, only to be struck herself by the car, the police said. The woman, Castelli Ellison, 38, whom the police said had lived at a shelter for homeless families near Kennedy International Airport, died later of internal injuries at Mary Immaculate Hospital. When the police arrived, they found her son, Germar Ellison, weeping over his mother's mangled body. B3.

Public Advocate Mark J.

FOUNDATION TAKES ON A CORPORATION
They are curiously matched adversaries. One is Intel Corporation, which is building the world's largest computer-chip plant, at Rio Rancho, N.M. The other is the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, a small family philanthropy based in Manhattan, which owns 3,000 share of Intel stock and is challenging Intel's projections of the benefits the plant will bring. In doing so, the foundation is pioneering an aggressive approach by foundations to corporate policies. B3.

NO MOVES TO INTERVENE IN RAIL TALKS
Even though there has been little progress in talks to avert a strike by Long Island Rail Road workers, lawmakers said they would hesitate to intervene before any walkout for fear of upsetting the negotiations.

TRACK PLAN DRAWS OPPOSITION
Railroad tracks already cut through the leafy, affluent community of Bronxville, in Westchester County, and many residents depend on the trains to get to work in Manhattan every day. But a plan to add a third track to the Harlem line of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad here has upset residents, who see it as a threat to the beauty of the village and the the serenity of their homes.

HEADLINE: Italy's Fashion Industry Turned on Its Head, Again

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, June 8

 BODY:
Italy's fanciful designers and apparel makers, the Medicis and the Borgias of contemporary taste, are approaching the fashion business as if almost everything they did right in the 1980's has to be done differently today.
"There's an epochal change going on now, and the climate of the 90's is making people reflect," said Santo Versace, the 49-year-old chief financial officer of Gianni Versace S.R.L. "After 15 years of continuous growth, they're no longer leaping like grasshoppers, but crawling cautiously like ants." 
 In the 1980's, designer labels with names like Armani, Versace and Valentino were often enough to sell their fashions at any price, most often to the affluent nations of Western Europe and the United States. Designer-driven trends fueled the market for clothing made in Italy, and big buyers came twice yearly to the ready-to-wear shows of the principal designers.
 
Expectations Are Higher
 Now the markets are spread farther afield to Japan, India, Russia and China. And customers everywhere are expecting to find quality clothing at competitive prices.
Although Italy's textile business has been around for hundreds of years, its designer fashion and apparel industry is a relative newcomer.
With the exception of a few large groups like GFT, Ermenegildo Zegna, and Marzotto, the industry consists of thousands of small companies, often just tailors and seamstresses, grouped in pyramid fashion beneath the large manufacturers, which turn to the smaller companies as needed, thus reducing costs and providing flexibility.
In the 1960's and 1970's, labels based in Paris like those of Emanuel Ungaro or Christian Dior drifted to Italian clothing manufacturers. Italian labor costs were low, and the industry boasted pockets of quality manufacturing like the silk makers clustered around Como or the wool manufacturers of Biella, in Piedmont.
With the industry's growth, local talent emerged, like Gianni Versace, who learned to design clothes by watching his mother, Franca, at work in her seamstress shop in his native Reggio Calabria. Some designers like Mr. Versace, Giorgio Armani and Laura Biagiotti, became industrialists.
And during the 1980's, they and Gianfranco Ferre and Romeo Gigli became the arbiters of international elegance. Their spectacular designs, and equally spectacular personalities, challenged French dominance, and set Milan, with its semiannual fashion displays and elegant showrooms, alongside Paris and New York as meccas of design.
 
Paying Italy's Bills

Their success also made the apparel industry a pillar of Italy's export economy. Last year, the textile and apparel industry had a trade surplus of $18 billion, roughly equal to the country's deficit in food and energy sources like oil.
"You can see, we're paying Italy's food and energy bill," said Vittorio Giulini, 53, owner of Liola, a prominent knitwear manufacturer, and president of Milan's clothing fair association.
After so many profitable years, the Italian fashion industry has found that defining itself has become more complicated than it used to be. Executives like Santo Versace, the bookkeeping brain behind Gianni Versace's creative genius, can talk easily about opening a store this year in Moscow or looking hard at potential new markets in South Korea and Indonesia, expanding new products like jeans, or providing fresh products year-round instead of just for the seasonal trade fairs in late September and February.
"As long as I've known the industry, it's been in a state of permanent change," Mr. Versace said. "Every six years or so it reinvents itself with extraordinary speed, to preserve what is after all a very mature industry."
 
A Year of Setbacks
 If there were doubts about the health of the Italian fashion industry, they arose last year when several large participants stumbled badly.
The first was Benetton, the clothing group that in the 1980's became a household word like McDonald's. Though Benetton remains profitable, the company found its products were too expensive to compete against cheaper competitors in the United States. Benetton has 150 stores in the United States, down from 800 in 1988.
Then Mr. Armani suffered a setback. After reporting a substantial loss, Simint S.p.A., a designer clothing group controlled by the Armani family, announced recently that it had sold Armani A/X, its American retail chain, to a retailer in Singapore for $13 million to raise cash as part of reorganization.
The worst trouble hit Gruppo Finanziario Tessile S.p.A., known as GFT, which is based in Turin and run by the innovative Rivetti family. The company almost single-handedly brought the craze for Italian designer fashions to the United States, where its sales grew to $304 million in 1989, from $7 million in 1980, with licensed designer names like Armani and Valentino.
By 1993, the growth had stopped and GFT was saddled with $250 million of debt. Creditors led by Mediobanca, an investment bank, took over the company, reducing the role of the Rivetti family.
What has provided the industry's resilience has been an essentially family-owned structure in which today more than 68 percent of the workers are employed by companies with fewer than 10 people. Only two sizable companies, Benetton and Simint, are publicly traded. A third, Versace, plans to go public.
Clemente Signoroni, a former finance specialist with Fiat S.p.A. whom the banks installed last year as chief executive of GFT, described how the system worked. "If our designers want lace this year, we go to our lace specialists," he said. "If next year's trend is silk, we go to the silk people."
But with the market saturated with designer fashions, a designer name no longer suffices to sell clothing. "Paradoxically, the very success of designer fashions in the 1980's means that consumers have become more educated and more discerning about fashion," said Robert Howard, a consultant and former editor of the Harvard Business Review who has studied GFT.
Customers still want quality, but at competitive prices. As a result, large-volume Italian manufacturers are following the lead of American companies like Donna Karan that pioneered so-called bridge lines, which are designer labels for less money.
This has transformed the old seasonal cycles into an almost steady flow of styles from the large fashion centers. In Milan, the big semiannual trade fairs now stand alongside the showrooms of designers and manufacturers like Krizia and Moschino that offer new styles at almost any time of the year.
With trade barriers falling, Italian manufacturers are facing cheaper competition from countries like India and China. Alfredo Ciampini, the secretary general of the Confederation of Textile and Apparel Manufacturers, said lower tariffs would open Italy to cheap imports during the next 10 years. He said he was not totally pessimistic as long as developing countries agreed to buy Italian clothing.
"I will import 1,000 cotton shirts from India at a dollar apiece," Mr. Ciampini said, "if I can export one Armani suit for $1,000."
 
Reality Check
 Prominent among those adjusting to the new realities is Carlo Rivetti.
Last year, Mr. Rivetti and his sister, Cristina, sold their stake in GFT, at which their cousin, Marco Rivetti, remains president, and acquired C.P. Company, a subsidiary that specializes in designer sportswear. Last year, he said, C.P. did $50 million in business.
Working out of a refurbished 18th-century palazzo on Milan's Via Bramante, Mr. Rivetti, a vigorous 38-year-old with red hair and a beard, borrowed a concept pioneered by Benetton of taking neutral-hued jackets or sweaters manufactured at low-wage sites in places like Albania and Tunisia, and increasingly in Italy, and using complex dyeing processes to reproduce designer models at an Italian factory.
"You know, you can go to sea in a huge tanker, but to turn a tanker around you need about two and a half kilometers," Mr. Rivetti said, reflecting on the experiences of the last several years. "Now, I prefer a small sailing boat, with just my crew, and the smell of the wind."

HEADLINE: Small Foundation Flexes Its Muscle

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
They are curiously matched adversaries.
One is Intel Corporation, which is building the world's largest computer-chip plant at Rio Rancho, N.M. The other is the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, a small family philanthropy based in Manhattan, which owns 3,000 share of Intel stock. 
 The two came face to face at Intel's annual stockholders' meeting in an encounter that in the foundation world is considered a bold use of financial muscle.
Stephen Viederman, the foundation's president, exercised his rights as a shareholder to question "our company" on its rosy forecasts of benefits from the $1.8 billion plant expansion, which Intel said would create 2,400 manufacturing jobs and bring enormous economic benefits to New Mexico.
A number of major foundations say they are watching the Noyes initiative to see how effective it is.
"We're following it with interest," said Peter C. Goldmark, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. "I've always had grave doubts that passive ownership of stock is an effective lever for change, but maybe Steve can prove otherwise."
 
Raising Tough Questions
 Foundations are minor figures in the investment field: collectively they own only 2.2 percent of all publicly traded stock.
And until now, foundations have protested quietly, if at all. Trying to influence corporations to be more socially responsible, some have divested themselves of stock or joined shareholders' resolutions that take issue with companies on political or social questions.
"The Noyes Foundation's appearance at the Intel stockholders' meeting is the first time a foundation executive ever has taken such a step and raised tough questions with corporate management," said Timothy H. Smith, the director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in Manhattan. "Noyes is on the cutting edge of a new trend."
The 23-year-old Interfaith Center has sponsored thousands of shareholder resolutions, often drawing support from church groups, universities, trade unions, pension funds and, over the years, about 50 of the nation's 35,000 foundations.
The role of visible and vocal campaigner is a new one for Noyes. With $60 million in assets, it ranks 351st in foundation wealth. Noyes has a history of involvement in environmental issues. It has supported traditional agriculture on lands of the Zuni pueblo in New Mexico and worked to protect the Brazilian rain forest.
The foundation was created in 1947 by Charles F. Noyes, a prosperous real-estate broker. (His most famous deal was the 1951 sale of the Empire State Building, considered a white elephant at the time.) The foundation, with headquarters at 16 East 34th Street, was named for his wife, a volunteer who worked to promote racial and religious rights.
The foundation was drawn into the Intel controversy because it is a financial supporter of the Southwest Organizing Project, an advocacy group that has picketed at Intel plants in California and New Mexico.
Before the Intel stockholders' meeting in May, the Organizing Project issued a 60-page report, "Intel Inside New Mexico," describing the company as a modern Trojan horse: a gleaming chrome exterior concealing a chemical factory.
The advocacy group charged that New Mexico's state officials, in their eagerness to attract the giant semiconductor manufacturer to Rio Rancho, had offered excessive inducements, including $250 million in tax breaks, and loosened environmental regulations to permit the company to use 90 chemicals, some never tested.
In an interview, Mr. Viederman called the Intel agreement with the state "an important case study of contemporary smokestack-chasing, with the environment and the community as victims."
At the shareholders' meeting, Craig R. Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer, characterized the Organizing Project as a "small, vocal minority of people." He said Intel was a good corporate citizen, was open about its environmental practices, had reduced chemical use and listed the chemicals it used.
An Intel spokesman, Howard High, said the company refused Mr. Viederman's request that it open talks with the organizing project and charged that leaders of the advocacy group had come to the meeting, some from outside the state, only to stage a protest for television cameras. In a telephone interview, Mr. High said Intel would try to answer the concerns expressed by Mr. Viederman "as we do any shareholder."
Mr. Viederman said the Noyes foundation would continue to exert pressure until it achieved some satisfaction.

HEADLINE: Experts Doubt Tax Cuts Will Create Job Growth

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 10

 BODY:
Although the business tax cuts signed into law last week by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have been promoted as an important stimulus to the state's slowly improving economy, many economists and fiscal analysts are skeptical that the cuts will generate significant job growth.
The experts agree that the tax-cut package sends a strong message that New York State wants to become a better, less costly place to do business -- an important message when dozens of states are cutting taxes. But business executives are unlikely to base decisions about hiring or relocating on such a signal alone, the experts said. And for the vast majority of companies, the cuts will not provide enough savings to justify much hiring. 
 "The talk about these tax cuts leading to jobs is a mantra which is based on religious conviction and not on much hard evidence," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany. "In general, cutting business taxes is a necessary step to improving the business climate. But it is not by any means sufficient to stimulate job growth."
Because the state is only beginning to recover from a jarring recession in which it lost over 500,000 jobs, job creation has become an important campaign theme this year, particularly for Mr. Cuomo, who is facing a strong challenge from Republican State Senator George E. Pataki. Indeed, many of the taxes cut or eliminated this week were imposed in 1989 and 1990, a recessionary period when Mr. Cuomo's fiscal leadership came under sharp criticism.
 
Dealing With a Deficit
 Now, when state spending is increasing at its fastest pace in four years, there are widespread questions about whether the economy will improve sufficiently to pay for the tax cuts, which will reduce state revenues by $1.64 billion when fully implemented at the end of four years.
Even before the cuts were passed, the state was expected to have a structural deficit of $1.4 billion in the fiscal year that will begin on April 1, 1995. Aides to the Governor argued, and legislative leaders agreed, that the tax cuts would not contribute to that deficit because of projected growth in the economy. But they did not settle on how to deal with the anticipated deficit.
If the economy improves only slowly or levels off, the state could face even larger deficits that would almost certainly trigger fights in the Legislature over how to increase revenues: by imposing new taxes, cutting programs or postponing the scheduled cuts.
The state found itself in such straits in 1989 when it postponed scheduled reductions in corporate and personal income taxes because of the recession.
 
False Promises
 "It is, in effect, making false promises," said Frank J. Mauro, a critic of the tax-cut package who is executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a group financed by labor unions. "They won't be able to pay for what they are promising, and the result will be tumultuous budget negotiations again and again."
Aides to Governor Cuomo say they expect the economy to grow fast enough to pay for the cuts. And some business lobbyists predict the cuts will generate tens of thousands of new jobs. But all sides acknowledge that the state could have cut spending more to insure that the cuts remain affordable -- a concern sure to be raised by Wall Street firms that are deciding whether to raise the state's low bond rating.
The $63.4 billion budget, which includes Federal and state funds, is 7 percent larger than last year's budget. Though much of the increase is Mr. Cuomo's doing, the Legislature did its part by adding about $800 million in spending to Mr. Cuomo's original budget.
"The belt wasn't too tight this year," said Edward Reinfurt, vice president of the Business Council of New York State, a major advocate for the tax-cut package.
The package is a potpourri of initiatives mostly aimed at businesses. The single largest cut is a three-year phasing out of a 15 percent surcharge on the corporate income tax that is assessed on about 450,000 companies and brings the state $900 million each year. Other cuts will eliminate the 5 percent state tax on hotel rooms renting for more than $100 a night, reduce a tax on sparkling wines from 95 cents per gallon to 19 cents per gallon and give developers tax exemptions worth over $1 million for new construction begun before 1996.
The lone cut not targeted to businesses is a state tax credit that low-income families can use to reduce their state taxes. At the end of four years, the credit will be worth 20 percent of the value of whatever Federal tax credit the taxpayer takes. Over 1.1 million families are expected to be eligible for the credit, which has been praised by advocates for the poor as a powerful incentive to work.
Upon passage of the budget this week, Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders talked about the importance of the business tax cuts in making the state's tepid economy more competitive with surrounding states. Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the cuts would be particularly effective in spurring growth in the ailing construction, trucking and hotel industries.
But fiscal analysts offered several reasons why the impact of the cuts is likely to be limited. First, the most broad-based reduction, on the corporate surcharge, will save the vast majority of businesses only a few thousand, and in many cases just a few hundred, dollars each year.
"I applaud the direction, but I think this is mostly symbolic," said Michael Brooks, senior municipal credit analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment firm. "This is not going to result in a huge savings for small corporations."
 
New York's High Taxes
 Many experts also say that corporate executives are more concerned about local property taxes and personal income taxes than with corporate income taxes when making decisions about whether to relocate to New York State or expand here. Combined local and state taxes in New York State are the second highest in the nation, behind Alaska.
"Most businesses are not corporations, and they pay taxes on the personal income level," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, a free-market research organization in Washington. "Those are the businesses that are prodigious job creators right now."
Others say the state should be trying to reduce property taxes by forcing municipal governments to consolidate services or by assuming a greater share of local government costs, such as Medicaid, the fastest growing expense of county governments. The Legislature agreed this year to pick up a slightly larger portion of local Medicaid costs, but it rejected a Cuomo proposal to gradually assume all those costs.
Because many of the cuts are aimed at specific industries, some analysts said their impact would not be broadly felt. Fishermen, farmers, real-estate developers, truck drivers and sparkling-wine producers were all beneficiaries of targeted cuts.
Other cuts, while not obviously aimed at an industry, clearly benefit specific companies more than others. Eastman Kodak, for instance, lobbied aggressively for a tax-code change that will benefit companies that have large payrolls and land holdings in the state but sell most of their goods elsewhere -- a category in which Kodak is the prime example.
Similarly, I.B.M., a major holder of investment tax credits, sought, and won, a change that extends the life of such credits from seven to 10 years. And New York City's major securities firms got a law that will allow them to deduct losses during the last recession.

HEADLINE: Foreign Banks Lag U.S. Rivals

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Foreign-owned banks in the United States are faring worse than American banks, a study by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has found.
The study said foreign banks were "less profitable and less efficient and had more credit quality problems recently than U.S. banks," the comptroller's office said. It said the growth of foreign bank operations in the United States, which was great in the 1980's and early 1990's, was tapering off and might not increase again. 
 According to the study, which was released last week, foreign banks here earned less than United States counterparts for every year between 1983 and 1992, except 1987. United States banks underperformed then chiefly because of losses after the Latin American debt crisis. The study also said that since 1991 profits of foreign-owned banks had been flat while United States bank earnings had surged.
Japanese banks, which make up 40 percent of foreign-owned banks in the United States, had the poorest record. The study, written by Daniel Nolle, an economist, said they tended to be less cost-efficient than other foreign banks.

HEADLINE: Mr. Moynihan's Gambit

 BODY:
Of the five Congressional committees handling heath care reform, Senate Finance may well be the one with the best chance of putting together a bill with enough Republican support to carry the full Senate. Its makeup of 11 Democrats and 9 Republicans encourages bipartisan bargaining. That is why the odd bill proposed last week by its chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, is important.
Viewed as a health care plan, the bill disappoints. It borrows in modified form the President's idea of requiring employers to pay for workers' insurance. But unlike the President, Mr. Moynihan would allow individuals to buy outside regional purchasing cooperatives; that invites the healthy to peel away and leave the chronically ill. 
 And Mr. Moynihan shrinks back from proposing a limit on the tax deductibility of premiums -- the best way to get consumers, and therefore health plans, to pay attention to costs; he thereby proposes a market-based system with no effective market incentives. In a word, odd.
But Mr. Moynihan was playing politics, not health economics. And his touch appears deft. He offered a bill that, despite differences, borrows heavily from the Clinton plan because he knew it would fail -- proving once and for all that the President's plan cannot win and that horse-trading is essential.
The Moynihan bill will not attract moderate Republicans, like John Chafee of Rhode Island and John Danforth of Missouri, or conservative Democrats, like David Boren of Oklahoma, because they are not ready to accept a strict employer mandate. After the plan fails in committee, Mr. Moynihan knows the key players will have to make a fateful decision: either compromise or walk into the November elections with no reform in hand.
The disturbing outcome of last week's goings on is that "no bill" seems an increasingly popular option. Republicans like Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas are gearing up to go before voters and take credit for saving them from, in their view, Mr. Clinton's version of socialized medicine; and the right-wing tug seems to keep the powerful Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, wavering, perhaps afraid that his colleagues will slice him up if he compromises with the White House.
There are plenty of Democrats, like Representative John Dingell, who are also threatening to pass. They privately express a willingness to go into November blaming the G.O.P. for the death of health reform rather than accept a bill that backs away from Mr. Clinton's lavish promises.
Ending 1994 without a bill would squander a historic chance to guarantee citizens of the richest nation that medical catastrophe will no longer lead to financial catastrophe.
The legislative season will be shortened by the elections. The only force big enough to turn the politics around in time is the President. And he will have the opportunity when he brings Mr. Moynihan and the Finance Committee's ranking Republican, Bob Packwood, to the White House tomorrow. He should state unequivocally what compromises he could swallow in order to get a bipartisan deal.
That might mean phasing in universal coverage more slowly than he originally proposed. It might mean exempting, for now, small employers from an employer mandate; independent studies show that over 92 percent of the population, accounting for perhaps 97 percent of health care expenditures, would be covered by reform that required insurers to sell coverage to every applicant at identical rates, with government subsidies for low-income families. There are many ideas around for picking up the stragglers.
Mr. Moynihan has put the ball in Mr. Clinton's court. And that is just where it belongs.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Human Rights Diplomacy, R.I.P.

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER 

 BODY:
President Clinton was seeking to solve a political problem when he snapped the link between China's human rights practices and its U.S. trading privileges. Yet by rewarding rather than punishing China's rejection of reasonable American human rights demands, Mr. Clinton damaged the credibility of American human rights diplomacy everywhere.
That is no small loss. Two decades of intermittent and occasionally successful American human rights pressure on behalf of, among others, East European dissidents, South African blacks and victims of Latin American juntas made a difference to thousands of individual lives and made it easier for democrats in those societies to fight for political change. 
 The unhappy consequences may not be confined to citizens in dictatorships. Values can unite and inspire Americans in ways brutal realpolitik or money lust cannot. Campaigns against arbitrary imprisonment, torture and forced labor and in defense of free expression broaden the appeal of American foreign policy, drawing ordinary citizens into world affairs.
Even after a heavy business lobbying campaign, polls showed strong popular support for using trade leverage to expand human rights. But the rhetoric of mega-profits and jobs in the hot China market eroded Washington support for trade sanctions. Mr. Clinton then shoved aside what had been a unifying expression of American ideals in the name of economics and geopolitics.
The message to the world's repressive regimes is now painfully clear: U.S. threats to impose economic sanctions to enforce human rights standards can in most cases be safely ignored. If your market is attractive, your support for U.S. diplomacy unreliable and your military power menacing, you can abuse your citizens at will, regardless of promises you may have made to Washington or international agreements you may have signed.
Why should China's leaders now think twice about persecuting and torturing dissidents, waging cultural warfare on Tibet or intimidating domestic and foreign journalists? And if the U.S. puts human rights pressure on smaller, weaker nations, like Haiti or Singapore, they can credibly claim to be victims of a great-power double standard that allows twisting the arms of the weak but not the strong. Such bullying may work, but lacks moral force and invites a nationalist backlash.
Recent American human rights diplomacy was launched nearly two decades ago by the moral idealist Jimmy Carter and, though he directed his efforts at different targets, was enthusiastically pursued by his anti-Communist successor, Ronald Reagan, before being shelved by the realpolitician George Bush. Mr. Bush was not interested in using American leverage for human rights. But human rights sanctions remained a credible tool for use by a future President. China, for example, had to think about the possibility of a tougher stand by Mr. Bush's Democratic successor. By deploying human rights pressure and then retreating at the first sign of resistance, Mr. Clinton has sacrificed that credibility, perhaps for years to come.
American foreign policy cannot pivot exclusively, or even mainly, around human rights. Hardheaded issues of military security and economic interest are compelling and must form the centerpiece of any sensible approach. Yet to deserve and win the support of the American people, a foreign policy must also reflect and advance American values.
From the days of the Monroe Doctrine, first formulated as a policy of keeping the Americas free from Old World imperialisms, to the crusading zeal of the cold war, successful American foreign policies have always contained a strong idealistic component. With the evil empire rolled back and the U.S. physically secure, that idealism requires a new and constructive focus if America is to remain internationally engaged. It is a shame, in more ways than one, that Mr. Clinton caved in so easily on human rights. DAVID C. UNGER

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
On Korea, Resolve

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If Kim Il Sung has heard about Western criticism of Clinton foreign policy as wavering and thinks he can bluff or threaten the United States out of firm action against his nuclear weapons program, he is making a mistake.
On this issue the Administration's watchword is resolution. So I believe after conversations here. I do not sense the tentativeness that has marked the search for effective policies in Bosnia and Haiti. 
 The national security interest in the Korean nuclear question is overpoweringly clear. If 5 or 10 years from now North Korea were making numbers of nuclear weapons and selling them, with missile systems, to Iran or Iraq or other rogue regimes, it would be a different world: an intolerably more dangerous one.
For three years, under Presidents Bush and Clinton, the United States tried to deal with the problem by diplomacy. The North Koreans responded by bobbing and weaving, indicating at times that they would allow full inspection of their nuclear facilities if we opened diplomatic relations, then abruptly barring international inspectors from the site that would have shown whether they had diverted nuclear fuel to bomb-making.
Now the Clinton Administration is moving to economic sanctions. Over this past weekend American officials agreed on a sanctions package with two crucial partners, Japan and South Korea. The Japanese Government was either less reluctant about the idea than had been reported, or the U.S. brought it around.
The plan is for sanctions to be applied in phases, becoming increasingly severe if North Korea remains intransigent. For example, a ban on North Koreans in Japan sending money home -- they send as much as $1 billion a year -- might not be imposed until the second phase. But the entire package has been agreed and does not have to be renegotiated with Japan or South Korea.
The big question-mark on sanctions is China, North Korea's neighbor and supplier of the one import on which it is most dependent: oil. The Chinese Government has been critical of sanctions. But there are also signs that it is worried about the instability caused by the nuclear policy of its longtime ally in Pyongyang.
Will sanctions work? No one can be sure they will persuade Kim Il Sung to back down on his nuclear weapons program. North Korea is largely self-sufficient and its family dictatorship can ignore public opinion. But the country's economy is in terrible shape, and sanctions will at a minimum increase the pain.
It will in any event take much determination for the United States and its friends to see the policy through. North Korea will undoubtedly float new negotiating ideas, as it has already started to do. Real results will not come instantly.
What are the results the Clinton policy seeks? First, and most important, to prevent diversion of nuclear fuel to weapons in the future -- by opening the critical processes to inspection. Second, to find out, as best inspectors still can, what happened in the past, so we do not seem to be winking at past violations of North Korea's obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty.
Some observers are critical of the phased sanctions plan as too slow, too weak. But on this problem steadiness is more important than speed. For there can be no quick fix. Talk of a pre-emptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities ignores the reality that such a strike could spread nuclear fallout over much of Asia. And North Korea would surely respond by attacking the South -- whose capital, Seoul, is just 30 miles from the border. We would win the war, but at a heavy cost in casualties.
The best way to show firmness is to beef up the U.S. military force in South Korea, now 37,000 strong. The Clinton Administration has sent patriot missiles and taken other undisclosed measures requested by the commanding general, Gary Luck. I think it should take the demonstrative further step of sending one or more additional force units. The Kim Government, after all, has said it would regard sanctions as an act of war. Sanctions must be accompanied by a strengthened deterrent.
President Clinton has not yet given his final approval to the plan for pressure on Pyongyang. When he does, he should explain the stakes and his measures to the public.

HEADLINE: What Grade Inflation?

BYLINE: By Donald Kennedy; Donald Kennedy, former president of Stanford, is now professor of environmental science there.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
An avalanche of public attention has been loosed by the decision of Stanford's Academic Senate to revive the failing grade and make it once again a permanent part of the student's transcript. The tone is interesting: though the decision is usually praised, the news accounts and editorials are often stridently critical of the previous practice -- which was a sincere effort, like it or not, to encourage students to take academic risks and experiment with courses outside their comfort zone. We are told that Stanford (and, by extension, other universities) "pandered" to students, fostering a climate of rampant "grade inflation."
I happen to think my colleagues probably made the right decision. But I am struck by the degree to which both the problem and Stanford's so-called solution are being misunderstood. 
 First, the F has always been rare, even in the toughest of olden times; at Stanford it never made more than a trivial contribution to grade-point averages. As a way of ending "grade inflation," then, Stanford's action was symbolic. The faculty didn't need to legislate to fix matters; all it had to do was start giving C's and B's instead of B's and A's.
Nevertheless, grade inflation is a problem, even if Stanford's action isn't the solution; it must be, since the whole world appears thrilled to imagine that we have done away with it. Can it be explained in a way that might help us find a real answer?
The first problem is the term itself. Alfred Kahn, the distinguished Cornell economist who deregulated the airlines and then moved on to the Council of Economic Advisers, noted that the very word inflation induced unfortunate behavioral changes. So he decided to substitute a harmless, context-free word for it. He chose "banana." It didn't protect us from double-digit banana in 1979-80, but it did stop people short, and that might be useful here.
I have a vantage point that may help in interpreting grade banana. Until 1977, I taught large undergraduate courses in biology at Stanford. I temporarily left to do other things, and from 1979 to 1992 scarcely taught at all. Then last year I returned to real teaching, and took over the same large sophomore course I had last taught in 1977. It has been a stunning experience. Stanford undergraduates are significantly brighter and better-prepared than their 1977 counterparts. They work harder, and we expect more of them. If they are receiving B-plus as against their predecessors' C-plus, that is an improvement of about 10 points on a 100-point scale. So we should ask whether these students are 10 percentage points better. My time-lapse answer is "at least."
It strikes me as strange to talk of this phenomenon as inflation. When your new Chevy costs more in 1993 than it did in 1977, that's inflation. When your new Cadillac costs more in 1993 than your Chevy did in 1977, that's something else.
Since it is the students who are changing and not the standards, one must ask why professors don't recognize this ability-and-dedication creep, and raise the standards. I think I know the answer, and it doesn't have to do with "pandering." Part of it is that Stanford and other leading universities are doing what their critics have demanded: offering more seminars and independent-study courses for advanced students, in which higher grades are always more prevalent.
Far more important, however, is the aging of the faculty. In the expansionary 1960's, most professors were relatively new. Now, thanks to static budgets and the ending of mandatory retirement, the average faculty member is much older, and many have been in place for the entire banana epoch. It is not surprising that standards stay fixed when there is so little rejuvenation in the population responsible for setting them.
Returning the failing grade, whatever other satisfactions it may provide us, will not peel back the banana. That will require something much harder. Our faculties need to have a serious, prolonged conversation about what they are trying to achieve and how the system of evaluation can be made to serve that purpose.
At Stanford, a commission of teacher-scholars has been engaged in that process for a year. When their work is done, I hope thoughtful friends of higher education will pay at least as much attention to it as they have lavished on the symbolic return of the eraser-proof F. It is academic policy that really matters -- not academic bookkeeping.

HEADLINE: President and Emperor Talk, Ever Politely

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
President Clinton and Emperor Akihito of Japan softened the edges of history today to draw a picture of shared interests, destinies and technologies with nary a brush stroke for recent trade and political frictions and only a minimalist approach to the toll and turmoil of World War II.
The ceremonial day began on a steamy morning that sent a half-dozen guests seeking the shade of a towering magnolia tree on the South Lawn. After a 21-gun salute and an honor guard representing all the branches of the American military, the President and the Emperor found themselves talking vaguely about cooperation and friendship without any serious mention of the severe trade imbalance that has defined Japanese-American dialogue for more than a decade. 
 They also managed to almost totally ignore the war, though White House staff members issued a transcript of President Clinton's remarks that initially misidentified the guest as Emperor Hirohito, the Emperor's father and the man who surrendered both his country and his claim to celestial ancestry at the close of World War II. The military color guard that stood at stiff attention in the unseasonal June steam carried several battle streamers from fights waged in the Pacific theater.
 
Sidestepping Differences
 The President got so carried away that at one point he almost seemed to bow, inclining his shoulders and upper torso forward in the vague direction of the 125th inheritor of the most formal throne on earth. The exchange of speeches between Mr. Clinton and the Emperor sidestepped fresh frictions over Japan's reluctance to take part in economic sanctions against North Korea for that country's failure to comply with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
And it omitted an allusion to Japan's desire to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, a move the Clinton Administration has supported but that would produce new problems down the road.
Today was not the day to dwell on such unpleasantries as war threats from Pyongyang, disputes over automobile parts or the thorny issues of copyright infringements and random violence. Instead, the two leaders lingered at loftier heights.
While their wives stood stoic and still in the sun, hatted and formal in white shoes and white gloves, the President and the Emperor exchanged grave words of admiration and support.
"Your majesties, our commitment to common ideals is firm," said the President, after thanking the Imperial couple for their first visit since ascending to the Chrysanthemum throne. "Our determination to work with you is strong. Our welcome to you today is sincere and heartfelt."
It was at times a bit of a stretch. After President Clinton, flushed and grinning, listed the contributions of Japanese-Americans in everything from sports to politics he told the Emperor: "In millions of American homes you will see the works of Japanese printmakers and gardens that might well fit in Kyoto."
He could not resist a pained and empathetic laugh as he spoke of American students "struggling to learn and master" one of the most complex languages in the world.
Empress Michiko clapped demurely and Hillary Rodham Clinton nodded and smiled in hat-bobbing support.
Emperor Akihito just as deftly avoided any appearance of controversy. After putting the afternoon in perspective by casting back to the time when Japan first opened its ports to the West 140 years ago (not mentioning that it was under the duress of gunboat diplomacy), he thanked the United States for the "knowledge and technologies" Japan had learned from the United States (not mentioning battles over copyrights) and for "caring for the next generations of Japanese by accepting exchange students" (not mentioning the deaths of several Japanese students in Louisiana and California).
Older wounds seemed easier. President Clinton spoke of the "vivid memories" from World War II dividing the two nations with misunderstandings and ignorance at a time when "more than borders blocked the sharing of ideas."
The Emperor, whose every word is scrutinized and analyzed back home for nuance and intonation, cautiously recapitulated Emperor Hirohito's description of Word War II during his 1975 visit to the Ford White House. Calling the war a "deplorable rupture," he dwelt on the commitments to democracy and peace that followed.
Although the only real substance was symbology, the symbology was formidable. The day began with 14 trumpeters leaning over the White House balcony to herald the President's arrival. The two leaders stood side-by-side on the fresh-swept podium during the 21-gun salute.

HEADLINE: JURY FINDS EXXON ACTED RECKLESSLY IN VALDEZ OIL SPILL

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 13

 BODY:
In a verdict that could have striking economic implications for the world's largest oil company, a Federal jury said today that the Exxon Corporation was reckless when it permitted a captain with a history of alcohol abuse to command a supertanker.
The jury also determined that the captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, was himself negligent and reckless when he drank heavily on the afternoon before the Exxon Valdez strayed off course in the dangerous waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound and ran aground on March 24, 1989, causing North America's worst oil tanker spill. 
 The verdicts, announced this morning in Federal District Court here, were the first in what could be a long and costly summer for Exxon. The findings of negligence and recklessness move the legal proceedings to the next phase, in which the same jury is to establish how much Exxon compensate the 10,000 or so people who fish, hunt or live near the sound and depend on it for subsistence or income. Then the jury is to decide on the size of punitive damages.
The plaintiffs, all private citizens, are asking $1.5 billion in compensatory damages and $15 billion in punitive damages. Exxon previously acknowledged that it had been negligent, opening the way for a jury to consider what compensation was just. The jury's finding today that the company was reckless means that the company is also liable for punitive damages.
Exxon has already spent $3.4 billion responding to the disaster, and it argues that the $1.5 billion claim for compensation is too large and that punitive damages are not warranted. Estimates by Government agencies of the scope of the damage have varied widely, up to many billions of dollars.
The effect of the verdict was immediately felt on the stock market, where Exxon shares fell $2.625, to $59.50, by the close of trading.
Elated but obviously worn by the trial, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, Brian O'Neill of Minneapolis, said after the verdicts: "A company as large as Exxon thinks that it is above the law. You need to take a substantial bite out of their butt before they change their behavior. This verdict will help to do that and send a message to all the Exxons of the world."
Patrick Lynch, a lawyer from Los Angeles who represents Exxon, said the company would continue to defend itself against charges that it was uncaring or reckless. "Exxon's behavior after the accident was exemplary," he said in an interview. "We took extraordinary steps to clean up, to compensate people, and to correct and improve operating practices."
This was the first jury trial for Exxon involving the Valdez spill but the second jury trial for Mr. Hazelwood. In 1990, a state jury in Alaska acquitted him of charges that he had operated his ship under the influence of alcohol. But he was convicted of a lesser charge of discharging oil, a misdemeanor that was overturned a year later by a state appeals court.
In 1991, the Coast Guard also acquitted Mr. Hazelwood of charges that he was impaired while commanding the Exxon Valdez. The Coast Guard, though, suspended Mr. Hazelwood's license for nine months for leaving the tanker's bridge at a critical moment. Mr. Hazelwood's license has since been reinstated, and, according to his testimony here, he is a paid employee of the New York office of one of his lawyers, Michael Chalos. Exxon is paying Mr. Hazelwood's legal fees.
A lawyer representing Mr. Hazelwood, Thomas Rousso of New York, said today: "We still believe Captain Hazelwood was not reckless in the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. We are hoping when all is said and done, when people look back over time and look at this objectively, Captain Hazelwood will be vindicated."
 
Civil and Criminal Differences
 Because some procedures and the legal issues usually differ between civil and criminal cases, plaintiffs in civil suits can often win judgments and collect damages for negligence or reckless acts from defendants who have been acquitted of criminal charges in another trial.
During the monthlong trial, Mr. O'Neill sought to prove that Exxon's senior corporate executives had failed to account for the risks of hauling millions of gallons of oil in a supertanker commanded by a skipper they knew was prone to bouts of drinking. Mr. O'Neill's strategy was to establish a morality play pitting thousands of ordinary Alaskans whose lives and livelihoods depended on Prince William Sound's vast natural resources against a company he portrayed as an uncaring oil giant that left its most modern supertanker in the hands of an alcoholic.
Mr. Lynch and other Exxon lawyers sought to show that alcohol had not been a factor. He contended the disaster had been caused solely by the failure of the ship's third mate, Gregory Cousins, to follow Captain Hazelwood's command and turn the ship back into the proper channel.
Because of the complexity of the case and the amount of money at stake, the trial has been divided by Judge H. Russel Holland into four phases. The jury verdicts today ended the first phase.
The second phase begins next week to set damages suffered by the plaintiffs, which their lawyers have put at $1.5 billion. The third phase establishes punitive damages.
The fourth phase, involving a different jury, is to hear hundreds of individual damage claims against Exxon brought by residents and property owners who are not involved in the first three phases.
 
Raw Spot for Alaskans
 Five years after the spill, the disaster remains a raw spot with many Alaskans. New scientific data collected by the state and the Federal Government indicate that the environmental damage from the spill endures. Fishing catches for herring and other species are down; the numbers of some marine mammal species have not recovered, and there is still ample evidence, say villagers as well as Federal scientists, that oil lingers on some beaches.
Exxon, which has 91,000 employees worldwide, earned total revenue last year of nearly $111 billion. Of the $3.4 billion that Exxon says it has spent in responding to the spill, $2.1 billion was spent in the months immediately afterward to scrub beaches, recover spilled oil and perform other environmental cleanup work.
The company also spent $300 million paying claims filed by about 11,000 residents and businesses in the Prince William Sound region. In 1991, the company also settled state and Federal civil and criminal charges that stemmed from the spill. It paid $900 million in civil-settlement costs and $125 million in criminal penalties for polluting Prince William Sound.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs said a turning point in the trial's first phase may have been the testimony of Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's former chief executive officer and chairman.
In 1989, in the early weeks after the spill, Mr. Rawl testified several times in Congress and was quoted in newspapers and on television as saying that it had been a mistake for the company to allow Mr. Hazelwood to skipper the Exxon Valdez because of his drinking problems.
But during the trial, Mr. Rawl recanted, testifying he had been misled about the causes of the accident by news reports, by reports from the Coast Guard and by statements the company's own lawyers were making to prepare him for his Congressional appearances. Mr. Rawl said he now believed that Mr. Hazelwood had not been impaired by alcohol.

HEADLINE: North Korea Quits Atom Agency In Wider Rift With U.S. and U.N.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, June 14

 BODY:
North Korea deepened its confrontation with the United Nations and the Clinton Administration late Monday, announcing that it would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency and that the agency's inspectors would no longer be allowed in the country.
The declaration would appear to mean that the two inspectors in North Korea will be expelled, but the statement did not explicitly refer to them. Without inspectors present, the spent fuel rods extracted from North Korea's largest nuclear reactor during the last month could be converted into weapons fuel without detection. 
 The Central Intelligence Agency has warned that the fuel is enough to make four or five nuclear weapons; the agency says North Korea may already possess one or two bombs.
The North stopped short of declaring that it would leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a step it announced and then suspended last year. Non-nuclear states that sign the treaty pledge never to develop nuclear weapons and agree to international inspections.
North Korea now says it has a "special status" under the treaty and is not subject to all its requirements.
But without inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which includes regular visits by specialists and constant monitoring by cameras and other equipment at nuclear sites, there is no way to verify whether the country is complying with the treaty.
For several weeks, two inspectors have been in North Korea on a special mission to oversee the removal of spent fuel from the reactor, an event that takes place once every five years or so. But they have not been permitted to take samples and perform some other duties.
"The agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do any further in our country," said the statement, issued in English by the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
The step announced by North Korea was precisely the one that the Administration officials had feared it might take in retaliation for the agency's vote on Friday to enact a mild set of sanctions against the Communist Government.
Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State who is coordinating handling of the North Korean standoff, said on Monday that a decision by North Korea to withdraw from the agency and to resist inspection "certainly would be a very, very serious development for the worse."
"This would put into question North Korean assurances about the peaceful nature of their program," he said. "It would potentially have their program completely unsafeguarded."
 
Clinton Confers With Yeltsin
 In Washington, President Clinton talked to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia by telephone Monday about efforts to impose sanctions against North Korea, the White House said.
"They discussed North Korea at some length and agreed on a general approach to sanctions" being discussed by members of the Security Council, said the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers.
At the United Nations, the chief delegate from the United States, Madeleine K. Albright, said Monday that the first draft of a sanctions resolution might be distributed within 24 hours, and she indicated that stronger measures would be considered.
Additional sanctions against North Korea are expected to be discussed in the Security Council this week, with provisions to phase in more severe steps unless the North relents and allows full nuclear inspections. In its statement Monday, which was monitored in Tokyo, the North reiterated that "sanctions will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war."
In South Korea today, former President Jimmy Carter arrived for meetings before a highly unusual trip across the Demilitarized Zone to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Wednesday. He is expected to meet the country's 82-year-old leader, Kim Il Sung, and lay out specifically what North Korea could obtain from the West -- diplomatic recognition, aid and investment -- in return for abandoning the nuclear program.
But the South was also preparing for the worst, saying it would call up 6.6 million reservists to conduct one of South Korea's biggest military drills in years.
Kim Deok, South Korea's director of intelligence, speaking to Parliament in Seoul, seemed to reverse his Government's earlier contention that the North was primarily seeking diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
Instead, he said in testimony, "it now appears their ultimate goal is to develop nuclear weapons, and they are now employing delaying tactics to earn time."
Until the latest announcement, the Clinton Administration was leaning toward a go-slow approach, in which the first phase of any sanctions would cut off scientific and cultural exchanges and a small United Nations economic development program.
Only in the second stage of sanctions, which would take effect if the North failed to relent, would the measure begin to have real bite. At that point Japan would be asked to cut off the $600 million to $1.8 billion a year that ethnic Koreans in Japan send to the North; this money is North Korea's most vital source of hard currency. Later stages could include oil cutoffs and a military blockade.
Speaking in Washington on Monday, Mr. Gallucci suggested that the latest announcement from the North could result in a speed-up of the sanctions plan.
The North Korean statement left open a number of crucial questions.
It did not say, for instance, whether its statement that "inspections for the continuity of safeguards" would no longer be allowed meant that security cameras at the nuclear site at Yongbyon would be dismantled.
The statement also did not say whether the two inspectors in North Korea would be immediately evicted.
Technically, a country does not have to be a member of the agency to submit to safeguards under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. While there are 164 signers of the treaty, there are only 122 members of the agency. But virtually none of the non-member states have nuclear installations.
"This is completely new territory," said Paul Leventhal, the director of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, which lobbies against the spread of civilian nuclear programs involving plutonium. "But the bottom line is that you can't make sure of anything unless you can eyeball the fuel."
Part of the Administration's seeming uncertainty over how to respond stems from the conflicting signals from the North. Just two days before the Monday announcement, for instance, Selig Harrison, a scholar for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, traveled to North Korea and met for three hours with President Kim.
Mr. Harrison emerged with what he said was a North Korean offer to freeze its nuclear program in return for a number of concessions.
The offer described by Mr. Harrison appeared to create a small opening for former President Carter. But North Korea's announcement on Monday seemed to undercut any such offers.

'Retired' and Regretting the Gang Life

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 13

 BODY:
Gregory Davis has about had it with the younger generation, marking up his neighborhood with gang graffiti, gunning one another down in drive-by shootings.
"If we'd known it would come to this, we never would have started things," said Mr. Davis, better known in his South Central neighborhood as Batman, one of the young toughs who founded the Crips street gang in 1969. 
 Now 40 and unemployed, this old street warrior, with three teardrops tattooed under his left eye in memory of three friends who were shot dead, solicits buckets of free paint from a nearby hardware store to paint out graffiti eyesores on his block.
"It was fun back when I was Crippin'," said Mr. Davis, who joined an earlier gang called the Businessmen when he was 12 and has spent 15 years in prison on convictions for assault, robbery and murder. "They didn't start that shooting and killing until like the late 70's, and it just got out of hand in the 80's and 90's."
As the years pass and new legions of youngsters take up ever deadlier arms, a generation of "retired" gang members has emerged, unschooled, untrained for jobs, with prison records that make them virtually unemployable, wondering what to do with the rest of their lives.
"Once a Crip always a Crip; once a Blood always a Blood," Mr. Davis said. "But you get to a certain age, you ain't going to be going out there throwing a Crip sign, flying the rags out of your pocket and that stuff."
And at a certain age, Mr. Davis and others like him have an unfamiliar yearning for something more. "Living here in South Central all these years, I ain't never been nowhere except prison," Mr. Davis said. "And you can't really get out and see things when you're in prison."
In South Central, he said, he is tired of "all these gunshots, all these helicopters flying" as gang members kill one another and the police hunt them down.
But Mr. Davis, a gap-toothed man with curly hair and a sly grin, is pressing ahead with his life. He has worked as an anti-gang counselor, and he has started an innovative business enterprise.
With an artistically talented friend, he has begun selling large mirrors whose glass is decorated with personalized paintings or photographic arrangements. He has created several for his own home with gang motifs, including one with a collage of snapshots of himself in prison, along with photographs of half a dozen friends who are on death row.
And over the weekend he was married, in a ceremony that brought together the divided world of a gang member, with some guests calling him Gregory and others, Batman.
His bride was his longtime girlfriend, Karen Stewart, who for now supports the two of them with a hairdressing business that she operates behind a curtain in their tiny, sparsely furnished home.
The ceremony was held by the swimming pool at the lavish Hollywood Hills home of Jim Brown, the former football player and movie actor, who now runs an anti-gang and self-help organization called Amer-I-Can, for which Mr. Davis has worked.
The guests' Sunday best ranged from black tie to T-shirt, and older guests who came to Los Angeles in the big wave of black migration in the 1950's, when factory jobs were plentiful, mingled with young men whose hope of success is to make it as rap performers.
The courtly manner of the older guests contrasted with the hustle of the young men, who interspersed their conversation with snatches of rap lyrics, snapping their fingers or thumping their chests for rhythm.
Ice-T, one of the biggest names in rap, attended the ceremony, along with his wife and their 3-year-old son, nicknamed Little Ice. Like the bridegroom and the other principals, Ice-T, his hair pulled into a tiny ponytail, shimmered in white tails and powder-blue bow tie.
Mr. Davis and his bride said their vows under a white arch, beneath large paper bells of white and powder blue, in a tableau that was replicated in miniature by the figurines atop their wedding cake.
Though the city of Los Angeles was spread out behind them, a blanket of white smog hid the South Central section from view. But as the newlyweds knelt for a prayer at the end of the ceremony, the voice of the priest was drowned out by the roar of a circling helicopter, a chance reminder of the world to which they would return.

Moseley, center, officiated. At right was Jim Brown, the former football player, who owns the home where the ceremony was held. To his right was Batman's uncle, James Jordan.

H.M.O.'S FEEL GROWTH PAINS AS POOR JOIN
Tens of thousands of New York's Medicaid recipients have enrolled in health maintenance organizations -- some nonprofit organizations with a long record of assisting the poor, others offshoots of commercial insurers drawn in by the promise of profits. But the spurt has also come with growing pains, particularly among the commercial companies. Critics say there are wide variations in quality and that some plans have put more effort into developing their marketing skills than their networks of doctors and medical services. A1.

The New Jersey Senate endorsed Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's philosophy of reducing the reach of government by agreeing that the Department of Higher Education has outlived its usefulness. The agency's abolition will realize only $4.6 million in savings, but the Governor's allies said the measure was the forerunner of other attempts to reduce state government. B6.

HEADLINE: Judge v. I.B.M.: Long, Bitter Clash

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR 

 BODY:
In 1953, a young Federal judge named David N. Edelstein had his first brush with I.B.M. and its lawyers in his Manhattan courtroom. A year earlier, the Justice Department had charged the company with antitrust violations. By 1956, after overseeing a series of pretrial motions, Judge Edelstein approved and signed a settlement reached by the Government and the company.
Under the settlement agreement, known as a consent decree, I.B.M. agreed to segregate services operations from hardware and other businesses. By all accounts, the signing was uneventful. But it marked the beginning of what has become one of the most rancorous -- and one of the longest-running -- relationships between a judge and a corporate defendant in the history of Manhattan's Federal court.
 
Personalizing the Issues?
 While I.B.M. has accused Judge Edelstein of waging a personal crusade against it, some legal experts say that the company and its lawyers have attacked the judge as way of winning their case. 
 In any event, some legal scholars say that overseeing the I.B.M. consent decree for 38 years has been, for the judge, one of the few remarkable chapters in an otherwise low-profile career. Others predict that he will be reluctant to give up such a big case even as I.B.M. is arguing that the economic and technological rationale for the decree has long since lapsed.
"Every judge likes the feel of an important case," said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a professor and specialist in antitrust cases at Columbia Law School. "The tendency of a good judge is to take on a case like this and not want to let it go."
Judge Edelstein, of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, declined to be interviewed for this article.
In the nearly four decades since the consent decree was signed, I.B.M. has accused Judge Edelstein of bias and of harassing witnesses and altering the court transcript. On three previous occasions, the company has demanded, albeit unsuccessfully, that he remove himself from the case. I.B.M. repeated the request last week.
The judge has so far refused to step aside, arguing that the company had failed to prove its assertions of bias. He clung fiercely to a second I.B.M. antitrust suit, a 13-year case that the Justice Department dropped in 1982. And he once accused I.B.M.'s lawyer on the case for the last 25 years, Thomas D. Barr of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, of "threatening" him during a cross-examination.
Last week, like two old sparring partners meeting in the ring, Mr. Barr, who is 63, appeared once again before Judge Edelstein, now 84. As he stood before Judge Edelstein, Mr. Barr said he was seeking to have the 1956 decree lifted and was asking that the judge step down from the case. In court papers filed last week, he cited "the cumulative evidence of Judge Edelstein's personal bias and prejudice against I.B.M."
But both critics and supporters say that Judge Edelstein will likely fight to the end to hold on to the decree and keep it in his court, underlining what they describe as an unusual, if not bewildering, attachment to the I.B.M. litigation. It is an attachment, they say, with roots in his past, his personality and his politics.
When President Harry S. Truman appointed David Edelstein, a Justice Department lawyer, to a Federal judgeship in 1951, it was over the objections of the American and New York City Bar Associations and of some lawyers, who argued that he did not have enough trial experience.
Since then, Judge Edelstein, who has been on the Federal bench longer than any other active district court judge in the country, has developed a reputation as a combative jurist -- an image cemented by his tenacious, often turbulent supervision of the Government's antitrust case against the giant International Business Machines Corporation.
 
Thoughtful, Irascible, Difficult
 "This is a guy who came to the job with questions raised about his credentials but who has done pretty well," Professor Goldschmid said. "He is a thoughtful judge, but he is irascible. And for I.B.M., he has certainly been difficult."
Whether on the I.B.M. case or other issues before him, critics have frequently accused Judge Edelstein of seeming overly sympathetic to Government lawyers. It is a loyalty, they say, forged during his early years spent working for the Justice Department in the late 1940's in jobs ranging from an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District to Assistant Attorney General.
In at least one case, the Federal appeals court in New York seemed to agree with such criticism. In a 1982 ruling, the court rebuked Judge Edelstein for "a usurpation of power" in his efforts to keep the I.B.M. antitrust suit alive even after the Justice Department dropped it.
 
A Willingness to Get Tough
 Certainly, legal experts said, the judge has shown a willingness to get tough with corporate defendants of various stripes. In 1983, for example, he ordered the Danilow Pastry Company of Brooklyn, which had been convicted of price fixing, to give baked goods to community organizations and forced company employees to help carry this out at Danilow's expense.
Some legal experts and lawyers, including James I. Serota, a former prosecutor who helped bring the Government's case against I.B.M. in 1969, argues that Judge Edelstein is simply motivated by a strong commitment to seeing justice done.
"He is tough with everyone," Mr. Serota said. "That doesn't mean he's not a fair person. He just plays things strictly by the book."
But such defenses do little to quiet critics who contend that Judge Edelstein has pursued I.B.M. as if he were on a mission to take down a corporate giant.
After the Justice Department filed the second antitrust suit against I.B.M. in 1969, the case was not immediately assigned to a single judge. In 1971, Judge Edelstein, who had become Chief Judge of the Southern District and thus had the authority to assign cases, effectively assigned the case to himself, according to lawyers familiar with the proceedings.
Former Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, who was I.B.M.'s general counsel at the time and oversaw the litigation with its team of Cravath, Swaine & Moore lawyers, remarked, "I think he wanted the I.B.M. case because it was a big case, and because he thought it would attract a lot of attention and would be a good way to finish a career."
Over the next 13 years, Judge Edelstein became famous for raging against the Cravath lawyers, including Mr. Barr.
During that period, Cravath tried twice to have Judge Edelstein step down from the case. Instead of citing behavior outside the courtroom -- the standard grounds for asking that a Federal judge remove himself from a case -- Cravath accused Judge Edelstein of personal prejudice against I.B.M. during the trial proceedings. Both efforts ultimately failed. (Cravath's third unsuccessful attempt occurred in 1989, when I.B.M. found itself back in Judge Edelstein's courtroom in a copyright lawsuit that the company had brought against a small engineering firm.)
Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at New York University Law School, said that Judge Edelstein had been tough on I.B.M. over the years in part because he apparently believed that the Government had made a strong case against the company, and felt that the Justice Department was "pulling the rug out from under him" by dropping the case in 1982.
I.B.M.'s supporters have not been so generous. "When the Government came in and wanted to dismiss the case," Mr. Katzenbach said, "it was though his life's work was going down the drain, and he didn't want that and he resisted that."
Now, the matter of the consent decree is left. Whether it is lifted, legal experts say, may hinge on whether Judge Edelstein stays on the case.
Last week, in a 50-page motion accompanied by reams of supporting documents, Mr. Barr attempted once again to have the judge remove himself from the case, citing the two sides' contentious history. And yesterday, I.B.M. filed its motion asking that the consent decree be vacated.
Judge Edelstein has not yet ruled on either motion.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Surges on Forecast Of Declines in World Crop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Coffee prices posted their largest one-day gain in more than seven years yesterday after the Department of Agriculture forecast a 3 percent decline in the world's coffee crop this year and a 4 percent drop in 1995.
The surge in coffee, as well as strong gains in crude oil and copper, helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities up 2.62, to 235.50. 
 Brazil's coffee crop, the world's largest, is expected to shrink 5 percent next year, while Colombia's crop, the second largest, is expected to plunge 14 percent.
Coffee for July delivery surged 13.10 cents, to $1.3830 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, its second-highest close since the International Coffee Agreement, which set export quotas, fell apart in 1989. Coffee prices have risen 71 percent since mid-April.
 
 
'Not Enough'
 "The market is going to have to go to stockpiles," said Stephen Smith, a coffee broker with Iron Horse Lamborn Company in Miami. Brazil's crop "is not enough," he said, to meet growing demand for coffee.
Coffee supplies available for delivery are scarce, Mr. Smith said, even with exporters selling coffee held off world markets under a 1993 plan designed to raise prices. Some of that coffee, totaling four million bags worldwide, is of poor quality, and exporters are selling it slowly to keep prices high.
Meanwhile, this year's harvest is not complete.
On other commodity markets, crude oil climbed to a three-week high after Venezuela said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did not need to meet in September.
"I don't think it will be necessary, but it's good to have the time to see how the market reacts," said Erwin Jose Arrieta, Venezuela's oil minister, after arriving in Vienna for OPEC's quarterly conference.
July crude oil rose 31 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $18.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
If OPEC cancels the September meeting, traders said, it is unlikely to alter its crude production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels a day this year.
 
 
Rising Demand
 "It's bullish because they're not going to change their quota," a trader at Merrill Lynch in New York said. "Demand is rising, and no meeting means that they're not going to increase output."
Elsewhere, copper jumped to its highest price since September 1992 as demand grows with a global economic recovery. July copper gained 2.05 cent, to $1.114 a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York, for a 9 percent gain in a week.
"Basic manufacturing is recovering, and you can't do that without using metals," said Peter Anker, an analyst with NatWest Securities in New York. "This is a very healthy metals market. I haven't seen anything like it in 20 years."
He said the demand for copper was "pretty straightforward, economically derived."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Asserts Resolve but Dollar Falls

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said today that the dollar's recent recovery against the Japanese yen demonstrated the Clinton Administration's resolve to uphold the value of the American currency. But shortly after the Secretary spoke currency traders appeared to test that resolve as they pushed the dollar down sharply against the yen and the German mark.
Traders said that the fall in the dollar, which has been eroding slightly over the last week, was not set off by Mr. Bentsen's remarks; they should have strengthened the American currency, if anything. Rather, Mr. Bentsen's remarks seemed to have been overshadowed by changing perceptions among some investors about the relative strengths of the American, Japanese and Germany economies.
 
Changes in Economies
 The mood that is taking hold, some traders said, is that the American economy is slowing down, and therefore no more interest rate increases are likely now by the Federal Reserve, while both the German and Japanese economies are clearly picking up, meaning no more interest rate declines in those countries are likely for now. Since, among other things, currency traders chase the best interest rates and the growing economy, some have clearly concluded that the best opportunities will be in Japan and Europe. 
 "It looks as though the dollar might be facing a new test," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. "The events of the past few weeks have increased the suspicion among investors that there will be no more increases out of the Fed right now, so they look around somewhere else. Meanwhile, the latest news has increased optimism about the recovery of Europe and Japan. Add that to the continued uncertainty about foreign policy developments, and you have a certain underlying skepticism about the dollar."
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6455 marks late yesterday, down more than two pfennigs, or 1.3 percent, from 1.6665 marks in New York late Friday. Against the yen the dollar fell to a five-week low of 102.90 yen, down from 103.60 on Friday, or seven-tenths of a percent.
Since Mr. Bentsen organized the May 4 intervention by 16 central banks to prop up the value of the dollar, the slide in the American currency had been reversed and it was holding steady around 104 yen to the dollar and 1.66 German marks. Before the concerted move by the 16 central banks, the dollar had dipped to near its post-World War II low of 100.40 yen and was threatening to crash through the 100 barrier.
 
 
Bentsen Sees Stabilizaiton
 But in the last week the dollar has started to fall again and it continued doing so from the start of trading this morning, despite Mr. Bentsen's comments to a group of wire service reporters that "we refuted the misperception that we had no concern about the value of the dollar."
Speaking at midday, before the full extent of the dollar's drop today was apparent, Mr. Bentsen said: "I don't think it is languishing. It had gone to 100.40. You have seen it stabilize, in fact a modest increase in its value. It is fairly constant."
Currency traders say that what is depressing the dollar now is not a feeling in the markets -- which existed two months ago -- that the Administration secretly wanted the American currency to go lower to help foster imports, and would not move to stop it if it did. Rather, traders say, it appears to be the relative comparisons of the German, Japanese and American economies at this moment in their respective business cycles.
In addition, the strong showing by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party in European Union elections helped calm investor worries that his Government would be ousted in fall elections by German parties with far less economic experience.
Charles Raymond, president of Predex, currency forecasters, said that the Treasury Department's intervention to support the dollar last month "did work relatively well as these things go."

HEADLINE: Wife and Lover Held in Murder Of Executive

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
It was not, the authorities said, a conventional suburban marriage and it ended in murder.
He was a wealthy 54-year-old senior vice president for merchandising at the Grand Union supermarket chain. She was a 23-year-old former topless dancer with a history of arrests in petty crimes. Brooke D. Lennon and his wife, Michelle, shared what the authorities said was was a craving for liquor and their relationship was so fractious they spent much of their one year of marriage living apart, he in a condominium in Edgewater, N.J., and she in a tumbledown bungalow in Monsey, N.Y., rented by her lover. 
 "He knew whom he was marrying and tolerated more than the typical suburban husband," said Kenneth Gribetz, the Rockland County District Attorney. "They were separately together."
Early Friday morning, in the Monsey bungalow, the relationship turned deadly. Mr. Lennon, the authorities said, was beaten over the head with a baseball bat and strangled with a telephone cord. His body was placed in the trunk of his company-leased Lincoln Continental Mark VIII and, after the car mired in a muddy path two miles away, the body was dumped in nearby woods.
Mrs. Lennon and Robert Tomassi, a 25-year-old unemployed motorcycle repairman whom the authorities described as her lover, were arrested Sunday evening and charged with his murder.
So unorthodox was the Lennons' marriage that the authorities said Mr. Lennon spent the last night of his life drinking with his wife and Mr. Tomassi in Mr. Tomassi's bungalow. Mrs. Lennon and Mr. Tomassi smoked crack as well, Mr. Gribetz said. Mr. Lennon, Mr. Gribetz said, had even told Grand Union officials that he was planning to move some belongings to the Monsey bungalow.
Mr. Gribetz said the murder had been planned and one likely motive was Mr. Lennon's $2 million life insurance policy and $280,000 bank account. He said Mr. Tomassi and Mrs. Lennon have made statements to the Ramapo town police, but he declined to classify them as confessions.
Neither Mrs. Lennon nor Mr. Tomassi have been assigned court-appointed lawyers.
Mr. Lennon, a stocky man with brownish hair, was described as an industry authority on how products should be displayed on supermarket shelves. Starting as a buyer in 1966, he worked his way up the hierarchy of Grand Union, which is headquartered in Wayne, N.J., and has 254 stores in seven northeastern states. He became a vice president last year.
 
Dancing at the Bar
 Mr. Lennon was born in Providence, R.I., and was a business graduate of the University of Rhode Island. He was married at least once before and had no children, Mr. Gribetz said. He met the former Michelle Fintzy, a longtime Rockland resident, while she was working as a dancer.
As husband and wife, the Lennons enjoyed dancing and drinking at Billy B's, a bar near their Edgewater condominium. Dick Reynolds, a patron and friend of Mr. Lennon's, said some evenings Mr. Lennon would put $20 in the jukebox and dance the evening away with Mrs. Lennon.
"We called him Fred Astaire," said Mr. Reynolds. "They were so lovey-dovey you'd never know anything was wrong."
But as time passed it became obvious to some at Billy B's that the marriage had its tempestuous side.
"Michelle was like a homing pigeon," said Mr. Reynolds. "They'd break up, get back together again, she'd leave again. One time she brought a boyfriend down to this bar."
Two months ago, neighbors said, she moved in with Mr. Tomassi, a Californian who graduated from Spring Valley High School and was known for the tattoos on his body, including the Harley-Davidson logo.
 
'It's Such a Dump'
 Timothy M. Smith, a Monsey neighbor, said he frequently heard the roar of motorcycles on the dead-end road leading to the bungalow. To his surprise, he also noticed Mr. Lennon at the bungalow many times.
"We all wondered what a guy with that stature was doing over here," he said. "It's such a dump."
Mr. Gribetz said that Mr. Lennon went to the bungalow Thursday night and, lounging shoeless and in black sweat pants, spent the night drinking with his wife and Mr. Tomassi, passing out around 2 A.M. Friday. It was then, Mr. Gribetz said, that Mrs. Lennon bludgeoned her husband with a bat and Mr. Tomassi stomped on his head.
The pair, he said, pulled three plastic bags around Mr. Lennon's head to stanch the blood and then tied a telephone cord around Mr. Lennon's neck. They drove with the body to Brick Church Road in the village of New Hempstead and turned down a dirt path leading to an unfinished home development. The car became mired in the mud and they had to abandon it and dump Mr. Lennon's body about 30 feet from the path.
The two started hiking home, Mr. Gribetz said, then hailed a passing taxi and returned to the bungalow to clean up evidence, burning the blood-soaked sofa cushions. The car was discovered Friday evening by children on their way to synagogue. They alerted nearby residents.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury-Issue Prices Hit by Selling Pressure

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities came under selling pressure yesterday as the dollar dropped in currency markets.
The bond market was also buffetted by the reappearance of trade tensions with Japan, increased unrest in Mexico ahead of the presidential elections there, and the general malaise in the Eurobond market. For some traders it was all too reminscent of the spring bear market in Treasuries when there was fear of a trade war with Japan and a Mexican presidential candidate was assassinated. 
 The 30-year bond dropped 15/32 , to 8627/32 for a yield of 7.35 percent, up from 7.31 percent on Friday. Bills and notes also ended a few basis points higher, with the discount rate on the three- and six-month issues up slightly in the weekly Treasury auction to 4.16 percent and 4.55 percent, respectively.
 
Lifeless Session Seen
 Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist for CS First Boston, described yesterday's market as pretty much a lifeless session. "The market opened lower and spent most of the day bouncing around in a rather narrow range," he said, "with the weak dollar and higher commodity prices having their greatest impact overnight. And that prevented the market from doing better."
Mr. Alexy says today's Consumer Price Index report for May is not expected to help the market since most market participants believe it will indicate that inflation is still something they need to worry about. "The monthly retail sales figures due out today," he added, are expected to show how quick the economy is growing and has implications for Fed behavior."
Analysts said the market was also still under pressure from last week's comments from the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International said the Fed chairman, while acknowledging that inflation indicators like the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index are restrained, emphasized that they are lagging indicators. And the Fed's policy, Mr. Hale said, is forward looking. This means that the Fed is still likely to push short-term interest rates higher in the near future.
Yesterday a Fed governor, Susan Phillips, in Basel, Switzerland, said there were some slight signs of inflationary pressure developing in the economy, particularly in the commodity markets.
Mr. Hale said he believed the "recent talk of a slowdown in consumption to be undermined by June data, which are expected to be stronger." He added: "Last week's strong Johnson Redbook retail report gave a hint on that regard. As long as the economy maintains its forward momentum, another 25-basis-point Fed tightening should be expected out of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting."
 
No Rate Increase Is Expected
 But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen gave a different view yesterday. He told news service reporters that he thinks that the Federal Reserve will not raise its short-term interest rate target when the Fed's policy-making committee meets July 7.
"Interest rates have stabilized for the present anyway," Mr. Bentsen said. "I would not say anything beyond that. The Fed has signaled it reached neutral policy."
As has been the case for months, dealers and some retail accounts, were selling into upticks in the bond market. The market was already struggling with the comments from Fed governor Phillips and the weak dollar, and then commodity prices added to the negative tone.
The Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of 21 commodity prices, rose 2.62, to 235.50, despite prospects for rain in the midwest.
In the corporate bond market, Morgan Stanley & Company will be the sole manager for $500 million of Tennessee Valley Authority power bonds that are expected to be priced today. As far as Morgan Stanley knows, these 50-year bonds will be the first corporate long bonds with a five-year noncall.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Law on Foreign Cartels

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
Contending that United States antitrust laws are no longer adequate for an increasingly global economy, the Justice Department is seeking legislative authority to move against as many as 20 international cartels that are outside the reach of American prosecutors.
Attorney General Janet Reno proposed legislation today that would allow the Justice Department to conduct joint investigations with foreign governments of international price-fixing cartels. United States law already allows joint investigations with foreign governments of criminal and securities cases. 
 Ms. Reno, in an appearance with two senior Congressional Democrats who support such legislation, said the cartels were virtually immune to United States prosecution because incriminating documents were in foreign countries, beyond American subpoenas.
But the bill's prospects in Congress this year are murky because only a few more weeks remain in the legislative session. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees, through which the bill must pass before reaching the floor, are busy with the President's crime bill and may not have time to handle another ambitious measure.
Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, who heads the House Judiciary Committee, and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, joined Ms. Reno in announcing the legislation. They said they would formally introduce the bill later this week or early next week.
But Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on Mr. Metzenbaum's panel, said that while he supported the bill's goal of bringing international range to the nation's antitrust laws, he wanted safeguards in the measure before he would support it. The bill should not allow foreign governments to use joint investigations with the Justice Department to obtain national security information, or to obtain American commercial information and pass it to companies in their home countries, Mr. Thurmond said.
 
Safeguards to Be Added
 Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy, said the final version of the bill would include such safeguards. The United States and other nations would have full discretion in deciding what, if any, information they shared, she said.
Even if the legislation is approved this year, it is likely to take two years to negotiate a series of agreements with foreign governments that would allow each country's law enforcement officials to serve a subpoena in another country, Ms. Bingaman said. Because each nation's officials would have the option of refusing to serve the subpoenas, most requests for foreign assistance would likely come as part of joint investigations.
Speaking at the same news conference as Ms. Reno, Ms. Bingaman said there were at least 10 and possibly 20 cartels that the Justice Department could barely investigate now and where the proposed law would help.
She declined to identify the cartels by country or product, but said the Justice Department had been frustrated in efforts to root out collusion in the international uranium industry because documents were in Scotland, Australia and elsewhere.
Even without the legislation, Ms. Bingaman added, the department would file an international antitrust case within a month involving "a major consumer product."
James F. Rill, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy under President George Bush, said Ms. Bingaman's estimate of up to 20 cartels was plausible. The illegal business alliances are probably as common in Europe as Japan, he added.
Last month the Justice Department settled its first antitrust case in more than a decade involving allegations that a company used monopolistic practices to restrict United States exports. Pilkington P.L.C., a British glassmaker, agreed on May 25 to begin allowing all American licensees of its technology to set up factories abroad. Only one of the licensees had previously had the right to open overseas factories, and it only had that right in certain foreign markets.
The Pilkington case was unusual because a private arbitration proceeding had brought all the crucial documents to the United States before the Justice Department stepped in. In most cases involving international businesses that appear to be colluding, the documents are in foreign countries, Ms. Bingaman said.
In cases like Pilkington, which involve foreign restrictions on United States exports, the Justice Department believes that it has jurisdiction when the foreign company has an American subsidiary, said Diane P. Wood, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy. Many big international companies do business here and have American subsidiaries.
For cases involving conspiracies to raise the price of American imports, the Justice Department can pursue a foreign company if it ships large quantities of goods to the United States, regardless of whether the company has an American subsidiary, Ms. Wood said.

Ben Leaving as Ben & Jerry's Chief

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Ben Cohen, the Ben who helped build Ben & Jerry's into a $140 million company without ever abandoning his blue-jean image, plans to resign as the ice cream company's chief executive.
With the kind of marketing flair that made a household name out of a business begun in an abandoned gas station 16 years ago, the company announced a contest inviting its customers to explain why they should succeed Mr. Cohen. 
 But with a concession to financial reality and at the expense of the social activism for which Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. also became famous, it said it had abandoned its policy that no executive be paid more than seven times the salary of the lowest-paid employee. The company said it knew it would have trouble finding qualified executives who would take the job with that restriction.
Wall Street had expected a change. Ben & Jerry's stock has slumped as competition has increased in the slow-growing superpremium ice cream segment of supermarket sales and as the company has had trouble exploiting expansion opportunities in stores and overseas.
The company, based in Waterbury, Vt., earned $7.2 million on sales of $140.3 million in 1993. Its shares, which are traded over the counter, fell from $32 just over a year ago to $14.75 early this year. They closed at $13.25 yesterday, up 25 cents.
"We have never had an experienced C.E.O. and we have reached the point in our life when we need one," said the 43-year-old Mr. Cohen. He plans to continue as chairman and concentrate on what he called "fun stuff" like product development.
Still, Mr. Cohen's step away from the helm may worry some of the company's fans, who have been attracted not only to its numbingly rich products but also to its longstanding commitments to social activism and taste for outrageous fun.
Both the products and the counterculture corporate style are traceable to the quirks of the bearded Mr. Cohen, a man who taught crafts to emotionally disturbed teen-agers before starting the company, and of Jerry Greenfield, his childhood friend, fellow hippie and co-founder, who is vice chairman but who has been less involved in the business in recent years.
Mr. Cohen said he did not expect a big change in style or social commitment from anyone chosen as his successor.
The company said it was retaining an executive recruiting firm to handle the job search.
Under the company salary policy, Mr. Cohen last year was paid $133,212, the highest at the company, and received no bonus, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"It's a bit sad that they have to abandon the 7-to-1 ratio, because it was a noble experiment at a time when pay disparities are rising," said Joan Bavaria, president of the Franklin Research and Development Corporation, a Boston company that manages investments for clients who have social concerns as well as monetary goals for their funds. "But they will probably always have a more equal pay structure than most and it's a sign of maturity that they can move on."
Ben & Jerry's started as a scoop shop in an old gas station in Burlington, Vt. It has since made headlines for paying Vermont farmers more than market rates for their milk to help support the family-farm economy, for buying nuts from Amazon rainforest tribes, for its extensive environmental programs and for tie-ins with a wide variety of charities through its policy of contributing 7.5 percent of profits to a foundation controlled by employees.
The company also won kudos for its promotional talents, which included developing exotic products and funky names for them, like Cherry Garcia, its popular cherry and chocolate chunk ice cream named after Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead rock band. Recently, the company began a campaign to reach an older audience with television and print ads featuring celebrities like Spike Lee, Pete Seeger, Bobby Seale and Daniel Berrigan.
In the contest announced yesterday, customers are being asked to send a lid from a container of their favorite flavor and a short essay on why they would make a "great C.E.O." The company expects a flood of entries, not so much from people who want the job as from those hoping for the second prize -- membership in its "Ice Cream for Life Club" -- or the honorable-mention T-shirts and "rejection letter suitable for framing."
 
Haagen-Dazs the Chief Rival
 Ben & Jerry's leading competitor, Haagen-Dazs, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., had 53 percent of the $277 million market in grocery stores for premium ice cream in the year ended May 15, compared with 42 percent for Ben & Jerry's, according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based market research firm. But the same survey concluded that Ben & Jerry's was the leader in the faster-growing $130.1 million frozen yogurt segment, with sales of $44 million, up 34 percent for the year, compared with $26.5 million, up 13.9 percent, for Haagen-Dazs.
Mr. Cohen and three other insiders with smaller holdings controlled 47 percent of the company's voting shares as of March 11. How Mr. Cohen, Chuck Lacy, who is president and chief operating officer, and the new chief executive will interact will depend on the strengths of the person chosen, Mr. Cohen said.
"I think we are looking for a rare bird," he said. "I guess there are about five or ten executives who will be interested and have the skills."
The key, Mr. Cohen said, is experience in keeping "everyone aligned and moving in the same direction" as the company grows, a skill he says he is learning but is not good at.
"I haven't found the happy medium between autocratic and laissez-faire," he said.

HEADLINE: Oil-Patch Congressmen Seek Deal With Clinton

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 13

 BODY:
With a Congressional vote on a health care bill still months away, some of the 119 members from the oil patch who plan to meet with President Clinton on Thursday say that breaks for oil producers could sweeten the odds of success in health care.
Some Administration officials have little appetite for any measures that would widen the deficit or raise energy costs, especially since Congress balked at most of the President's energy plans. But the meeting at the White House might offer a preview of the trade-offs members of Congress will demand for their health care votes. 
 The President has already shown himself willing to clinch the sale of his legislative merchandise -- a tax bill, the North American Free Trade Agreement -- by throwing in all manner of incentives. Now, even lawmakers who are inclined to take his side first often state their price.
Domestic oil producers have seized the moment to pursue their campaign for higher exploration and production incentives. They say that oil prices, despite a recent rebound, remain so low that many smaller producers may have no choice but to plug their wells.
In Dallas today, the producers told a Commerce Department panel that production cuts would leave the nation dangerously dependent on imported oil and at risk of another Middle East war.
"How many American lives will be lost next time?' asked Louis W. Powers, a consultant for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, as he played Persian Gulf War footage on a screen above. "Are we willing to allow our economic system to be controlled by the sheiks?'
 
A Sign of Receptiveness
 George Alcorn, the association's chairman, considers the decision by Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, to hold hearings on how oil imports affect national security as a sign of the Administration's increasing receptiveness to his group's views.
Mr. Alcorn says he regrets that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, although a former Senator from Texas, now worries that any favors for the energy industry could slow the economy. "They want to get the President re-elected,' Mr. Alcorn said.
The President's prospects are bound to depend as well on his health care program. Here, the lawmakers with the greatest influence over energy policy say they can be of help.
J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the Senate Energy Committee, has joined two committee members and Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is his powerful House counterpart, in linking the oil and health issues -- "both of which affect the long-term economic security of this nation," they said in a letter to the President earlier this spring.
 
A Strange Alliance
 They propose tax breaks for oil exploration, drilling on the outer continental shelf and production from the smallest, most marginal wells, as well as import taxes on foreign refined oil.
It's an unusual alliance. Mr. Dingell, whose Committee on Energy and Commerce also considers many health care matters, more often opposes subsidies for the energy industry. Senator Johnston and many other oil-patch lawmakers represent conservative states and interests that have been uneasy over the President's initial health care program.
"Socialized medicine," Mr. Alcorn of the oil producers, said. "That's clearly what it is."
Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who also signed the letter, said that Thursday's gathering will also take up what the President can do without going to a Congress already preoccupied with health reform. "That's the 900-pound gorilla,' he said.
The President could reduce royalty charges and liberalize leases on Federal property, on land and offshore, said Mr. Bingaman, who joined 118 other members of Congress in requesting the meeting.

HEADLINE: Jan Tinbergen, Dutch Economist and Nobel Laureate, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Jan Tinbergen, the Dutch economist and Nobel laureate whose technical accomplishments and passion for effective public policy have led some to compare him with John Maynard Keynes, died last Thursday at the age of 91. News of his death was withheld by his family until yesterday to allow his funeral to take place without publicity.
Mr. Tinbergen was trained as a physicist (he received a doctoral degree in the subject from the University of Leyden) but switched to economics in the late 1920's. During the early 1930's he was a professor of development planning at the University of Rotterdam and staff member of the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics, where he applied mathematical techniques from the sciences to the question of why industrial output fluctuated in nonrandom ways -- the classic puzzle of the business cycle. 
 As an adviser to the Social Democrats in the Netherlands, he was co-author of a plan for coping with the unemployment that had swept across Europe with the Great Depression.
 
Econometric Models
 But Mr. Tinbergen first gained prominence with his pioneering efforts to build mathematical models of how whole economies work -- more specifically, how shocks like harvest failures or stock market crashes ricochet through an economy to influence employment, output and inflation. Others had used mathematics to add intellectual rigor to economic theory. But in the view of Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Tinbergen's combination of analytic versatility and good policy judgment" gave him an enormous advantage over most of his contemporaries.
His model of the American economy, produced for the League of Nations in 1938, was the precursor of the giant computer models now used to forecast everything from the size of next year's budget deficit to the exchange rate of the Mexican peso.
In the decade after World War II he served as the director of the Dutch Central Planning Bureau and as a key policy adviser to the country's Social Democrats. Indeed, his reputation as a guru of the democratic left was reportedly so sacrosanct that he was able to broker a wage pact between the Government and the country's militant labor unions that prevented mounting inflation. But he remained a world-class theorist and practitioner as well, helping to transform economics into a true policy science.
One idea generally attributed to Mr. Tinbergen is that governments must have at least as many independent policy instruments as policy targets. For example, if a country wishes to control both the exchange rate of its currency and the rate of economic growth it must use a minimum of two levers -- say, the supply of money and the rate of deficit spending. That notion comes as second nature to the current generation of economists, who were put through their mathematical paces in graduate school. But it was a revelation at the time, an insight that had eluded the greats.
In 1969 Mr. Tinbergen shared the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science with the Norwegian Ragnar Frisch. And while his intellectual force as an economist was by this time largely spent, he remained, in the words of James Tobin of Yale, "a congenital do-gooder," who used his fame and prestige to further the cause of rational economic policy in the third world.
Failure to help impoverished countries, he told an interviewer during his tenure as the chairman of the United Nations Development Planning Committee, would result in "mass unemployment, increasing internal conflicts, disaster." Part of his prescription was a sharp increase in development aid, a fashionable view at the time. But he had the foresight to understand that barriers to imports from the third world were potentially more important obstacles to growth.
The voice of a man whom Mr. Samuelson dubbed a "humanist saint" was not stilled until his last days. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Samuelson reports, he received a letter from the Dutch economist asking him to sign a petition calling for an end to the exploitation of children.
The cause of Mr. Tinberg's death and information about his family were not immediately available.

HEADLINE: Tribes See Jobs Hardship In Tax Ruling

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 13

 BODY:
Indian leaders in New York State said today that a United States Supreme Court decision allowing the state to tax some sales transactions on reservations could devastate Indian-owned smoke shops and gas stations that have become the backbone of some tribal economies.
"I don't think there is any doubt it will cause economic hardship for the Mohawk people," said Joseph D. Gray, a spokesman for the tribal council of the St. Regis Mohawks. "People who in the past have been on public assistance found they could open small smoke shops and make some money." 
 Those Indian businesses have thrived largely because of one major advantage: they did not charge state sales or excise taxes, even though under law they were required to assess those taxes to non-Indian customers. Today's Supreme Court decision upholds a state plan to collect taxes on those sales to non-Indians.
In the last five years, tax-free smoke shops and gasoline stations on the state's 10 Indian reservations have proliferated as state taxes on cigarettes and gasoline have risen sharply, allowing Indian entrepreneurs to undercut non-Indian competitors by larger amounts.
 
A Boon on Reservations
 In that period, state excise taxes rose by 167 percent to 56 cents a pack for cigarettes and by 67 percent to 30 cents a gallon for gasoline. Today, between 100 and 200 Indian businesses routinely sell gasoline for 15 to 20 cents a gallon less and cigarettes for $5 to $8 per carton less than stores just outside their reservations.
That has proven a boon to Indian business owners and created jobs and economic stimulus for hard-pressed reservation economies. But it has siphoned away millions of dollars in business from non-Indian retailers.
"This decision should get us back to where we should be, making money instead of making debts," said Salvatore Aronica, owner of Tubby's Corner Quick Stop just outside a Seneca reservation in western New York.
Barry Snyder, president of the Seneca Nation, said his tribe would consider suing the state for violating treaties if it attempted to implement its taxation plan. "There is nothing in the decision that changes the basic principle of Indian law that treaties are the supreme law of the land," he said.
Ray Halbritter, the elected leader of the Oneida Indians near Rome, said he would seek to negotiate a favorable agreement allowing the state to collect some taxes from sales to non-Indians. But he said that today's ruling could cause protests or encourage black-market sales on other reservations.
"It's just not something the Indian people are going to take," he said.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 13

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation paid $17.4 million in May into its Pacific Horizon Prime Money Market fund to cover losses on securities, some of which were derivatives.
"The amount injected into the fund was equal to the losses realized," John Keane, a spokesman for BankAmerica, said on Saturday. Investors did not lose money, he said. 
 The payment was needed because of the rise in interest rates in March and April, Mr. Keane said. The higher rates prompted many investors, mostly institutions, to take their money out of the fund and put it directly into securities, he said. As a result, the fund had to sell securities at a loss before they matured.
The banking company, based in San Francisco, sold certificates of deposit and other short-term money market assets. The impact on BankAmerica's earnings from the payment will not be material, he added.

HEADLINE: 5 New Yorkers Among MacArthur Recipients

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
Jazz musicians, choreographers, a poet and other artists won half the 20 fellowships awarded yesterday, 5 of them to New Yorkers, by the Mac Arthur Foundation of Chicago. Proportionately, it was the largest group of winners in the arts since the program began 14 years ago. The fellowships have traditionally been dominated by academics and researchers.
Coincidence, not a policy shift from science to culture, decided the choices, said Catharine R. Stimpson, director of the foundation. 
 In addition, 9 of the 20 recipients belong to minority groups, the highest proportion ever, demonstrating further, Ms. Stimpson said, that "creative people come in all sizes, shapes and colors."
The fellowships will range from $235,000 to $375,000 to be paid over five years.
The program was established by the John D. and Catharine T. MacArthur Foundation to free exceptionally gifted individuals from money cares. For the recipients, there are no strings. No reports need to be filed, just an address where checks can be sent. Applications are not accepted; candidates are proposed by 100 anonymous nominators, and the foundation's board selects the recipients.
Among this year's winners are Bill T. Jones, the dancer and choreographer, and Arthur Mitchell, who founded Dance Theater of Harlem and was the first black principal dancer with the New York City Ballet.
Ornette Coleman, the jazz musician and composer who is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in jazz; Anthony Braxton, a musician and pioneering composer who is a professor of African-American music at Wesleyan University, and Sam-Ang Sam, a musician who works to preserve and reinvigorate Khmer performing arts in the United States, were also named fellows.
Prizes went to the poet Adrienne Rich, whose most recent work is "What Is Found There: Notebooks on Poetry and Politics" (Norton, 1993), and to Robert Adams, a photographer of Western landscapes.
Another winner, Willie Reale, a theater arts educator, founded the 52d Street Project in Manhattan, a theater company that puts inner-city children together with professional actors and playwrights to help the youngsters produce their own plays.
Another MacArthur also went to Hugo Morales, the Mexican-born co-founder of Radio Bilingue, one the first bilingual radio stations in the United States. Mr. Morales was also the leading force behind Satelite, a nationwide Spanish-language radio network.
Prof. Faye D. Ginsburg, head of New York University's ethnographic film and video program, also received a prize. Her fieldwork has taken her to Australia to make documentaries about the Aborigines.
Professor Ginsburg said she intended to give part of her award to the Dysautonomia Foundation, which promotes research on a genetic disease of the nervous system. She and her husband, Prof. Fred Myers, head of the university's anthropology department, have a 5-year-old daughter, Samantha, who has the rare disease.
These are the 20 recipients:

HEADLINE: North Korea Courts Confrontation

 BODY:
North Korea moved a step closer to disastrous confrontation with the rest of the world yesterday by announcing its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency and by banning I.A.E.A. inspectors from its territory.
Pyongyang has not yet carried out its threat. Two I.A.E.A. inspectors, along with monitoring cameras, remain at its reactor site, watching recently removed spent fuel that could be transformed into as many as five nuclear bombs. If North Korea does expel the inspectors, it could fatally compromise the Clinton Administration's efforts to resolve the nuclear dispute peacefully. 
 To keep diplomacy alive, the U.S. and its Asian allies must not flinch in the face of this and other North Korean provocations. Instead they should proceed with their plan to ask the U.N. Security Council to enact a sequence of phased sanctions as soon as the Council's five permanent members reach a consensus on how to do it.
North Korea's withdrawal announcement came in response to last Friday's decision by the I.A.E.A. to suspend most international technical assistance to Pyongyang's nuclear program. That I.A.E.A. vote, reflecting frustration at North Korea's breaches of agency monitoring rules, provided a test run for any forthcoming U.N. sanctions resolution. The U.S. was glad to see that China did not try to block I.A.E.A. punishment, raising hope that China will also permit Security Council action.
What is most important for now is not North Korea's announcement of its intentions or even formal withdrawal from the I.A.E.A. After all, North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty a year ago only to "suspend" its withdrawal a few months later. The most urgent requirement is that North Korea allow effective international monitoring of that recently removed spent nuclear fuel. Inspectors must retain necessary access to the storage site. Monitoring cameras must be kept supplied with batteries and film without interruption. That is the surest way to keep North Korea from building new nuclear bombs.
Until now, the main issue between North Korea and the I.A.E.A. has been over collecting evidence bearing on whether North Korea built bombs in the past. Through analysis of spent fuel rods and access to nuclear waste sites, the I.A.E.A. hoped to establish exactly how much plutonium North Korea may have diverted when the reactor was briefly shut down five years ago. The C.I.A. estimates that if North Korea had the necessary technology, that could have been enough for one or two nuclear bombs. On the other hand, it remains possible that the North has not yet built any.
The spent fuel whose monitoring is now at issue contains far more plutonium, perhaps enough for five bombs. North Korea's threat to disrupt monitoring of this new cache of potential bomb fuel, coupled with its warnings of military reprisals against Japan and South Korea, forces the world to think hard about the worst-case possibility: that North Korea is not merely seeking diplomatic concessions but wants to make nuclear weapons and will wage war to protect its ability to do so.
Pyongyang continues to assert that its nuclear program is peaceful and that the whole crisis can be resolved by direct talks with the U.S. But when the Clinton Administration braved domestic criticism to offer such talks, North Korea repeatedly answered with provocations -- "suspending" its adherence to the Nonproliferation Treaty, thwarting I.A.E.A. inspectors, refusing to preserve evidence and now threatening to quit the I.A.E.A.
As the world moves toward sanctions, it cannot afford to abandon diplomacy. The costs of confrontation would be very high. Even without war, sanctions could trigger collapse of the Northern regime, sending millions of refugees over the South Korean and Chinese borders and into Japan.
The U.S. and its allies must try to use the threat of sanctions to push North Korea into a diplomatic solution, while preserving continuous monitoring of that dangerous fuel.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Supping With the Bigot

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The offense of the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. was not simply to invite Louis Farrakhan to a conference of black leaders but to treat Americans as total fools.
Every important argument he makes to defend the invitation, to justify the damage he did to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, is grounded in obvious intellectual, political and moral distortion or demagoguery. 
 Since the N.A.A.C.P. affects black-white relations -- particularly among Americans who want to better them -- non-members as well as members should pay close attention.
The demagoguery is painfully easy to spot.
A white man in an audience asks Mr. Chavis why he invited Louis Farrakhan. Mr. Chavis is prepared. He says he has denounced bigotry. But about the invitation he cries: "The N.A.A.C.P. will not be dictated to."
Mr. Chavis knows better. He knows that peaceful protest or questioning are not dictation but the very right on which the N.A.A.C.P. was founded.
Charging that protest is dictation is the lie that Mr. Farrakhan himself, and his hand-trained bigots, trot out when anybody denounces their hate-mongering. This phony bravery brought applause and Amens from the audience; it always does. It is a terribly old trick -- used by every demagogue to squash opposition.
These are three of Mr. Chavis's other major arguments, repeated endlessly in the press:
1. Inviting Mr. Farrakhan is not endorsing him.
Maybe not, but it is a plain mark of respect and respectability that will increase the standing of Mr. Farrakhan and his clones -- and therefore increase their influence.
2. Mr. Farrakhan attracts more and more young blacks -- exactly the kind of active people the N.A.A.C.P. wants.
There is a phrase for this kind of thing: sickening opportunism.
If Mr. Chavis and the N.A.A.C.P. have any moral status or political value to the U.S., it would be to fight the attraction of Mr. Farrakhan by talking straight to young blacks about the danger of black bigotry to them and their future -- not by endowing the Farrakhans with respectability.
The argument Mr. Chavis uses -- the popularity of the bigot-in-chief -- is the very reason not to invite him. It was the argument used by the German elite when they saw Hitler's popularity, cowered before it and tried to profit from it.
3. The civil rights movement should be redefined to embrace self-help and economic improvement, and Mr. Farrakhan leads the Nation of Islam in that direction.
Once again, it is an old argument used to move toward bigots -- Mussolini's trains running on time, Hitler's rosy-cheeked Nazi youth, the glories of Stalinist production lines. That argument amounted to a statement of the inadequacy of tolerance and democracy -- and respect for leaders who use physical or intellectual brutality for their "achievements."
The invitation did damage inside and outside the N.A.A.C.P. Inside are members who oppose Mr. Chavis and his philosophy and are under heavy pressure for it.
Also, around the country are politicians, intellectuals and other prominent African-Americans who have spoken out against Mr. Farrakhan without counting the consequence, because they detest what he stands for. Inviting him is a slap at the political and racial decency that these men and women represent.
(Among them is Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn. He faces opposition from an African-American who has earned his racist reputation. I hope all his constituents, black and white, rally around Mr. Owens in justice to him and themselves).
When Mr. Chavis extended that invitation to Mr. Farrakhan, his guest brought his baggage with him -- including his suitcase full of threats. He has already pulled out economic holy war -- "in the name of Almighty God," a boycott of American companies that dare reduce or end contributions to the Chavis-led N.A.A.C.P.
But Mr. Chavis gambled the reputation of the N.A.A.C.P. and its political and economic support when he invited Mr. Farrakhan. He knew what he was doing. He lost -- for himself and the N.A.A.C.P.
Now the threats of his guest can deepen the damage but not repair it. That will take the stamina and courage of N.A.A.C.P. members who are fighting both the guest and the director who brought him to the table.

Talking The Talk

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The car radio was saying, "Public awareness is building." I had to deal with an orange traffic light just then, so missed the rest of the bulletin and by the time I'd finished the decision- making process the schmoozemeister had moved on to "dysfunctional families."
"Public awareness is building." "Decision-making process." "Dysfunctional families." Why do people talk like this, especially on radio and television, though also in newspapers, magazines and my very own house, to be honest. 
 In the first place, I don't believe public awareness is building. Maybe it is, but for each piece of evidence suggesting that public awareness is building there is an equal and opposite piece suggesting that public awareness is crumbling.
I suspect there may not even be any public awareness, either building, crumbling or just sitting around passively minding its own business. This is based on observation of the few dozen people I see now and then.
If you want to know what glazed-over eyes look like, ask any of these people about public awareness. These glazed-over eyes, of course, are "only anecdotal evidence," another mess of wordage that's highly fashionable with the big-talk crowd these days.
Economists, I believe, coined "only anecdotal evidence" to shrug off tales of individual human misery that threaten to spoil their statistical pictures of general and abundant happiness.
"Only anecdotal evidence." It is such a depressingly governmental way of voicing contempt for people. Government in all its vastness can no longer visualize each person out here as an individual caught in his own singular anecdote of a life. It can see us only as numbers on statistical printouts.
As I guided the car masterfully through traffic, headed for my laundry-and-dry-cleaning establishment, I chided myself for becoming sentimental about the individual in his struggle against statistical oblivion. I have always been too soft. "Soft-nosed" is what the old hard-nosed, brilliant crowd in Washington called me in the old days. Just recently an obscure journal dismissed me as a tribune of "soft liberalism."
Am I a man or a pillow? This sentimental distaste for being a statistic must be abandoned. I must learn not only to "talk the talk," as street kids say, but also to "walk the walk." Well, I had instinctively talked the talk back there when the traffic light went orange. Had I not thought, "Now I must enter the decision-making process"? I had. And noticing that there was a police car on my rear bumper, I had concluded the decision-making process by declining to floor the gas pedal and, instead, had come to a complete stop.
And who was I to sneer at those who say "Public awareness is building"? Perhaps there really was a fresh set of statistics proving conclusively, at least until the next set of statistics comes in, that public awareness is indeed building.
Could these statistics, I wondered, be collated in the vast Public Awareness Building? And what in the world did "collated" mean anyhow? How do you collate a statistic? Is it done with a digital collater? How many megaherz does it take? How much RAM, ROM, RUM does the typical collation require?
"Steady, man, steady," I cautioned myself as I pulled onto the 2,000-acre Steaming Asphalt Shopping Mall. "You're losing it again, you're letting the old brain slip out of talk-the-talk mode and going irritable, human . . . soft, soft as a feather mattress."
Getting a grip on myself was essential, because any minute now I would have to confront the dry-cleaner. That meant being ready to walk the walk, for he could be an arrogant devil when my white shirt was not ready on time, as it often wasn't when I needed it for a special evening, as I did this day.
I would have to be prepared to give him a good tongue-lashing, make him promise never to fail me again and see him bow with respect for my anger. In short, this was no time for soft nose or soft liberalism. I must be ready to walk the walk.
Stepping from the car, I braced for the encounter by talking the talk and said, sotto voce, "Public awareness is building." Also, "spiritual fulfillment," "raised consciousness," "dysfunctional," "the counterculture" and "gender-neutral."
The dry-cleaner was all smiles. "Your white shirt is ready this time," he said, handing it to me. I accepted it, very unhappily, because I knew it was only anecdotal evidence.

HEADLINE: As Union Negotiations Continue, L.I. Braces for a Railroad Strike

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
With the Long Island Rail Road's biggest union threatening to strike at midnight tonight, the region prepared yesterday for a commuting nightmare as negotiations continued on a contract that could influence deals to come for New York City subway and bus workers.
The United Transportation Union, which represents 2,300 workers, from conductors and bartenders to mechanics and track workers, wants raises of more than 18 percent during four years, about double what management is offering. The railroad is insisting on work-rule changes that it says would improve productivity and cut costs. 
 Last night, both sides were predicting a strike, although Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who controls much of the railroad's financing, said a settlement "doesn't look impossible." If workers walk out, he said he would call on the state's Congressional delegation to push for binding arbitration to end the strike quickly.
Union and management negotiators met late into the night under the auspices of the National Mediation Board.
For the railroad's 107,000 commuters and many New York City employers, the threat of a strike, the first on the railroad since 1987, has led to elaborate plans to avoid spending hours on the expressways. [Page B4.]
But for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent agency of the railroad, the subways and other transportation agencies, the talks, which have been going on for more than two years, are complicated by broader concerns.
M.T.A. officials say the settlement will set a pattern for all of its 64,800 employees, and each additional percentage point increase in wages that it pays, worth $1.3 million for the Long Island Rail Road employees, comes to $30 million if extended to all workers.
Since the railroad gets nearly half its budget from Albany, the dispute presents a challenge for the Governor, who will need the votes of Long Island commuters if he is to be re-elected this fall. But he will also face a conservative Republican opponent who could accuse him of being soft on labor unions if he endorses a generous settlement.
It is also a test for the railroad's president, Charles Hoppe, whose management skills have been questioned since the breakdown of service in a snowstorm early this year, and for Peter Stangl, the chairman of the M.T.A., whose appointment has expired and has not been formally renewed, because of conflicts in Albany between the Governor and the Republican-controlled State Senate.
 
A Challenge for All
 In a personal and financial sense, a strike would be a challenge for all who struggle to get to New York City for work every day, or who employ those strugglers.
"Obviously a prolonged strike is bad for the economy of the city and Long Island, and Long Island's economy doesn't need the blow," said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a transportation expert at the Regional Plan Association, a private civic group.
Transportation officials planning for a strike said that they would suspend road maintenance that was not urgent, extend the hours of operation for bus and car pool lanes, and take other steps to increase transportation capacity in the hours before and after rush hour, but at peak hours, they said, there was nothing they could do.
"The very best thing would be to keep your cars at home," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in a news conference at City Hall yesterday. "The second best is to park them in Queens and come in by public transportation."
"The worst possible thing to do would be to come into Manhattan in a car, and we will be encouraging people not to do that," he said.
 
Congressional Role
 A spokesman for the railroad, Michael Charles, said that agreement had been reached with the union to allow the departure of eight trains after the Knicks-Houston Rockets basketball game on Wednesday night, even if that is after midnight.
But the preparations also had a certain air of temporariness, with the union predicting that if the dispute is not settled quickly, Congress would probably step in to impose a "cooling-off period," which is the way the last strike ended after 11 days. In this dispute, the second of two "cooling-off periods" expires tonight.
The union is subject to the Federal Railway Labor Act, and an act of Congress could force the union back to work. Local Representatives have said they would seek such action in the event of a strike.
With that threat hanging over the union, the M.T.A. is trying to hold the Long Island workers, who are among the highest paid railroad employees in the nation, to the same pattern of raises that the Transit Workers Union agreed to in 1991: 2 percent that year, 2.5 percent in 1992, and 2 percent in 1993.
The subway and bus workers' union, the Transit Workers Union, has 43,700 members and its contract expires on June 30. The United Transportation Union at Metro-North is also negotiating a new contract; it has 4,900 members. In all, the M.T.A. has 56,600 unionized employees.
Management employees received no raises last year or the year before, but a 4 percent increase this year.
 
Work-Rule Changes
 The L.I.R.R. union is asking for wage increases that amount to a total of 18.1 percent; management is offering 9.3 percent. There are also work-rule changes that would save money for management, including being allowed to schedule some workers on Saturday and Sunday who now collect overtime for working those days.
An M.T.A. study found that as of Dec. 31, 1991, when the last contract ended, Long Island Rail Road conductors had a base salary of $46,500: $500 more than those on Metro-North, $4,500 more than PATH and $6,600 more than Amtrak.
But Edward J. Yule, general chairman of the United Transportation Union, emerging from a bargaining session in Melville yesterday afternoon, said, "We can't be saying we're the highest paid people in the railroad industry without noting that we have the highest paid cops, the highest paid schoolteachers and the highest paid phone workers. But we also have the highest-priced 7-Elevens in the country and the highest priced taxes. Everything here on Long Island is higher than anywhere else."
The M.T.A. has promised no increases in subway or suburban railroad fares before July 1995. With favorable trends like increasing ridership and a good labor settlement, that could presumably be pushed further into the future. But it is hard to imagine Metro-North and transit workers getting smaller increases than the Long Island employees.
Nonunion workers will also get increases largely based on what the union gets.
"If costs go up, fares go up and that discourages ridership," said James T. B. Tripp, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups and planners. The goal, he said, should be productivity improvements that would allow expansion of service, and with that, expansion of union jobs.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Philips Seeks Market Share For Its Technological Power

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands

 BODY:
Having pioneered such products as the videocassette recorder, the compact disk and high-definition television, Philips Electronics N.V., Europe's largest electronics maker, has a deserved reputation for technological prowess.
But when it comes to turning that technology into market share and profits, Philips, best known in the United States for its Magnavox, Norelco and Sylvania brand names, has often fallen on its face. Its VCR format never caught on. Its video laser disk was one of the great flops in consumer electronics. Its latest hope, the digital compact cassette, an audio tape with CD-quality sound, is off to a slow start. 
 After several years of trying to revitalize Philips, the Dutch company's aggressive chairman, Jan D. Timmer, has another ambitious but risky target in his sights: the rapidly evolving world of interactive media -- where computers, television, communications, entertainment and information come together -- and particularly the software that combines pictures, sounds and words stored on compact disks for entertainment, educational and business uses.
The company has built a wide range of holdings through Philips Media, its New York-based subsidiary, which is headed by Scott C. Marden, a former investment banker at Bear, Stearns. Set up by the parent company last year, Philips Media encompasses cable television and teletext operations in Europe, stakes in the American video chain Blockbuster Entertainment and in Whittle Communications, the educational media company, and alliances with a variety of entertainment and software companies.
Its initial product for the market, a $399 CD-Interactive player that hooks up to a television set, has generated only lackluster sales so far, although the company insists that sales are growing. Whether CD-Interactive will succeed is a matter of debate within the industry; most analysts think the product will be squeezed out on the high end by personal computers equipped with CD-ROM, and on the low end by video games capable of using compact disks.
But this time Philips seems determined not to fall victim to another format war or to wager everything on the hardware side of the business. Indeed, Philips Media is being built on the premise that no matter which hardware formats catch on, there will be great demand for games, movies, music, educational programs and business-oriented software that runs on compact disks.
By the end of this year, there will be 10 million computers in the United States equipped with CD-ROM, Mr. Marden said. Add in other formats like Philips's own CD-Interactive or similar products being sold or planned by such companies as Atari and Sony, and there are "tremendous opportunities for us to exploit our development of software," Mr. Marden said.
Philips is already selling 200 CD-based titles, ranging from an interactive version of "The Joy of Sex" to games like "Alien Gate" and "Voyeur," movies like "Top Gun," music videos, educational programs and interactive programs used by companies for sales training and in-store promotions. Philips and its partners have 100 more titles in development, and most other big consumer electronics companies are developing similar programs. Philips soon expects to be able to offer such products as the Yellow Pages on CD.
As one of the inventors of the compact disk and as a pioneer in putting music, pictures and data into digital form, Philips has a head start in the development of a CD-based software and interactive media industry.
Philips is no stranger to the software side of the business, either. It owns 75 percent of Polygram N.V., the world's third-largest recording company and an increasingly ambitious producer of movies, including the recent hit "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Polygram is often mentioned as a possible bidder for a Hollywood studio like MGM.
"The industry, broadly defined to include a variety of software as well as new delivery systems, is very large already and presents huge opportunities for sustainable long-term growth," Mr. Marden said. "Philips has a long history of innovative technology that services this emerging business."
Philips Media is just one example of how the parent company has begun expanding its horizons, after years in which its primary goals were to slash employment and inject new energy into a fossilized corporate culture. When Mr. Timmer, the chairman, asked the heads of the parent company's business units at a meeting several years ago to write down the names of their 10 biggest customers, he was horrified but not totally surprised when many could not do so.
 
New Blood Brought In
 Since then Mr. Timmer has brought in new blood -- often non-Dutch blood. For example, Frank P. Carrubba, an American who had been a top executive at I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, joined Philips two years ago to oversee its technology and product development. Today, in a company that was once run almost exclusively by Dutch executives, only four of 13 members of the management board are Dutch.
Needing to slash costs, Mr. Timmer eliminated 22 percent of the company's work force over the last four years, bringing employment down to 238,000 worldwide. Philips pushed responsibility and authority down to the managers of its sprawling operations in lighting, consumer electronics, small appliances, semiconductors and electrical components, telecommunications and medical products. This led to further cost reductions and more aggressive product development and sales efforts.
Philips closed plants and sold assets, notably its 35 percent stake in the Matsushita Electronics Corporation, helping stabilize a precarious financial situation that got worse as its home markets in Europe sank into recession several years ago.
 
'Fundamental Reorganization'
 "This company really had to undergo a fundamental reorganization," said Dudley G. Eustace, the executive vice president and chief financial officer, who was brought in two years ago from British Aerospace.
"We were too fat, and we needed to make our assets work harder," Mr. Eustace said. "The results have started to show through. But you can't cut costs forever without damaging the company, so we have to start reinvesting in the company."
Having seen its profits rebound last year to $1.05 billion from a net loss of $511 million in 1992, Philips is now feeling prepared to act. Analysts expect to see a string of medium-sized acquisitions, or maybe even a few big ones, especially in the fields picked as targets by Philips Media.
"If Philips is to continue to show good earnings growth beyond the next two years or so, it cannot rely on cost cutting alone," Angela Dean, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a recent report. "Organic growth will obviously help drive earnings -- and there are good opportunities for businesses such as lighting, in terms both of fast-growing, added-value products and of strong geographic markets such as China, India and Eastern Europe. But acquisitions are an answer, too, and the media sector, with potentially higher margins and higher growth rates, has obvious attractions."
Analysts said they were still not convinced that Philips had learned the skills needed to make the most of its technology. The poor sales of the digital compact cassette, for example, show "that they still have a learning curve to progress along," said Dennis Exton, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. In that case, he said, Philips misjudged consumers' willingness to pay for yet another music format, especially so soon after the compact disk's introduction.
In interactive media, Mr. Exton said he thought the hardware and software might be ahead of their time for many consumers, and that Philips might be pursuing "too broad a range of applications to enable it to be a success in any one of them."

HEADLINE: For Mexico's Indians, Promises Not Kept

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN TOTOLZINTLA, Mexico

 BODY:
More than 100 Nahua Indians streamed out of the parched, stony villages of central Guerrero State not long ago and marched a dozen days to Mexico City, emboldened by the battle cries of Indian rebels in southern Mexico and hoping to win their own set of Government promises to improve their lives.
Armed only with anger, they occupied the city's heart for several days until President Carlos Salinas de Gortari listened to their complaints about poverty, discrimination and injustice, facts of life for nearly all of Mexico's nine million or so Indians. After Mr. Salinas agreed that something had to be done and promised to meet them again in 60 days, they went home. 
 But like the armed uprising by Maya Indians in Chiapas State, which seized the nation's attention in January, the protest by the Nahua seemed to raise expectations without really changing anything. Life in most villages remains a mixture of dust and racism, made all the more bitter by unfulfilled promises.
"They told us lots of things just to ease the pressure, and we're no longer that important for them," a leader of the march said after Mr. Salinas did not appear at a state congress of Indians in May despite his promise to do so.
In the heat of the Chiapas conflict, Mr. Salinas told all of Mexico's Indians, "We will not abandon you," and promised many things, including paved roads, new schools, health clinics and economic development plans.
Paving was the easy part. The other promises have yet to materialize on any significant scale.
In some respects, it is not surprising that so little has changed for the Indians who rebelled in Chiapas, or for those in Guerrero or anywhere else in Mexico. Oppression of the Indians began as soon as the Spanish landed almost 500 years ago.
What many political analysts find surprising is that so soon after the shock from Chiapas, the Indians -- one in every 10 Mexicans -- can once again be so easily forgotten.
Communiques from the masked rebel leader, Subcommander Marcos, used to be front-page news; some now are printed on the letters page. A package of laws drafted after the uprising began is still months from being passed even though the national legislature is controlled by Mr. Salinas's party.
[On June 11, guerrilla leaders in Chiapas rejected the Government's proposed peace settlement. They offered to reopen talks, but only if the talks address demands for political changes at the national level. Government officials said that despite the rejection, they would keep the promises they made to build roads and other projects in Chiapas, but only in areas outside of rebel control.]
The demands of the Indians are as diverse as their customs, but basically they come down to wanting their share of the Mexican pie. Usually that does not mean jobs so much as passable roads on which to take their corn, beans and coffee to market; hospitals close enough to get to and schools that teach in their own languages; electricity and telephone lines that connect them with the rest of the country, and, as always, the right to a piece of land, without which there is no life for them.
 
Seats of Power Empty of Indians
 For the presidential election in August, Indian concerns have been reduced to a sound bite. As he campaigns, the governing party candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, makes earnest but vague pledges about Indian independence and dignity, yet does not promise to change the land laws that are at the heart of the Chiapas conflict.
Although the revolt galvanized Mexico, Indians do not hold much political sway. All ballots are printed in Spanish, and since many Indians do not speak Spanish, many do not vote. Of those who do, many allow local bosses to tell them how to vote, and this results in huge pluralities for the governing party.
Few Indians are ever elected to positions outside their own small villages. They hold only a handful of federal legislative positions, and the list of candidates for legislative races includes only a few Indians.
In Chumpon, a steamy, ramshackle village carved out of the jungle about 125 miles south of Cancun, Rolando Cen Tun, a descendant of the Maya who built the temples of Chichen Itza and Tulum, slapped his moneyless pockets and said life would go on just as it did before Chiapas rose up in anger because Indians do not even have enough to fight back.
Half a country away in Guerrero, about 100 miles from Acapulco, Indians of San Juan Totolzintla gathered under a small pavilion that offered shade to describe Indian life in Mexico. There were six men, all in their 20's or 30's. Not one had even a peso in his pocket; not one could remember the last time he had eaten meat; all had had family members stricken by cholera in an epidemic two years ago; only one had ever been to a hospital; only one could read.
"I'm more curious about things then my companions," said Anacleto Viegas Dimas, 37, who was one of those who marched to Mexico City in February. Learning Spanish and spending time with political organizers may have changed the way he sees the world, but his experience of life, his anger and his despair equal his friends'.
"They brought this here from outside," he said, rapping a huge church bell that hangs from the timbers of the pavilion. The bell is dated 1736, and was brought in by Augustinian missionaries who added "San Juan" to the village's Indian name.
"They tried to change our religion with this, they tried to change everything we had," he said. "But we were already here long, long before they came."
 
Land Transformed, But Not Their Lives
 Before the outsiders showed up, a fragile island in Mexico's distant corner was the whole world for a Maya fisherman named Gabuch. Life there meant caring for the stone monuments of his ancestors and gathering a Caribbean harvest so bountiful that even his dog ate lobster.
Now 51, Gabuch still lives on the island. His one-room hut is still without water, electricity or telephone but now it is surrounded by the luxury hotels that have turned his paradise into the glossy resort called Cancun.
Wherever they live, Mexico's Indians have seen their country transformed and, like Gabuch, most have watched progress pass them by.
"I knew this beach from when I was a child," he said. "Now I'm one of the forgotten ones."
Gabuch's situation represents what many Indians say is the same basic problem, which is not poverty but rather Mexico's inability to treat the Indians as an integral part of society, to honor their traditions without ignoring their hardships.
It is said that Mexico loves its Indians, so long as they are dead. Mexico builds proud monuments to Aztec warriors and strives to protect ancient ruins (now big tourist attractions), but the largest single concentration of Indians in the country lives on Mexico City's streets or sleeps in its doorways, selling 35-cent boxes of gum at street corners or knocking on the windows of stopped cars, palms turned up to beg.
If the rest of Mexican society seems to have trouble connecting today's Indians with the glorious past, so too do the Indians.
"The colonial period was very brutal," said Arturo Warman, former head of the National Indigenous Institute and now in charge of settling rural land disputes. "For the Indians to have maintained any connection with their past was in effect to have put their lives in danger."
As bad as is the discrimination in Mexico City, Mr. Warman said, it is often worse in the provinces. As late as the 1950's, Indians in San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas were expected to step off the narrow sidewalks when a white person came by. They still hold no political or economic positions in the city, although they are present on every street and in every market.
 
Language Barrier As High as Ever

At Totolzintla, in sight of a multimillion-dollar bridge on the just-opened superhighway to Acapulco, a dozen Nahua Indians in the town's primary school gather haphazardly under an awning. A pile of sticks serves as a desk, and they try to read a textbook written in Spanish, which most do not understand. The lesson on this day is the heroes of Mexico, including the Indian President, Benito Juarez, but not much is getting through.
"What good does it do for me to have a teaching certificate and to try to teach these kids anything if I only speak Spanish and they only understand Mexicano?" asked Vicente Cabrera Alonzo, 28, whose chair is a tin container. He used the term "Mexicano" to mean Nahuatl, the ancient idiom of the Aztecs and the language Emiliano Zapata used to win the loyalty of his revolutionary followers. About 1.4 million Indians speak Nahuatl, more than speak any other of Mexico's 56 Indian languages.
[President Salinas recently presented new textbooks written in 20 indigenous languages and 6 dialects that will be used by 170,000 Indian schoolchildren next year. The others will continue to use Spanish books.]
 
A Hunger for Justice Goes Unmet
 Mexican leaders have lamented the deficiencies and injustices Indians face. Years before Chiapas erupted, President Salinas said that erasing the inequities must be a priority.
In January 1992 the Mexican legislature approved a constitutional amendment that for the first time recognized Mexico's pluralism and acknowledged the right of Indians to their own culture and language. For some Indians, the measure was too ambiguous and too late.
"To be an Indian in Mexico is to be a human being without rights," said Marcelino Diaz de Jesus, a leader of the Nahua Indians of Guerrero. "I think it is that simple. Even a human being without rights struggles with ancestral hunger -- not a material hunger for what you eat, but a hunger for justice. This is what the Indians of Chiapas have shouted to the world."
Mr. Diaz de Jesus is unusual in that he is a Nahua who has attended a university. Last year he won a MacArthur Foundation leadership award, which helps him work with the Indians who live in the raw villages along the Balsas River. They all know his name and use it to exert authority and sway opinion almost as readily as they use the name of Subcommander Marcos.
Mr. Diaz de Jesus was one of those who marched to Mexico City. He met with Mr. Salinas and heard the President promise to respond to the demands in 60 days.
The President's word was enough for the Indians to believe that when they held their annual congress 60 days later in Guerrero, he would be there. After Chiapas, they reasoned, they would at least be listened to. But by the time the congress ended, neither the President nor anyone from his office had come.
That has not been the only disappointment. After Chiapas exploded, Mr. Salinas set up a national commission for the development of the Indian people, which held hearings across the country. A resulting package of legislative reforms is still months from being considered.
Many Indians never really expected much to change after Chiapas. Too much time had passed, too many demands were unfulfilled, too many complaints had gone unheard. To those like Juan Bautista Tux Ku, those with the most hardened eyes and the least ready smiles, it was clear that the bark of a rifle may be the only sound that is heard, but even violence is not an option for most.
Recently he was encountered on the long sandy road leading to Chumpon with a rifle over his shoulder.
"A rifle is all that counts, but look at what we have," he said, showing how his ancient firearm, used for hunting, was held together with an automobile hose clamp and a bent nail. "We are poor. Where are we going to find the arms to rise up?" Every shell is an expense. Every missed shot, a step closer to starvation.
"When it comes to us," he said, leaning on his rusty bicycle, gazing toward the sea, "the country just ends."

HEADLINE: An End to Welfare?

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
For all its complexity, the welfare plan that President Clinton put forward today will be judged by one, seemingly simple standard: Does it deliver on his famous pledge "to end welfare as we know it"?
He has reasons to argue that it does. The President has proposed a set of work requirements far stricter than those advocated by his predecessors, and penalties that are far more severe. When his program is fully in place, women who refuse to join a work program will get no more money. Period. 
 But it is less certain whether Mr. Clinton's program will satisfy the expectation of fundamental change that his own, insistently bold language has helped create, and that his political opponents are eager to exploit.
Republicans moved quickly today to denounce the plan, with its slow phase-in, as tepid and small, a defense of welfare rather than an end to it. "Tinkering," said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin.
 
Stealing the Welfare Issue
 But their fervor may reflect a fear that the President is stealing the issue. Though Congress is unlikely to act in the time left this year, Mr. Clinton's plan would bring the most significant change since the program began in the New Deal.
"This plan is a step toward ending the current welfare system," said Judith Gueron, president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a New York firm that evaluates welfare programs. "It's not as large a step as was promised, or as the public anticipates. But greater change would require spending a lot more money."
Mr. Clinton's plan would primarily affect women and children, the 14.3 million who receive monthly checks from Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Its rules would not apply to the mix of state welfare programs that cover single men and women or people with disabilities.
The President's plan would give recipients additional training, but would require those still on the rolls after two years to join a work program. For those who had not found jobs on their own, the programs would offer subsidized jobs at the minimum wage, whether with private employers, governments or nonprofit groups. For the public, the first surprise may be that the Clinton plan, like all work programs, would cost more than the status quo.
 
Expensive Phase-In Program
 It would spend $9.3 billion over five years on training, child care and job subsidies, and even that sum buys a phase-in so gradual that by 1999, only about 8 percent of the nation's welfare recipients will be working for their benefits.
And while the documents made public today do not say so, the plan is expected to cost more than twice as much in the second five years. An impatient public, recognizing little change, might balk at the bill before the program ever hits its stride. If the Government does not have the money to create the subsidized jobs, it could not enforce the two-year limit.
Beyond the pace at which it takes effect, Mr. Clinton's plan raises a more fundamental question: just how many of the nation's five million welfare families can really support themselves in the private economy?
The President took pains today to highlight success stories, standing beside a woman who had left public assistance for a clerk's job in the same Kansas City bank that once employed Harry S. Truman.
 
Marginal Impact of Training
 Mr. Clinton is betting that he can create more successes, especially if health care passes, since many women stay on welfare simply to get medical care for their children. "We ought to be able to do this in every community in the country," he said.
But many welfare mothers have woefully few skills, and research shows that even the best training programs only marginally trim the welfare rolls. If Mr. Clinton intends to make all welfare recipients work he may have to place many of them in a subsidized work program and endure the criticisms of cost and waste that government job programs attract.
With all the talk of "ending welfare," there has been little discussion of a related issue: ending poverty. The two are not the same.
The President hopes to tackle both problems, in part by providing health care and expanded tax credits to welfare mothers who go to work. He is also trying to collect more child support payments from absent fathers, so that one parent will not have to do the financial work of two.
And he is trying to fight poverty by deterring the soaring rate of out-of-wedlock births. The time limit is meant to supply one deterrent, by making welfare less attractive.
Mr. Clinton is supplementing that effort with a crusade against teen-age pregnancy that features grants to 1,000 schools and his own invocations to form stable families. "Governments don't raise children, people do," he said.
 
Praise From Moynihan
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton's strong remarks today about out-of-wedlock births pleased one of his critics, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chastised the President earlier this year for dragging his feet.
"He's the first President in our history to have the courage and nobility to address the problem of out-of-wedlock birth," Mr. Moynihan said. The Senator has criticized time limits, but he was so pleased to hear the President talk about family breakdown that he vowed to co-sponsor the bill in the Senate.
Still, it is possible that the plan would leave the nation with more poor people, rather than fewer. The average mother with two children now receives cash payments of about $380 a month. Mr. Clinton's proposal does not raise that amount, and for some families it could lessen it.
For example, he would allow states to deny increased payments to families that have additional children. The difference is about $60 a month -- not much to many Americans, but a lot to those facing hunger or eviction.
The work program that Mr. Clinton proposes would impose tough penalties on women who refuse to join the program: cutting off all cash to the family for at least six months.
In a confidential memorandum last March, Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledged "the danger that in rare circumstances families will find themselves homeless or unable to care for their children."
There are also antipoverty implications in the President's financing strategy. About $7 billion of the $9.3 billion he would spend comes from cuts in other programs for the poor, including those now serving indigent immigrants and addicts.
While many Republicans were accusing Mr. Clinton today of sham reform, the differences between their proposals is less dramatic than their rhetoric. A bill sponsored by 163 House Republicans would also impose a two-year limit on benefits and place recipients in a work program.
 
Some Important Differences
 The Republicans would implement their program faster and finance it by cutting deeper into programs for immigrants. And after welfare recipients had spent three years in the work program, the Republicans would allow states to drop them altogether, leaving some families neither benefits nor a subsidized job, on the optimistic assumption that they will somehow manage.
Mr. Clinton, by contrast, has guaranteed a work program spot for all recipients, as long as they demonstrate they are genuinely seeking private work.
As it happened, Mr. Clinton made his announcement on the same day that Ms. Gueron made public a new study of what is often described as the nation's most successful welfare training program, in Riverside, Calif.
Three years after joining the program, participants were earning 40 percent more than a similar group of women who received no training. Still, their average earnings remained quite low -- less than $3,600 a year. And 41 percent of those who had entered the program were still on the rolls three years later.
What does that suggest for a two-year limit? "You'd have to have a very large, expensive work program at the end," Ms. Gueron said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Seek Voluntary Curbs on North Korean Arms Deals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration decided today to seek a voluntary embargo on North Korean arms purchases and sales as part of its initial set of sanctions, American officials said today.
The effectiveness of a voluntary arms embargo against North Korea, which has become a worrisome exporter of weapons in recent years, has been vigorously debated within the Administration. But with the North continuing to defy international monitors and the Clinton Administration under fire from Congressional critics for its handling of North Korean issues, top Administration officials agreed at a White House meeting today to propose the arms trade ban. 
 The arms embargo is to be included in a proposed sanctions resolution that Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate to the United Nations, plans to circulate to members of the United Nations Security Council in the next day or two.
While the arms measure would strengthen the initial package of sanctions Washington is proposing, officials acknowledged that the Clinton Administration was keeping to its basic plan of delaying any move to impose strict economic sanctions, like a cutoff in the millions of dollars that Koreans living in Japan send to North Korea and an oil embargo.
Those tough measures would be held in reserve in an effort to deter the North Koreans from abandoning all constraints on its nuclear program, withdrawing entirely from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and beginning to process the spent fuel from the reactor to make plutonium for nuclear weapons.
Or as a State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, put it today, the Clinton Administration intends to proceed with its "phased-in approach" on economic sanctions. "It would address not only the past actions and behavior of the D.P.R.K. but it would also be designed to provide leverage for future possible actions by the North," Mr. McCurry added.
The White House meeting today on North Korea included Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry, Gen. John M. Shalikasvili and Ms. Albright.
It took place against the backdrop of rising concern over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and its continued defiance of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
North Korea alarmed American officials on Monday when it said it would withdraw from the agency and said the agency's inspectors would no longer be allowed inside the country. The agency had decided to cut off $250,000 in technical assistance after North Korea destroyed evidence of its past plutonium production.
The North Korean announcement, which it reaffirmed today in an official notice to the Clinton Administration, increased fears that the North Koreans would be able to begin producing additional plutonium without international monitoring.
But North Korea also has yet to follow through on its threat to expel the inspectors and allowed the monitors to do their routine checks at the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon today.
But the White House has also warned that Washington would consider pushing for quicker implementation of tough economic sanctions if North Korea evicted the inspectors.
Arms sales have become an important source of income for North Korea. The ballistic missiles North Korea has sold to Syria and Iran have also contributed to Mideast tensions.
Pentagon officials, who have favored a go-slow approach on sanctions, support the voluntary arms embargo to deter nations from buying and selling arms to North Korea.
But some Administration officials have been concerned that the voluntary arms embargo might become an empty gesture and undercut the credibility of American sanctions policy.
The embargo would not be enforced by a blockade. Instead, the Security Council would urge countries to obey it. And Administration officials say it is unlikely that Iran and some other countries would comply.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Other Countries to Help Resettle Haitian Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Worried that a flood of Haitian boat people will create major political and economic problems, the Clinton Administration is urging other countries to help resettle Haitians who are granted asylum.
So far only a few positive responses have been received, but Administration officials say they hope other countries will accept at least 5,000 Haitian refugees -- a figure some refugee groups say is far too optimistic. Last year, the United States accepted 1,700. 
 Expecting Florida and other states to be unhappy about accepting more Haitian refugees, Administration officials say their efforts demonstrate that they are doing their best to spread the burden.
 
Internationalizing Relocation
 "We want to internationalize the resettlement process," a senior official said. "We hope a large share will be taken by other countries."
Many Administration officials expect a surge in emigration once the United States begins interviewing Haitian boat people, probably this week, on a 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship anchored off Jamaica.
Some predict that about 2,000 Haitians a week will be interviewed aboard the ship, far more than the average number of Haitians, 130, that the Coast Guard intercepted at sea each week in the first five months of this year.
Administration officials discussed resettlement with other countries in the hemisphere last week in Brazil at an Organization of American States meeting.
Canada is one of the few countries to suggest that it is prepared to resettle some Haitians. One official predicted that countries with a tradition of accepting refugees, including France, Venezuela, New Zealand and Australia, were strong candidates for resettling Haitians.
The United States has asked the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees to help it find other countries to accept Haitians.
After more than a week of wrangling, the Administration and the High Commissioner agreed last weekend on procedures for processing Haitian boat people that include giving them a very limited appeal process.
 
Interviews on Shipboard
 The Haitians are to be interviewed after Coast Guard vessels intercept them on the high seas and take them to the Navy ship anchored in Kingston harbor. The boat people will be given an opportunity to rest and receive medical attention before their interviews.
Concerned that many applicants would be rejected without thorough consideration of their claims, the High Commissioner pressed the Administration to grant an appeal process. The appeal will be a limited one in which Haitians can add information to their files after the interviewer informs them that their claims will be rejected.
Then a "quality assurance officer" from the Immigration and Naturalization Service will review the file and decide whether further discussion with the applicant is appropriate. Representatives of the High Commissioner can review applications and counsel Haitians to add information. The quality assurance officer will then make a final determination.
Haitians who are rejected will be sent back to Haiti within a few days. If accepted, they will be resettled in the United States or in other countries.
Advocates of Haitian refugees attacked the planned screening procedures today, especially the limited appeal process.
 
'A Very Meager Process'
 "It's probably a misnomer to call it an appeal," said Arthur Helton, director of migration programs for the Open Society Institute. "There is an effort to portray this as an extraordinarily generous arrangement. In my view, it's a very meager process in terms of procedural safeguards."
Many lawyers for Haitian refugees complain that the procedures neither allow the Haitians to have counsel nor give them time to assemble documents or witnesses.
In a letter to State Department officials, Kosi Asomani, the High Commissioner's special envoy for Haiti, did not hide his ambivalence about the agreement, saying he hoped that the procedures would be reviewed once land-based processing began.
The Administration plans in several weeks to begin land-based processing of Haitians in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.
One signal that worries lawyers for Haitian refugees is that some Administration officials predict that the percentage of Haitian boat people who are granted refugee status will not be much higher than the 5 percent who have been accepted in the last year.

HEADLINE: Under More Ethical Scrutiny, Many Senators Curbed Perks

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Senators still traveled the world in 1993, but many of them held down the number of trips during a period of ethical scrutiny, financial disclosure reports showed today.
Trips financed by outside groups were not the only perk substantially down from past years. With all speakings fees required to go to charity, many senators reduced their number of speeches to special interests. 
 Some senators were more meticulous than ever in providing details in the annual disclosure forms.
For instance, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted on his disclosure that he and his wife "drove to Syracuse at their own expense" so he could address his 1968 Syracuse University law school classmates.
Mr. Biden's only assets were six life insurance policies worth $1,001 to $15,000 and a Senate credit union account worth less than $1,001.
Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, noted that he had received $20,000 from Tri-Star International Creative Management in Los Angeles for a script he is writing. In addition, he will receive $5,000 when the script is completed.
Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, listed only one asset valued at more than $1,000 -- a Senate credit union account worth $5,000 to $15,001.
Some senators are multimillionaires, but others have little beyond their $133,600 Senate salaries. Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, has several investments of more than $1 million. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has two blind trusts, each worth more than $1 million.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said on his form, "I do not accept honoraria, nor do I have payments made to charitable organizations in lieu of honoraria."
But Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, took a half-dozen trips last year, including trips to Boca Raton, Fla., and Toronto. She also earned $616 for charity with an appearance on the Arsenio Hall television show.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, made seven trips, including one to Switzerland for an economic conference and another to Tokyo for an international environmental conference.

HEADLINE: Croatian Leader Tours Sarajevo on Behalf of Bosnia Federation

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 14

 BODY:
Once reviled in this ravaged city, Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, visited Sarajevo today for the first time in the 26-month war to discuss a nascent Bosnian federation of Muslims and Croats allied to his country.
"We are at the end of the tragedy that this city and the Muslim nation, and together with it the Croatian nation, had to experience," Mr. Tudjman said as he formally dedicated a new Croatian Embassy here. 
 Just five months ago, Mr. Tudjman stood behind the Croatian nationalists fighting Bosnia and Herzegovina's Muslim-led Government. Since then Muslims and Croats have joined in an alliance against the Serbs, who have captured 70 percent of Bosnia since the war began in April 1992.
After meeting with Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, Mr. Tudjman strolled on Sarajevo's main downtown street under heavy security to the embassy, shaking hands with pedestrians as some shouted in approval and others jeered.
Dedicating the embassy, he said his trip was "proof of our support for the Croat-Muslim federation as well as the formation of a future confederation with Croatia." Mr. Tudjman's visit came on the eve of a scheduled parliamentary session in which Croatian and Muslim leaders are to fill positions in the Government.
The Parliament has already approved a constitution and linked Muslim and Croatian military commands. But Western diplomats lament the lack of progress in organizing the federation, especially on the local level.
In most areas of Bosnia with mixed populations of Muslims and Croats, often antagonistic local administrations are still in place. Restrictions still prevent refugees in divided areas from returning to homes in areas controlled by the other side.
Fierce fighting between the Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia claimed thousands of lives and uprooted tens of thousands of people before the United States and Roman Catholic clerics persuaded Mr. Tudjman early this year to replace the nationalist Croatian leader, Mate Boban, and agree to form a federation.
Today local radio reports described renewed clashes between Croatian and mostly Muslim Bosnian Army forces near the western town of Mostar as well as fighting that has pitted Muslim against Muslim in a pocket of Muslim separatists near the northwestern town of Bihac.
The fighting is marring a four-week cease-fire that took effect in Bosnia on Friday. Still, clashes in the country have sharply declined overall since last week, the United Nations military command says.
Some analysts say the Bosnian Government Army and the Croatian militia are using the one-month respite to stock arsenals, and several are predicting a surge in fighting against the Serbs this fall.
Bosnian Government officials openly admit they are buying weapons from the Croatian militia in Bosnia, which is supplied by Croatia's Army, and obtaining arms shipped by Muslim countries through Croatian ports and airports. The United Nations has maintained an arms embargo against countries of the former Yugoslavia since September 1991.
A joint statement issued by Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Izetbegovic indicated that the mostly Muslim Bosnian Government has pledged to help Croatia form economic ties with Islamic countries in exchange for economic cooperation from Croatia, including the use of ports, roads, railroads and telecommunications links.
Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Izetbegovic, who once made little effort to hide their mutual dislike, also agreed today to form embassies with mixed delegations and other diplomatic missions for Croatia and Bosnia.
Mr. Tudjman and his retinue, which included at least one former Croatian commander condemned as a war criminal, flew later by helicopter to Vitez and Busovaca in central Bosnia for meetings with Croatian political and military leaders.

HEADLINE: Centrist Presidential Hopeful in Brazil Trips on Racial Remark

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 13

 BODY:
Wearing a monogrammed shirt that recalled his days teaching at the Sorbonne, the Brazilian presidential candidate gamely posed for photos astride a peasant's donkey.
Responding to a Brazilian reporter who asked if he was the country's "great white hope," Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who seems white to most observers, responded hotly, "I really am mulatto." 
 "I have one foot in the kitchen," Mr. Cardoso continued, using an archaic phrase that refers to Brazil's long history of sexual liaisons between members of the European elite and their household servants, largely of African descent.
In the ensuing uproar, black rights leaders denounced the candidate as racist and newspaper cartoonists painted him brown and depicted him walking with one foot in a cooking pot.
With less than four months to go until the Oct. 3 presidential election, a series of stumbles are frustrating Mr. Cardoso's ambitions of becoming the centrist candidate capable of defeating Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Three opinion polls taken in recent weeks show Mr. Cardoso, a former Economy Minister, stalled in second place with 17 percent of voter preferences. In first place, Mr. Silva, candidate of the Workers Party, enjoyed support ranging from 35 to 40 percent.
Jose Sarney, a former President with a keen eye for discerning power flows, commented on the polls, "There is no human force in the world capable of keeping Lula from winning these elections."
In retort, members of Mr. Cardoso's fractious center-right coalition argue that today's polls are largely irrelevant.
Next Friday, the monthlong World Cup soccer championship is to start in the United States, and Brazil is expected to go on a monthlong political siesta. Then, in August, free political advertising starts on television.
In the 1989 presidential campaign, a few weeks of television exposure was enough to raise Mr. da Silva from 5 percent of opinion preferences to 40 percent. This time, to sabotage the leftist candidacy, Congress has passed a law restricting television advertising to candidates talking in studios.
Mr. Cardoso's goal is to deny his socialist opponent a majority victory in October, forcing a runoff on Nov. 15. To do this, his backers have adapted a two-pronged strategy -- heavy campaign spending and close identification with a new economic plan.
According to campaign budget estimates filed last week, Mr. Cardoso's coalition plans to outspend the Workers Party by more than a 2 to 1 ratio -- $75 million to $30 million.
In the economic plan, Brazil is to change currencies on July 1, selling reserves to maintain parity between the dollar and the new currency, the real.
Several months of low inflation and of greater buying power are supposed to make Brazilian voters forget that prices have risen by 4,000 percent over the last 12 months and that today's per capita income is slightly less than the level of 1985.
Possibly spoiling this strategy, Brazilian voters increasingly seem to be "vaccinated" against pre-election "miracle" plans, political scientists here warn.
For his part, Mr. da Silva has steadily repositioned himself closer to Brazil's political center.
"I'm going to fight for foreign investment to come to this country," the former trade union leader bellowed at a public rally in Sao Paulo on Sunday.
Last week, the Workers Party approved a "Lula Brasil" campaign symbol that drastically reduces the use of socialist red. For use on T-shirts, flags and bumper stickers, the new symbol prominently features the green, blue and yellow colors of Brazil's flag.
Further bolstering Mr. da Silva's centrist, presidential image, Mr. Sarney, the former President, hinted last week that he might endorse the Workers Party candidate.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Picks Up Support From Rally in U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed yesterday against leading currencies, rebounding from early losses after the American bond market rallied on a report showing that inflation remained subdued.
"The rally in bonds gave the dollar some support," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "When there's demand for Treasury bonds, there's demand for dollars." 
 In late trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6470 German marks, up from 1.6455 marks Monday. It had dropped as low as 1.6412 marks before bonds advanced.
 Bond prices rallied after the Labor Department said consumer prices rose two-tenths of a percentage point in May. The report suggested that the economic recovery would not overheat and fuel inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
"If bonds had tanked, the dollar would have been in real trouble," said Win Thin, an economist at MCM Currency Watch, a market consulting firm.
The dollar fell in European trading amid growing speculation that central bankers in Germany and Japan were under less pressure to lower interest rates now that their countries' economies were showing signs of picking up. At the same time, fewer traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon given the mounting evidence that economic growth may be slowing. Higher rates and economic performance tend to bolster the value of a country's currency.
Speculation that the Treasury might call on the Fed and other central banks to buy dollars also kept the American currency from falling further yesterday, traders said. Based on yesterday's exchange rates against the mark, the dollar is below the levels at which the Fed and 18 other central banks teamed up to buy dollars on May 4.
The dollar fell slightly against the yen yesterday. The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 102.78 yen, down from 102.90 yen.
Tensions between the United States and North Korea have not helped the dollar against the yen, traders said, because many investors are skeptical of President Clinton's ability to handle the conflict. Investors often buy dollars as a haven during international crises. But many are now buying Swiss francs instead because of that country's policy of neutrality.
In other trading, the British pound was quoted at $1.5195 late yesterday, down from $1.5215 late Monday. The dollar fell to 5.6040 French francs from 5.6125 francs and rose to 1,597 Italian lire from 1,594 lire.

HEADLINE: New Law Against Age Bias on Campus Clogs Academic Pipeline, Critics Say

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The historian Richard Pipes, who will turn 70 next month, can go on teaching at Harvard University for the rest of his life if he so chooses. But his departmental colleague Bernard Bailyn was obligated to retire last year, after his own 70th birthday.
The two professors saw the later stages of their working lives take such contrary directions not because of differences in their performances at Harvard -- both are highly regarded in their field -- but because of a new Federal law that took effect in January prohibiting mandatory retirement on the basis of age for tenured faculty members. 
 Since the new law has given professors like Mr. Pipes far more control over how and when to retire, many are now continuing to teach after the age of 70. And that, critics of the new arrangement say, is just the trouble: they fear not only the prospect of graying faculties teaching from yellowing notes but also the possibility that young academicians will be blocked from advancement in an already tight job market.
 
Some Unintended Effects
 "Clear the deck," said Cheryl Rock, 40, an assistant professor of human nutrition at the University of Michigan, who opposes the elimination of mandatory retirement. "The old professors are holding back the university."
Oscar Handlin, 78, an emeritus professor of history at Harvard, agrees. "The new law clogs the arteries," said Professor Handlin, who has published five books since his retirement eight years ago. "It won't allow young people to move in."
Moreover, Thomas Bisson, chairman of the department of history at Harvard, said that although the new law, an amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, had been intended to eliminate age bias, it was having the reverse effect: deans and department chairmen, he said, are now reluctant to hire elderly job candidates for fear that they might later cling to their jobs.
And attempts to remedy the situation by creating inducements to voluntary retirement have created unforeseen problems of their own.
 
Studies on Consequences
 While most academic administrators say it is still too soon to know how the new arrangement will ultimately affect faculties, there has been plenty of time for colleges and universities to contemplate the possible consequences.
In 1991, a National Research Council committee concluded that a high proportion of faculty members at the nation's elite research institutions would choose to work past the age of 70 because they found the life congenial and their work stimulating. (The panel also reported that there was little evidence that scholarly ability diminished with age. But Saunders MacLane, an 84-year-old emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago, challenged that claim. The research council's study, he argued, did not take into account the experience of professors past 70 because under previous retirement practices, few such faculty members existed.)
A second study on the possible effect of eliminating mandatory retirement -- this one conducted in 1991 by Stephen Stigler, a professor of statistics at the University of Chicago -- suggested that the top-tier research universities would not be alone in retaining an elderly faculty.
"We studied not only the elite private universities like Columbia, Stanford and the University of Chicago, but also public institutions like the University of Michigan and California State University at San Diego, and we found no significant differences in the rate of departure," Professor Stigler said. "We projected that by the year 2000, 10 percent of the faculty at all of these institutions will be above the age of 70. What's troublesome is not that they will be undesirable but our inability to hire young faculty at that point."
Some administrators do worry about the quality of teaching with an older faculty. Jeremy Knowles, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard and a former professor of molecular biology, said the loss of ability to teach with increasing age was most pronounced in the sciences. "Methodological changes tend to be much more rapid in the sciences than in the humanities," he said, "and that gets increasingly difficult to keep up with as the years go by."
 
Inducements to Retirement
 To guard against being overrun with elderly professors, a number of research institutions recently began to take steps to make retirement more attractive.
"We don't say 'retired' anymore; we say 'emeritus status,' " Dean Knowles said. "We've done things to make the transition less like dropping off the end of the earth. For example, some emeriti may be asked to teach freshman seminars."
Because of a separate economic trend, however, incentives for retirement are nothing new, and they are a mixed blessing. Decreasing appropriations from financially beleaguered state legislatures have prompted some public colleges and universities -- notably the University of California at Berkeley and several New England schools -- to use well-funded pension plans to finance buyouts of senior professors and thus help lift the burden of large, perhaps too large, faculties.
For several years, these institutions have been encouraging senior professors to retire, because in many cases the buyouts and subsequent pension payments are financed by budgets separate from those that finance university operations; the schools are thus provided substantial savings.
Many professors responding to the early-retirement incentives have left their institutions in random patterns. That has frequently disrupted the curriculum. Moreover, relatively few openings have been created for younger teachers, because the incentives were conceived not to make way for a new generation but to reduce overall faculty size with the aim of trimming budgets.
 
A Flight of Faculty
 Since these buyouts must be offered across the board, there is no telling which faculty members will take them. As a result, some departments have been battered. Berkeley has lost 28 percent of its faculty over the last three years, prompting Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien "to lay down on the tracks," as he puts it, in an effort to curb the practice.
Bruce Stave, chairman of the department of history at the University of Connecticut, said the State Assembly "created havoc in 1992 because it offered golden handshakes but refused to authorize replacements."
"This year is also very hard for us," he said, "with 4 retirees in a department of 31."
Some educators look upon this wave of retirements approvingly, regarding the windfalls as being well deserved by dedicated and hard-working teachers.
Neil Smelser, 63, a widely published sociologist at Berkeley, will double his salary in September, when he retires from the university at full pay and starts work as the director of the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. "It should happen to everyone!" he said.
Others see the phenomenon more ominously. "The Smelser case," said Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the American Association of University Professors, "is an example of a hard-pressed public university losing someone of great quality to a private institution. That's a matter of concern."
Some observers of higher education express surprise that there has been no widespread protest against the new law by the young faculty members who are sure to be thwarted by it. Interviews with a number of college and university teachers in their 20's and 30's suggest that many see the long-range benefits to themselves as outweighing the short-range cost.
Daniel Gordon, 33, an assistant professor of history at Harvard, spoke for many in his generation when he said: "It takes so long to get a Ph.D. these days -- 10 years at Columbia or Berkeley -- that people in the humanities tend to start their careers later. For that reason, I'm glad about the change in the law, because I myself may not wish to retire when I'm 70."

HEADLINE: Once a Resort, Village Struggles With Urban Problems

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SPRING VALLEY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Claudie Pierre owned a clothing boutique on Main Street here not long ago. But as this once-rustic village changed, so did her line of work.
Like a charity worker, she now helps people find jobs and housing, provides children with a place to stay while their parents work and offers translation in French, Creole and Spanish for new immigrants -- all from a rundown storefront on the street where she once catered to fashion tastes. 
 "I do a little bit of everything," she said the other day while receiving clients at her new venture, The Open Door, the private social-service agency that she started with her own money last year. "There are many people who need help."
Ms. Pierre is dealing with many of the problems that in a generation have transformed Spring Valley from a thriving summer resort to a community facing a range of urban ills.
 
Increase in Violence
 Struggling families -- many of them new immigrants but many with roots in the area -- double and triple up in apartments and houses in Spring Valley. Unemployed men stand on street corners awaiting offers of jobs as day laborers. Young men walk the streets peddling drugs. And violence -- including the killing of three people in recent months -- is on the rise.
It wasn't always that way in Spring Valley. Just a generation ago, city dwellers flocked to its bungalows, camps, lodges and resort hotels in the summer to escape the city.
But Spring Valley lost its allure as a vacation destination beginning in the 1960's as suburbanization and the advent of modern highways and the Tappan Zee Bridge made Rockland County more accessible to New York City and Westchester commuters.
The village became a magnet for struggling families. Landlords began converting vacation houses into cheap rentals. In a county where most people own their homes, Spring Valley has the highest number of rental units, and 59 percent of the village's residents are renters.
"All of these modern pressures have contributed to the problems in the village," said Bob Rubin, Spring Valley's historian. "The changes have turned Spring Valley into a place of typically urban problems."
 
A Cosmopolitan Flavor
 Still, there have been some advantages to the urban atmosphere that Spring Valley has acquired. The steady arrival of the new immigrants, mainly from Haiti, Jamaica, Guatemala and El Salvador, has given the village new energy and a cosmopolitan flavor.
In the heart of Main Street, there are Haitian political and social clubs, a law office specializing in immigration and restaurants and groceries offering spices, jerk chicken, curry goat, stewed oxtail and beef patties. The parks and playgrounds are filled with West Indian cricketers and soccer players on most weekends.
The village still has many solid neighborhoods of working- and middle-class families, including large numbers of Hasidim who have been in the village for decades.
"There is a kind of vibrancy and diversity here that one doesn't usually find in suburbia," said Winsome Downie-Rainford, the president of a social-service group called the Martin Luther King Multi-Service Center. "We've got 25 nationalities in one small village."
But a measure of the pressures that the changes have brought is the rapid growth of Spring Valley's population. This rise has been fueled by the steady influx of the new immigrants attracted here by cheap rentals and opportunities for unskilled laborers.
According to the 1990 Census, some 22,000 people live in the three-square-mile village of Spring Valley. But village officials and community leaders say that just based on increased garbage collection, for instance, the village actually has some 50,000 people, including a large number of illegal immigrants.
 
Looking for More Aid
 As a result, officials have been grappling with a variety of problems, including landlords in the poorer sections who have been illegally converting one- and two-family houses into overcrowded multifamily dwellings. Two months ago, the village hired an additional housing inspector to keep pace with the problem.
The situation is so severe that the new Mayor, Allan Thompson, recently proposed having the village declared a city to make it eligible for more state and Federal aid.
"We can't afford to let these problems fester," said Mr. Thompson, an immigrant from Jamaica who said he overcame poverty and homelessness.
Juan Nunez, 21, has shared a two-bedroom bungalow with five other men since he arrived from Guatemala several weeks ago. On most mornings, he and his roommates, also from Guatemala, stand near the edge of Route 59 in the hope of securing low-paying jobs like laying bricks, planting trees, mowing lawns, tending gardens and cleaning homes.
It is a hard life, he said. But Mr. Nunez plans to make do until he has saved enough money to return to his homeland and family with a stake for a better life. "I wish it could be different," he said.
 
Emerging Drug Trade
 In a village where 12 percent of the official population lives below the poverty line and the official unemployment rate has soared to 13 percent, community leaders say that services like job training, youth counseling and family assistance are so scarce that problems like crime have been aggravated.
The village's crime figures for 1993 list 180 burglaries, 58 stolen cars and 872 cases of larceny. There were also 172 crimes committed with guns, up from 16 in the previous year. There have been 2 killings, 5 rapes and 40 assaults.
The potential for violence has been magnified with the emergence of a small but steady drug trade. The drug problem has taken root here in part because the village -- a crossroads of bus lines and highways -- is a convenient spot to buy and sell drugs.
"Any time you add drugs to a community that is struggling you will have a combustible situation," said Nathan Mungin 3d, the program director for the King Center.
Thinking that he had left behind the kind of problems he had faced in East Harlem, Wayne Scurry Jr., 16, settled here recently with his father. But he discovered that Spring Valley was not the suburban haven he expected. His cousin was slashed during a fight in a local playground.
"It's still a lot different from the city," he said. "But I was surprised at finding so many bad things here."
Last November, 30 people stood by as a man was shot dead in the village's downtown. Not a single witness has come forward.
"We even had one teen-ager who said she didn't want to talk about it because she didn't care," Police Chief Howard Goldin said. "That's scary."
To combat the crime, Spring Valley has begun an aggressive campaign. The police department plans to hire three officers for community policing in a troubled section known as The Hill. The first police precinct station separate from police headquarters is being built near Main Street. Seven part-time officers were hired to patrol the downtown district at the urging of residents and business people.
In a county whose population is largely white, Spring Valley has become a magnet for both fears and enthusiasm.
David Zuber, a mortgage consultant who lives in nearby Pomona, said that many people in his town fear that Spring Valley's struggling population will ruin the local school district that both communities share. But he disagrees.
"Some of the fears are based on reality, and some of them are based on perception," he said. "But I'm happy to be living near a place with so much variety and diversity."
He added, "If I'm in the mood for plantains or any other Caribbean food, I go to Spring Valley; I'm not going to find it at the Grand Union."

HEADLINE: Cruise Lines Betting That Bigger Will Be Better

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Driven by resurgent bookings, younger passengers and a bit of "our ship is bigger than your ship," the cruise industry is in the midst of a construction boom that will create some of the biggest passenger ships ever seen.
At least 28 ships are scheduled to be launched through 1998, including a 100,000-ton giant from Princess that is expected to carry 2,600 passengers and will be far larger than the 76,049-ton Norway, the biggest ship afloat. 
 The Princess ship topped by 5,000 tons a Carnival ship announced last June, but industry analysts said they would not be surprised if Carnival again raised the ante. Even the Walt Disney Company is getting into the act, starting its own cruise line and ordering two jumbo vessels, each holding 2,400 passengers.
 
Most in Half a Century
 The construction boom will add at least 44,000 passenger berths -- a 40 percent gain over current capacity and the biggest four-year gain, by far, since the golden age of ocean liners more than a half a century ago.
Executives in the cruise industry do not think they will have trouble filling those cabins. Despite the recent recession, the annual number of passengers has jumped from 1.4 million in 1980 to a projected five million this year. And the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group, predicts eight million passengers annually by the year 2000.
More younger people are taking to the sea in ships for their vacations. Twenty-nine percent of first-time passengers before 1989 were 25 to 40 years old; that is now up to 46 percent, and the mean age of first-time passengers has fallen from to 43 percent from 51 percent.
"The recession is over," said Janice Farmer, formerly a cruise-line analyst for Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. "The industry's now targeting people 35 to 54, a sector that will grow 30 percent by the year 2000 and will take longer vacations and spend more."
To fill the ships, cruise lines have been advertising heavily. Between them two industry giants, Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, spent almost $82 million in advertising last year. And lines are developing a variety of niche markets, including conferences and meetings, honeymoons, family cruises and cruises built around themes like sports, music and education.
And taking a page from the airlines, which use yield management to fine-tune supply and demand, they have discounted some fares rather than see ships sail with many empty cabins.
But with construction costs for the new ships running as high as $160,000 for each passenger berth compared with $105,000 per berth for big ships ordered in the mid-1980's, the industry needs higher yields per passenger and expects to get them. Although cruise prices are not expected anytime soon to rise above current fares, which average $175 to $225 a person a day, usually including return air fare, new ships typically charge a premium of 25 percent to 30 percent.
"New ships stimulate demand so they're able to charge premium prices," said Warren H. Lieberman, a cruise analyst for Decision Focus Inc., a management consulting company in Mountain View, Calif. Mr. Lieberman estimated that industry revenue would reach $8 billion to $10 billion by the year 2000, compared with about $6 billion this year.
 
Where the Money Is
 "The mega-ships are generating a 20 to 30 percent return on investment," said Paul Mackey, a cruise-industry specialist at Dean Witter. "As long as they can do that, they'll continue to build ships."
The industry now has 131 ships and 103,000 berths. Although some of the new ships will be replacing older ones being retired, most of those berths are likely to be added capacity, which most analysts said the industry should be able to absorb.
"But it begins to get a little hairy when you get into 1998," Mr. Mackey said. "We'd better be right that the industry is going to keep growing about 10 percent a year."
More Stringent Fire Regulations
Moreover, late in 1997, cruise ships will be required to comply with tighter fire codes. "Ships built before 1960 have the greatest probability of being retired from service," Ms. Farmer said. "It may not be worth it to spend $20 or $30 million to bring them up to code."
But with the industry growing so rapidly, cruise lines are not likely to automatically consign older ships to the scrap heap. The S.S. France, built in 1960 for voyages between New York and Le Havre, now sails between Miami and the Caribbean as the Norway of the Norwegian Cruise Line -- after a $50 million overhaul.
The Orient Lines' Marco Polo, a luxury liner with menus created by Wolfgang Puck, was originally a Soviet spy ship, the Aleksandr Pushkin, built in East Germany in 1965.
The new vessels will have atriums, multimillion-dollar art collections, high-tech gymnasiums and spas, plush casinos and theaters that seat as many as 1,200.
Towering high above the new ships -- at least on the drawing board -- is the Phoenix World City, a $1 billion giant that its backers envision as having three hotel towers above deck and more than a dozen restaurants for its 6,400-passengers -- almost 4,000 more than any cruise ship sailing today.
"The Phoenix World City won't be just a floating hotel when it's built, it will be more like a floating island," said Ernst Frankel, professor of ocean systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Frankel is the senior adviser to the World City Corporation of New York, which hopes to build three such ships, although many industry officials are skeptical that the often-postponed Phoenix World City will ever be built.
 
No Boon for U.S. Shipyards
 The construction binge will be good for passengers, but is expected to do little for the United States' moribund shipbuilding industry, as almost all the new vessels will be built in Europe. It will have little direct effect on other American jobs because most crew members are expected to be foreign nationals.
Yet a Price Waterhouse study last year said that while the cruise industry provided 64,000 jobs directly, it was the indirect source of 385,000 more in industries like farming and ranching -- which supply the ships with fruit, vegetables and beef -- as well as restaurants that serve passengers in port cities.
These are among the cruise lines and their plans:
*Royal Caribbean has contracted for two 1,800-passenger ships for delivery in 1995 and 1996, and for a 1,950-passenger ship late in 1996 with an option for a second delivered in 1997.
*Princess Cruises will spend almost $1 billion for three ships to be delivered by 1997, including the record-breaking 100,000-ton vessel. The ships will increase the Princess fleet to 12 and passenger capacity by 70 percent.
*Celebrity Cruises, in business only since 1991, has ordered two new 1,740-passenger ships for delivery no later than 1997.
*Crystal Cruises is building a 960-passenger ship, for delivery next year, with what it says will be the largest penthouses at sea and a casino managed by Caesars Palace.
*Carnival Corporation, one of only a few public cruise companies (along with Royal Caribbean and American Classic Voyages Company), spent more than $3 billion on 11 ships from 1990 through 1996. That includes four ships for its Holland America subsidiary, which added two 1,200-passenger ships last year and will add two more by 1996.
To increase space in cabins and restaurants, and because the Caribbean is the biggest destination, the mega-ships being built for Princess and Carnival will each be too wide to transit the 110-foot-wide locks of the Panama Canal. They will remain in the Caribbean -- the first passenger vessels in years to forgo cruising in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.
With all these huge ships coming from the big companies, the smaller cruise lines fear being squeezed. Many of the smaller companies have focused on niches, like personalized, luxury cruises and adventure trips, and are expected to do more of that as the biggest ships are launched. And even the smaller lines are building ships.
 
The High End
 Silversea Cruises, for example, is adding two 296-passenger luxury vessels this year and is building two 350-passenger luxury ships for delivery in 1996. Radisson, the hotel company, is building a 232-passenger, all-suites ship, which will cater to business people. Seabourn Cruise Line, whose two luxury ships carry fewer than 300 passengers each, expects to build three more by 1997.
The most unusual small ship may be the American Queen, the $60 million, 420-passenger steamboat being built for the American Classic Voyages Company at McDermott Inc.'s shipyard in Amelia, La. Although small compared with the mega-ships, the American Queen will be the biggest vessel for overnight cruises built in a United States shipyard in more than 40 years.

Wrongly perhaps, traders find soft drinks less than refreshing.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
INVESTORS willing to buck the stock market's current inclination to look no farther than the end of its own nose might consider shares in beverage companies, a long-term growth segment that has fallen badly out of fashion lately.
The beverage group was shaken last week when Pepsico Inc. disappointed Wall Street by disclosing that second-quarter profits would be flat, rather than ahead of last year, as had been expected. 
 Pepsi's shares plunged $3 that day, to $31.50, and the shock has still not worn off. Pepsi closed yesterday at $31.875, up $0.50, which is a discount of more than 25 percent from its 52-week high of a little more than $41 a share.
Analysts attribute Pepsi's current problems to vicious price competition among colas and so-called New Age beverages, and to slow growth at its restaurant chains.
Some of these difficulties are unique to Pepsi, but investors have apparently assumed they are shared by its competitors, because the stock prices of most of its rivals are also trading near the bottom of their 52-week ranges.
Coca-Cola, for example, which derives only 6 percent of its total worldwide business from supermarket sales in the United States, where price competition is the stiffest, closed at $39.875 yesterday, $1 a share over its 52-week low of $38.875.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies closed yesterday at $23.625, just over $2 a share above its 52-week low of $21.25, even though Dr Pepper is one of the country's fastest-growing soft drinks.
And Snapple Beverage, one of Wall Street's hottest initial public offerings two years ago, has also fallen back, even while volume growth of its real-brewed tea and juice-based drinks continues to expand at annual rates of more than 100 percent. On the over-the-counter Nasdaq market yesterday, Snapple's shares closed at $24.50, just above the 52-week low of $21, adjusted for stock splits.
Some Wall Street analysts said this pressure on stock prices showed more a lack of perspective among investors than a seminal change in the economics of the beverage business.
"The soft drink industry has been intensely competitive for about two decades," said William Leach, who follows it for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and what is going on now "is not that different from what we have seen historically."
Analysts who are bullish on the industry's future say that investors are overlooking growth prospects in foreign markets. Huge capital investments have been made in these markets over the last few years, and a cyclical upswing overseas will lift soft drink revenues, they said.
"It is within consumer nondurables industries that American companies possess unassailable worldwide competitive advantages," Roy D. Burry, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, wrote in a recent report on the beverage industry's outlook.
"Major returns from this investment are anticipated during the second half of the 1990's."
Given Coca-Cola's extensive global reach -- 80 percent of its revenues come from outside the United States -- Mr. Burry upgraded Coke's shares to a "strong buy" recommendation.
Mr. Leach said that at the $31 level, Pepsi looked like a "dandy buy," but he laughingly admitted he had the same thought at a higher price. At current prices, he said, he also likes Coca-Cola.
"Statistically, Pepsi's price looks cheap," said George Thompson, a beverage industry analyst at Prudential Securities.
"But I don't think that is going to make any difference at the moment, because people are not looking at the long haul right now."
Pepsi's announcement last week caused Joseph Doyle, Smith Barney's beverage analyst, to downgrade Pepsi to "outperform" for the next year from "buy." He cautioned, "For the next six months, I think it will be dead money."
Emmanuel Goldman, the beverage anlayst at Paine Webber, currently has a buy recommendation on Snapple and Dr Pepper/7-Up shares.
"Snapple's whole product category is exploding," he said, "and while there is price competition, it is not the same as in carbonated soft drinks."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lofty Copper Prices Tumble And Commodity Index Falls

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices tumbled yesterday, and an important commodity index fell for the first time in five trading session.
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities declined two-tenths of a point, to 235.30, helped by stabilizing prices for commodities from coffee to grains. The index, a closely watched gauge of inflation, rose 2.62 points on Monday, and is up nearly 5 percent this year. 
 "The current rally by the C.R.B. index is temporarily taking center stage in the financial markets," Gary Thayer, senior economist with A. G. Edwards, said before yesterday's dip in the index.
 Copper prices had recently climbed to 21-month highs. Stocks of copper held in warehouses have been shrinking as a result of growing demand from recovering industries. But prices retreated yesterday. The copper contract for delivery in July fell 1.4 cents, to 110 cents a pound.
 
Comments on Copper
 "I think the climate in the copper market right now is speculative," one trader said. "But the market will go higher in the long term due to improving fundamentals."
Mike Frawley, an analyst with Dean Witter, said, "We view the market as still being somewhat vulnerable price-wise but over all the long-term fundamentals are still quite positive and higher prices are expected."
Grain prices also stagnated after a volatile two weeks caused by unusually dry spring weather. Much of the activity, however, was in the options market, where traders sought to take advantage of increasing concerns about crops.
On the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the July contract for soybeans edged down 0.25 cent, to $6.905 a bushel; July corn firmed 0.5 cent, to $2.7525, and July wheat declined 3.75 cents, to $3.375 a bushel.
 After a sharp rally on Monday, coffee prices steadied yesterday, with the July contract up 0.15 cent, at $1.3845 cents a pound, on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. Estimates of a smaller world coffee crop this year and next caused prices to jump to around five-year highs.
July crude oil firmed 16 cents, to $18.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where analysts were anxiously awaiting weekly inventory data.
After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute reported oil stocks fell 2.2 million barrels, but by only 12,000 barrels in the closely watched Midwest region where supplies have been tight.
July unleaded gasoline gained 0.26 cent, to 52.18 cents a gallon, and July heating oil rose 0.29 cent, to 47.93 cents.

USAir Sees Initial Savings Of $175 Million Under Plan

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., June 14

 BODY:
USAir Group Inc. said today that it would save $175 million starting this year under an ambitious, previously announced plan to slash its operating costs during the next three years.
USAir said the initial $175 million in savings would take place through management and staff reductions and subcontracting of cargo and air-mail handling. The carrier did not disclose the details of planned cuts in the work force. 
 The airline, which is based here, lost nearly $197 million in the first quarter and has some of the highest fixed costs in the United States airline industry. USAir said it was discussing salary and benefit reductions with its labor unions.
USAir added that as soon as one of its three unions agreed to a cost-cutting program, the airline would institute the plan with all its nonunion employees.
The airline's previously announced plan called for savings of more than $1 billion annually during the next three years.
 
 
Labor Cost Cuts Needed
 "While improved operating efficiencies and innovative new service products are certainly key elements in our total plan, we need labor cost reductions of at least $500 million annually, or about one-half of the total," Seth E. Schofield, chairman and chief executive of USAir, said.
About half of USAir's 44,000 employees are represented by unions. Many took wage cuts in the last several years as the airline industry lost billions of dollars because of the weak economy and overexpansion.
Mr. Schofield added that the cost savings "will enable us to meet our short-term goal of being cost-competitive with the low-cost carriers that have obviously targeted USAir's East Coast markets."
USAir said in its 1993 annual report that competition could have an impact on its ability to sustain operations.
Last Thursday, union officials representing USAir's pilots, flight attendants, machinists and dispatchers met in Pittsburgh to discuss strategy and review an analysis prepared by their financial advisers.
The airline appealed to its unions in March for potential concessions in a bid to revamp its operations and slash expenses.
Shares of USAir were up 12.5 cents, at $6.625, on the New York Stock Exchange today.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Ad Spending Forecast Is Revised Upward

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The straws in the wind indicating growth in advertising spending after years of sluggishness are beginning to accumulate into a tidy haystack. But no one is yet trying to spin the straws into gold.
After a first quarter in which marketers of products like automobiles, packaged foods and computers spent more money than anticipated, in turn enriching advertising media like network television and magazines more than anticipated, the growth is continuing. 
 And yesterday, Madison Avenue's leading forecaster revised upward his projection of ad spending for 1994, noting trends that seemed more robust than they did six months ago.
"There's a lot more reason to be more optimistic," Robert J. Coen, the senior vice president and director of forecasting at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., said at a seminar at the University Club in Manhattan.
"We're seeing budgets restored and a little heavier spending reappearing again. The firmness in demand for media time and space is definitely on the uptick."
Mr. Coen's remarks sparked a boomlet in the prices of stocks of advertising and media companies yesterday. Shares of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which owns McCann-Erickson and other giant agencies, rose 12.5 cents, to $31.875, and shares of the Omnicom Group, which owns large shops including BBDO Worldwide, rose 87.5 cents, to $45.75. Shares of the Gannett Company rose $1, to $52.75, and shares of Times Mirror rose 75 cents, to $32.
Still, there are no forecasts for a boom that would undo the systemic shifts that have fundamentally reshaped the agency industry, resulting in the elimination of thousands of jobs since 1989.
What Mr. Coen called "the restructuring and downsizing" that have shrunk the industry are unlikely to be reversed by a single year of brightening or improving data. Only last Friday, for instance, Lintas New York, which like McCann-Erickson is owned by Interpublic, said it would lay off 12 employees.
Mr. Coen, who has tracked ad trends since 1948, said domestic ad spending in 1994 would total $148 billion, compared with a forecast of $146.8 billion he made in December at the 21st annual Paine Webber media conference.
If ad spending in the United States reaches $148 billion this year, that would represent growth of 7.2 percent from the $138 billion that was spent in 1993. In December, Mr. Coen had predicted a gain of 6.3 percent.
Either way, barring an unforeseen event, ad spending appears likely to increase this year at the quickest pace since it rose at a rate of 7.7 percent in 1988. During recent years, ad spending has uncharacteristically stagnated, trailing the growth in the gross domestic product, and in 1991 even declined for the first time in three decades.
The primary reason for the readjustment, Mr. Coen said, was an accelerating expansion in ad spending at the national level, up 7.8 percent, compared with his prediction of 6.5 percent in December. At the local level, Mr. Coen added, advertisers are somewhat less willing to open their wallets wider, particularly for advertising space in newspapers, where the results remain problematic.
Indeed, Mr. Coen trimmed his forecast for ad spending in local newspapers to an increase of 6 percent, rather than the 6.5 percent he had predicted in December. Over all, his forecast for local spending was for an increase of 6.3 percent, compared with 6.1 percent in December.
Mr. Coen's prediction joined a lengthening list of indicators of an improving advertising environment that includes these:
*The brisk sales being booked by the national television networks in the up-front, or advance, market for commercial time during the 1994-95 season, which are expected to total $4 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in the up-front market for 1993-94.
*Figures from the Magazine Publishers of America showing that ad page gains in April and May were the strongest for those months in a decade.
*Data showing a rise in the demand for commercial time on both local radio stations and national radio networks.
*A report last month at the 76th annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies that so-called spot television time was sold out from April through June "for the first time in six or seven years" in local markets like Atlanta, Las Vegas, Nev., and Washington.
Mr. Coen has become known for forecasts that tend to accentuate the positive. In December, when he predicted a spending increase of 6.3 percent in 1994, Zenith Media Worldwide, a unit of the Saatchi & Saatchi Company P.L.C. specializing in media services, predicted a gain of 3.8 percent.
Karen R. Ficker, an analyst for Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York who follows media companies and attended Mr. Coen's presentation, said that while "it's nice to see the numbers going upward," she would be more inclined to follow Mr. Coen's initial prediction for a gain of 6.3 percent in 1994.
James R. Guthrie, executive vice president for marketing development at the Magazine Publishers of America in New York, who also attended the presentation, called Mr. Coen's magazine projections "a little bit conservative."
Mr. Coen, asked about the assessments of his outlook, said, "When I made a forecast of a 6.5 percent increase for national ad spending in December, nobody seemed to be that confident, and I was losing confidence in my own confidence."
"I think there's a pattern," he said. "When things are bad, people think they'll stay bad. When things get good, people can't believe they're getting good. And then they can't believe it can get bad again."
Still, Mr. Coen's forecast for ad spending outside the United States was less rosy than his outlook for this country, and was also less rosy than his forecast in December. He attributed that to spotty showings in significant markets like Canada, Japan and Spain, which are expected to overshadow what he called "exceptional growth" in countries including Argentina, China, Hungary, South Korea and Thailand.
Mr. Coen projected that spending in 1994 in the rest of the world would total $170.3 billion, up 4.5 percent from $163 billion in 1993, compared with his December forecast that it would total $171 billion, a gain of 4.9 percent.
That would result in total worldwide ad spending in 1994 of $318.3 billion, up 5.7 percent from the $301.1 billion spent in 1993, compared with Mr. Coen's forecast in December of $317.8 billion, an increase of 5.5 percent.
And in his first look at 1995, Mr. Coen estimated that ad spending in the United States would be $157.7 billion, up 6.6 percent from his revised forecast of $148 billion for this year. He said this year's growth should moderate somewhat next year because of the absence of the Winter Olympics and political campaigns that are helping to stimulate ad spending during 1994.
Mr. Coen also estimated that ad spending elsewhere in the world in 1995 would be $181.9 billion, an increase of 6.8 percent from his revised forecast of $170.3 billion for 1994. That would put total ad spending in 1995 at $339.6 billion, up 6.7 percent from his new estimate for 1994 of $318.3 billion.

HEADLINE: Review/Television;
A Sainted Journalist, Blushing In the Grave

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Agreeable though it always is to be reminded of Edward R. Murrow, tonight's edition of "CBS Reports" leaves one wondering how that serious-minded journalist might have felt about the iconizing he has been subject to since his death in 1965. In particular, the conferring of sainthood by an industry that rarely met his standards and by a network that in effect buried his career (while publicly praising it) might have awakened his cynical side.
"When America Trembled: Murrow/McCarthy," at 10 P.M. (on Channel 2 in New York), focuses on the famous 1954 "See It Now" program that helped do in Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. It's a white hat-black hat story that has been told many times but bears retelling. 
 Evidently in an effort to punch up the daring of Murrow's decision to take on the nation's pre-eminent hounder of Communists and their relatives, defenders and facsimiles, tonight's account sets an overly dire scene of an America in the grip of political hysteria. It adds little to the main facts of what is known as the McCarthy era (which was more a blink than an era) and nothing that runs counter to the conventional history; but Murrow's colleagues provide glimpses from the inside, and the material is professionally packaged.
Old news clips catch the personalities of the bullying Senator and his tough nemesis. As Dan Rather points out in his narration, it was not the Murrow program but the televised Army-McCarthy hearings a few weeks later that toppled McCarthy. Still, Murrow had greased the skids.
"When America Trembled" touches on journalistic issues that troubled Murrow and are worth more attention than they receive tonight. One has to do with the right of a popular journalist to use his power and his medium's power to go after a public figure. Murrow's discomfort over his own exercise of such power gave way to his outrage over the damage McCarthy was doing to individuals and to the country, but it was not an automatic decision for him.
Since his time, producers, anchors, reporters and commentators have taken liberties that would probably have caused Murrow sleepless nights. The 30-minute "See It Now" report consisted mainly of newsreel clips of McCarthy telling lies followed by Murrow's corrections. Although the pictures of McCarthy were not chosen for their flattering quality, little use was made of the visual effects commonly employed nowadays against the targets of television exposes. And nobody seems to be losing sleep over sinister close-ups, dire music and the rest.
And then there is Murrow's up-and-down relationship with CBS, the network where he spent almost his entire journalistic career. It was on CBS Radio that he made his mark as a foreign correspondent in World War II and on CBS Television that he made his fortune as host of "Person to Person," a popular celebrity-interview show about which he was sensibly embarrassed. But "See It Now," the series celebrated tonight, brought little joy to Murrow's network masters. It pleased liberal reviewers more than it pleased local stations and advertisers, and signaled the end of Murrow's television career.
Since Murrow's time, the line between reporting and advocacy has been increasingly blurred on the screen, sometimes with worthy results, sometimes in a worrisome way. It can be a close call. And even as so-so news magazines proliferate, good documentaries on urgent matters are left largely to public television.
Tonight's exercise in recycling is the fifth in the current "CBS Reports" series, reincarnated last year. All have been respectable retrospectives: on D-Day, Vietnam, the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the noisy year of 1968. They made economical use of old clips that featured CBS News stars and gave no headaches to network executives. A safe way to call up a faded glory.
Speaking of news magazines, at 9 P.M. tonight, "America Tonight," the latest CBS clone, tells about an automobile insurance scam and about the American head of an Indian village in the Amazon rain forest who is trying to fight off oil drilling. The subjects are not uninteresting by news magazine standards but will win no awards for innovation. As the man said, if you've seen one report on a rain forest (with slow-motion episodes) or on an insurance scam (through an undercover camera), you may not have to see another for a while.
At 10 P.M., ABC's "Turning Point" puts the blame on the Exxon Corporation for the devastating 1989 Alaskan oil spill and warns of similar catastrophes to come. It's a timely report: on Monday, in the first phase of a multi-billion-dollar suit, a Federal jury decided that Exxon and Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez, acted recklessly in events leading to the spill. The program offers some new evidence and pertinent details on the workings and misworkings of the oil-tanker industry. It is well documented, and opposing views are registered. All in all, the sort of job "CBS Reports" might have done in other years.

The nervous Irish woman who repeated constantly "I could never judge another human being. Never. I just couldn't" was not chosen for a jury. The plumber who had difficulty reading was not chosen for a jury.
Juror 30892 was not chosen for a jury. Two times in the box: a drug case, a civil suit centering on a bike rack. Two peremptories. Opinion columnist married to a trial attorney? Goodbye.
"If you're excused, don't be offended," said the avuncular Judge Seymour Margulies when he gave a pep talk at the beginning of the week. "Don't be offended," said Judge Richard F. Connors, who gave an ad hoc disquisition on the dangers of tort reform after announcing that one civil matter had been settled while a jury was in the process of being assembled. "Please know you're wanted. Please know you're needed."
I was not wanted. I was not needed. I was offended.
"You made me nervous," said one of the lawyers who wanted me off his panel. "You bring too much to the table," said a former prosecutor.
In a book to be published this fall called "The Jury," Stephen J. Adler, legal editor of The Wall Street Journal, uses case studies to illustrate all that is wrong with the system, how educated jurors either do not serve or are not selected, how lawyers choose jurors based upon imagined partiality rather than the opposite, how jurors clearly decide some cases based on bias and misapprehension.
He includes the criticisms that have become the staples of reports on the jury system throughout the country: that the ways in which jurors are summoned and selected are haphazard and that too many people and classes of people are excused or excluded.
Mr. Adler quotes Erwin Griswold, the former dean of Harvard Law School: "Why should anyone think that 12 persons brought in from the street, selected in various ways, for their lack of general ability, should have any special capacity for deciding controversies between persons?" And Mark Twain: "The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium upon ignorance, stupidity and perjury."
But Mr. Adler writes nevertheless, "I found myself delighting in the spectacle of entrusting whatever was at issue to a random slice of the community." And I agree. To be sure, those long hours sitting in that room with its fluorescent lights and pallid linoleum, the twin curses of shabby places of public assembly, watching the others play Bingo or solitaire, swapping stories about childbirth or construction, were the closest thing to quarantine.
But there came those moments, with a group assembled in a jury box, when it suddenly made some sort of sense. The Filipino man, the black woman, the housewife with the retired husband, the economist, the divorced bus driver, the banker, so many so serious about their civic duty when duty truly called. Funny that this place, whose reason for being is wrongdoing, leaves you with the overwhelming feeling that the world is full of solid citizens.
She also serves who only sits and waits and reads old copies of Cosmo. And listens in on the post-mortems of the jury that found a woman who slipped on soup on the steps of the medical center 7 percent negligent and the hospital 93 percent in the wrong. The pay was $5 a day. The judges told us with conviction that we were doing something essential to the democratic process. There were times when it seemed true.
Often the jury system works. But there should be coffee every day, and newer magazines, and a place at the table for people, like juror 30892, who bring too much to it.

HEADLINE: Consider the Patient And Not the Insurer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The A.M.A. -- Deja Vu, Again," (editorial, May 29) shows again that the patient's needs are overlooked in the health care reform debate. 
 Permitting insurance companies to fire doctors "without cause" will not assure patients that their doctors are excellent. Insurance companies will be most interested in the lowest cost of what passes for health care on an insurance form. Was the fired doctor really mediocre or perhaps providing the best care at a cost a profit-oriented insurance company did not like?
The public is not well served by putting insurance company employees, either clerks or doctors not expert in the particular problem, in charge of overruling the judgment of a specialist who has spent years training to diagnose and treat the specific ailments of the patient.
Bringing timely and affordable health care to more Americans should not mean diminishing quality. Financial considerations should not replace medical judgment.
Many of the health care reforms being considered in Congress, as well as those on state and local levels, limit the patient's right to choose a specialist and obtain specialty care. That false economy will undermine quality medical care. Patients want the best medical care available. Doctors want to provide the best medical care, too.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rise by Only 0.2%

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Two more signs of a slowing economy and restrained inflation emerged today as the Government reported that consumer prices crept up by a modest two-tenths of a percentage point in May while retail sales fell by an equal amount.
Bond investors, greeting the news as a sign that the economy would not overheat and feed inflation, bid up bond prices. Long-term interest rates fell to 7.30 percent from 7.35 percent. The stock market also rose, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 31.71 points, to 3,814.83. 
 Inflation erodes the value of future interest payments from bonds and the repayment of principal, so bond prices tend to rise and interest rates fall when inflation seems to be under control.
But some economists and analysts are still divided on what the data are saying.
"The economy seems to have stepped down a notch in the pace it was running at," said Martin A. Regalia, the chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. The figures, he said, were the latest indications that the economy was no longer growing at the 5 percent annual rate that it sustained during the latter half of 1993 and that inflation remained under control.
Kenneth P. Mayland, the senior vice president and chief financial officer at Keycorp, a bank based in Cleveland, said today's figures had forced him to reconsider his forecast of "three-ish" growth in the second quarter of this year. "On the basis of these figures, I'm starting to look a something with a two handle, and something with a one handle is not out of the realm of possibility," he said.
 
A Complex Calculation
 But James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York who predicts much stronger growth this quarter, said that it was too soon to start revising economic growth figures. Growth depends not only on consumer spending but also on such variables as international trade and military spending, for which even April figures are not yet available, Mr. O'Sullivan said.
Some Wall Street and banking economists also said that the figures strengthened their view that the Federal Reserve might wait until the August meeting of its interest rate policy committee before raising short-term interest rates again, rather than acting at the next meeting on July 5 and 6. "If we continue to see numbers like this, the Fed is going to wait," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
But David B. Bostian, the chief economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., a New York brokerage firm, is less sure. He said that while he foresaw a sharp slowdown in the American economy during the second half of this year, he was worried about a new Fed study that contends that lower inflation causes higher productivity.
"It looked to me like a rationale for additional rate increases," Mr. Bostian said.
 
Some Rise, Some Fall
 The modest increase last month in consumer prices, which have risen at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent so far this year, reflected a drop in gasoline prices and airline fares. These drops, along with falls in pork and bakery prices, largely offset increases in fruit and vegetable prices and smaller increases in apparel, tobacco and furniture prices.
Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose by three-tenths of a percentage point in May, the Labor Department said in its report.
The small drop in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department for last month came mainly because of a 1.9 percent drop in sales at car and truck dealerships. Sales rose at outlets like grocery and department stores that sell nondurable goods.
But sales at restaurants and clothing stores, which tend to reflect discretionary consumer spending, dropped in May by 1 percent and three-tenths of a percentage point respectively.
The Commerce Department also revised today its figure for April sales to show a fall of 1.1 percent, compared with a previous estimate of a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Views Split on Car Sales
 There is no consensus among auto industry experts and economists on why car sales have led the way in pulling down retail sales over the last two months. Some experts attribute it to rising car prices and a desire among consumers to start saving more of their money.
But some economists, like Mr. O'Sullivan, attribute the fall in car sales to a shortage of popular models, like the Chrysler Neon. "It sounds like that weakness in spending reflects low inventories," he said.
Despite four increases by the Federal Reserve in short-term interest rates this spring, interest rates on car loans have stayed virtually unchanged. Bankers attribute that to stiff competition.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about economic indicators that showed slower growth included an incorrect figure supplied by the Labor Department for the change in consumer prices from May 1993 to May 1994. The index rose 2.3 percent in that period, not 2.8 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers a Plan For U.N. Sanctions On North Koreans

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 15

 BODY:
The United States outlined a plan today for United Nations sanctions against North Korea, including a ban on arms trade, in an effort to force that nation to cooperate with United Nations nuclear inspectors seeking to discover whether it is building an atomic bomb.
The American plan would require United Nations members to halt all trading in arms with North Korea, a move that could cost it between $50 million and $100 million a year in lost exports. But North Korea's arms exports are mostly missiles sent to Iran and Syria, two countries with spotty records of compliance with United Nations directives. 
 The sanctions plan has also been watered down in an attempt to win the support of China, which has a veto on Security Council decisions and has a long record of opposing punitive international sanctions. So the proposals fall well short of the near-total trade blockades the Council has slapped on Iraq, Yugoslavia and Haiti, and they have no enforcement provisions.
China still has not said whether it will approve the sanctions. The positions of the other three permanent members of the Security Council are also unclear, though Britain and France seem likely to endorse the American position.
Unveiling the Clinton Administration's sanctions plan, the United States representative here, Madeleine K. Albright, said sanctions were not an end in themselves but "a tool to show the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that it needs to correct its past behavior and be careful about its future behavior."
As she began what are expected to be long consultations on the plan with other Security Council members, Ms. Albright said Washington wanted the sanctions introduced in phases so North Korea clearly sees the advantages of cooperating with nuclear inspectors sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, as well as the costs of continued defiance.
But Ms. Albright also underscored the dangers inherent in the crisis building up over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, saying the effort to compel the Pyongyang Government to cooperate with the atomic energy agency is "the single biggest issue" before the Security Council now and "the most important thing I shall be dealing with here."
North Korea has repeatedly warned that it will consider sanctions against it to be an act of war, raising the specter of a second northern invasion of the South, where there are some 37,000 American troops.
 
Plan Would Halt U.N. Aid
 In addition to an arms embargo, the initial sanctions package, which would take effect a month after the Security Council approves it, includes cutting off what remains of a four-year, $15 million United Nations aid program in North Korea that began in 1992 and canceling planned assistance for a big industrial project on the Tumen River.
The size of North Korea's few diplomatic missions in foreign countries and international organizations would also be reduced. And whatever cultural, scientific and educational exchanges that exist with North Korea would be canceled.
North Korea would pay "a heavy price in diplomatic isolation," Ms. Albright said.
Only if North Korea responds to this initial sanctions package by further provocative action -- such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- would the United States then ask the Security Council to introduce a second round of sanctions.
The second round would ban all financial transactions with North Korea. This would cut into the remittances it receives from Koreans living in Japan and further complicate what little trade it has with other countries. The $600 million to $1.8 billion a year that Koreans in Japan now send home is thought to constitute North Korea's biggest single source of foreign exchange.
In what appears to be an effort to placate China, the United States has refrained from proposing the full trade embargo it favored against Iraq, Yugoslavia and Haiti or even a ban on selling oil to North Korea, which gets most of its supplies from China. But officials insist that it still might decide to press for a full trade embargo if North Korea refuses to give way.
To avoid the initial package of sanctions, the United States wants North Korea to cooperate again with the atomic energy agency in its efforts to reconstruct the history of a nuclear research reactor to see how much spent fuel has been removed from it for reprocessing into plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear explosives.
The best way of doing this is no longer possible since North Korea has dismantled the reactor core without allowing the agency's inspectors to make the examination they wanted. But the agency's director, Hans Blix, has said his inspectors could still try to discover what use was made of the reactor if North Korea would allow them access to nuclear waste dumps and provide more technical information about the reactor's past operations.
 
Seeking Cargo Flight Ban
 In an attempt to enforce the planned arms embargo, the United States wants the Security Council to ban all cargo flights to and from North Korea. This means that only the scheduled passenger flights that now link Pyongyang with Beijing, Moscow and Bangkok would be allowed to continue.
Many of North Korea's arms deliveries have been made by air. But ship traffic would not be affected, and in any case officials say the United States is not yet contemplating the kind of naval and air monitoring it has organized against Iraq, Yugoslavia and Haiti because it does not yet want to impose a draconian trade embargo on North Korea.
The atomic energy agency has already established through its inspections that North Korea has manufactured some plutonium from spent reactor fuel, though it does not know how much. But the research reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, arousing suspicions that North Korea may have extracted a sizable quantity of fuel and reprocessed it into enough plutonium for one or several bombs.

HEADLINE: 50,000 Orders For New Fords

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 15

 BODY:
The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Alexander J. Trotman, said today that the auto maker already had 50,000 dealer orders for its new Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique compact cars, which go on sale in the United States in September as 1995 models.
Ford will start building the cars next month at a plant in Kansas City, Mo., after a $375 million investment there. The cars, which will also be made at a Ford assembly plant in Mexico, replace the smaller and less expensive Tempo and Topaz compacts. 
 The Contour and Mystique are part of Ford's $6 billion, six-year program to build an all-new car for sale around the world. Their European counterpart is the Ford Mondeo, which is built in Genk, Belgium, and went on sale in March 1993. All three cars share the same basic underpinnings but are styled to suit regional tastes.
Ford expects combined sales of about 800,000 a year, in both right- and left-hand-drive markets. More than 614,000 Mondeos have been ordered in 48 markets.
"It's been a smash hit all across Europe," Mr. Trotman said in a speech today to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. "Despite a deep recession, sales are well over a half million."

Countrywide Credit takes a battering from rising rates.

BYLINE: By Michael Quint 

 BODY:
THE ill effect of rising interest rates on mortgage banking companies is no secret. Wall Street expected companies that originate and service mortgages to report lower profits this year because fewer homeowners are refinancing their mortgages. But analysts were still surprised this week by developments at Countrywide Credit Industries of Pasadena, Calif.
On Tuesday, the day before Countrywide officials met with investors and analysts in New York and announced weaker-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended May 31, the company's stock was hit by a wave of selling by large investors. 
 By the end of the day, 5.9 million shares changed hands, including several blocks of more than a million shares each. The trading was more than eight time Countrywide's normal volume and about 6.4 percent of all shares outstanding. The flurry of selling was enough to push the stock down $1.50, to $15.50. Trading was active again yesterday, with 2.56 million shares changing hands as the price fell 12.5 cents, to $15.375.
Stanford L. Kurland, Countrywide's chief operating officer, said he does not yet know who was selling. But he added that the company had reviewed its procedures for compiling and announcing earnings results and was satisfied that there had been no leak of the company's earnings announcement. But one analyst said investors might have decided bad news was coming because the company does not usually schedule meetings with investors on the day that it announces earnings.
The company said profits for the quarter ended May 31 were $33.7 million, or 37 cents a share, down 24 percent from $43.3 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Davis S. Loeb, Countrywide's chairman, said rising interest rates had reduced mortgage originations, but Countrywide was not matching the moves of some competitors by cutting prices and interest rates on new mortgages.
The combination of higher interest rates and a reluctance to cut its profit margin resulted in a 19 percent decline in the volume of new mortgages. Although the company has been cutting expenses -- its payroll is down 21 percent since October, to 3,499 workers -- overall expenses are still 28 percent higher than a year ago.
"Expenses were not down as much as expected," said David Hochstim, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. He added that the cost of hedging to protect the value of fees on the mortgages the company services -- an activity that greatly benefited Countrywide when interest rates were falling -- was greater than expected. Countrywide officials say the cost of those hedges will decline.
The Countrywide report was discouraging enough, and far enough below the average earnings forecast of more than 50 cents a share, that several Wall Street analysts promptly reduced their forecasts for the remainder of this year and next. Paul Mackey, an analyst at Dean Witter, now expects the company to earn $1.90 a share this year, down from $2.17 he expected earlier. Next year, he expects a rebound to $2.25, unchanged form his earlier estimate.
Despite the weaker-than-expected profits in the first quarter, Countrywide remains one of the most highly regarded mortgage banking companies on Wall Street. The company is only 25 years old, but is the leader in originating mortgages and has kept intact a network of 291 offices which deal directly with consumers. It is also the leader in the servicing, or mortgage record keeping business, with a $93.6 billion portfolio of mortgages that produce fees of nearly half a percentage point, or $470 million annually, a stable source of revenue.
As a market leader, some analysts say Countrywide is a takeover target that is within the reach of banking companies. Seth Glickenhouse, one of the largest investors in Countrywide -- who said he was a buyer, not a seller on Tuesday -- maintained the company would be a great fit for a bank such as BankAmerica. And some analysts have said Countrywide could fetch $50 a share.
"For the past few months there has been a real tug of war between the takeover school and the weak results," said Gary Gordon, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "When the results show up, the company gets hit, then that memory fades and there is more talk about a takeover." But estimates of $50 a share are unrealistic, he said, adding that a price of $25 a share would be more appropriate.

HEADLINE: Castro Dons Civvies for Latin Conference

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CARTAGENA, Colombia, June 15

 BODY:
Tailoring his attire to a changing foreign policy, President Fidel Castro of Cuba has broken his 35-year tradition of only wearing olive-green military uniforms in public and has appeared at a meeting with Latin America's civilian heads of state here by wearing a white cotton guayabera shirt.
"We are all used to the general in olive green, and now he is in a guayabera," commented Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, Colombia's President and host to the annual Ibero-American summit meeting. "We think this represents a good change." 
 President Castro looked slightly ill at ease in his public debut in civilian clothes, but it is generally assumed here that he donned the loose shirt out of more than a desire to comply with his Colombian hosts' request for informality at this tropical beach resort city.
 
A Growing Share of Trade
 Gradually emerging from decades of isolation in the Americas, Cuba during the last five years has tripled the amount of trade it does with Latin America, from 7 percent in 1990 to 21 percent today. With trade and investment growing steadily, Latin American leaders are increasingly open in their objections to the United States' 32-year trade and diplomatic embargo of the Communist-ruled island nation.
In an indirect slap at United States policy, the leaders of 19 Latin American nations and of Spain and Portugal approved a communique tonight calling for the elimination "of unilateral coercive economic and trade measures."
The communique was a victory for Mr. Castro, who on Tuesday, as the summit meeting began, complained that "no one has said a word about the criminal and unjust blockade that for more than 30 years has been imposed on my country."
 
'Relic of Cold War'
 But blunt language in support of lifting the embargo was heard last week at a meeting in Brazil of foreign ministers of member nations of the Organization of American States. A Panamanian diplomat described the 1962 suspension of Cuba from the O.A.S. as "a relic of the cold war."
Calls for Cuba's return were heard from some of the organization's most powerful members -- Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Venezuela -- as well as from most of the Central American republics. The organization's Secretary General, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, received a standing ovation when he asked, "Hasn't the time come to re-admit Cuba to the Latin American family?"
The United States ban on business with Cuba costs American companies $6 billion a year in lost opportunities, according to Representative Charles Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. Mr. Rangel has sponsored a bill to lift the trade embargo, but the Clinton Administration has shown no signs of shifting policy on the issue.
 
Canada Shifting Policy
 Meanwhile, companies in other nations are signing deals with Cuba. Next week, Canadian officials, who have described the United States embargo as "unhealthy," are expected to announce a renewal of Canadian foreign aid to Cuban non-governmental groups. Aid was suspended in 1978 to protest Cuba's military intervention in Angola.
As in much of the Americas, Canada's softer line toward Cuba reflects a steady growth in trade and investment since the collapse of the Soviet bloc five years ago. Last year, 130,000 Canadian tourists visited Cuba, accounting for 28 percent of the island's total.
Two weeks ago, two Canadian companies announced that they had found commercial quantities of oil at a well offshore of Cuba's Manzanas Province. In mining, two Canadian companies signed contracts this year to exploit an open-pit copper mine in eastern Cuba and to prospect for gold, lead, silver and zinc in central and eastern Cuba.
This week, a Mexican company signed a $1.5 billion deal to rehabilitate Cuba's decrepit telephone system. The deal dwarfs an additional $150 million in Mexican investments that have been announced in the 1990's.
 
'Concrete Opportunities'
 "We have been progressively strengthening our relations with the rest of Latin America," Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, the president of Cuba's National Assembly, said here. "There is important Mexican investment now. Brazil is buying medicines. Tourism is increasing. There are concrete opportunities for Latin American countries to invest."
In recent years, some Latin American nations soured on Cuba when the impoverished country ran up large unpaid import bills -- $30 million to Brazil and $50 million to Colombia. But the liberalization of Cuba's foreign investment climate is sparking new overseas interest in this market of 11 million people.
Two weeks ago, Spain, which accounts for one-quarter of Cuba's 100 joint ventures with foreign companies, signed an investment protection treaty in Havana.
Colombia, which only re-established diplomatic relations with Havana last October, has been among the most aggressive in courting trade and investment with Cuba, which ranks as the fifth most populous of the Caribbean nations.
 
Commerical Airline Links
 Visits to Havana by three Colombian ministers since February have produced an accord for commercial airline service, a 17-fold increase in Cuban exports to Colombia and negotiations over an oil deal in which Colombia would supply Cuba with up to one-third of its oil needs.
"We have no discrimination against Cuba," Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia's foreign trade minister, said in an interview after his March visit to Havana. "But we will not give them any special benefits. We approach Cuba in a businesslike way."
If the oil deal goes through, Cuban exiles threaten to launch a boycott of Colombian products in southern Florida. But Government authorities seem to pay as little heed to this threat as participants in the summit meeting have paid to full-page advertisements published this week in Colombian newspapers by Cuban exiles opposed to Mr. Castro's visit here, his second in less than a year.
"I don't accept any influence by Cuban exiles on Colombian foreign policy," Ernesto Samper Pizano, the ruling party candidate in Colombia's June 19 presidential election runoff, said recently. "The O.A.S. should open a new space for Cuba in the inter-American concert."

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Ebb in Restrained Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After four consecutive advancing sessions, the stock market fell yesterday in restrained trading. Falling bond prices, a declining dollar and rising commodities prices all contributed to weakness in the leading stock indexes.
The Dow fell 24.42 points yesterday, to 3,790.41, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.76, to 460.61. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 0.14 point, to 735.84. 
 Blue-chip issues like I.B.M. and the Aluminum Company of America, telephone companies like BellSouth and conglomerates like General Electric, as well as Nasdaq stocks like Intel and American Power Conversion, all fell.
For more than three weeks, the Dow had been vainly attempting to break a resistance level at 3,800, only to exceed that on Tuesday when the Dow hit 3,814.83, technical analysts said.
But for a variety of reasons, analysts doubt that the blue-chip index can hold its ground for the near future. "The market is very, very overbought," meaning that traders are more likely to sell than to buy, said Don Hays, investment strategist for Wheat First, Butcher & Singer in Richmond.
For the last 20 days, for example, there have been sharp advances in a wide variety of stock groups. "You need a pause to refresh," Mr. Hays said.
The stock market is also getting mixed signals from the bond market. Long-term interest rates rose yesterday, almost by default. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.39 percent from 7.30 percent in light trading, which accentuates volatility.
At first, a Federal Reserve report provided more evidence of a slow-growth economy, but later, seemingly innocuous remarks by a Fed official reminded bond traders of their quick-to-surface inflation fears and again roused anxieties that the Fed would again increase interest rates.
In the morning, the Fed reported that factory use fell to 83.5 percent in May, from 83.6 percent in April. But John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said yesterday that factory use was "approaching a high level" and "that's one of the things that may at some point contribute to inflation pressures."
A declining dollar, which could signal a reluctance by foreign investors to buy American assets, did not help. The dollar fell to 102.75 yen, from 102.78 the day before.
The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index did not help, either. The index, a proxy for commodities traders' inflation outlook, consists of 21 futures contracts. The index jumped 3.31 points, to 238.61, one of the steepest rises of the year.
The biggest movers were agricultural commodities like soybeans and corn, which rose sharply because weather forecasts for the Midwest indicated possible drought conditions for the next month. Separately, the price of crude oil soared.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.96 point, to 254.14, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks, 950 to 1168. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.38 point, to 442.27.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 269.9 million shares, about 8 percent below this year's average of 295 million shares.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 18 fell, led by Exxon, which fell 1 7/8, to 57, in heavy trading.
A Federal jury ruled on Monday that Exxon was reckless in the Valdez oil spill and thus opened the company to billions of dollars in possible legal damages. Yesterday, a Bear, Stearns analyst lowered his Exxon stock assessment to "avoid" from "hold." Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 252 stocks fell, led by Exxon and Wal-Mart, which declined 1/4, to 24 5/8, on no apparent news.
The most active stock, at 7.3 million shares, was the Cott Corporation, which fell 3 1/2, to 14 1/2, after management told securities analysts that its rate of growth was slowing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS Gains Fade On Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prospects for a rally in the bond market on raised expectations of a slowing economy quickly faded yesterday. A sharp rise in commodity prices, a weak dollar and comments by a Federal Reserve official all helped revive investors' concerns about inflation.
Bond prices initially rose on industrial production and business inventory data that suggested a slowdown in the economy, traders said. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 30/32 , to 8613/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.39 percent, from 7.30 percent on Tuesday, but still well within the trading range of the last few months. Since April, the yield on the long bond has been as low as 7.10 percent, on April 26, and as high as 7.60 percent, on May 11.
Raymond A. Worseck, chief economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons of St. Louis, said that yesterday's reports were in the range of most economists' expectations. They showed the economy was growing, but at a slower pace, he said.
 
Concern on Inflation
 "Inflation in May was not a problem, but inflation is something to be concerned about," Mr. Worseck said. "It is on the mind of the Fed, on the minds of people investing in foreign bonds and on the minds of people watching commodity prices."
The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a closely watched gauge of inflation, surged 3.31 points yesterday, to 238.61, near a three-and-a-half-year high of 239.20 reached on May 24. The price of oil moved above $19 a barrel yesterday, with the July contract for light crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange settling at $19.86 a barrel.
The gain in the commodities index was led by grains and hogs. Mr. Worseck noted that of the three commodity categories, industrial, agricultural and precious metals, the focus has been on agriculture, where one crop failure can cause turmoil in the market.
"Many in the market still live with the memories of 1974, when commodity prices double and tripled," Mr. Worseck said. "But as long as the Fed holds the line, they're making a monetary accommodation that would allow temporary commodity events to spread into general inflation."
Inflation fears in the market were heightened after comments by John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor. In an interview with the Market News Service, Mr. LaWare said that although the rate of capacity utilization in American industry fell slightly in May, it had reached potentially inflationary levels.
 
'Straining the System'
 The Market News Service reported that Mr. LaWare was more concerned about the relatively high level of capacity utilization. "The estimates are that if you get capacity utilization at 85 percent that you are really kind of straining the system," Mr. LaWare was quoted saying.
Another Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, told the Market News Service on Tuesday that monetary policy was now "within the neutral range" but that mere neutrality could become inappropriate at some point.
But Mr. LaWare's comments bothered the market more, even though he had made similar comments in the past.
The market was helped by yesterday's report showing the decline in capacity utilization. There is much debate, however, whether industries are at or near the point were they will begin to raise prices.
Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May, slightly stronger than expected. Capacity utilization slipped to 83.5 percent, from 83.6 percent, with the market trading up on the decline in capacity usage.
Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury announced that next week it would sell $17 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $11 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year was being offered at a price to yield 5.92 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 6.69 percent.
 
Massachusetts Issue
 In the municipal market, underwriters, led by Paine Webber Inc., of Massachusetts' $300 million of special-obligation revenue bonds , announced the deal's final pricing. The maximum yield for a bond due in 2014 is 5.90 percent, with shorter-maturity serial bonds priced to yield from 3.40 percent in 1995 to 5.85 percent in 2012.
Moody's Investors Service rated the financing A1. Standard & Poor's gave it a AA- and Fitch Investors Service, A+.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Getting welfare recipients into jobs probably won't be cheap.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
Is America ready to dump a welfare system that permits -- even encourages -- permanent dependence?
President Clinton apparently thinks so, and this week is proposing changes that would, among other things, limit the time that healthy adults could remain on the dole. But findings from an ambitious experiment, released just yesterday, suggest that any reform guaranteeing a living to everyone who plays by the new rules would not come cheap. 
 For while the study, by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, shows that modest additional investments in training and job brokering could make a dent in the welfare rolls, it also implies that most people on welfare would need costly, government-supported jobs in order to join the 9-to-5 culture. And as Rebecca Blank, an economist at Northwestern University, points out, "There just isn't enough money to match the rhetoric."
In this latest study, some 33,000 welfare recipients in six California counties were randomly divided into program and control groups. Those in the program group were required to participate in a variety of training and job hunting activities under the Greater Avenues to Independence, or GAIN, program, the state's effort to contain welfare with support from the Federal Family Support Act of 1988. Both the "experimentals" and the "controls" -- those left in the regular welfare system -- were then followed by researchers to see how they fared over three years.
GAIN did make a difference: On average, participants earned 22 percent more than the controls. More striking, those in Riverside County (east of Los Angeles) increased their earnings by 49 percent.
Riverside was also a winner from the perspective of taxpayers: $2.84 was saved for every dollar invested in extra services. On the other hand, Alameda (Oakland), Los Angeles and largely rural Tulare County spent twice as much as they saved on welfare payments. Over all, GAIN was a drain in the six counties, with a dollar spent for every 76 cents recouped.
But that is a "narrow perspective" to judge success or failure, said James Riccio, director of research at the nonprofit Manpower agency, since it ignores the extra income of those able to reduce their dependence on welfare. When the Government's total costs are compared with the benefits to both taxpayers and welfare clients, GAIN comes within a hair of breaking even.
Substantial losses were recorded in just two counties, Los Angeles and Alameda. And by no coincidence these were the two counties with a large, chronically poor underclass -- the people who, in Ms. Blank's words, "start with five strikes against them."
It is relatively easy to see why the going was rough in those two counties. But what explains the success in Riverside?
While the county did offer training, Mr. Riccio said, Riverside's staff insisted that everyone look for jobs and put serious effort into matching them with prospective employers. "What stood out most was the message," Mr. Riccio concluded -- the message that welfare is a temporary safety net rather than a way of life.
The Manpower executives are inclined to put a positive spin on the results from GAIN, emphasizing the win-win nature of the Riverside experience and the fact that the overall taxpayers' loss was offset by benefits to poor people. But they are too committed to objective research to ignore the darker implications of this controlled experiment in trimming the welfare rolls.
GAIN's cumulative outlays on training and job search (ranging from $1,597 a person in Riverside to $5,597 in Alameda) raised the number holding jobs by just six percentage points. That left more than half on welfare at the end of the third year, said Judith Gueron, the president of Manpower -- an enormous number who would need help in finding and keeping jobs in the brave new world of workfare.
President Clinton has promised that Washington would assume the responsibility as employer of last resort -- a promise designed to win political support from the states, which fear they will be stuck with the cost of making workfare work. But the promise is not worth much unless Congress comes up with the money.
Mr. Riccio imagines circumstances in which the Government job guarantee would not be as expensive as the GAIN experiment implies. The incentive to leave welfare was beefed up just last year with the expansion of tax credits for the working poor. And it would be beefed up still more, he said, with the passage of health care legislation that allows those leaving welfare to keep medical benefits.
It is possible that welfare-to-work will prove cheaper than expected, but no one is saying it is probable. The big worry, then, is that once again the fragile coalition backing welfare reform will crack under the pressure of tight budgets and unrealistic expectations.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Up a Bit; Operating Rate Off

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Evidence of slower economic growth is piling up. Production at American factories, mines and utilities barely rose in May, and a barometer of inflationary pressure was lower for the second straight month.
There was also reasonably good news about the productivity of American businesses. And, as expected, inventories rose slightly in April while sales slipped. 
 The Federal Reserve said today that industrial production posted its 12th straight increase in May, with output of business equipment and construction supplies barely offsetting the third consecutive decline in car and truck production.
Production rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month on top of an April gain of one-tenth of 1 percent, which was revised downward from an earlier estimate of three-tenths of 1 percent. The size of the recent increases is down sharply from the last three months of 1993, when the economy expanded more rapidly than it had in a decade.
"I don't think we're on the verge of economic collapse," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the WEFA Group, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting service. "Put all of it together, we'll have some noninflationary growth. It's wonderful."
The Fed said the industrial operating rate -- a barometer of inflationary pressure -- fell in May for the second straight month.
The central bank said production facilities operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in May, down a tenth of a percentage point from April and two-tenths from March.
The operating rate peaked at 83.9 percent in June 1989. If it rises too high, it could mean production limits are being reached -- leading to shortages that spur price and wage increases.
Many analysts now predict the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates four times from February to May, will impose no further tightening of credit before August at the earliest.
Gene Sherman with M. A. Schapiro & Company in New York said the decline in both production and operating capacity for auto manufacturers was concealing stronger growth in other sectors.
"So far, so good," he said. "But, in my view. we're at the threshold of rising prices."
In another report today, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity rose 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the first three months of this year. The figure, defined as output per number of hours worked, is nearly three times the half-percent rate reported earlier. But it still trailed the fourth quarter of last year, when productivity shot up at a 6.1 percent rate.
Also, the Commerce Department said still-lean business inventories rose two-tenths of 1 percent in April after falling in March for the first time in three months. The department also said business sales fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in April, the largest drop since they plunged 1.5 percent in December 1991.
The Fed said a 5.8 percent drop in production of cars and trucks was more than offset by gains in production of business equipment, up nine-tenths of 1 percent in May on top of a half-percent climb in April, and construction supplies, which rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in May following a 1.7 percent surge as spring arrived. Production of computers and office equipment surged 3.1 percent. All manufacturing production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May, matching the April advance.

The aspiring buyers include several of the biggest cable companies in the country: the Comcast Corporation of Philadelphia; Continental Cablevision of Boston, and a joint venture between Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver and Knight-Ridder Inc., based in Miami. 
 With 553,000 customers in a number of fast-growing suburban markets and combined cash flow of $120 million, McLean Hunter's lucrative American cable franchises are almost certain to be sold for more than $1 billion.
 
An Active Market
 Maclean Hunter, based in Toronto, is selling the franchises as it prepares to be acquired by Rogers Communications Inc., a telecommunications company also based in Toronto. Rogers has said it wants to sell the systems, in part to reduce debt associated with its takeover of Maclean Hunter, which is expected to be completed later this year.
The auction, which should be concluded in the next day or two, comes as the market for cable television properties has become more active than it has been in months.
But the pattern of today's acquisitions is sharply different from that of earlier activity. Instead of telephone companies competing to purchase cable systems outside their territories, cable companies are buying up each other as they brace for competition from phone companies.
In the wake of new Federal price regulations for the cable industry, the regional Bell companies appear to have shifted their strategies from buying systems to upgrading their networks for video services and direct competition with cable operators.
"The phone companies have decided to sit it out," said John Waller 3d, president of Waller Capital, a cable television broker in New York. "It's going to be cable company buying cable company, not telephone companies buying cable companies."
Less than two weeks ago, the Times Mirror Corporation agreed to sell its extensive cable television holdings to Cox Enterprises in a stock deal valued at $2.3 billion -- about 12 times cash flow. If the Maclean Hunter properties are sold for only 10 times cash flow, they would bring about $1.2 billion.
People familiar with the auction, which is being managed by Goldman, Sachs, said Rogers Communications had asked for all-cash bids, which could drive prices below the valuations received by Times Mirror. In addition, one investment banker noted that the Maclean Hunter properties do not have the same strategic value that the Times Mirror systems had for Cox.
In that case, Cox was able to combine its own cable properties in Southern California with those of Times Mirror, thereby stitching together a powerful collection of systems from San Diego to Los Angeles.
Maclean Hunter's most valuable systems are in suburban New Jersey and Florida. It also owns a cable system in Detroit, but that system's performance has been dragged down by the city's weak economy.
Still, companies like Comcast and Continental Cablevision are believed to have an intense interest. Comcast, with 2.6 million subscribers at present, would move from being the nation's fourth-largest cable operator to the third-largest. If it acquired the MacLean Hunter properties, Continental Cablevision, with 2.9 million subscribers, would strengthen its position as the third-largest operator.
The largest cable companies are Tele-Communications, with 10.2 million subscribers, and Time Warner Cable, with 7.1. million customers.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Asked to Study Derivatives in Funds

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Reacting to recent sharp price drops for several supposedly low-risk mutual funds, the chairman of the House subcommittee with securities oversight asked the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday for a comprehensive study of such funds' use of the complex financial instruments known as derivatives.
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, has recently held a series of hearings into the regulatory issues posed by the growth of derivatives. 
 Derivatives are a broad family of new financial products whose value is based on, or derived from, the movement in a financial market, such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Mutual funds often substitute derivatives for other investments, often in the form of structured notes, which are bonds whose value is linked to an index of the stock market, or some other asset.
 
Mortgage Derivatives Held
 Most mutual funds that have gotten into trouble recently have held mortgage derivatives, which are complex bonds backed by pools of home mortgages. Many of these securities were offered with unusually high interest rates, but their principal value has eroded substantially in recent months as interest rates have risen.
For example, the Paine Webber short-term government bond fund fell 4 percent in one day, mainly because of illiquid mortgage derivatives.
Mr. Markey asked Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C., to review a series of issues posed by derivatives. In particular, Mr. Markey sought a reading on whether the disclosures made about fund practices could be understood by the average investor.
 
Leverage Involved
 He also asked whether funds were taking too much risk to raise their yield, and whether derivatives posed problems because they were hard to value and were sometimes hard to sell and more leveraged than was generally permitted for mutual funds.
Mr. Markey asked that the S.E.C. complete the study within 30 days, an unusually brief period for such a lengthy request.
In fact, the agency may well ask for more time, Barry Barbash, the agency's top mutual fund regulator, said. "There are a lot of complex issues but not many easy answers." he said.
Mr. Barbash said that the S.E.C. had already begun several initiatives in response to mutual funds' growing use of derivatives. In February, the agency sent a letter to fund managers asking them to increase disclosure of their derivative activities. And it is about to send a second letter asking fund managers to look at their risk management controls that track derivatives positions.

HEADLINE: Corporate Spending Booms, but Jobs Stagnate

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Rarely since World War II has corporate America spent as much as it is spending today on the new equipment that is the foundation of a thriving economy. Companies are becoming more efficient and profitable. But don't celebrate. Rarely has so much spending resulted in so little expansion by businesses -- and so little job growth.
Take the Whirlpool Corporation. Its decision to build a factory in Tulsa, Okla., to produce stoves sounds like an expansion that would create a lot of jobs and a lot of stoves. But that is not the case. 
 The stoves that come off Whirlpool's new assembly line will only replace the gas and electric ranges that the company either makes at another of its plants or buys from competitors and resells with the Whirlpool label. The new factory will not add to the nation's supply of stoves. Gone is the robust optimism that more stoves should be made because people will buy them. That would have been the rationale for adding a factory in decades past.
 
Jobs Added, Jobs Lost
 Instead, Whirlpool merely intends to lower the cost of its products by making the stoves itself, more efficiently. And while Whirlpool will add 700 jobs when the plant opens next year, that many jobs, or more, will probably be lost elsewhere within the company and at its suppliers -- unless those suppliers can find customers that do not now seem to exist.
Like much of corporate America, Whirlpool does not think the demand among Americans for its product will rise significantly soon, and so it is reluctant to expand its capacity.
"American companies, being very cost-sensitive, are really trying to substitute machinery for labor rather than purchase more machinery and more labor," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting firm. "Why expand here if you know there is a company in Japan operating at only two-thirds of capacity and seeking business in America to fill up its shop. Or there are skilled workers in Mexico who can do the job."
Nothing tells the story more vividly than the Commerce Department's figures for capital spending -- business's investment in factories, buildings and equipment. Capital spending reached $592 billion last year, in inflation-adjusted dollars, or a near-record 12 percent of the gross domestic product. But most of the spending was to replace existing equipment or, as at Whirlpool, to shift production from one place to another.
Although the estimate is inexact, the Commerce Department says that only 2.3 percent of the G.D.P., or $120 billion last year, went for what it classifies as expansion -- the new factories and buildings that require more workers. That compares with 4 percent or more during periods of economic growth in the 1960's, 1970's and early 1980's.
The approach that Whirlpool and others are taking to re-equip and upgrade the nation's industrial base strengthens corporate profits and makes companies more efficient, but is not so immediately favorable for wage earners.
In the new Tulsa factory, for example, stoves are to be made at lower cost. Prices can fall, and Whirlpool will sell more stoves. Very possibly, the new equipment, being fast and efficient, will allow Whirlpool to increase production and sales without hiring more people. Or perhaps there will be some hiring. But in either case, American companies that compete with Whirlpool could lose market share, and shed workers.
That brings hardship that many economists temper by outlining a longer-term solution. The day will come, they argue, when American-made stoves will be price-competitive with those imported from Mexico or Canada, for example. Production in those countries will then shift to the United States. New factories will open without old ones closing. When that process is multiplied across many industries, jobs are likely to be created at a more vigorous pace.
 
An 'Ultimate Payoff'
 "The link with jobs that goes through productivity does take some years, but that is the ultimate payoff," said Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
To be sure, the heavy spending to replace equipment and factories has contributed considerably to recent economic growth. Several hundred thousand jobs created since early 1993 represent people who are manufacturing, installing or programming the machinery and computers that companies are buying in record numbers, Mr. Wyss said.
But the job multiplier effect from capital spending is muted. In the past, the equipment went more frequently into new factories and offices that then had to be staffed. The vigorous rise in employment spread fresh income through the economy, and that new spending power, in turn, raised demand for stoves and many other products and services.
One reason that businesses have been reluctant to expand is that such an investment has been less profitable than it used to be. Investment in factories and equipment is guided mainly by the return that a company can earn. Until the early 1970's, the average return was 10 to 15 percent a year, which meant that a machine bought for $10,000 to stamp out hubcaps, for example, earned the company $1,000 to $1,500 annually.
Since then, the average after-tax return on invested capital has never exceeded 8 percent, and in the 1990's it has ranged from 5 percent in 1991 to 6.8 percent last year, the Commerce Department reports. It isn't enough; corporate America's goal is more than 10 percent.
 
Paper Industry Cautious
 That helps to explain why, for example, the nation's giant paper manufacturing companies, after a round of expansion starting in the 1980's, resist another round now -- although paper mills are operating flat out and paper prices are rising, promising a higher return.
"The annual return today in the paper industry is an abysmal 1 to 2 percent; our shareholders would kill us if we invested in major expansion," said Timothy McKenna, aUnion Camp Corporation executive.
Instead, paper companies are installing new machines at existing plants, or upgrading old ones to cut costs or squeeze out more production. Union Camp, for example, is putting a $170 million machine in a Virginia plant, to recycle 100,000 tons of paper a year. "That is an expansion of production, without an expansion of manpower," Mr. McKenna said.
Similarly, AT&T, with 40 manufacturing plants in the United States, is upgrading many of them to meet the strong demand for equipment to modernize some of the Baby Bell telephone networks, and to expand telephone service in China and the Middle East. Workers, for example, are being hired for a third shift at a Richmond plant that makes wiring boards, many of them for export.
 
Move Overseas Seen
 But once the plant hits capacity, a new plant will probably be built overseas and hiring at Richmond might ease off, said Laurence C. Seifert, vice president of manufacturing.
"There would have to be more growth in the American economy to put a new factory here," he said. "Revenue has to grow by 18 percent a year to offset the gains we can get in production simply by installing new equipment. The 18 percent is the average offset for new technology, and in even the best United States markets, the revenue growth is less than 10 percent a year."
Similarly, America's railroad companies acquired 827 new locomotives last year, but that raised the nation's locomotive fleet by only 157, to 18,161. The locomotives, however, are more powerful and can haul more freight.
But investing in more trains and hiring more people to operate them is a different matter. That requires an average return on the investment of at least 11.5 percent a year, said Harry Levine, a vice president of the Association of American Railroads. Now the return is only 8 percent, which is okay if the goal is to buy more powerful, more efficient engines to haul freight on existing lines, often at less cost.
The national economy surged over the winter, but rising interest rates have slowed growth, taking some of the appeal away from capital spending. A railroad company projecting an 8 percent return from the purchase of a $1 million locomotive might decide to buy Treasury bonds instead, because they offer almost as much payback, with less risk.
"Given the risk, the industry is waiting for a greater return than it can get elsewhere," Mr. Levine said.
 
Whirlpool Rejected Mexico
 Whirlpool's Tulsa plant, announced in April, seems to offer that greater return. The $104 million plant is to employ 700 people when it opens and 1,300 later on. And if all goes well, Whirlpool will emerge a market leader in the one home appliance, stoves, where it has never had a big role.
Whirlpool settled on Tulsa after rejecting a low-wage site in Mexico, where General Electric has a modern stove factory. While Mexico's labor costs were lower, Tulsa's were low enough for skilled workers -- under $10 an hour -- and transportation costs were less.
Then, too, voters of Tulsa County have agreed to pay 25 percent of the new plant's $104 million cost. They voted yes, in a referendum on Tuesday, to a temporary rise in the county sales tax to raise $26 million of the capital outlay. They decided, in effect, to buy some of their new jobs. A no vote probably would have meant no plant and no new jobs. "If the tax increase had not passed," Thomas L. Vining, a Whirlpool vice president, said, "we would have regrouped and thought about what to do next."

HEADLINE: U.S. Imports of Oil Increase

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
United States dependence on imported oil continued to grow last month, with domestic production failing to keep pace with surging demand, an oil industry group said yesterday in its monthly report on petroleum supplies.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, domestic crude oil production in May was more than 3 percent below levels a year ago, at 6.3 million barrels a day. 
 The overall drop in output comes as demand for petroleum products, especially gasoline, is rising, bolstered by an expanding domestic economy. Domestic deliveries of petroleum products, a key measure of demand, Were 4 percent higher than a year ago, the institute said.
Faced with declining domestic production, the United States has turned increasingly to imports to fill the supply gap.

HEADLINE: Ciba Corp. Decides to Keep Its U.S. Headquarters in the County

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ELMSFORD, N.Y., June 15

 BODY:
One of Westchester County's largest employers, the Ciba Corporation, has decided to keep its American corporate headquarters in the county, rejecting financial incentives offered by Connecticut.
New York offered more than $13 million of its own to keep the pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing company, formerly known as Ciba-Geigy, and its 1,000 jobs, in Westchester. Neither Connecticut officials nor Ciba executives would say how much Connecticut had offered to lure the company across the state line. 
 Ciba said it had signed a letter of intent to move its headquarters from Ardsley to the Tarrytown Corporate Center.
 
Seeing a Turnaround
 Company officials said they had considered several sites in Fairfield County during an 18-month search for new office space for its headquarters and additives divisions, which have been in Ardsley since the mid-1950's.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who attended the news conference here announcing Ciba's decision, said, "Ciba's plan to keep the majority of its Westchester operations here in Westchester is a tribute to this community's high-skilled work force."
While noting that the state has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the recession, Mr. Cuomo said he was starting to see a turnaround. But he said the state would have to compete internationally as well as with New Jersey and Connecticut to attract and retain businesses like Ciba.
The state's financial package for Ciba includes low-interest loans, skills-training grants, research and development credits and tax abatements.
Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Economic Development Department, acknowledged that a financial offer was made to Ciba.
 
Acknowledging 'Slim Chance'
 "Connecticut recognized from the outset that there was only a slim chance that Ciba would uproot and relocate," he said, "but we sought to accommodate them and put together what we believed was a competitive proposal." He added that "New York put together a very competitive package to keep what is a very good company."
The letter of intent announced today is between Ciba and Halpern Enterprises, which will lease Ciba 425,000 square feet of space at the Tarrytown corporate center complex, including a new 150,000 square-foot laboratory.
Various state and local approvals are necessary before the relocation of Ciba to Tarrytown can take place, the Greenburgh Town Supervisor, Paul Feiner, said.
While Richard Barth, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ciba, praised state and local officials for working hard to make the deal possible, a Ciba spokesman said yesterday that until all approvals are obtained, "it is not a done deal."

HEADLINE: Questions for the N.A.A.C.P.

 BODY:
Where is the N.A.A.C.P. headed under its president, the Rev. Benjamin Chavis? That is a pressing question, given the fruits of the so-called "National African-American Leadership Summit" staged by Mr. Chavis this week in Baltimore.
Black elected officials, including all but one member of the 39-seat Congressional Black Caucus, avoided the meeting in droves. Also absent were some prominent non-government civil rights figures, including Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
 Many who stayed away did so for fear of being associated with the Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, well known for his anti-Semitic railings and especially his description of Judaism as "a gutter religion." Also present was the anti-Semitic black supremacist Leonard Jeffries.
For all the noise and hurt feelings it caused, the meeting came forth with nothing. On education reform, economic development, crime control -- all matters of pressing importance to the African-American poor, trapped in the inner cities -- no new proposals were announced.
The N.A.A.C.P. has been central to the quest for racial equality. Its efforts in such landmark events as Brown v. Board of Education have contributed immeasurably to the common good. Why sully that history by seeming to legitimize prejudice? And why risk political capital for what turned out to be a photo opportunity?
The answers lie with Mr. Chavis himself. Speaking of Mr. Farrakhan's presence, he said, "Never again will we allow an external force to dictate who we can meet with." In other words, Mr. Chavis wanted to prove his independence and demonstrate to his critics that he will do what he wants, and let the rest of the world take a hike.
Rhetoric like that plays well with crowds. But it falls far short of a statement of mission or a program for "improving the quality of life for the African-American community," which Mr. Chavis says was the convention's aim. Economic development, to choose just one subject, cannot be addressed through shrill rhetoric. It requires sober thought and conversation with the minority community, Government officials, bankers and corporate leaders, among others.
Mr. Chavis wants to "broaden" the N.A.A.C.P.'s appeal to inner-city blacks. It would be a tragedy for the country, the N.A.A.C.P. and Mr. Chavis himself if "broadening" came to mean empty rhetoric and public acceptance of bigotry.

The Tony Scandals

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
On Monday Edward Albee, the author of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" became the first American playwright to be invited to a state dinner at the Clinton White House. But only the night before, Mr. Albee had been persona non grata at the theatrical gala of the year: the Tony Awards.
No wonder the Clintons invited Mr. Albee. His new hit play, "Three Tall Women," won the Pulitzer Prize this spring. But that's not enough to win Mr. Albee a place at the Tonys. Because "Three Tall Women" is not playing at a theater owned by the club that controls the awards, it is designated an Off Broadway show and is barred from the potentially lucrative Tony competition. Mr. Albee's name went unmentioned at Sunday's Tony broadcast on CBS. 
 A scandal? Only the first of several. Thanks to easily manipulated rules, even some acclaimed artists who did turn up on Broadway this season, from the choreographer Lar Lubovitch ("The Red Shoes") to the actor Richard Chamberlain ("My Fair Lady"), were ineligible for Tonys while shows no one remembers ("Cyrano") received multiple nominations. As Variety has reported, many Tony voters flagrantly violate the balloting regulations. Then there was the Tony broadcast itself -- a flop with critics and Nielsen households alike.
Why does it matter? The Tony show is the New York theater's last, not-to-be-squandered toehold in network television. As recently as 1980 the broadcast commanded almost a third of the Nielsen audience -- a rating that fell by more than 50 percent in a decade, even before last Sunday's disastrous competition from a Knicks finals game. A dishonest, unwatched and unwatchable Tony show not only diminishes the theater but its artists -- not to mention a city whose economy and culture demand a healthy Broadway.
Nathan Lane, the young comic star of "Laughter on the 23rd Floor," felt this year's Tony broadcast confirmed the public impression that "on the entertainment food chain, the theater is somewhere between clog dancing and accordion playing." Mr. Lane was struck by the B-list Hollywood presenters ("Melanie Griffith saw a play once, but she didn't stay for the whole thing") and the show's reliance on taped pieces instead of live performance. "I began expecting a high-school film on personal hygiene," he said, "and by the end I was hoping for one."
Others felt, as the past Tony winner Jackie Mason put it, that the broadcast was "coming at them from a museum." The show opened with a salute to revivals -- "plays from yesterday," as a lyric rubbed it in -- and a tribute to the fuzzily identified George Abbott, age 106.
Only next to Mr. Abbott could a show that included a dowager's cryptic flashback to the Stage Door Canteen look youthful. Though the broadcast's theme was "The Past, the Present and the Future," the present barely registered as disoriented hosts rushed through the awards. The future mainly consisted of a five-minute plug for a coming revival of the 1927 "Show Boat." This production represents the future in only one way: Most of its tickets will cost $75, with even rear balcony matinee seats going for $55.
The Tony show was so dreary that it even failed to reap the traditional large economic rewards for its winners. Only the most conspicuous loser, Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," sold a ton of tickets the next day, aided by a terrific commercial that captured more of the theater's joy than any of the Tony broadcast proper. Four other Tony nominees announced their closings the next morning, and few in the theater were willing to bet that either the Tony-winning best play ("Angels in America: Perestroika") or musical ("Passion") would run past Labor Day.
In July, the few remaining Broadway attractions may be upstaged by the hearings that Attorney General Oliver Koppell will soon announce, as he steps up his criminal investigation into the path of prime tickets from box-office computers to scalpers. Against this backdrop of rock-bottom p.r., isn't it time for Broadway's creative minds to liberate the Tonys from the elderly businessmen who monopolize them and their acquiescent patrons at the out-to-lunch CBS?
An awards show that embraced the entire theatrical community and was written and cast by a Wendy Wasserstein, Stephen Sondheim, Tony Kushner and George Wolfe might be so much fun that it could even find a place on the schedule at Fox.

HEADLINE: Why Can't We Have a True Waterfront Park on the Hudson?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Down by the Riverside" (editorial, June 5) praises the new path along Manhattan's Hudson River waterfront. As you write: "who needs fancy when a great waterway is dancing practically at one's feet?" 
 The Urban Development Corporation, that's who. This state authority has been seeking control of the waterfront and has repackaged and renamed itself the Hudson River Park Conservancy. But development is still its middle name. It is promoting a grandiose and ill-conceived scheme for the Hudson River waterfront, which would let the river dance at the feet of shopping malls, high rises and commercial development while blocking the river for the rest of us.
Like you, I believe that "grand and glitzy" schemes, costing billions and taking more than 20 years, have no place on the Hudson River. I support a plan conceived by the Federation to Preserve The Greenwich Village Waterfront & Great Port, on whose executive committee I serve. This is a plan for a true waterfront park, green, glorious, open and simple, with no development attached, one that can be built in years, not decades, and one that we can afford right now.
The $1.4 million that built the waterfront path is a small portion of the Federal money available for a true waterfront park. The rebuilding of Route 9A along the river entitles the state to money from the Federal Highway Trust Fund for "scenic enhancement purposes." An all-green park fits that definition. A development park doesn't.
Indeed, part of that Federal money, $80 million originally earmarked for Westway, is in the state's treasury at this moment, waiting to be used. Yet the Hudson River Park Conservancy has been fighting to return this $80 million to the Federal Government. Why? Because accepting it would automatically preclude development along the waterfront. And development -- not parks or dancing waters or conserving anything except perhaps their jobs -- is what the Hudson River Park Conservancy is all about.
The Hudson River waterfront is our last open space. To use it for development, especially when the city has so many other areas available for and in need of development, is environmentally and economically absurd.

HEADLINE: FUTURE MARKETS;
Oil Price Is Highest In a Year

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 15

 BODY:
Oil prices bounded today to their highest levels in a year as OPEC oil ministers congratulated each other in Vienna and a report showed that supplies had fallen in the United States.
Crude oil for July delivery rose 91 cents, to $19.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, continuing an advance from the $14 range in March. 
 Analysts also pointed to fears of a North Korean confrontation with the West over nuclear weapons, and fresh signs that no oil would soon be flowing from Iraq.
 
Interest Rates Rise
 The surge in oil prices pushed the Commodity Research Bureau's index to its highest close in three and a half years, gaining 3.31 points, to 238.61. The sharp jump in commodity prices revived concerns about inflation, causing the bond market to sell off and interest rates to rise. [Page D8.]
Relatively low oil prices, brought about by steady and at times excessive production in the second half of last year, was a major reason why inflation in the United States remained in check.
By late in the day, all the provocations and fears seemed to feed each other. "A lot of times, the market interprets everything in a certain way," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Refined energy products also climbed today, although not as much as crude oil. Spot prices of gasoline rose 1.67 cents, to 52.15 cents a gallon; heating oil rose 2.65 cents, to 50.58 cents a gallon.
 
Gasoline Up at Pump
 At the pump, gasoline prices have also been rising steadily, although they tend to be less volatile than crude oil. Regular self-serve unleaded bottomed out at $1.02 in the March 11 Lundberg Survey, reaching $1.09 in the June 10 survey, the most recent.
Trilby Lundberg, whose North Hollywood, Calif., firm conducts these surveys, said that the reviving economy as well as higher crude oil prices were pushing up the cost of gasoline. "It's not just vacations," she added. "It's commerce, too."
Refineries are running at a high 92 percent of capacity, she said. But gasoline prices may still slip during the summer because producers have already stocked up on the grades necessary to meet pollution requirements.
OPEC leaders themselves wondered whether the advance in oil prices could be sustained. But over the longer run, some analysts said, stronger worldwide demand and increased discipline by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should keep prices from slipping back to the levels of earlier this year.
OPEC members agreed today to maintain their production limit of 24.52 million barrels a day through the end of the year. While that action was expected, the oil ministers' decision to forgo a planned September meeting underscored the group's renewed discipline.
Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiah, the energy minister of Qatar presiding over the OPEC conference, boasted in a speech that the organization's strength since its March meeting had surprised all who followed the industry. He said the group could agree on higher prices, but questioned whether demand would support them.
Mr. Lichtblau, in an interview from Vienna, said that the Iraqi oil minister had also stoked the market by denouncing United Nations resolutions concerning the region. Turkey and Iraq have discussed flushing 25 million or more barrels of oil through a pipeline that has been idle since the Persian Gulf war, but United Nations approval would be required.
On the supply side, the American Petroleum Institute reported that the nation's crude oil inventories fell 2.2 million barrels, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, last week.
Traders reported a shortage of West Texas intermediate oil supplies to satisfy futures contracts for July delivery that expire on Tuesday. Those who sold these contracts must either buy them back, at the current higher prices, or fulfill them by delivering oil. As a result of the supply squeeze in the United States, the West Texas intermediate price has run far ahead of North Sea Brent contracts for July delivery.
 
North Korean Issue Cited
 The confrontation over North Korea's nuclear program caused some traders to start calculating the odds of a battle there, which could disrupt some oil supplies or increase demand.
Speaking of the day's jitters, Kevin Lindemer sounded less like a petroleum markets specialist at Cambridge Energy Research Associates than a psychiatrist talking a patient through some reversals. "There's anxiety in the market," he said. "There are some psychological pressures there."
In the shorter term, he said he counted on buyers to regain their composure, making it unlikely that oil prices would stay this high in the near future. Oil prices last topped $20 a barrel on June 9, 1993.
But by the last quarter of the year, he said, diminished surpluses and reviving demand as the world's major economies recover could provide continuing support for oil prices. The International Energy Agency predicts that by the end of the year the world will demand a million more barrels of oil from OPEC each day than it plans on pumping.

Farm Prices Up Sharply
 By Bloomberg Business News
Soybean and corn prices soared yesterday, reacting to the National Weather Service's forecast of continued hot weather and less than normal rain in the Midwest.
Traders are concerned that dry weather will damage crops at a time when nationwide supplies are low in the aftermath of last summer's devastating flooding.
July soybeans settled 14.75 cents higher at $7.0525 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade. July corn gained 4.75 cents, to $2.80 a bushel.
After the extraordinary floods in the Mississippi and Missouri River basins and tributary areas in 1993, Midwest farmers now face the prospect of near-drought.
"There are places in the eastern Corn Belt -- parts of Indiana -- where the land is so dry it has cracks in it," said Dave Miller, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation in Park Ridge, Ill. "Basically, we need rain."
Elsewhere, gold and silver prices surged as rising oil and grain prices raised traders' concerns about possible inflation. August gold rose $2.60, to $389 an ounce, at the Commodity Exchange in New York, while July silver gained 13 cents, to $5.522 an ounce.
"This market was ready to go," said Daniel Weissman, head trader with MTB Bank in New York. "It just needed an excuse."

Dollar Falls Against Mark; Europe Rate Outlook Cited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the German mark yesterday, ending the day at its lowest point since late October amid growing speculation that Europe's economic recovery will halt a recent decline in interest rates across the Continent.
Although the Bundesbank and other European central banks cut interest rates several times this year, most remain higher than comparable American rates, making dollar-denominated assets less attractive to international investors. 
 "The Deutsche mark is coming back into favor for economic reasons," said John McCarthy, foreign-exchange manager at ING Capital Markets. "People are less bearish about Germany."
 
Mark and Swiss Franc Gain
 In New York, the dollar ended at 1.6364 marks, down more than a pfennig from 1.6470 marks on Tuesday.
The dollar also fell to a 20-month low of 1.3705 Swiss francs from 1.3870 francs. The Swiss currency has surged on reports that the president of the Swiss central bank said Swiss rates could rise sooner than expected.
Still, the dollar showed little change against the Japanese yen, slipping to 102.75 yen from 102.78 yen.
Germany's economy grew five-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter. With the economy reviving, the German central bank is under less pressure to lower interest rates to spur business activity.
The Bundesbank shaved its securities repurchase rate just 5 basis points yesterday, to 5.05 percent from 5.10 percent, indicating to many traders that the pace of German rate cuts was slowing. The repurchase rate is what German banks pay for most of the money they borrow from the Bundesbank.
 
Slower U.S. Growth
 At the same time, many currency traders are convinced that the American economy is not growing fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again soon. The Fed has raised short-term rates four times this year to control inflation.
The latest sign that growth is slowing came yesterday when the Fed reported that American factory capacity in use slipped to 83.5 percent in May from 83.6 percent in April, indicating that inflationary pressures were not building as rapidly as some expected.
"I don't see inflation getting away from us," a Fed governor, John P. LaWare, said yesterday. "The current numbers don't show it."
Many traders expect the dollar to continue its slide unless the Treasury begins another effort to rescue it. The Treasury called on the Fed and 18 other central banks to buy dollars on May 4.
"Dollar selling will continue until the Treasury does something to stop it," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign-Exchange Analytics, a market consulting firm. "The market is looking for the bottom in the dollar."
 
Canadian Dollar Tumbles
 Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar fell for the fourth straight day after big Canadian banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point.
In New York, the Canadian dollar tumbled to 71.97 United States cents from 72.20 cents. The Canadian dollar has fallen more than 5.5 percent since late January.
"I don't think we've seen the end of the decline" in the Canadian dollar, said Peter Sacks, president of Toron Capital Markets.
Yesterday, the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest financial institution, increased its prime lending rate to 7.25 percent, from 6.75 percent. The increase was matched by the country's five other major banks.

HEADLINE: Diluted Medicine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Nurse Paradigm," Anna Quindlen's June 1 column: 
 While the idea that nurses should examine patients, perform simple procedures and even prescribe medication is gaining momentum, it does not mean this trend will be advantageous for all patients or, for that matter, even for the future of medicine in the United States.
We are seeing a dilution in the quality of medicine practiced as standards are relaxed under the premise that basic medical care will become more widely available and affordable. The trend is to find ways to duplicate the functions of doctors without doctors. It would be more honest to admit that these changes are dictated by the economics of medicine. Insurance companies will take the opportunity to provide medical care at a lower cost to them, while insisting that quality remains the same, though physicians may not provide basic care. There is a hierarchy, and the physician is better trained.

HEADLINE: Technology Exports Mean U.S. Growth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is not correct to state that the Senate bill on exports "authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, acting alone, to grant relief from export controls" ("Too Relaxed on High-Tech Exports," editorial, May 29). The Secretary of Commerce leads the interagency government process to determine if relief is warranted, but is not the only actor. The process ends with the President in the absence of agency consensus. 
 Nor is it correct to say the legislation requires "that the U.S. Government relax its own controls within 18 months if they are not adopted by other supplier states." Both the Sen-
ate and House bills explicitly state that the President may decline to provide any relief from export controls, even if foreign availability is clearly established.
In discussing the General Accounting Office report on export licensing of nuclear-related items, you fail to note that 86 percent of the licenses granted to "questionable" countries were for computers.
The nuclear suppliers group -- the multilateral regime that regulates this trade -- has concluded that computers are not critical to the development of nuclear weapons and does not maintain them on its list of controlled items.
Accordingly, the United States has removed controls on lower-level computers to most destinations (excluding such countries as Iran, Iraq, Libya and North Korea), but maintains stricter controls than our allies on higher level computers to countries of nuclear concern.
Finally, there is no dispute that United States exports mean significant numbers of jobs, and the $18 billion of exports subject to licensing could account for hundreds of thousands of such jobs.
The real question is where does growth lie. In our economy it lies without question in exports generally and high-technology exports in particular. It is misleading to suggest that high-tech exports don't matter in economic terms because they are a small part of the total. They are the foundation of our ability to compete in the global marketplace.
When they contribute to developing weapons of mass destruction, we must control them, and the pending bills would let us do so better. When they do not, we should let United States exporters seek a fair market share, not limit them in creating sales and jobs.
