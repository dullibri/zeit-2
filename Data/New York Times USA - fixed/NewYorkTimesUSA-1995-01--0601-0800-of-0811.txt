HEADLINE: QUAKE IN JAPAN: IN KYOTO;
An Ancient City Hopes to Reassure Tourists That It Is Safe to Visit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan, Jan. 23

 BODY:
As if she did not face enough challenges becoming a geisha, what with endless training in the arts of teasing her hair and clients, Keiko Takada now must deal with an unexpected crisis that is affecting her job security.
The earthquake that devastated the city of Kobe, 40 miles to the southwest, did not at first do much damage in the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto. But since then the economic aftershocks have been rattling Kyoto without interruption, cutting sharply into tourism and myriad related businesses. 
 "We're very concerned," said Miss Takada, 17, a maiko, or apprentice geisha. "The earthquake was on the 17th, and that night all of our banquets were canceled. We had many customers in Kobe, so we're very alarmed about our business. I hear there are lots of cancellations, and I wonder what will happen."
Miss Takada paused and delicately adjusted her red and purple silk kimono, and a hint of anxiety showed through the layers of white makeup on her face.
"Even before this there was a recession," she explained earnestly, with the same charm and polish she uses at dinners to entertain business customers. "And now the earthquake has made the situation much worse."
Kyoto was the capital of Japan for more than 1,000 years, until 1868, and it is perhaps the foremost Japanese city for temples, tradition and tourists. But these days, all it has are temples and tradition.
Many of the tourists, on whom 30 percent of the economy depends, have been frightened away by the earthquake. Hotel lobbies are vacant, temple gardens are nearly empty, and entertainers like Miss Takeda are left to sit at home.
With train service disrupted, it is more difficult for people from western Japan to reach Kyoto. And in any case, Kyoto and Kobe are linked in the popular mind as neighbors -- some guidebooks cover both cities -- so that prospective visitors are turned off by the prospect of visiting an earthquake zone.
Nearly 40 million tourists normally visit Kyoto each year -- including 500,000 foreigners, of whom 90,000 are Americans -- but the number is now well below normal.
The city tourist office estimates that tourism has been cut in half, but that may be optimistic. The night sightseeing bus tour, which sold about 100 tickets an evening this time a year ago, is now selling just 20 an evening.
The earthquake has particularly affected the geisha and the tea houses where they work, entertaining businessmen with their charm and music and -- sometimes when the mood and money are right -- their bodies.
Geisha are not regarded as prostitutes, any more than surgeons are to be equated with seamstresses, for a geisha's training has much less to do with sex than with hairdos and music and courteous speech. Instead of fishnet stockings and high heels, they wear layers of kimonos secured with a most daunting obi, or belt.
Kyoto is a center for geisha, with 210 of them and another 71 maiko, but their prices are as impressive as their appearance. A few businessmen can easily spend more than $1,000 on a dinner with a geisha, sating their culinary appetites alone, and now they seem inclined to cut back on such expenses.
"Customers are businessmen, many of them small entrepreneurs from Osaka, Kobe and other areas hit by the earthquake," said Toshio Ozeki, a man who is an official of one of the geisha associations in Kyoto. "Now they would rather use their money to rebuild, instead of on entertainment.
"Even those customers not affected by the earthquake feel they should refrain from going to entertainment areas when there is so much suffering going on," Mr. Ozeki added, a bit regretfully.
Tetsuo Ito, an official in the Kyoto Tourism Association, said that the impact of the earthquake would probably last at least a year. He said the city wanted to get the message out that it was safe, but without any flamboyance that would be in poor taste considering the misery nearby in Kobe.
"Because of the suffering in Kobe, it would be inappropriate to have lots of flashy advertising, but we need to make some efforts to let people know that Kyoto is O.K.," Mr. Ito said.
Indeed, the frustration for people like Mr. Ito is that the only abnormal thing about Kyoto these days is the absence of tourists. While the earthquake jolted Kyoto badly, it caused no deaths in the city, only a few injuries and little damage.
The city's temples and cultural treasures survived almost unscathed. None of the buildings fell over, although a few cracks were reported in walls, and the worst harm was to wooden statues that toppled at Koryuji, a second-rank temple on the outskirts of town.
A 13th-century statue of a servant lost its left arm in the accident, and a 9th-century statue of the god of mercy lost its right arm. Experts are going to reattach the missing limbs, and the damage is expected not to be noticeable.
Dozens of other artifacts at the temple -- including a famous statue damaged in 1960 when a college student was overcome with its beauty and embraced it, snapping off a finger in his passion -- remained upright and were unhurt in the earthquake.
Many Japanese have grown critical of Buddhist temples, saying the monks have grown rapacious with exorbitant demands for money for funerals and other ceremonies. But while the monks acknowledge the criticisms, they attribute the earthquake to chance alone.
"This can't be a punishment," said Yorito Matsuda, the curator of the Koryuji. "We've prayed very faithfully every day and looked after everything carefully."
At the Nishi Honganji, an important temple in the center of the city, about 20 stone lanterns fell over. Homei Komagai, a Buddhist priest at the temple, said that the lanterns were about 300 years old but that they did not seem to have special historic or cultural importance.
A greater concern at the temple was that many of its donors lived in Kobe.
"We're concerned about their safety," Mr. Komagai said, "and also about their ability to continue to contribute."

HEADLINE: President Will Seek a Higher Minimum Wage, Senior Aides Say

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton will buck certain Congressional opposition to seek an increase in the minimum wage as a sign of his resolve to buttress the earning power of working Americans and stress the value of work, senior White House officials said today.
In the face of widespread demands for new requirements that would force welfare recipients to find jobs or lose benefits, administration aides described the President's proposal as one step toward providing new incentives for work. 
 But the proposal would be largely symbolic since some leaders of the new Republican Congress are opposed to the very concept of a minimum wage, much less an increase in the Federal standard, which has been $4.25 an hour for the last four years. The White House is leaning toward an increase to $5 an hour, phased in over several years.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said today that the President's economic advisers had given him their recommendations on the subject over the weekend, and that Mr. Clinton had a "very firm idea" of how to proceed and would announce his decision "at the appropriate time." Mr. McCurry and other officials declined to say whether the President would broach the subject in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
Mr. Clinton himself, asked whether he would announce an increase in the speech, said only, "Tune in tomorrow." But in discussing the possibility earlier this month, the President noted the long-term erosion in the value of the minimum wage and said, "The number one mission of the country in this recovery is to raise incomes."
For weeks, Presidential advisers and Democrats in Congress have debated how to handle a proposal that appeals to traditional Democratic constituencies like organized labor, but that some economists look askance at and that has little chance of passing. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has proposed an increase to $5.75 an hour over three years, and some unions complain the White House proposal is too timid.
But the White House has been wary lest the proposal peg the President as a captive of old-fashioned liberal thinking, emphasize his weakness vis-a-vis Congress and overshadow the broader blueprint of tax breaks, educational incentives and hopes for the second half of his term that he hopes to sketch in his speech.
Advocates within the Administration like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich have argued that an increase of 50 cents an hour would essentially compensate for inflation since the last increase, from $3.80 in 1991. Coupled with an additional 25-cent increase in coming years, they say, the move would boost incomes of the lowest-salaried workers without big new Government spending and with little overall reduction in employment, positioning Mr. Clinton as champion of the little guy.
It would also redeem a promise of Mr. Clinton's campaign -- one that was deferred in the fall of 1993 to avoid alienating business leaders, whose support the Administration wanted for its health care and trade proposals, and who remain generally opposed to an increase.
The House Majority Leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, today repeated his resolute opposition to any increase in the minimum wage.
"It's a heartfelt issue with me," Mr. Armey told reporters, as he left the White House after a signing ceremony for a new law to require Congress to abide by the same workplace and employment standards it imposes on the private sector, a bill Mr. Clinton described as a first step in making government "more open, more fair, and less elitist."
Mr. Armey added: "I've seen the pain of people who desperately need work having lost their job because of increases in minimum wages. This is not an issue that anybody takes lightly. It's a question of real difference of opinion. I can again just reiterate my point: I will resist an increase in the minimum wage with every fiber of my being."
Much recent economic research has called into question the longstanding view that increasing the minimum wage is undermined by resulting job losses. Economists have found that when the wage is increased, overall growth in income for workers who keep their jobs exceeds the income lost by those who lose theirs, and that a higher minimum wage makes work more attractive than welfare.
Studies also have found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, about two-thirds of the 2.5 million hourly workers who are paid the minimum wage are adults, who often provide much of their family income, not teenagers, who need less help.
Of course, raising the minimum wage also has the effect of shifting the cost of such workers a bit to business and away from the Government. Mr. Clinton's advisers contend that curtailing welfare benefits for those who do not seek work should be coupled with new incentives and higher wages for those who do.
But some conservative Democrats argue that the minimum wage may need to be reduced in some cases to spur job opportunities.

Chart: "UPDATE: A Closer Look at a Mixed Record"
 President Clinton rode to the White House on a campaign of ambitious promises. After two years, some have been redeemed, others abandoned. Still more are imperiled by Congress's new Republican majority.
 
The Economy
 Roaring along, with five million jobs created and the budget deficit slashed in half. But Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his risingj interest rates could slow growth going into the 1996 Presidential election.
 
Taxes
 The wealthiest got a heavier burden, and the poorest got new breaks. But there was a Republican victory before Mr. Clintondecided to honor his campaign pledge of a tax cut for the middle class.
 
Government
 Getting smaller, with 98,000 Federal jobs cut since Mr. Clinton took office and the size of the workforce approaching that of the Kennedy era. But will Vice President Al Gore's knifework be enough to stave off the Republican ax?
 
Trade
 The free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada was passed, the international trade pact was renewed and Mr. Clinton won comitments to vast free trade zones by early in the next century. But the crumbling peso is a reminder that partnerships carry peril.
 
Foreign Affairs
 Haiti is free, North Korea says it will give up its nuclear weapons and the war has quieted in Bosnia. Yet White House wobbliness raises a question: should the credit go to Mr. Clinton or to former President Jimmy Carter?
 
Health Care
 A year in Congress's spotlight leaves the pet project withered with no laws passed and little hope. Even the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton concede that their dream of universal coverge proved a political nightmare.
 
Welfare
 Left on a back burner, the promise to get tough with welfare recipients never came to a boil, allowing Republicans to seize the initiative as they take control of Congress.
 
Social Policy
 Millions of Americans got new guaranteed leave for childbirth and sick care. But instead of ending the ban on gays serving in the military, Mr. Clinton offered this: "Don't ask; don't tell."
 
Crime
 Some 100,000 new police officers are on their way to the streets, and the tough controls on handguns and assault weapons that Mr. Clinton backed are in place. But a renewed fight is brewing as Republicans threaten to strip the crime law of measures they label big-spending and anti-hunter.
 
Politics
 It is still business as usual as Congress delays putting restrictions on fundraising and lobbying, leaving Mr. Clinton to keep on raising millions under loose ruls. But the White House is gearing up to make its proposed tighter rules a test of Republicans' willingness tow ash their hands of old ways.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Pair Confront A City's Budget Woes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
As political partners eager to untangle the financial mess of the nation's capital, they could not be an odder couple.
With liberal spending and hiring practices during his previous terms as Mayor of Washington, Marion S. Barry Jr. had a hand in creating the city's $500 million deficit. Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, a Republican from Northern Virginia and head of the subcommittee that oversees city affairs, is part of the new Congressional majority eager to slash social spending and skeptical of Mr. Barry's leadership. 
 But through the first weeks of the new Congress and the new Barry administration, no partisan fights have emerged. Nor have lines been drawn in the sand. Mr. Barry has assured Congress that he will cut a $3.3 billion budget to return the District to financial solvency, and Mr. Davis has promised to give him time, at least a few months, before Congress would step in to avert the embarrassment of a bankruptcy.
"I think you have to give them the leeway to succeed or to screw up," Mr. Davis said in an interview last week. "They have to be able to make their own decisions."
But what those decisions are remains undefined, adding a dash of tension between the Democratic Mayor and his Republican overseers. Mr. Barry has said only that on March 1 he would announce detailed plans for his budget. They are expected to include layoffs, furloughs and other cost-cutting measures that will mean fewer police, a reduction in hospital services, library closings and less frequent garbage collection -- but most important to city leaders -- a diminished role for Congress in running the city.
Congress, which gives the District about $650 million a year, has demanded at least $140 million in cuts. The City Council has asked for twice that. And Mr. Barry has said his staff has identified at least $431 million in cuts.
How did the capital fall into such disarray? During the 1980's, Mr. Barry nourished his base of support by expanding government employment rolls by thousands and awarding many city contracts on a no-bid basis. By the time his third term ended after his arrest for cocaine possession, the city was careering toward financial disaster. And while his successor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, loudly criticized him for allowing the city to crumble, she failed to cut spending fast enough or deep enough to avert the growing deficit.
By 1991, Mrs. Kelly's first year in office, Washington had become a model of inefficiency, with the highest per-capita expenditures, $9,516, among major American cities, far ahead of second-place New York, at $5,568. The District also had the highest per-capita spending for welfare, $1,156 (with New York second, at $891), according to the United States Department of Commerce.
More recently, the city secured a loan of $250 million from lending institutions to meet its current payroll, Mr. Barry agreed to turn over some control of the city's housing authority to a court, and he said the police force could be reduced by 15 percent, about 600 officers.
To solve this mess, Mr. Davis and Mr. Barry have begun a respectful waltz of accommodation, with Mr. Davis suggesting obvious cuts for the District -- like the District of Columbia Law School and a prison run by the city in Lorton, Va. -- but leaving the details to Mr. Barry.
"I think we're on target," Mr. Barry said.
The city can hardly afford not to be. Already, the new Congress has shown its regard for the District's efforts at greater stature. Just two years after its lone delegate in the House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, gained voting rights for the first time, the new House took them away, prompting renewed cries among residents of "taxation without representation."
The new Congress has also dashed thoughts of statehood, once a major goal of city leaders.
But, Mr. Davis said, the Mayor deserves time to show he is serious about spending cuts in the face of overwhelming skepticism among his colleagues. "I don't think you'll find 1 in 10 who thinks he is going to do it," Mr. Davis said.
Yet, dangling a carrot before the Mayor, Mr. Davis said he would consider commonwealth status for the District, a designation that would eliminate Federal income tax, as a way to attract new residents and businesses. In 1993, local residents paid $1.6 billion in Federal taxes, more than all but Connecticut and New Jersey among the states on a per-capita basis. Yet the city's population has been declining for years, down to 585,000 in 1992.
"It's an idea I really thought was stupid and the District would have thought was stupid two years ago," Mr. Davis said of commonwealth status. "But now I think it's something you ought to look at in your tool bag."
Both Mr. Barry and Mrs. Norton said their staffs were studying the economic implications of commonwealth status, perhaps as an interim step toward statehood, as Mr. Barry said. But cutting fast enough to satisfy Congress may be a more formidable task, given the dire circumstances at hand.
It seems to matter less to Congress where the cuts are made than that they are made quickly.
"You have to get the financial straight early on," said Mr. Davis, a former chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, which faced a $200 million deficit in 1992 before he eliminated it within 18 months.
If Mr. Barry's deliberate response has caused some concern along lawmakers, so have several recent incidents that appeared to call his leadership and judgment into question.
After a high school student was shot to death at school this month by another student, Mr. Barry acknowledged having no ideas how to stop such incidents from occurring again. Nor has he provided details about how the private sector will create 10,000 new jobs, as he promised in his campaign.
He has also drawn criticism for not fully explaining the financing of a new security fence at his home.
But he has navigated successes, as well, including a deal with Abe Pollin, owner of professional basketball and hockey teams, to build a downtown sports arena at little public expense. And those are encouraging signs to Mr. Davis.
"I think the members are now saying: 'You know, we've been embarrassed. We've been defending this city, and look at the situation,' " Mr. Davis said. "So I think at this point, members in both parties and all races are going to have to say: 'Look, we have a problem. Let's not dwell on how it came about, who's to blame. Let's see if we can solve it.' Because, for heaven's sake, the last thing that I believe that Republicans and Congress want to do is take over the city."

HEADLINE: Illinois Town a 'Testing Field' in Labor Relations

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill.

 BODY:
The ovens of industry are burning with gusto in this old prairie city's east end, where factories abut dormant black cornfields and the asphalt skirts of auto body shops and bowling alleys. Day and night, the A. E. Staley corn milling plant belches plumes of smoke that dust the downtown with a scent as sweet and thick as a bakery's.
A few blocks up 22d Street from Staley, the two-story brick plant of the world's No. 1 tire and rubber company, the Bridgestone Corporation of Tokyo, is operating, too, and so, a few blocks farther up 22d, is the still bigger plant of the world's No. 1 producer of earth-moving equipment, Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria. 
 These are three of Decatur's largest employers. All are embroiled in their longest labor disputes ever, and all are running, although most of their 4,000 unionized workers are on the street. All of which has made this city of 85,000 a national metaphor for the turmoil within an American labor movement to which just 1-in-8 private industry workers belong, less than half the level 20 years ago.
Labor and management are dug in deep in Decatur. Management, blaming competitive pressures, has been mowing down labor costs -- holding down wages, cutting benefits and staff, keeping machinery running 24 hours a day. Labor has given up hope of reversing losses. But more emphatically here than anyplace else, it is trying to halt its slide toward irrelevance.
Decatur "is a kind of testing field," said Robert W. Cassidy, 60, a member of the United Automobile Workers who has been driving forklifts in the Caterpillar plant for 38 years.
The disputes here, involving about 10,000 additional workers at Caterpillar and Bridgestone plants elsewhere in Illinois and in five other states, has also set the stage for a nationwide test for organized labor.
Beginning this month with the railroads, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, 707 contracts covering the 3.4 million employees of public and private institutions with 1,000 or more workers are up for renegotiation this year, the highest number of workers in the 11 years in which the bureau has kept track.
The Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, says that these negotiations could spur an incipient trend of labor-management collaboration, with both sides seeing something to gain from an employer's success.
In strikebound Decatur, at least, there's no whiff of such amity. "These work stoppages represent three examples of employer aggressiveness in bargaining that we didn't see 15 years ago," said Peter Feuille, director of the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations at the University of Illinois.
Staley, citing sabotage and vandalism after imposing 12-hour shifts, locked out its workers in June 1993 and brought in temporary replacements. Caterpillar's workers struck last June, blaming management for anti-union harassment; they, too, have been temporarily replaced.
Bridgestone's employees struck in July rather than accept a contract with shift changes, benefit cuts and lower wages than Goodyear workers have won. Although the Government this month goaded Bridgestone and Caterpillar to talk with their unions, Bridgestone says that settlement or not, 650 of its 1,200 strikers here have been permanently replaced.
The Decatur plants, Mr. Feuille said, "are willing to tolerate a great deal of labor-management strife in exchange for a more advantageous contract, so you end up with three very long-running disputes that don't seem to have any end in sight."
The companies' regular workers here are nearly all men 45 to 60 years old who earned $30,000 to more than $60,000 a year. Some are collecting only $60 a week in union strike benefits; most seem to be getting by with part-time jobs, charitable contributions and donations from local unions elsewhere.
But they say that they will pay the price of staying out to defend their wages, job security and eight-hour days with weekends free.
"Push comes to shove and I'm not going any further," said Tom Jordan, 45, a Caterpillar machinist for 21 years and member of the United Automobile Workers union. "If it costs me my job, it costs me my job."
Fred Quick, 57, an inspector who has worked for Caterpillar for 26 years, said, "It's about respect, and a little dignity along with that."
The issue for unions in Decatur and across the nation is not what more they can win for workers, but what previous gains they keep.
Industry, by contrast, is in the strongest position in years to argue for a strike-free less-regulated economy. Like most American industry until the 1980's, Staley, Bridgestone and Caterpillar could grant regular wage increases to workers and pack those increases onto the prices they charge customers.
But with the erosion of trade barriers, the companies say they must work in a global economy and vie with competitors, foreign and domestic, whose costs are lower. They want fewer workers and they want to use them more efficiently -- on days, nights and weekends -- so that they never need to stop production.
So in October 1992, after its last labor contract expired, Staley instituted a wrenching change. Owned since 1988 by Tate & Lyle, the British food processing company, Staley said it would invest in labor-saving machinery, cut the workforce of 750 to 250 or fewer over several years, and institute 12-hour rotating shifts in which for one month, an employee works three days in a row, 6 A.M. to 6 P.M., then takes three days off. The next month, the employee shifts to nights, working three nights on, three off. His total hours each month are about the same as they were in an eight-hour five-day week.
But "you forget about weekends," said Richard Brummett, 49, a Staley worker for 24 years. Companies like Staley, Mr. Brummett said, are simply trying to put unions out of business.
"Absolutely not true," said J. Patrick Mohan, executive vice president of Staley. The workers, he said, are simply "resistant to change."
"Our intention is to try to make the plant competitive with other corn wet-milling plants," Mr. Mohan said. Bridgestone and Caterpillar say they face similar competitive pressures. Caterpillar lost more than $600 million in 1991 and 1992, although it has recovered and had profits last year of $955 million. Trevor C. Hoskins, a spokesman for Bridgestone's American operations, said those businesses lost $1 billion from 1990 to 1992 and are barely profitable now. "We said to the union that we had to return to a competitive position," he said.
That meant workers must help pay for their health insurance, agree to shift schedules permitting plants to run all week and accept a two-tier wage system in which new workers would be paid 30 percent less than veteran workers performing the same jobs.
To block such demands, unions once had a deadly weapon, the strike, which forced concessions from both sides.
Since the late 1970's, however, more job seekers have been willing to cross picket lines. And since the 1980's, more companies have been willing to deploy a mightier weapon than the strike: the permanent replacement worker.
As a result, unions today try to avoid strikes. The number of strikes against employers of 1,000 or more workers has plunged from hundreds a year from the 1940's through the 1970's to fewer than 50 a year in the 1990's, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. "Strikes don't work," said David Watts, president of Staley's paperworkers' union, Local 7837.
The specter of permanent replacement figures in all three disputes in Decatur. Since companies can permanently replace workers only when disputes involve economic issues like wages and benefits, Staley and Caterpillar workers have emphasized noneconomic issues, like union rights and working conditions.
By contrast, the rubber workers' strike against Bridgestone involves wages and benefits. On Jan. 4, management attempted to scare the union back to the bargaining table by declaring that about half of the company's 4,000 union members had been permanently replaced.
Management could be bluffing. In letters that day offering the temporary workers permanent status, the company said that "under certain circumstances, other factors could result in the return of striking employees to their former jobs." Still, the action has terrified strikers.
Mr. Reich attributes the Decatur companies' tough position to managers who undervalue workers.
All the while, he said, there is another trend afoot. Companies like Levi Strauss in San Francisco and Nynex in New York are underscoring employee loyalty, helping them develop skills and paying them well.
"It's almost as if there are two management philosophies," Mr. Reich said. "One seeks to cut payrolls and reduce labor costs and tries to bust unions or control union power. The other seeks to empower workers and give them a greater voice." Which is winning? "It's too early to tell," he said.
Not in Decatur, where the notions of teamwork lost out some time ago. Caterpillar tried it in the late 1980's, but new management saw the company moving into the red and eventually abandoned the experiment.
In 1988, when Bridgestone bought the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, the Japanese managers called everyone, workers and managers, "associates."
"They stressed that we were one and were all working for the same goal," said Randy Gordon, the vice president of Bridgestone's United Rubber Workers Local 713 here.
But Firestone, headed toward bankruptcy at the time, proved a colossal money loser, so labor became a cost to cut.
"Sometime around 1990, 1991," said Mary Brummett, a volunteer office manager for the paperworkers' union her husband, Richard belongs to, "it seems like everybody, all the companies, decided they didn't have to be nice anymore."

HEADLINE: Japan Market Still Nervous Over Quake

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Tokyo stock market tried to recover today from a severe selloff brought on by last week's earthquake, as investors continued to fear that the disaster in Kobe would damage Japan's economy and businesses.
On Monday, Japanese stocks suffered their worst one-day loss in nearly three and a half years. The decline in Tokyo pulled down other stock markets throughout Asia, especially in Hong Kong, as concern mounted that Japanese investors would pull their money out of these other markets to help pay for rebuilding at home. 
 "It looks to me like what you would call a stampede," Jeff Bahrenburg, the equities strategist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said after the Nikkei index of 225 stocks plummeted 5.6 percent on Monday.
The Nikkei fell 1,054.73 points, to 17,785.49, its lowest level in a little over a year. In percentage terms, it was the Nikkei's largest decline in a single day since Aug. 19, 1991, and the 12th-largest fall since 1949.
Today, however, the Nikkei rebounded from early selling and closed up 275.24 points, or 1.55 percent, to 18,060.73 at midday. Still, many traders remained quite skittish about the market's prospects.
In the first two days after last Tuesday's earthquake, stocks barely fell as investors were unsure of the extent of the damage. But as the magnitude of the catastrophe became clearer, the stock decline accelerated, with foreign investors among the most active sellers, analysts said.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index, which accounts for 70 percent of the market's capitalization, dropped 310.17 points, or 4.26 percent, to close Monday at 6,967.93, its lowest level since July 1993. It was virtually unchanged at midday today.
Stocks also fell sharply in Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Australia on Monday, although most began to stabilize today.
The earthquake is not the only factor depressing stocks in Hong Kong and other Asian markets. Another is the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board in the United States will soon raise interest rates. In addition, Asian markets have been weakened by reports that China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping, is near death, leading to concerns about instability in China. All this while the Mexican peso crisis has undermined investor confidence in industrializing nations worldwide.
Economists are divided on how the earthquake will affect Japan's economy, which has just started to recover from three years of recession. Most economists say that in the short run the quake, which killed more than 5,000 people, will hurt the economy. Factories have been damaged and cannot produce, and shipping and transportation have been severely disrupted.
But in the long run, the money spent to rebuild Kobe and surrounding cities should stimulate economic growth, as the construction industry booms and people buy homes and goods to replace what they have lost.
"We are bringing years of future consumption right into 1995," said Tod Wood, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo.
The disagreements tend to be over the relative duration and size of the negative and positive effects. Those like Mr. Wood who see the positive effects outweighing the negative ones think that stock prices will rise before too long.
But others say that the market might continue to sink and that Monday's huge drop was justified.
"There's been a very large destruction of property and, more important, confidence," said John V. Baldwin, director of research and strategy at Jardine Fleming Securities here.
There are several other ways, besides lost production, that the earthquake could hurt the economy and the stock market.
The costs of rebuilding, which some estimates now put at $100 billion, will add to the national budget deficit. Increased borrowing by the Government is expected to lead to a rise in interest rates, which would dampen business investment.
Japan's banks are expected to suffer because some of their less financially strong borrowers will be pushed out of business by the earthquake and will not repay their loans.
Besides bank stocks, shares of securities companies, electronics companies and electric utilities lost value on Monday, as they did last week. Construction company stocks generally gained last week on the anticipation of increased business, and they showed signs of recovery today from Monday's selloff.
Even before the earthquake, the Tokyo market had been falling from the Nikkei index's recent peak near 21,500, which was reached in June. That is partly because the economic recovery is turning out to be somewhat weaker than the market might have anticipated, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Plan to Aid Business on Tax Fades

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The only item in the Congressional Republicans' Contract With Americathat was meant strictly to be a boon to business appears to stand no chance of becoming law.
The measure, which was supposed to give businesses more generous tax deductions when they bought expensive machinery and equipment, does not even have the support of the industries it wants to help. Top Republican lawmakers have also expressed qualms that it could end up sharply increasing future budget deficits. 
 The prospects are better for a part of the Republican contract of particular interest to individual investors -- more favorable tax treatment of capital gains. But that proposal also faces formidable obstacles: a Democratic filibuster in the Senate and a possible veto by President Clinton.
The Clinton Administration maintains that these two Republican tax measures would lead people to invest their money with more of an eye toward reducing their tax liability than on making a profit, a once-common practice that was largely eliminated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
"These proposals, if enacted, would result in significant tax shelter transactions and encourage investment in uneconomic activities," Leslie B. Samuels, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy, told the House Ways and Means Committee two weeks ago.
The reason, according to Administration officials, is that Wall Street would take advantage of the new tax breaks to create paper losses for executives and professionals with big salaries on exotic shelters similar to the oil and gas ventures, leasing deals and race horse partnerships of the past.
At a new series of hearings before that committee beginning on Tuesday, some economists and tax lawyers will side with the Administration on this point.
But supporters of the bigger tax break for capital gains, which are the profits made from investments, say they will testify that the most abusive tax shelters would still be outlawed.
While capital gains will be subject to a lively debate, the proposal to allow businesses to use a new and more favorable way of writing off investments in machinery and equipment appears to have little enthusiastic support.
"We've got questions about its effectiveness and certainly are taking a careful look at it," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members would be some of the main beneficiaries of more generous depreciation rules.
A prominent business lobbyist, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, said, "As best I can ascertain, this is an orphan with no discernible set of parents in the business community."
The reluctance of businesses to embrace the proposal is based on the political calculation that Congress cannot be trusted to leave the tax laws alone.
Depreciation deductions are meant to allow businesses to write off the cost of investments over the lifetime of the purchase. Different schedules are used for different kinds of investments. Furnaces in apartment buildings, for instance, are expected to last 27.5 years. Computers and automobiles, though, can be written off over five years. While there are variations that sometime allow bigger tax breaks in earlier years, in general that means a $100,000 investment in new computers, say, would translate into a corporate tax deduction of $20,000 a year for five years.
The measure in the G.O.P. contract would make the depreciation deductions on machinery and equipment slightly less generous the first few years and then make the tax break much larger in later years. In almost all cases, the eventual total deductions would be significantly larger than under current accounting rules and much greater than the original price of the equipment.
But business executives worry that they would forgo some deductions in the early years only to have Congress change the law so they never get the promised write-offs.
"There is some element of trepidation about buying a plan that you think may be changed in the long term," Mr. Jasinowski said.
The depreciation measure, called a neutral cost recovery system, sticks out of the Contract With America like a tall tree in the desert. It is the only item in the contract -- the political manifesto that was the platform for the Republican Congressional campaigns last year -- that does not have broad popular appeal.
The cost recovery proposal was introduced in the House last year by Representative Nick Smith, a Republican from Michigan. It never came to a vote. But Mr. Smith had nearly 100 co-sponsors, including Newt Gingrich, who is now Speaker of the House, and Dick Armey, the new majority leader.
Mr. Smith said in an interview today that no particular company or interest had lobbied him on the matter. He said he had offered the measure because he thought it would stimulate economic growth, generate jobs and put American manufacturers on an equal footing with those in other industrial countries where tax breaks are more generous.
One of its attractions, he said, is that it would actually increase tax revenue by $18 billion in the first five years, which is the period in which Federal budgets are usually calculated.
A staff assistant said that the measure was included in part because of budgetary considerations and in part because the authors wanted to satisfy an important Republican constituency, big business.
In retrospect, both seem to have been miscalculations.
While the measure would help lower the deficit slightly in the first five years, it would lose $139 billion in tax revenue in the next five years, according to Treasury calculations. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the total cost of the measure over 10 years was unacceptable to him.
And Representative Smith conceded, "The response from business has been somewhat guarded."
Mr. Samuels, the Treasury official, testified that the new depreciation rules and the proposed break on capital gains threatened a repeat of the early to mid-1980's, when so many office buildings were built in part because the laws were so generous to real estate tax shelters.
Other tax experts agree that when the taxes on one form of investment are lower than on others, financial instruments are created that are based not on profits but on allowing investors to take advantage of the tax break.
But those analysts say that Mr. Saumels probably exaggerated the effect of the Republican proposals. New tax shelters would be inhibited, they say, by a provision of the 1986 law that the Republicans do not intend to repeal. That provision forbids the extensive use of tax losses on investments to offset tax liability from salaries.
"I don't see a big business on the tax shelter side of this," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers.

HEADLINE: Stock Jitters Over Mexican Aid Package

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market dropped sharply yesterday morning, but rallied just as sharply in the afternoon as Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, sought to reassure nervous financial markets that the Clinton Administration's $40 billion rescue of Mexico "is going to happen."
The leading stock indexes yesterday closed mixed after being sharply negative most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.02 points, to 3,867.41, the third consecutive decline for the blue-chip index. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.04 points, to 465.82, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.54 points, to 759.51. 
 The markets have been volatile for several days now as investors watched the partisan wrangling on Capitol Hill over approval of the Mexican aid package. Other factors adding to the volatility include the earthquake damage in Kobe that has begun to undermine the Japanese stock market, and a market consensus that the Federal Reserve is all but certain to raise interest rates at its two-day meeting that begins next Tuesday.
Stock, bond and currency traders are therefore scrambling to figure out what to do with dollar-denominated assets, as worldwide demand for credit appears to be rising, in part because of the need to rebuild both earthquake-battered Kobe and Mexico's shattered economy.
The markets followed no clear pattern yesterday. Bond prices fell a little, but the dollar rallied on international currency markets and the price of gold, a fever chart for concern about inflation, fell. Markets calmed following Mr. Gingrich's remarks around 2 P.M. that he would cooperate with the President to pass aid to Mexico.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 325.8 million shares changing hands, slightly above this year's daily average of 323 million shares.
The American depository receipts of Wellcome, a British pharmaceutical company, soared 4 3/8, to 15 1/8, after Glaxo, the world's second- largest drug company, offered to pay $16.20 a share for Wellcome. The combination would create the world's largest drug company. Wellcome was the most active stock, with 9.1 million shares traded.
Cyrix shares closed up 3 3/4 at 26. The company had said on Friday that problems with its high-performance computer chips had been solved and that it planned to sell more of them.
Stratus Computer fell 10 7/8, to 28 3/8, after the maker of extra-rugged "fault tolerant" computer systems reported earnings that disappointed securities analysts, some of whom lowered their stock assessments.
The Kobe earthquake continued to hurt Japanese stocks traded in the United States. The A.D.R.'s of Mat-- sushita Electric Industrial fell 9 1/8, to 142, as one of its major plants was damaged in the earthquake. The A.D.R.'s of Kyocera, a leading ceramic maker for electronic parts, fell 7 1/2, to 128, in part because of worries about the economic effects of the earthquake.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.09 point, to 253.47, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks by 1,399 to 826. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.73 point, to 436.91.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 14 fell, led by Eastman Kodak, which dropped 1 1/2, to 48 1/4. Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 221 advanced, led by Philip Morris, which climbed 1 5/8, to 58 5/8.

TURMOIL IN MEXICO
 MEXICO CITY, Jan. 23 (Reuters) -- Mexican financial markets spent another day in turmoil today as investors worried about delays in a United States plan to provide economic assistance.
President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon of Mexico added to investor concerns by reshuffling his Cabinet for the second time after only two months in power.
The Mexican stock exchange and the peso both fell sharply in morning trading and were little moved by a speech to Mexican legislators by Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz, in which he promised austerity and Government spending cuts.
Later in the day, however, the markets managed to recover.
After falling almost 3 percent by midday, the Mexican stock market's main indicator, the IPC 37-stock index, ended at 2,068.49, up 2.64 points. Meanwhile, the peso ended lower as the dollar gained value. Today, a dollar bought 5.705 pesos, compared with 5.585 pesos on Friday.
The new peso stood at 3.46 to the dollar just over a month ago before the Zedillo Government devalued the currency and then let it float on world markets.
The stock market rebounded this afternoon after Mr. Gingrich's comments about the United States loan guarantee program.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
I.B.M. Posts First Annual Profit Since 1990

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation reported its first profitable year since 1990 yesterday, with fourth-quarter earnings more than tripling to a level well above Wall Street analysts' estimates.
But revenues from personal computers declined in the quarter, and that helped drive I.B.M.'s stock price down in heavy trading yesterday. 
 Shares of I.B.M. closed at $74.25, off $1.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, after posting losses of as much as $3 earlier in the session.
Analysts said general bearishness in the stock market contributed to the selloff in I.B.M., noting that in many respects the company had a strong quarter. Mainframes and minicomputers sold in greater quantities than expected, and the service operations outperformed estimates in both revenues and profit margins.
In personal computers, however, I.B.M. trailed the rest of the industry's growth, analysts said.
"The only negative in the quarter was that sales growth, at 3 percent, was less than expected," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "Obviously, they underperformed in PC's, and that's not going to change soon."
"I think it was a solid quarter," he said. "I.B.M. has really executed on the cost side, but sales remain a challenge."
After being roughly tied with Apple Computer Inc. in 1993 for the title of No. 1 seller of personal computers in the United States, I.B.M. slipped in 1994, falling behind the Compaq Computer Corporation, Apple and Packard Bell Inc. to fourth place.
I.B.M.'s personal computer business has stumbled in recent years because of a confusingly large number of product lines and poor inventory management, resulting in shortages of popular models and an oversupply of less successful machines.
For the fourth quarter, I.B.M. had earnings of $1.23 billion, or $2.06 a share, more than three times the $341 million, or 55 cents a share, it reported a year earlier. Analysts had estimated earnings of about $1.75 a share.
Revenue was $19.9 billion, up 6.6 percent from $18.66 billion in the 1993 quarter. The figures exclude the results of a subsidiary that developed computers and software for the Federal Government; the subsidiary was sold last January.
"Despite the progress, we are not satisfied with our revenue growth," Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said. "Demand generally was strong across our product line, and demand for mainframes and storage products far outstripped supply. We were disappointed, however, by weakness in our personal computer business."
In a conference with securities analysts, Jerome York, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said Richard Thoman, head of the IBM PC Company, expected the unit's restructuring to be completed by the second quarter of this year, allowing it to focus on regaining market share. Analysts said that at current revenue levels, the PC business was operating at a loss.
In October, in an effort to reduce confusion and rationalize its product line, I.B.M. cut its personal computer lines from nine to four, and introduced some new models. It also resurrected the I.B.M. PC brand name.
While mainframe computers benefited from the economic recovery, which prompted customers to make long-deferred purchases of these large machines, other I.B.M. product lines grew on their own merits, analysts said. Both the AS/400 line of minicomputers and the RS/6000 line of work stations and servers grew at double-digit rates, Mr. York said.
"The AS/400 is doing so well because they have refreshed the product line and are out there with a brand new marketing strategy," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research, a consulting firm based in Phoenix. "In the case of mainframes, the customer couldn't wait any longer; they have businesses that need additional capacity."
Mr. York said I.B.M. had cut expenses by $3.5 billion in 1994, and had met 80 percent of its long-range goal of cutting expenses by $8 billion. It will meet that goal by mid-1996 at the latest, he said.
I.B.M. said it ended 1994 with about 220,000 employees, down 14 percent from a year earlier.
For 1994, I.B.M. reported earnings of $2.89 billion, or $4.92 a share, in contrast to a loss of $96 million in 1993. The 1993 loss totaled $8.1 billion when that year's restructuring charge of nearly $8 billion was included. Revenue last year grew 6 percent, to $64.1 billion, with the Government systems unit excluded.

American Express Net Climbs 16%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations rose 16 percent as consumer spending increased and profits from the company's insurance and mutual fund subsidiary advanced.
The travel and finance company said income from continuing operations increased to $335 million, or 65 cents a share, from $291 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier. 
 "They benefited from the higher spending," said Thomas Facciola, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst. American Express is "holding its own" in competition with credit cards such as Visa and MasterCard, he said.
Still, the American Express earnings failed to meet analysts' forecasts of 67 cents a share, according to a survey of 12 analysts by Zacks Investment Research. The results were released after the stock market closed.
The company's operating results exclude profits from the Shearson Lehman Brothers brokerage firm in the 1993 quarter. American Express spun off the firm in May. Including those results, net income was down 16 percent from the 1993 quarter, when the company earned $399 million, or 78 cents.
Revenue rose to $3.8 billion, from $3.48 billion a year earlier.
The American Express results are closely tied to the health of the economy, which grew at a 4 percent annual pace in the third quarter. The company said fourth-quarter earnings in its travel services division, which includes the American Express charge and credit card operations, rose 14 percent, to $237 million from $208 million.
Earnings from American Express Financial Advisors, formerly named IDS Financial Services, increased 16 percent, to $114 million from $98 million.
Profits at American Express Bank, the company's overseas banking division, fell 40 percent, to $16 million, from $25 million in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Off in Price For 3d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for the third consecutive trading session and longer maturities once again took the brunt of investor uncertainty over the Mexican aid package, a weak dollar and coming sales of new Treasury securities.
Shorter maturities received some support from market investors who are moving to "safer" investments in reaction to downturns in overseas stock markets. 
 Traders said volume was light, with shorter maturities already reflecting the expectation of an increase in interest rates of half a percentage point when the Federal Reserve meets next week.
The 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to a price of 9513/32 to yield 7.9 percent, up from 7.88 percent on Friday and the highest yield since Jan. 3, when it was 7.92 percent. Bill rates were steady to slightly lower.
Alan Kral, a portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen Inc., a New York investment firm, said the reasons for yesterday's market malaise included worries over the Mexican situation, the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy and the outlook that the Fed would raise rates again. "The question is, will the next rate increase exacerbate or unveil another Mexico," he said.
At the Treasury's weekly auction, bill rates rose to a two-week high, as the three-month average bill rate came in at 5.8 percent and the six-month rate at 6.24 percent.
Some securities dealers were even selling two-year and five-year notes ahead of this week's new supply. The sale by the dealers and portfolio managers may have added more downward pressure on prices as the supply increased.
Traders and investors are already looking beyond this week's auction of two-and five-year notes to next month's quarterly refunding when the Government will sell 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. The yield on the current coupon two-year note was unchanged at 7.48 percent yesterday, as was the when-issued yield of 7.55 percent on the new issue being sold today.
Municipal bonds fell for the third day. Traders said the market was looking at the sale this week by New York City of $645 million in bonds as a barometer. The sale will be handled by Prudential Securities. The new issue will help the city refinance existing bonds and provide $200 million for capital projects. But the bonds are also expected to save the city money on interest and principal payments on all its debt as it struggles to close a $650 million budget gap.
Because of the city's fiscal problems, it remains to be seen if there will be enough investors to buy these bonds.
Last week, Standard & Poor's said it was considering downgrading the A- rating on the city's $23 million of general obligation bonds outstanding because of the plan to use money from the new bond issue to help close the city's budget gap.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: On Both Sides of the Border, Peso Ills Were Long Ignored

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER with ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration and the Mexican Government were saying until late last year that Mexico was a booming example of an emerging market that would bring wealth to workers in both countries, warnings were running rampant in both capitals that severe economic trouble lay ahead.
According to officials in Washington, the Treasury Department told several Mexican officials beginning last summer that the country's short-term borrowings had reached a dangerously high level and that the peso was being kept artificially high. But on several occasions, officials said, the Mexicans responded that they were aware of the problem, but that nothing could be done during and just after the election that brought Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon to power. 
 In Mexico City, officials now acknowledge that they knew the economy was in serious trouble months before Mr. Zedillo's election on Aug. 21. But they say that for political reasons, partly related to the elections and partly to the ambitions of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to head the new World Trade Organization after leaving office, they chose to continue borrowing and spending at a tremendous pace, sustaining the illusion of a thriving economy.
Today, Guillermo Ortiz, the Mexican Finance Minister, said at a hostile meeting of the legislature in Mexico City that there was "a yellow light" in Mexico's balance sheets that anyone should have seen. He said that while the Government was to blame, so was Wall Street, which "endorsed the economic policies and in particular the exchange rate policy of the Mexican Government."
The series of warnings issued from Washington, however, raises a number of questions about what the Administration was saying in public about the health of the Mexican economy, signals that were picked up by both American companies and investors. In November, as disaster loomed, President Clinton used the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the first meeting of Latin American leaders in nearly three decades, to celebrate Mexico's economic management as a model for the region's growth. He and his deputies issued no warnings that Mexico was consuming too much too fast, or letting its debt grow too rapidly.
Asked today why Mr. Clinton offered no public words of caution, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said, "The President's public comments have always stressed the fundamental strength of the Mexican economy and the commitment of the Mexican leadership to economic and political reform."
But a senior White House official added: "There was a great deal of sensitivity, as the Zedillo administration came to office, about not undercutting the very delicate situation they faced as they tried to form a government, so there was a very conscious effort not to be too heavy-handed. All these sovereignty issues are very sensitive."
Mr. Zedillo, an economist, contributed to the atmosphere of unbridled optimism. Visiting Washington on Nov. 23, just before his inauguration, he talked of economic growth this year "at 4 percent or better, and soon 5 percent, which we need to generate a million new jobs a year."
Now he will be lucky if his economy posts any growth this year and if the number of jobs do not shrink. At the same time, the Clinton Administration is now warning that unless the crisis is resolved, nearly half a million Mexicans seeking higher wages will illegally enter Texas and California during the next year.
In the aftermath of the Mexican debacle, officials in both Washington and Mexico are spinning tales of who knew what and when. The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, circulated a brief warning in July that Mexico's foreign currency reserves were being depleted in an effort to keep up the value of the peso. Now it is recirculating the same report, citing it as evidence that top Government officials had been warned.
But several leading economic officials say that the original warning was buried in a mountain of economic intelligence issued by the C.I.A. "There was no headline, and they know how to get your attention when they want to," one official said.
The agency, officials say, provided no warning in December that Mr. Zedillo was considering a major devaluation of the peso, which precipitated the crisis. Washington was given a half-hour notice of the action.
Other Clinton Administration officials said they warned Mexican leaders last year that the peso was overvalued, especially considering the tremendous pace at which Mexico was printing money.
One senior American official said that while it would be "inappropriate" to discuss private consultations between the Mexican and American Governments, "it would also be a big mistake to suppose that we were unaware of the building problem." Mexican officials, he said, acknowledged the problem but did little.
Today, both Administration officials and the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, expressed optimism that Congress would approve $40 billion in loan guarantees -- essentially cosigning a loan -- in hopes of increasing the confidence of investors in buying Mexican securities again. "It's going to happen," Mr. Gingrich told reporters. Those comments helped reverse slides on both the Mexican stock exchange and on Wall Street.
Mexican officials now acknowledge that they issued far too many short-term bonds -- called tesobonos -- and they say Mr. Salinas's administration passed up several opportunities to devalue the peso slowly, a step that could have averted the huge sell-off in Mexican bonds and other securities.
Mr. Ortiz, the Finance Minister, said that in September he argued that the peso should be devalued in an orderly way when a pact with labor and business was renewed. He not only lost that argument but also was originally passed over when Mr. Zedillo picked Jaime Serra Puche as his first Finance Minister.
Mr. Serra Puche was forced to resign a week after the peso was devalued, and Mr. Ortiz took his place.
Other officials who were carried over from the previous administration say that when Mr. Zedillo took office on Dec. 1 he knew how seriously overextended the Mexican economy was and that a crash could follow. But he also knew that the economy was addicted to the flood of international capital to keep paying its bills. So they said there was not much he could do except act as if nothing was wrong and encourage investors to keep pouring money into Mexico.

Canada's Pale Version of Peso Crisis

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada has raised short-term interest rates for 11 of the last 12 weeks in an effort to stop the precipitous slide of the Canadian dollar, but has failed so far to reverse its downward spiral to a near record low.
The central bank acted because a declining Canadian dollar reduces the value of the nation's wealth and compounds the Government's fiscal problems by increasing the cost of servicing Canada's huge national debt. 
 For Canadians themselves, the devaluation is cutting both ways, making winter trips to Florida more expensive but also making Canadian goods more attractive abroad.
The result has been a paler Canadian version of the financial jitters that sent Mexico into economic crisis when it abruptly devalued its peso last month. Both countries depend heavily on foreign capital.
At just over 70 American cents, the Canadian dollar has shrunk by 5 percent in three months and 20 percent since hitting a high of 89.29 on Nov. 1, 1991. The all-time low was 69.13 cents on Feb. 4, 1986.
Contributing to the depreciation are Canada's budget deficits and uncertainty about a referendum expected later this year on Quebec's independence.
A jump of 2.5 percentage points in short-term rates set by the Bank of Canada over the last two months helped brake the Canadian dollar's slide, but has also added $3 billion to the annual cost of servicing the debt. Interest on Canada's debt already gobbles up 35 percent of Government revenues. The higher interest rates could in time also dampen economic growth.
"There's clearly the risk of a vicious circle," said John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. But he added that the Canadian dollar crisis "strengthens the bargaining hand" of advocates of major spending cuts in the Government budget to be presented next month.
The currency imbroglio comes when Canada's economy has sharply improved under Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Economic output in the third quarter of 1994 grew 4.8 percent over the comparable period a year earlier, which is higher than any other member of the Group of Seven industrial nations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that Canada will lead the group in growth both this year and next.
With trade barriers lowered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canadian exports to the United States have boomed, soaring 65 percent since 1991. Canada has almost zero inflation. And last year, it created 431,000 full-time jobs in the private sector, dropping Canadian unemployment to 9.6 percent.
But in a world of almost instantaneous money flows, currency markets are prone to what C. E. Ritchie, chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia, calls the "electronic jury" of traders around the world.
The staggering rise of Canadian debt, more than a third of which is held internationally, has left the Canadian dollar vulnerable.
Over the last five years, Canadian national and provincial governments have run combined deficits of more than $50 billion (Canadian), or $35 billion (United States), annually. Their accumulated debt now exceeds $700 billion (Canadian), an amount roughly equal to the value of all goods and services produced in Canada last year.
As a percentage of the gross domestic product, only Italy's debt is higher among the leading industrial nations. On a per-capita basis, Canada is at the top of the list.
The markets have focused on the Government's credibility in reducing the budget deficit. The Government has promised to cut the deficit from the current 5 percent to 3 percent of Canada's gross domestic product, or to $25 billion (Canadian) by the 1996-97 fiscal year.
If the new Government budget fails to cut spending enough to meet that goal, the Canadian dollar could get even weaker.
Many market traders say the Government should be taking stronger action. "Markets want a clear sense that the Government is prepared to make deep cuts in spending," said Robert Palombi, senior fixed-income analyst for MMS International, a financial markets advisory service in Toronto. "They're demanding a less generous welfare state."
Some complained that the Bank of Canada's governor, Gordon Thiessen, waited too long to raise rates after the Federal Reserve Board in the United States tightened money in December. Last Tuesday, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark bank rank nearly another full point, to 8.21 percent.
"The market lost confidence in the bank's ability or willingness to support the currency, and this created a feeding frenzy," said Jeff Rubin, chief economist at the Toronto investment house of Wood Gundy Inc.
Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at another Toronto investment firm, Nesbitt Burns Ltd., said the central bank had sought to insulate the Canadian economy from higher rates, but found that it could not do so and still maintain Canada's appeal to international investors.
Mr. Thiessen talked up the Canadian dollar to the Montreal Board of Trade on Thursday, noting that Canada's economic fundamentals, including minimal inflation and high productivity, were strong. "So the underlying situation for the currency," he said, "is one that would cause you to look at the possibility of an increase" in the Canadian dollar's value.
The Canadian dollar has also been weakened by worries about what will happen to Canada's debt if Quebec votes to leave the rest of the country. A separatist Parti Quebecois government in Quebec is committed to holding a provincial referendum on independence this year. The latest polls indicate that a majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada, but with separatists holding provincial power, they might be able to swing more opinion their way.
So far, ordinary Canadians have not shown much concern over their dollar's fall. "I don't get the sense that anyone's particularly worried," said James Nason, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia. "To the credit of the Prime Minister, the political atmosphere is calm and the drop in the dollar has not hurt exports or jobs."
Canadians point out that a large number of American companies are also benefiting from the lower Canadian dollar. Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd., for example, has the mandate from its American parent, the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Mass., to build personal computers for North and South America. Shipments from the Canadian plant in Kanata, Ontario, jumped 70 percent in the second half of 1994.
The weak Canadian dollar has also helped Canadian store owners along the border. A few years ago, Canadians were spending billions of dollars in American shopping centers, protesting with their feet against the high prices and sales taxes at home. Now the plunging Canadian dollar, helped by lower inflation than in the United States, is luring American shoppers to Canada.

Advances by the Dollar
(By The Associated Press)
The dollar ended slightly higher against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday.
In Asian and early European dealings, the dollar strengthened after investors dumped Japanese stocks, pushing the Nikkei index of 225 issues down 5.6 percent.
But the dollar retreated in New York as many traders became concerned over reports suggesting Congress could reject or cut the Clinton Administration's proposed $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico. Currency dealers expect the dollar to come under pressure if the peso continues to weaken because Mexico is the third-largest trading partner of the United States.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 99.80 yen from 99.40 yen on Friday. It advanced to 1.5145 marks from 1.5115 marks on Friday. The British pound rose to $1.5940 from $1.5890.
"The market has concluded that a failure to pass the Mexican loan package would be a negative for the dollar," said Michael Faust, currency strategist at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money-management firm in San Mateo, Calif.
"It's not only what it might mean for trade with Mexico, but the impact on international capital flows in general," he said. "Money might tend to stay at home."

HEADLINE: Car Makers' Debt Upgraded

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation raised its credit ratings today on the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, saying they were effectively preparing themselves for tougher competition and costly regulations.
The credit rating agency said it expected Japanese auto makers to become more competitive and believed that the automotive industry's business would decline up to 30 percent with the next recession. In addition, S.& P. said new regulations, particularly the more stringent emissions standards that might be put in place by several states, would be costly for the industry. 
 "Still, the Big Three are taking advantage of this period of prosperity to enhance their financial flexibility to meet these challenges," Standard & Poor's concluded.
Ford's main debt rating was raised to A+ from A and Chrysler's from BBB+ to A-. The company affirmed its BBB+ rating of the General Motors Corporation.
S.& P. cited Ford's return to profitability in Europe, the ability to capitalize on a strong automotive market in North America and the prospects of the company's financial services businesses, which are a "substantial and growing source of earnings."
S.& P. said Chrysler, which last week announced record profits for 1994, had had the most impressive financial performance among the Big Three. It praised Chrysler's successful new products and leanness, accumulation of a $7.5 billion cash reserve and the elimination of the company's unfunded pension liability.
The rating agency praised G.M.'s return to profitability in North American operations but said it was still concerned about the company's long-term potential.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold and Silver Off Sharply; Oil Prices Turn Downward

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Gold and silver prices tumbled yesterday on selling set off in part by sharp declines in overseas stock prices. The downturn halted a four-day rally in gold prices. 
 Crude oil futures also weakened after climbing last week to their highest level since early November. Analysts attributed the setback to increased supplies of reformulated gasoline and a lack of severely cold weather.
Commodities were generally lower, with the Commodity Research Bureau's index falling 1.66 points, to 235.51.
Gold for February delivery fell $4 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $381.40 an ounce. March silver tumbled 9.7 cents, to $4.82 an ounce. And April platinum dropped $5.70, to $417.60, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold had risen strongly in recent weeks, hitting a high for the new year Friday amid the inflationary implications of rising commodity prices. The CRB index rose 3.99 points last week.
But steep losses yesterday on the Japanese, British, French and German stock markets prompted many international investors to sell precious metals for cash to cover margin calls and other obligations, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
"Often, the initial response to a sharp selloff in stock markets is a flight to cash, because you need liquidity," she said. "Ultimately, you may get a flight to safety, and to gold in particular, if the decline in stock markets continues."
Precious metals were also hurt by technical factors, including silver's drop through $4.90 and $4.85.
Crude oil futures relinquished more than a quarter of last week's strong gains after weekend shipments of reformulated gasoline into New York Harbor relieved a tightness in supplies of the cleaner-burning fuel.
Light crude for March delivery fell 32 cents, to $18.10 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. February heating oil fell 0.32 cent, to 47.82 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline sagged 1.02 cents, to 56.38 cents a gallon, and February natural gas fell 3.6 cents, to $1.389 for 1,000 cubic feet.
"Weather continues to be a negative as well," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures. Temperatures have cooled down to normal in the Midwest and Northeast, but there is no severe cold in sight.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Whitman's Address on the Budget

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's budget address to the Legislature today.
Last year, I promised taxpayers that this budget would be different. 
 And it is.
More than ever before, it's your budget.
We held town meetings around the state. Every cabinet member conducted public hearings. We promised to reach out through radio and television to hear your concerns.
We said we'd listen, and we did. . . .
I'm proud of this budget. It keeps promises. It uses common sense to invest our dollars and cents wisely. And it accomplishes a lot.
It absorbs the enormous cost of taking over the county courts. It complies with the Supreme Court's ruling on school funding. It helps municipalities, supports education and provides for New Jerseyans in need.
It reduces the state's reliance on one-shot revenues from $1.6 billion two years ago to $348 million this year -- a 78 percent reduction.
And it includes a $500 million surplus essential to preserving New Jersey's bond rating.
Last year's budget set us on the right course. Our tax cuts established credibility with the people. More important, they helped create jobs for the people.
The numbers speak louder than words.
This past year, the private sector created 60,000 new jobs. That's over 60,000 more New Jerseyans who are supporting their families and contributing to their communities.
We must continue to cut taxes. We are still competing for jobs and businesses with other states across the nation.
Last year, I promised to cut state income taxes by 30 percent over three years for most New Jerseyans. I said lower taxes would be good for the economy and good for our citizens. Today, we're halfway there.
We already have cut income taxes 15 percent for most New Jerseyans. We have removed 380,000 lower-income citizens from the tax rolls entirely. And the tax cuts are working -- even better than I thought.
Our job growth has put tax revenues in the state coffers faster than we expected.
So why wait to reinvest in New Jersey's future? Why wait to return as much money as we can to taxpayers? Why wait until next year to keep a promise we can keep right now?
Today, I am asking the Legislature to complete the 30 percent tax cut in this budget -- one full year ahead of schedule.
Effective Jan. 1, 1996, I want families earning up to $80,000 and individuals who earn up to $40,000 to pay 30 percent less than they did just two years before.
Families making up to $150,000 would pay at least 23 percent less in taxes. And families earning more would save at least 10 percent.
I want all families to have more each year to spend, save or invest as they see fit. And I want the same for business.
In this budget, I am proposing three business tax cuts designed to create new jobs.
Jobs in our inner cities.
Jobs in growing industries.
Jobs throughout New Jersey.
Our first proposed business tax cut is a change in corporate tax policy to encourage multistate companies to invest and employ people in our state. The other two cuts will benefit small businesses, which create up to 95 percent of our new jobs.
I am calling for the repeal of the telecommunications sales tax on Yellow Pages advertising.
I am also calling for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 9 percent to 7.5 percent for small corporations earning less than $100,000. That would make New Jersey's small business tax the lowest in the region. . . .
Together, our income and business tax cuts are working to put more New Jerseyans back to work.
Some argue that these tax cuts will force local property taxes to rise.
That simply isn't so.
The state does not collect a penny of property tax. The state does not spend a penny of property tax.
Those functions are the exclusive domain of the counties, the municipalities and the school districts. Property taxes reflect local spending decisions.
High property taxes are the price homeowners pay as school boards and local and county governments struggle to control costs.
It is the policy of this administration to help them win that struggle. . . .

HEADLINE: Cuomo Puts Ideas on Paper And Shops for a Book Deal

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR 

 BODY:
Conservative books are hot, publishers say. Liberal ones are not. But never mind that. Former New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whose liberal politics were soundly voted down in November, has decided to weigh in anyway. His proposed book theme: "progressive pragmatism."
In a two-and-a-half-page letter now being shopped around New York's publishing houses by his agent, the former Governor promises a fresh rebuttal to what he calls "Gingrichism" and the "Newt world order." Publishing executives say that Mr. Cuomo is asking for a seven-figure advance. 
 The book, he writes, "will say to America -- we can do better than the plastic populism that convinced voters in 1994 their anger had produced an intelligent plan for the nation's future."
"And then," he goes on, "it will describe something better."
He says his book will include "an economic plan that goes beyond painless tax cuts and makes the investments and insists on the trade relations necessary to succeed in a new global economy."
And he promises to outline "a common-sense approach that recognizes that tragedies like drug addiction, violence, children having children, dysfunctional families, are not visited upon us like earthquakes and floods, but are all avoidable disasters."
"It will be strong and it will be positive," he writes. And, he vows, "I will not simply recast speeches I made in the past."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cuomo said he had discussed the book idea with at least two publishers. The letter, to Jim Griffin, his agent at William Morris, was his first effort at putting the idea on paper, he added.
But the book, to be finished this fall, would not be his first. The former Governor's words are already immortalized in two published diaries and in a collection of speeches, "More Than Words: The Speeches of Mario Cuomo" (St. Martin's Press).
Owen Laster, an executive vice president at William Morris, declined to comment on how large an advance was being sought.
Carol Schneider, an associate publisher at Random House, which published Mr. Cuomo's two diaries, said that Jason Epstein, who edited Mr. Cuomo's two diaries, was pursuing the new book. "Yes, we're interested," she said. But she declined to discuss the money issue.
Mr. Cuomo laughed when asked how big an advance he was looking for.
"I don't want to get into numbers," he said, "but I don't think that's accurate," referring to a suggestion he was seeking up to $2 million. Then, unable to resist kicking a little dust on Mr. Gingrich, who is still reeling from the furor that arose over his book contract, Mr. Cuomo added, "I don't have any $4.5 million dollar offers."

Economic Report Proposes Novel Step

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As a Senate subcommittee draws closer to holding hearings on baseball's exemption from antitrust laws, members of Congress have received a nonpartisan economic report that questions whether the exemption "serves a useful public purpose."
The 22-page report, compiled by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, also shows how the salary cap the clubs have implemented would benefit the owners in an overwhelming economic way and suggests the novel step of placing new franchises in existing large-revenue markets like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles as a way of leveling revenues between high-revenue and low-revenue clubs. 
 The owners were critical last August of a report compiled by Roger Noll, a Stanford economist, for the Players Association, but this one, while not dissecting the numbers the way Noll did, reaches many of the same basic conclusions as he did.
The owners, for example, have linked their revenue-sharing plan to the system that places a cap on club payrolls. But Dennis Zimmerman and William Cox, the economists who wrote the "CRS Report for Congress," conclude that "revenues to be shared with financially weak franchises might be raised from the income of financially strong franchises rather than from the salaries of the players."
Congress is not concerned about revenue sharing and salary caps specifically, but a growing number of members has questioned the link between the strike and the antitrust exemption.
Multiple bills calling for complete or partial repeal of the exemption have been introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose chairman is Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, is expected to announce soon that it will hold hearings by the middle of next month.
Zimmerman and Cox write that the exemption might have encouraged the owners "not to seek a settlement that players would accept and to prefer an impasse," adding that the exemption reduces the owners' potential losses from declaration of an impasse in negotiations and unilateral implementation of a salary cap.
Without the exemption, they write, the union could challenge the salary cap on antitrust grounds. "A positive outcome of such a challenge," they write, "could result in the imposition of treble damages."
Raising doubts about the value of the exemption for anyone other than the owners, the report says that if options other than "anticompetitive labor practices" are available to correct the problems the owners say exist, "then the social benefits of MLB's antitrust exemption may be questioned."
Looking at the salary cap itself, the economists determined that if the plan had been in effect last year and the season had been played uninterrupted, the owners would have reduced player salaries and benefits by $198 million. The revenue-sharing plan, they add, would have transferred $38 million from high-revenue clubs to low-revenue clubs.
"Much of the remaining $160 million," they write, "presumably would accrue to the large-revenue teams (but could not be spent on player salaries)."
Zimmerman and Cox, however, say there are ways the economic onus would not have to fall so harshly on the players. For example, they write, the owners' concerns about the effect on competitive balance of the disparity between payrolls of high-revenue and low-revenue clubs could be met by diluting the revenues of the wealthier teams.
"In industries operating under competitive conditions," they write, "the existence of businesses with exceptional profits like the New York Yankees would attract new firms into the location, which would capture some of those profits."
Major league baseball, they say, could accomplish a similar result by adding franchises to markets like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, thus reducing revenue of established clubs from such sources as attendance and broadcasting rights.
The established clubs would not like the idea of being used "to finance a solution to the problem," the economists note. "But," they write, "one might ask why this loss would be more unfair than asking players to forgo part of the value of their own talent and skill (their human capital) to solve the problem."
On the other hand, they add, the established clubs could avoid suffering reduced revenues; they could be compensated by fees from the sale of the new franchises.

HEADLINE: Officials Offer New Plan To Retain the Yankees

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Yankee officials have rejected New York City's initial plans for upgrading Yankee Stadium and the surrounding neighborhood, and city officials presented team representatives with yet another proposal yesterday designed to keep the team from leaving the Bronx.
In the latest plan, the city proposes to upgrade the stadium with a new outer wall that copies the stadium's original facade, to add about 100 luxury boxes. It also proposes to increase the number of parking spaces and to make it easier to travel to the stadium by car. 
 John Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, said that when the city presented its plan for the renovations in December, team officials liked the proposal for the stadium itself but were concerned about both parking and access roads to the ball park -- two major fan complaints about the stadium.
The proposal presented yesterday tried to respond to those concerns, Mr. Dyson said, but he refused to provide details on the changes.
George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, said the team was studying the proposal. "We had a good meeting with the Mayor," he said. "He presented a plan to us. We said we'd study it and get back to you."
Mr. Steinbrenner denied a published report that he had already notified city officials of a decision to move the team out of the Bronx, possibly to the Meadowlands in New Jersey.
"They presented this latest plan to us, which was a revision of one we had seen earlier, but we never even discussed the Yankees' leaving the Bronx," he said.
Referring to New Jersey officials, he said, "We've talked once in a while with them because I have some very good friends over there. That's no secret."
He also said, "To say that I said we would be leaving the Bronx is a total fabrication."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also denied the report, in this week's issue of The New York Observer, which said that Mr. Steinbrenner had sent a letter to City Hall on Jan. 12 informing officials of his decision.
"It's a false story," the Mayor said. "It's flat-out untrue."
Mr. Dyson said the main objective of city and state officials was to keep the Yankees at their current location in the Bronx. He said there have been no talks with team officials about alternate sites within New York City.
In August, the city and state hired the design firm Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum to draw plans to modernize the stadium and to resolve the traffic, parking and safety concerns that Yankee officials claimed were keeping some fans from attending games.
Earlier proposals from state officials envisioned constructing a bridge from the Harlem River Drive to the Bronx, where fans could park in garages connected to the stadium by a secure walkway -- allowing them to attend games without walking the streets of the Bronx. It was not clear if those proposals were included in the plans presented to the Yankees.
Despite periodic reports -- all denied -- that the Yankees are about to flee the city, Mr. Dyson said the team appeared to be taking the negotiations over the stadium seriously.
"They come back with detailed suggestions or proposals or complaints from their architects and traffic engineers," Mr. Dyson said.
Yesterday morning, when Mr. Giuliani presented the latest proposal, Mr. Dyson said Mr. Steinbrenner reacted favorably. But he added that it remained an open question whether the team, in the end, would stay in New York.
In New Jersey, Carl Golden, a spokesman for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said Mr. Steinbrenner had been talking for years to officials at the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the Meadowlands sports complex. Mr. Golden reiterated the Governor's position that no taxpayer money would be spent to build a ball park, but that the state would help with the construction of access roads to a stadium.
"George Steinbrenner has talked to the sports authority for some time, just expressing interest and staying in touch," Mr. Golden said. "But there hasn't been, to my knowledge, any firm offer, plan, proposal for the authority to consider."

HEADLINE: Fighting Inflation Without Designated Paupers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Those Vital Paupers," Russell Baker's perceptive Jan. 17 column, displays the transparent vacuousness of the concept of the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, expressed by economists in the acronym Nairu. 
 The cognoscenti who run our Federal Reserve and advise our policy makers believe it is bad for our society if self-interested business people want to hire most of the unemployed. By reducing the ranks of the unemployed (Mr. Baker's "vital paupers") in response to profit opportunities, business people will cause the economy to "overheat."
Consequently, the Nairu seers argue that the Federal Reserve must destroy potential profit opportunities by raising interest rates whenever profitable markets induce entrepreneurs to hire enough workers to reduce the unemployment rate below that embedded in their concept. It is apparently better to keep about 5.8 percent of American workers, who are willing to work, unemployed than to hire them, making them productive, income-earning, taxpaying members of society.
If we require some perpetual proportion of Americans to be unemployed, they must either starve to death or live as "parasites" off government entitlements or private charity. If we end welfare, and private charities do not replace these entitlement payments, three dreadful scenarios are possible.
(1) Unable to obtain any form of income maintenance, the unemployed will slowly starve to death. As they die, the rate of unemployment among the surviving members of society will fall below the critical Nairu value. To prevent inflationary overheating, the Federal Reserve will be forced to destroy additional profit opportunities so that business people, facing slack markets, will fire enough previously employed workers to refill the unemployment ranks to the necessary level.
Under this scenario of starving the unemployed, additional employed survivors must continually be sacrificed. Then, as Keynes noted in a slightly different context, "in the long run we'll all be dead."
(2) The unemployed can attempt to compete with the employed by lowering their wage requirements or improving their skills. If, however, the system always requires a significant portion of the population to be unemployed to prevent overheating, the newly employed will gain their jobs at the expense of the previously employed.
Job search will merely be a game of musical chairs where the Federal Reserve undertakes, as its responsibility, to assure that there are always fewer chairs than players.
(3) Those who are cast on the trash heap of the unemployed without entitlements may decide it is in their self-interest to create an illegal entitlements system -- that is, to steal from the employed, rather than to starve quietly. If as the crime rate increases, society's response is to incarcerate these criminals, the result will be more spending on entitlements for food, clothing and shelter through prisons and orphanages.
If instead, society decides to expand the death penalty rather than locking up such criminals, and if we are successful in catching them, the result will be to reduce the ranks of these unemployed more rapidly than under the starving the unemployed scenario. This will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates all the more rapidly to replenish the unemployment rate.
Surely a civilized society can figure a way out of this nonaccelerating-inflation-rate-of-unemployment nonsense. Some economists, including John Maynard Keynes, who never were ensnared in the gossamer of the Nairu garment, have advocated policies that do not require a permanent army of unemployed paupers to achieve a prosperous, inflation-free economy.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO ANY JEWS LATELY?;
Is It a New Holocaust? Is It Paranoia? Is It Funny?

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
About halfway through the first act of Bruce Jay Friedman's newest fever dream of a comedy, "Have You Spoken to Any Jews Lately?" a man in the audience explodes more or less metaphorically, speaking words supplied by the playwright. "This is a cheap commercialization of this century's most barbarous act," the man shouts to the actors. "Have you no shame?"
Not really. 
 Shame isn't much in evidence on the stage of the American Jewish Theater, where "Have You Spoken to Any Jews Lately?" opened last night. Yet there's a lot of anger, fear and compassion, sometimes expressed in terms that are as horrific as they are funny. Mr. Friedman is a novelist with sterling credits ("Stern," "A Mother's Kisses") and playwright ("Scuba Duba" and "Steambath"), who has recently been working in movies. Maybe that's why he likes to push his luck when he finds himself in the comparative freedom of the Off Off Broadway theater.
You can still do things here that remain unacceptable in Hollywood. That would include writing a play some people might take to be a comedy about the Holocaust, rather than recognizing it as one man's nightmare prompted, in part, by his own sense of guilt and rootlessness. In New York you are also allowed to write a play, like this one, which is scarcely more than an extended series of blackout sketches, but which has an emotional impact that goes beyond its very free, sometimes sloppy form.
"Have You Talked to Any Jews Lately?" is about Jack Horowitz (Larry Pine), born and bred in the Bronx of devout Jewish parents. He's married to a beautiful, blond Roman Catholic, Flannery O'Halloran (Christina Haag), and the father of an off-stage daughter, Chrissy, who has begun to bug him with questions about who she is. What, exactly, are her roots? Her ethnic obligations?
These are the questions Jack asks himself, though in most other ways he's self-assured and honorable. He has given up a successful career as a hack screenwriter to bring his family back to the sanity of the East Coast. When the play opens, it's off-season in the resort community (which could be one of the Hamptons) where they are year-round residents. Jack stays busy writing a column for the town weekly and helping out at the deli.
Mr. Friedman describes the time as "a few years from now, whenever now is." Israel, we learn, has left the Middle East and is now in Miami Beach. Because the large Cuban presence in Miami goes unmentioned, this gag, like some others, seems underdeveloped and slightly disconnected. References to Quentin Tarantino and Ollie North compete for attention with mentions of Walter Winchell and Irwin Shaw.
The play's principal setting is the common room of the resort town's community center. The weather outside is B-movie stormy as the uneasy Jack awaits an old Hollywood screenwriting pal. Uneasy? He is verging on paranoia. When he turns on the radio, right-wing Christian evangelists dominate the airwaves. He's unable to reach his lawyer, Sid, on the telephone. Willy Gold, his plumber, has disappeared.
By the time of the appearance of the loud, bumptious Danny (Richard M. Davidson), Jack is in a state of high anxiety. Danny's news isn't good. The municpal authorities of the town where he has a summer place have rezoned his property. Even as they speak, says Danny, a road is being built through his living room, "right past the sectional couch." Is "it" happening again, and this time here? Well, Danny also hasn't spoken to any Jews lately, except his wife, Shirley.
In the course of the two acts, played as very dark, but often wildly funny vaudeville entertainment, Jack and Danny become convinced that a new Holocaust is at hand. They are assaulted by the past and present, by memories and fantasies, which are acted out, and by their own bizarre panic. Has the world changed, or are they only acknowledging realities for the first time? Two men and a woman, a cabaret team, dance through the common room. They stop just long enough for the woman to admire the size of Jack's nose. The tradespeople who wander in call Jack "Mr. O'Halloran." The insults take on menace.
Jack shows Danny a T-shirt Chrissy was wearing one day when she came home from school. It bears a large "J," which the principal says was to punish her for jaywalking. The town's barber charms the name-dropping Danny with the list of his summer customers, including Wayne Gretzky. He lures Danny offstage just long enough the shave him bald. The absurd becomes plausible, and the plausible unspeakable. The play's penultimate sequence, set in a boxcar, is a shocker, and something of a coup de theatre.
The director, Michael Rudman, has had remarkable success in staging all this fluidly and with conviction. That's not an easy job on the American Jewish Theater's tiny stage, hemmed in by a ceiling so low you can almost touch it when sitting down. The pacing is lively. The mood is almost festive. The members of the very good cast, headed by Mr. Pine and Mr. Davidson, have all found the gravely lunatic manner the material demands.
Three standouts: Penny Balfour, as the kind of Weimar Republic chanteuse identified with the music of Kurt Weill; Gene Canfield, as the sadistic barber, and Judith Granite as the motherly type Jack and Danny meet en route to a place called Grunwald.
Though "Have You Spoken to Any Jews Lately?" is loaded with Jewish manners, lore, figures of speech and history, it would be a mistake to consider the play as narrowly ethnic as it sounds. Beneath its engagingly disreputable particulars, the play is another consideration of the same kind of moral aimlessness Sam Shepard examined in "Simpatico."
When American social and economic life was dominated by people sharing the same northern European heritage, one could speak of this country as a great melting pot. Today it's apparent that we don't all melt down at the same speed and to the same consistency. Somehow we have to learn to accommodate that fact, Mr. Friedman seems to say. Otherwise, chaos.

HEADLINE: WHITMAN PLEDGES EARLY COMPLETION OF 30% TAX CUT

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Saying that she had kept her promise, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced today that she would complete her 30 percent reduction in state income tax rates by next January, a year ahead of schedule. The reduction would be paid for by a catalogue of cuts in state government that would reduce the state work force by 3,350 employees, or nearly 5 percent.
The announcement was a surprise, since most legislators listening to the Governor's annual budget message had forecast a new tax cut of only 5 percent on top of the 15 percent in reductions already enacted, and since Mrs. Whitman herself had indicated in October that she might not be able to keep to her three-year timetable. 
 "We have kept our promises," she said, and when she declared that she could deliver the full 30 percent reduction in two years, it brought legislative Republicans cheering to their feet. [Excerpts, page B5.]
The Democratic minority, caught off guard, sputtered that for all the national attention the Governor has attracted with her tax cutting, she has not managed to arrest a steady rise in total state spending. Mrs. Whitman's critics also pointed out that New Jersey's indebtedness is on the rise and claimed that she was simply shifting the burden from the state income tax to local property taxes, from today's residents to future taxpayers.
Mrs. Whitman's speech set the scene for her appearance in a national broadcast on Tuesday night, when she will offer the Republican reply to President Clinton's State of the Union address, which is to be televised at 9 P.M. Tuesday. [Article, page A14.] Her speech will be built around the theme, developed in Washington and by the Governor, that Republicans keep their promises. It was a motif Mrs. Whitman embellished time and again today.
"Tax cuts are working, even better than I thought," the Governor said in her address. "Our job growth has put tax revenues in the state coffers faster than we expected. So why wait to reinvest in New Jersey's future? Why wait to return as much money as we can to taxpayers? Why wait until next year to keep a promise we can keep right now?"
The selection of Mrs. Whitman to be the first governor ever to reply to a State of the Union address has resonated through the State House for days. Today, a packed Assembly chamber flared into a tumult of bipartisan cheering when Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate president, referring to Mrs. Whitman's speech on Tuesday, introduced the Governor with the words, "Your selection is proof that the best of New Jersey is the best of the nation."
Mrs. Whitman's staff pointedly disavowed speculation that the Governor had increased her tax cut from the expected 5 percent to the full remaining 15 percent to strengthen her reply to President Clinton on Tuesday.
"If you're asking, did we put a one before the five after she was selected to make the Republican response, that is not true and frankly it is insulting," said Peter Verniero, the Governor's chief counsel. He said the decision had been made weeks ago.
The final proposed 15 percent decrease in income tax rates would affect single taxpayers earning less than $ 40,000 a year and couples filing jointly earning less than $ 80,000 a year; those levels were the original target of the Governor's tax cut pledge, and cover about four-fifths of all taxpayers. As of next January, a couple earning $ 80,000 will have seen their top tax rate decline from 5 percent in 1993, the year before Mrs. Whitman took office, to 3.5 percent, worth about $ 600 in savings.
Taxpayers earning more than $ 80,000 will see lesser reductions, but Mr. Verniero said the Governor would seek additional cuts for top earners in future years. Mrs. Whitman eliminated any income tax obligation for those earning less than $ 7,500 last year, about 380,000 people.
The reductions will cost the state nearly $ 500 million a year in revenues, but only about half of that, $ 247 million, will have to be made up in the Governor's $ 16 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, since that budget extends only to the middle of next year. The budget for the current fiscal year is $ 15.4 million.
Mrs. Whitman made it plain today that she was in no mood for her critics' complaints that the failure of state aid to schools and municipalities to at least keep pace with inflation is responsible for an inching up of state property taxes. In her truncated, barely inflected speaking style, Mrs. Whitman sent local governments the clearest signal yet that they are on their own.
"Some argue that these tax cuts will force up local property taxes," the Governor declared in her speech. "That simply isn't so. The state does not collect a penny of property tax. The state does not spend a penny of property tax. Those functions are the exclusive domain of the counties, the municipalities and the school districts. Property taxes reflect local spending decisions."
Although nearly half of the state's 611 school districts will see outright cuts in their levels of state aid, and its 567 municipalities will get no increase at all from the budget, leaders of local government received the speech with resignation and in some cases a sense of relief that the budget news was not worse.
"It's better than we expected, or feared," said William Dressell, director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities. "State aid to municipalities makes up a large portion of the budgets of many local governments, so naturally we were concerned with all the talk of cutting back. So just staying even is a plus, you could say."
While Mrs. Whitman had wavered on the timing of her three-year, 30 percent pledge in October, she said today that better-than-anticipated tax revenue figures that came in Jan. 4 -- spurred by a strong state economy -- made today's bold proposal possible.
In many ways, Mrs. Whitman's challenge was less daunting than the task facing her fellow Republicans in New York and Connecticut. To pay for today's income tax cuts, she had to trim only $ 247 million out of a $ 16 billion budget, while Gov. George E. Pataki in New York has said he will have to cut $ 5 billion out of a $ 34 billion budget to deliver his first round of income tax cuts.
New Jersey is a wealthier state than New York, and its economy has led the region as the pharmaceutical and electronics industries have prospered while Wall Street has yet to recover from the recession. Also, New Jersey's social agenda has always been far less ambitious than New York's.
Governor Whitman is expected to get the budget reductions she asks for. Republicans control both houses of the Legislature and, as State Senator John A. Lynch, leader of the Senate Democrats said after the speech, "Who's going to vote against a tax cut?"
Ever mindful of New Jersey's business climate, Governor Whitman also she she would seek to repeal a tax on Yellow Pages advertising, worth $ 20 million a year; change a corporate income tax to save businesses $ 33 million, and cut the rate of tax on businesses earning less than $ 100,000 a year to 7.5 percent from 9 percent, worth $ 14 million.
That lower rate will give New Jersey the lowest small-business tax rate in the region, the Governor said.
The Democrats were generally subdued in their response, acknowledging that Mrs. Whitman has torpedoed the old language of budget making, based on needs, and substituted her own logic, founded on tax reductions. An example of one Democratic legislative response, from Assemblyman Joseph J. Rogers: "The Governor's 15 percent tax cut announcement advances her carefully tailored public image so she can compete with the O.J. Simpson trial in her ongoing campaign for the national spotlight and higher office."
Henry A. Coleman, a professor of government at Rutgers and a former ranking member of the Republican administration of Thomas H. Kean, said in an interview that the relationship between state spending and local taxes is more complex than Mrs. Whitman's approach would suggest, since many local functions, including the biggest one, education, are required and regulated by state law. He said it was unfair to say that the state has nothing to do with local spending levels, since it mandates many services.
"You can't expect the state to come in and ratify every increase in spending a local government wants with more aid -- that's the argument she's making, and it's a reasonable concern on her part," Dr. Coleman said. "But you really have to balance what is local discretion and what services the state requires localities to buy."
Indeed, Mrs. Whitman proposed two measures today to help move school districts toward greater frugality. One would help school districts merge into more efficient regional districts, and the other would reduce state aid levels to schools that spend too much on bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: State of the Union? One Day, Paralyzed

BYLINE: By Paul Starr; Paul Starr, professor of sociology at Princeton, is co-editor of The American Prospect.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
When the Framers replaced the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, they gave the Government unqualified and unimpeded fiscal powers. Today, a new Republican majority in Congress proposes to overturn that decision. Speaker Newt Gingrich says he intends to reverse the growth of the Federal Government's role in society since 1932. The legacy he challenges, however, is not only that of Franklin D. Roosevelt but more fundamentally that of Alexander Hamilton.
As President Clinton delivers his State of the Union Message tonight, many Americans will wonder about the fate of particular programs and policies in the new Congress. But the larger question raised by the Republicans is the Government's capacity to act, for they propose not just to shrink programs but to impose a permanent constitutional straightjacket that is likely to paralyze the Government in future crises. 
 The Constitution is a parsimonious document, unencumbered with detailed policy prescriptions. This restraint expresseed confidence in representative government; it left the people's future representatives free to confront problems the Founders knew they could not anticipate. As Hamilton explains in "The Federalist" (No. 30), it was imprudent to set any limit to the new government's taxing power because there was no clear limit to the demands that might be placed upon it. The Constitutional Convention deliberately rejected requirements for supermajorities: impediments to revenue-raising had helped make the Articles of Confederation unworkable.
Today's Republican majority apparently believes it is more capable of making fiscal policy for future generations than were the Founding Fathers. It seeks to prescribe a balanced-budget amendment, to require a three-fifths supermajority for tax increases and to prohibit the Government from imposing requirements on the states except when it assumes 100 percent of the costs.
These measures are frankly intended to disable a Government that many Americans say they no longer trust. Yet those measures severely weaken the Government's capacity to achieve any purpose. They hand weapons to minorities to obstruct majorities: a minority in either house would be able to impede preparations for national defense as well as spending on the poor.
If in the pursuit of a balanced budget in the year 2002, we cut Medicare and social programs and provoked an inevitable angry reaction, it would be all the harder to find money for purposes that conservatives prefer, whether "Star Wars" defense systems, more prisons or intensified border patrols.
The Government capacity's to act is a resource as much for conservative as for liberal purposes. So those who are planting a time bomb under the welfare state may see it explode in their own faces.
The comeuppance could be much more serious for the nation than for any party. The dangers would likely be greatest in a recession. If revenue fell along with economic activity and if three-fifths of Congress could not agree to run a deficit, the Government would be forced to aggravate the downturn by cutting public expenditures as well -- a recipe for turning recessions into depressions.
The Pentagon is committed to maintaining forces prepared to fight two wars simultaneously, but a nation with weakened fiscal powers is much less capable of sustaining such commitments. Our enemies would understand this and act accordingly.
Some critics may dismiss these as empty worries. After all, the amendment, if passed in time, would not require a balanced budget until 2002. But seven years come soon enough. Concerns about the amendment are empty only if the amendment itself is empty of force.
The requirements for supermajorities are the most dangerous element in the Republicans' plan. But even if they reduced voting requirements to an absolute majority of members of Congress -- as many Democrats prefer -- it would give undue constitutional force to the norm of budget balancing.
Denying the Government the routine power to borrow is a surrender to the medieval view of debt that continues to shape popular attitudes. The introduction of credit cards almost three decades ago prompted overwhelming disapproval in public opinion surveys; meanwhile, Americans got the cards in droves.
There has never been a time -- not even during the New Deal -- when public opinion surveys failed to register overwhelming disapproval of government deficits. Yet Americans' disapproval of deficits ought to be taken as a mandate for constitutional prohibition about as seriously as their disapproval of credit cards was taken as grounds for outlawing charge accounts. Credit cards have not doomed the economy, nor will Federal deficits.
The problem of the deficit is its long-term rate of growth, which is due almost entirely to projected health care costs. There are no more grounds for making a zero deficit a constitutionally required objective than for denying corporations or families the ability to borrow. Federal deficits of 1 or 2 percent of the gross domestic product are entirely manageable. If the outstanding debt is inflation-adjusted annually, deficits of that scale typically do not amount to a real increase in the debt anyway.
Judge Robert Bork opposes the amendment as unworkable. So do other jurists, who think that if Congress used accounting gimmicks to portray an unbalanced budget as balanced, the courts would have no competence to enforce the amendment. And some state officials worry that the burdens of Federal cutbacks would be passed on to them. If the Senate does not derail the amendment, such objections may well do so.
The original rationale for constitutional parsimony still stands. We will never know enough about the future to predict the tests that democratic government will face. More than 200 years of American history should assure us that the Republic not only can survive without constitutionally imposed fiscal restrictions, it has been better off without them.
If the Constitution had required a balanced budget, many members of Congress would not sit there today: for one thing, Thomas Jefferson could never have completed the Louisiana Purchase.
Hamilton's legacy of unimpeded fiscal power has been crucial to a system of government that has brought us through wars, depressions and natural calamities to an unchallenged position as the strongest nation on earth.
During the Depression, World War II and the cold war, there was a ready-made answer to questions about why we needed a strong Federal Government. The crisis of Government capacity has erupted today in part because there is no longer any shared sense of the Government's overriding mission. But depressions and wars have not been banished forever; rules we adopt now must be good when the world turns bad. Constitutionalizing fiscal policy is bad for the Constitution and bad for fiscal policy. It would make a mockery of one or a failure of the other, or both.

HEADLINE: Some Mexican Bonds Go Unsold

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
With American loan guarantees for Mexico unresolved, the peso weakened again today and the Mexican stock market drifted.
Interest rates on the latest sale of key Government bonds soared above 26 percent. 
 Even at those high rates, the Government could only find buyers for two-thirds of the $400 million worth of short-term bonds, called tesobonos, that it offered today. By contrast, investors snapped up all the bonds available at the last scheduled sale a week ago, increasing confidence then that the Mexican economy could recover from the bruising devaluation of the peso in December.
The peso fell to 5.745 to the dollar today, down from 5.705 on Monday. It has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the dollar since Dec. 20, when it traded at 3.46 pesos to the dollar.
Today's disappointing auction of bonds, and the high interest rates the Government had to agree to pay, illustrated how much Mexico's recovery depends on American Congressional approval of the $40 billion loan-guarantee package, now the subject of vigorous argument in Washington and elsewhere in the United States. Mexico's credibility in the financial markets has fallen so low that to some investors, the creditworthiness of the country appears doubtful no matter how much interest it offers to pay.
"The U.S. investing public is waiting to see what is the status of the bailout package," said Scott E. Kalb, managing director of emerging markets research at Smith Barney & Company in New York. "That's the final piece in the puzzle."
Passage of the loan guarantees has been hindered by members of Congress who are trying to add economic and political conditions. The House Banking Committee is scheduled to open its hearings on the package in Washington on Wednesday, with the new Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, testifying. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to begin its hearings Thursday. A vote on the package would take place after the hearings are concluded.
But the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, said today, "My assessment is that they are not getting close" to rounding up enough votes to approve the loan guarantees.
Although the Mexican Government is under increasing criticism at home for having run to the United States for help, it acknowledges that recovery would be almost impossible without the American guarantees. On Monday, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz told angry Mexican legislators that he had been negotiating with private commercial banks and the governments of other nations, in case the American package fell through or the United States Congress imposed conditions that Mexico considered unacceptable.
But even Mr. Ortiz conceded that the alternatives would only delay Mexico's problems, not solve them. He said it might be possible to get commercial banks to place a modest amount of short-term bonds, "but we would not be able to do so in sufficient amounts to really solve for once and for all this problem."
The $40 billion in loan guarantees from the United States would buy time for Mexico, providing assurance for foreign and domestic investors that Mexico would meet its obligations in 1995, and giving Mexico time to sell airports, railroads and other state-run enterprises to private buyers. Proceeds from the sales would be used to permanently retire much of that short-term debt.
The Mexican stock market began the day with substantial gains, but then lost some of its momentum after the results of the bond auction were announced. By the end of trading, the market index closed at 2,095.61, up a modest 27.12 points, or 1.31 percent.
Telefonos de Mexico, the largest company on the exchange, estimated that it would show a pretax loss of 4.4 billion pesos in 1994 as a result of the peso's devaluation. The American depository receipts of Telmex closed in New York today at $35 a share, down 75 cents.
Investors interpreted the outcome of the bond auction today as a sign of Mexico's continuing lack of credibility. The bonds are pegged to dollars and are thus considered the most secure type of Mexican debt. The interest rate for the benchmark 91-day bond rose to 24.98 percent, the sixth straight week that the rate has gone up. Rates for six-month bonds rose to 26.99 percent, and one-year bonds were sold at 21.4 percent.

Crops Holding Promise Beyond Food

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Most of the crops America's farmers raise each year are eaten. But the country's agribusiness is hoping that the small portion that is not consumed can be turned into a new wave of profitable nonfood agricultural products.
Many of the recent innovations, like corn-based golf tees and biodegradable pens, are relatively inconsequential novelties. But others, like new lubricants, fuel additives, and inks, make up the advanced guard of products that could eventually earn billions of dollars annually for farmers and agribusinesses while benefiting the environment. 
 "The 1990's may be witnessing an historic turnaround in the fortunes of plant matter," said David Morris, an economic development specialist at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Minneapolis who has studied the potential for using materials derived from plants instead of fossil fuels like oil and coal.
No one expects a return to the early days of this century, when scientists like Thomas Edison and George Washington Carver were famous for their research into new industrial uses for crops and industrialists like Henry Ford not only wanted to run cars on soybean oil but also to build steering wheels and other parts from soybean-based plastics.
World War II and the cheap oil era that followed dramatically highlighted the attractions of fossil fuels, which have a higher energy content by weight and volume, and are easily processed into a variety of wondrously durable plastics and fibers.
Nor is the rebound going to put any oil companies out of business. Farmers would satisfy only a small fraction of the demand for gasoline, fuel oil, plastics and other petroleum-based products even if every bushel of every crop planted last year went to such uses.
Even enthusiasts like Mr. Morris concede that the rebound is starting from a very low base: Fewer than 10 million tons annually of plant matter other than wood go into industrial and construction products in the United States, compared with roughly 175 million tons of petroleum and coal and 300 million tons of inorganic minerals like sand, salt and iron ore. About 6 million tons of corn go into fuel and about 450 million tons of plants end up as food or animal feed.
Still, growing industrial use of crops could slow the nation's increasing dependence on oil and other raw materials imported from politically unstable areas like the Persian Gulf. A Department of Energy study last year concluded that 19 of the 50 most widely used chemicals in the United States could wholly or partly be replaced by biomass feedstocks, as materials from plants and animals are known. Petrochemical companies say that outside of a few niches, raw materials from plants are no match for oil-based products on a cost or performance basis. A crucial part of the equation, they say, is how much industry has invested in existing processes and factories.
The environmental pitfalls of some petrochemical materials are providing a market opening for some agricultural products that cannot compete simply on a per-pound cost basis with petrochemicals. Construction companies, for example, have begun to use Bio-Form, which is made from the oil in rape (a relative of mustard), to coat the wood beams that keep concrete in place while it hardens. The coating allows the workers to remove the wood after the concrete has set. By using Bio-Form, which is made by the Leahy-Wolf Company of Franklin Park, Ill., instead of cheap but noxious substances like waste motor oil, construction companies do not need to give workers gloves or respirators. Because Bio-Form breaks down into harmless components, the companies also avoid the kind of lawsuits many have run into charging them with contaminating their work site.
Other developing market niches have bigger potential, not all of which would come at the expense of oil companies. Phenix Biocomposites Inc., a privately held company in Mankato, Minn., is aiming Environ, a blend of soybean flour, shredded newspapers, and mixers, at the building materials market. "Looks like granite, works like wood," is the company's slogan. An independent study commissioned by the United Soybean Board, a Government-appointed trade organization that oversees spending of research and promotion funds raised from farmers, said that the annual market for such hardwood replacements could be $1.8 billion by the turn of the century.
Phenix's giant neighbor, Cargill Inc. in Minneapolis, is currently leading a new assault on one of the biggest petroleum-based markets of all: plastics. Cargill has been making up to 1,200 pounds an hour of Eco-Pla, a polymer derived from the lactic acid produced by fermenting corn, at a plant it built for $10 million in Savage, Minn. Polylactic acid, as the polymer is known, was discovered in 1833 and has been used in surgical products like sutures and screws because it breaks down harmlessly in the body. But it has cost hundreds of dollars a pound to produce.
Cargill has figured out how to make polylactic acid for as little as $3 a pound in Savage. It has designed a production line for its plant in Blair, Neb., that should be efficient enough for Cargill to make up to 300 million pounds annually for sale at about $1 a pound.
"It looks and functions just like a plastic but has the added advantage of degrading completely when disposed of," said Patrick Gruber, a general manager at Cargill. "This could be the first renewable polymer product to break into a classic petrochemical product stream."
Cargill said various Eco-Pla formulations could be used as paper coatings, fast-food containers and cutlery, disposable diapers and trash bags. Among those on the record as interested is the Packaging Corporation of America, a large manufacturer of packaging material for fast-food companies.
"We see a lot of interest from our customers in biodegradability," said Gordon Putz, vice president of marketing for the Packaging Corporation. He said the company aimed to have Eco-Pla products by 1997.
Because plant chemistry was so neglected as oil and other hydrocarbons came to dominate the economy, researchers say the area is now ripe for innovations like Eco-Pla. And that is without even factoring in the new tools of biotechnology, which make it easier for researchers to manipulate plants to produce bigger quantities of valuable substances or variations on naturally occurring compounds.
But even if the new products eventually begin selling in sizable enough quantities to have a significant impact on the overall demand for major crops, it is by no means clear that farmers will capture many of the benefits. Demand will have to rise faster than their ever-increasing productivity to raise prices. That explains why many farmers are more interested in specialized strains of their crops, like Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.'s new varieties of soybeans that are low in saturated fat, than new end uses. These hybrids could be sold at premium prices to food processors trying to create healthier products.
But others see new uses as a means for getting better returns. Robert Schemel, who grows corn, soybeans and sugar beets on 3,000 acres in southern Minnesota, is chairman of a new farmers' cooperative that is raising money to build a processing plant to make Environ for Phenix Biocomposites. Once the plant is running, Mr. Schemel said, the farmers who own it will get up to $9 a bushel more for soybeans than the market price, which is currently $5.50 a bushel.
"We want to get as close to the consumer as possible," said Mr. Schemel, who sees Environ as a way to branch into higher-margin products. "If a farmer does not do more to his crop than just grow it, his long-term viability is limited."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 4.71 Points As Stocks Finish Mixed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, the third session where the leading indexes have been virtually stagnant. The lackluster day was perhaps a harbinger of the next five sessions leading to a Federal Reserve policy meeting that begins on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.71 points, to 3,862.70, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.04 point, to 465.86. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 3.69 points, to 763.20. 
 Traders are watching the continuing financial troubles in Mexico for a clue to worldwide market conditions. The Mexican central bank yesterday could not sell all its dollar-denominated short-term bonds, called tesobonos, and the yield on the 91-day bonds rose to 24.98 percent, from 19.75 percent last week. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
In addition, Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, said yesterday that Republican leaders and the White House had so far failed to reach agreement on conditions for President Clinton's $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico. A Congressional vote, which had been expected by Friday, may now take longer.
Probably the only market-sensitive economic report immediately facing traders is the Commerce Department's report on Friday of its initial estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The economy grew at a 4 percent annual pace in the third quarter, revised upward from 3.9 percent, and some economists, including some Fed governors, have speculated that fourth-quarter growth was even stronger.
The outlooks for inflation, interest rates and the level of corporate earnings are three major factors that move markets. All three factors are unsettled in traders' minds.
Even the strong corporate earnings that have been reported recently have failed to lift prices. Two cases in point: American Home Products, whose fourth-quarter net earnings of $1.30 a share exceeded expectations by 3 cents a share, and Martin Marietta, whose fourth-quarter profit of $1.30 a share exceeded expectations by 5 cents. Martin Marietta closed unchanged yesterday at 44 7/8, while American Home Products rose 1/4, to 66 1/4.
The stock market often takes its cue from the bond market, and bond prices have fallen for four consecutive days. When prices of bonds fall, their interest rates, or yields, rise to attract more buyers, thus weakening prices for stocks.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond is fast approaching 8 percent, a level it has not reached since Dec. 1. The long bond closed yesterday at a yield of 7.92 percent, up from 7.90 percent. The American depository receipts of Kirin Brewery rose 7 1/2, to 107, following reports that its Amagasaki factory had sustained no major damage from the earthquake in Kobe, though the plant has been shut down temporarily.
The A.D.R.'s of Kyocera, a Japanese ceramics makers, rose 5 1/2, to 133 1/2, probably a result of bargain hunting after steady declines in the five previous sessions. Cordis, a maker of catheters, rose 2 5/8, to 60 3/8, after reporting a 42 percent rise in fourth-quarter net, to 78 cents a share.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, reported its first fourth-quarter profit in five years, but its stock price still fell 4 1/8, to 95 1/2.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was slightly above average with 325.2 million shares changing hands.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.23 point, to 253.70, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,265 to 936.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Rise On New York City's Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
New York City's continuing fiscal problems forced the city to pay higher interest rates yesterday on its sale of $658 million in debt.
The offering, which included 30-year bonds, was intended to help the city avoid further cuts in its $31.8 billion budget. It will cost New York millions of dollars in extra interest payments compared with other similarly rated municipal bonds as Wall Street continues to worry that the city's problems will make it more difficult to finance its needs. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani decided to sell the refunding bonds last week to help close a budget deficit after acceding to requests from Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines not to cut another $120 million from the city's school budget during the rest of the school year.
The Mayor has managed to achieve more than $2 billion in budget savings, in part by moving to eliminate 15,000 jobs from the city's payroll. But revenue has dropped, partly because of a decline in Wall Street's fortunes and the impact that has on the city's economy.
The city's problems also affect the creditworthiness and market value of $23 billion in existing New York City securities.
Last week, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it was considering downgrading its A- rating on the city's securities if New York did not continue to cut spending.
Compared with other municipalities, New York was forced to sell its bonds yesterday at higher interest rates to attract buyers.
During discussions among dealers on Friday, the 30-year bond the city sold yesterday was expected to sell at a yield of 7.25 percent. In fact, the yield was 7.37 percent, 47 basis points more than the index of other 30-year municipal bonds compiled by the Delphis Hanover Corporation, a bond research company in Southbury, Conn. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The higher yield indicated that there was even greater reluctance to buy the city's bonds than underwriters had anticipated. By comparison, when the city last sold bonds in November, its 30-year bonds offered a yield that was 10 basis points below the comparable index.
Yesterday's rates drew enough demand that the city sold $13 million more in bonds than the $645 million it had first intended.
Serial bonds were priced to yield from 5.50 percent in 1997 to 6.55 percent in 6.80 percent in 2005, 7.10 percent in 2010 and 7.30 percent in 2013 through 2015.
Some analysts were relieved that the damage to New York City was not worse. Arthur D. Spector, managing director in charge of the public finance department of Prudential Securities, which was lead underwriter on the issue, said orders for the new bonds were about $1.3 billion. "That's not bad in the face of rising Treasury yields and concern about Mexico and Japan," he said.
Rating agencies have said they are unhappy with the city's plan to close its $650 million budget gap for the year ending June 30 by refunding maturing bonds with new bonds. That method just shifts the debt to future years, making it harder to restore fiscal stability later.
That transaction, though it cannot be repeated indefinitely, buys the Mayor time to bring the city's spending in line with revenue. It also gives the New York regional economy a chance to improve while avoiding larger cuts to city programs.
Compared with the city's current borrowing costs, which reflect debt incurred when interest rates were higher than they are today, the new bonds will help reduce costs slightly. David Neustadt, a spokesman for the Comptroller's office, said the city's policy toward refundings was that they must not only generate savings in the first five years, but also over the life of the new bonds.
Meanwhile, in the Treasury market yesterday, prices were lower for the fourth consecutive day on thin trading volume. Amid worries about everything from an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve to a weak dollar, the Treasury sold $17.25 billion of new two-year notes.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32 , to a price of 95 6/32 to yield 7.92 percent, up from 7.90 percent on Monday.
But some analysts saw signs of light at the end of the tunnel.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist for CS First Boston, said: "There are definitely expectations by the market that the Fed is near to accomplishing its objective" of slowing economic growth enough to reduce fears of inflation.
The following are the results of yesterday's two-year note auction:

HEADLINE: Chrysler In Warning On Rates

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Growth in new-car sales could slow this year and show little gain in 1996 if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates another half a percentage point, the Chrysler Corporation's chief economist said today.
"The Fed has already engineered a soft landing," said the economist, W. Van Bussmann. "Now, a little bit can throw you." 
 Auto makers have been voicing worries about rising rates for months, in an effort to discourage the Fed from further action. But, as sales have improved there has been little evidence that they were not just crying wolf.
In his comments today, however, Mr. Bussmann made the most direct plea yet of any auto maker that the Fed go no further. The Fed is expected to raise short-term interest rates next week, its seventh increase in a year.
Mr. Bussmann's comments, in a meeting with reporters at Chrysler's headquarters here, came less than a week after the Ford Motor Company cited higher rates as the reason for temporarily shutting three assembly plants.
Mr. Bussmann repeatedly said the Fed could squeeze too hard as it tried to restrain the economy. "The Fed is right on the cusp of not flattening the curve, but causing an actual downturn," he said.
The stock prices of auto makers have been slipping on investors' fears that car sales are slowing as interest rates rise. Today, in a slightly down market, the shares of the Big Three were actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and all of them lost ground. Chrysler fell 62.5 cents, to $46.75; Ford fell 12.5 cents, to $25.75, and shares in the General Motors Corporation slid 75 cents, to $38.75.
But just about everyone involved is guessing and no one really knows if the auto market is weakening. Many Wall Street analysts continue to say that demand for vehicles remains robust and that the stocks are good values.
Although no one would speak for attribution, several analysts played down Mr. Bussmann's comments today as posturing to deter the Fed. Further, Chrysler's sales projections have been far more optimistic than any in Detroit, and the company may simply be laying the groundwork to use the widely anticipated interest rate increase as a cover for lowering its estimates.
Last week, Ford said dealers had begun reducing their orders for new vehicles, not because customers were staying home but because higher interest rates were raising inventory costs. Ford has not released figures but a spokesman called the drop significant.
Mr. Bussmann said the market remained strong, adding that levels of disposable income, household debt and consumer confidence all augured well. But he said another increase of half a point in short-term rates would cause Chrysler to cut its 1995 industry sales estimate by as much as 100,000 units and its 1996 estimate by up to 500,000 cars and trucks.
Chrysler now projects that sales this year of all vehicles, including heavy-duty trucks, will rise 5.2 percent, to 16.2 million, from 15.4 million last year, and will jump another 3.6 percent, to 16.8 million next year.
By contrast, Ford projects industry sales of 15.8 million to 15.9 million this year, and does not offer a 1996 number. G.M., which was the closest to the mark last year, forecasts sales of 15.6 million this year, and further growth next year.
The industry record, set in 1986, is 16.3 million sales of cars and light and heavy trucks.
While some auto analysts have accused Chrysler of playing Pollyanna with its estimates, Mr. Bussman said, "I think they're out of step." One reason he cited today for his conditional optimism on potential sales was an internal Chrysler study that concluded, contrary to many analysts' fears, that vehicles are as affordable now as they have been in recent years. Mr. Bussmann said that last year 46 percent of American households could afford new cars, compared with 54 percent in 1988 and 47 percent in 1993.
Mr. Bussmann based those figures on a Chrysler-sponsored survey that put the average cost of a new car in the first quarter of 1994 at $16,700. The survey was conducted by Consumer Attitude Research, a Birmingham, Mich., consultant.
The new-car prices found in the survey were substantially lower than those in a Commerce Department study that has been widely used inside and outside the industry. The Commerce Department put the average cost of a new car in the first quarter of 1994 at $19,112.
Mr. Bussmann said the Commerce Department figures overstated prices, because they did not factor in rebates and other discounts. Clint McCully, chief of the consumption branch of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produced the study, acknowledged those deficiencies and said that his office, prompted by Mr. Bussmann, had begun a review of its survey.
But he added that while the survey overstated some costs, it understated others, and that it was too early to predict what revision might be necessary.

HEADLINE: Top Fidelity Executive Quits Fixed-Income Unit

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Thomas J. Steffanci, who joined Fidelity Investments four years ago to head its fixed-income division, has resigned, Fidelity said yesterday.
Mr. Steffanci, who is 50, is leaving Fidelity, the giant mutual fund company based in Boston, to become a principal at Alpha Select Investments Inc., a small broker-dealer in Portsmouth, N.H., that specializes in developing analytical tools for portfolio management. His resignation is effective Feb. 28. 
 "He was not pushed out," a spokeswoman for Fidelity, Marilyn Morrison, said. "He was not fired."
But some former Fidelity employees, traders at other firms and mutual fund company analysts said yesterday that Mr. Steffanci was a victim of the debacle that swept through the bond markets around the world last year. Mr. Steffanci may have not been asked to leave, those people said, but displeasure among Fidelity's top management about the performance of his division left him little choice.
"He felt that his authority as head of the group was being undermined by senior management," said one former Fidelity employee, who asked not to be identified.
Eric Kobren, editor of Fidelity Insight, a newsletter in Wellesley, Mass., that follows the company, said: "The pressure to produce is extraordinary. It's not something they tell you to do. It's in the walls and in the air."
The Wall Street Journal first reported yesterday that Mr. Steffanci was leaving Fidelity. The company later confirmed the report.
Mr. Steffanci, in a statement issued by Fidelity, said, "ASI presented an exciting opportunity to become a principal at a new firm, and at the same time has allowed me to return to my family and to Southern California."
Mr. Steffanci, who came to Fidelity from CMB Investment Counselors in Los Angeles, will work from California for Alpha Select.
A telephone call to Mr. Steffanci's office yesterday seeking further comment was not returned.
In the same statement, Fidelity said the fixed-income group, at least for now, would report directly to J. Gary Burkhead, president and chief executive of the Fidelity Management and Research Company, investment adviser to the Fidelity mutual funds.
Mr. Steffanci was hired to increase the size and improve the performance of Fidelity's bond portfolios through a more aggressive management style. For three years, it worked well.
When he arrived in 1990 Fidelity had about $12 billion in its fixed- income funds. As interest rates fell steadily through the 1990's, Mr. Steffanci and other bond fund managers diversified into riskier, higher-yielding debt instruments, from derivatives to emerging market bonds.
From 1991 to 1993 the performance of Fidelity's fixed-income funds generally was in the top third of those covered by Lipper Analytical Securities. The assets under management had climbed to a peak of $31.1 billion in early 1994.
Then the roof fell in. Like many other fixed-income managers, Mr. Steffanci was caught by surprise when the Federal Reserve began pushing up short-term interest rates last February.
"They were convinced the Fed's first rate increase would not be followed by others," the former Fidelity employee said. "They had tremendous bets that bond yields would not keep going up, and they kept making them."
Compounding the problem, the fallout of higher United States interest rates affected Mexico, hurting many emerging market bond funds. Fidelity was hit harder than most.
Last year, Fidelity's general United States Government bond funds were ranked at the bottom of the 145 such funds covered by Lipper; its global bond funds were ranked 96th of 106. By the end of December the assets in the 47 funds in the fixed- income group had shrunk to $24 billion.

Ousted German Executive Sues Nation's Biggest Bank

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Thirteen months after Metallgesellschaft A.G., the giant German metals, futures and oil trader, was bailed out to the tune of more than $2 billion, fresh recriminations are flying in a bitter court battle that pits the company's former chief executive against its current management and Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest financial institution.
In a case that could shed new light on the events that caused Metallgesellschaft's liquidity crisis in December 1993, its former chief executive, Heinz Schimmelbusch, filed a $10 million suit in New York Supreme Court last Friday, contending that Deutsche Bank used the company's troubles to profit financially and needlessly brought it to the point of bankruptcy. 
 Mr. Schimmelbusch, who was dismissed in late 1993 along with most of the senior management, accused his successor at Metallgesellschaft, Rolando Schmitz, and Deutsche Bank of conducting a "systematic campaign of defamation" that left him unable to get a job.
Metallgesellschaft dismissed Mr. Schimmelbusch's assertions as "grotesque," and Deutsche Bank called them part of a "continuing campaign of disinformation." It threatened to countersue Mr. Schimmelbusch after it publishes the results of a study on the company's crisis. The study, prepared in part by Coopers & Lybrand, is expected to be released in a few days.
Metallgesellschaft teetered on the brink of collapse toward the end of 1993, when the spot price of oil fell below the price of the positions in oil futures taken by its New York energy-trading subsidiary, the MG Corporation, causing huge losses.
Deutsche Bank, which owns 11 percent of Metallgesellschaft, stepped in and dismissed Mr. Schimmelbusch and other top managers, putting in Mr. Schmitz as new chief executive. The new management then added to the losses by closing out the subsidiary's oil-futures positions.
Deutsche Bank persuaded a group of creditor banks to come up with $2.2 billion to bail out the company. The bank is now negotiating with the creditor banks for a further injection of cash into Metallgesellschaft.
Deutsche Bank has been criticized for not paying sufficient attention to its investments. Public pressure has also mounted in Germany to review the practice of letting big German banks hold stakes in German industrial concerns.
Last summer, Prof. Merton Miller, an economist at the University of Chicago, said in a report that Deutsche Bank had mishandled the situation, panicked and needlessly liquidated the futures positions, effectively causing the losses.
Mr. Schimmelbusch is the second former executive to file a suit against Metallgesellschaft. Arthur Benson, its former head oil trader, is seeking damages of $1 billion, contending that the new management sabotaged his efforts to stop the losses.
In his suit, Mr. Schimmelbusch contended that his successor, Mr. Schmitz, and Deutsche Bank officials schemed to take advantage of the industrial concern's troubles and make profits for the bank. He accused Mr. Schmitz, who was a member of the Deutsche Bank board, of precipitating the crisis so that he would be given control of Metallgesellschaft.
Deutsche Bank, in a statement, said that once its case comes to trial, "a full airing of the facts in court will finally resolve any questions about culpability and responsibility."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls vs. Yen as Japan Increases Its Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the yen and other leading currencies after a Japanese Government report showed the country's trade surplus with the United States swelled last year.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus with the United States rose 2.8 percent in December from a year earlier, pushing the surplus for all of 1994 to a record $54.96 billion. The trade gap means Japanese exporters have a large amount of dollars to sell for yen when they send revenue from American sales home. 
 The dollar pared its losses against the yen later in the day. Market participants said they remained concerned about Japan's ability to rebuild after last week's deadly earthquake.
"There were conflicting factors that affected the market," said Tom Hoge, corporate currency trader at the Bank of New York. The trade numbers put pressure on the market until "the market focus went back to the earthquake," he said.
After hitting a low of 99.21 yen, the dollar later settled in New York trading at 99.76 yen, down from 99.80 yen on Monday. The dollar slipped to 1.5125 German marks from 1.5145 marks, and to 1.2710 Swiss francs from 1.2705 Swiss francs.
The dollar will be unable to rise much against the yen, analysts said, as long as the trade imbalance between the United States and Japan remains large. Signs of trade tension between the United States and Japan have hurt the dollar since early 1993, when President Clinton and his aides said a strong yen would help balance trade with Japan by making Japanese goods more expensive.
Market participants' worries about whether Congress will approve the Clinton Administration's aid package for Mexico also weighed on the dollar, dealers said.
In other currency trading, the British pound rose to a two-month high against the dollar amid expectations that strong economic growth would prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month.
The pound rose to $1.6014 yesterday, its highest level since Nov. 11, before retreating in New York to $1.5975, up from $1.5940 on Monday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Evaluate Outlook in Kobe Quake Area

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Thirty seconds after his alarm went off at 5:45 A.M. last Tuesday, Glenn Spargo, general manager of Sea-Land Service, had the jolt of his life.
The earthquake that struck Kobe, where Mr. Spargo was living with his family, knocked out the electricity and made it impossible to conduct normal business. But Mr. Spargo convinced a friend to lend him a tugboat and he went to inspect the pier. There he got some bad news: His four cranes were damaged and the asphalt by the berths had sunk four to five feet. 
 The terminals will take about six months to repair fully, and in the meantime he has been trucking his container loads to Osaka. But in the long term, he said, Sea-Land would remain in the area.
"Absolutely we'll remain in Kobe," Mr. Spargo said in a phone interview from the stricken city. "We have a commitment to Kobe."
Having checked on their families and employees and assessed the damage to their plants and offices, managers at American companies are only beginning to evaluate the prospects this year for business in the Kansai region, as the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto area is known. For the most part, many say that earthquakes are a "risk of doing business" in Japan and have no plans to scale down, but with the recession here and the high cost of doing business in Japan, some are raising more fundamental questions.
"The Kansai politicians, economists and business organizations had such high hopes for this year, with the new airport and all, and it was going to be the year of Kansai," said Ron Siani, the administrator for the Kansai regional office of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "Now, this is going to be destroyed.
"With China such a player in the world market, is it necessary to have a presence in Japan? Companies are looking to Singapore or another country to establish an Asian presence. It's a wild card, but what would happen if Tokyo was hit with an earthquake? Where would you go?"
For now, businesses are temporarily relocating to Osaka, about 20 miles from Kobe. Proctor & Gamble Far East Inc. evacuated its headquarters on Rokko Island after a leak in a large tank of liquid petroleum gas led the Government to order 70,000 people in the area to leave temporarily.
Eli Lilly Japan had just moved into its new 12-story headquarters in Kobe a month ago. It made a $60 million investment in a new plant nearby that was going to open on Feb. 1 and make Vancomycin, a drug used to treat post-operative complications. Now its new plant and its barely used furniture have been damaged.
Over the weekend, the company leased temporary office space in Osaka. But the plant's opening will probably be delayed until around May, according to Jean-Pierre Millon, the subsidiary's general manager. In the meantime, Eli Lilly will ship products to its clients from the United States.
"The risk of earthquakes is there all throughout Japan," said Mr. Millon, who has spent the last week shuttling in his car among his damaged plant, his temporary and damaged offices and his Osaka hotel room. "We have no plans to leave the area."
Eli Lilly, which had its distribution interrupted for only one day, is planning to donate insulin and antibiotics to people living in shelters in Kobe, Mr. Million said.
As a result of the earthquake, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. might have an expanded market for hydraulic excavators that it makes in a plant in the western part of Kobe. Dorwin R. Larsen, general manager of the hydraulic excavator development center at Shin Caterpillar, said there was some damage to the office building and equipment in the design office and there would be some delays at the plant, which makes 10,000 excavators a year at one of Caterpillar's largest plants.
"There are already plenty of excavators around for that," Mr. Larsen said in a telephone interview, referring to the post-quake rebuilding that is getting under way in Kobe.
"I suppose they're going to need a lot of construction equipment for rebuilding," he said, but acknowledged he had not thought about it. "I've been dealing with our people's immediate problems. That's totally dominated my week."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Halt By Alfa Romeo

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Italian car maker Fiat S.p.A. said today that it would stop making its Alfa Romeo cars for the North American market after this year because of heavy losses.
That will mean the end of Fiat's passenger-car presence in the United States. Fiat also makes cars under its own name and under the name Lancia, although they are not sold in the United States or Canada. 
 Fiat said that "Alfa Romeo's continued presence in the North American market has become increasingly economically unfeasible" and that it expected losses to continue. The statement did not give details of the losses.
The company said it could not justify the cost of adapting future models to United States specifications.
Fiat had a loss in 1993 for the first time since the 1970's. Analysts expect it to bounce back with a profit of more than $1 billion for 1994.

HEADLINE: Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's Response to the State of the Union Message

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Following is Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's response to President Clinton's State of the Union message, as transcribed by The New York Times:
Good evening. Before I begin, let me assure you I am not going to ask for equal time. I'm Christie Whitman, Governor of New Jersey, and I am addressing you tonight from the historic legislative chamber in Trenton, one of the oldest in the nation. Speaking to you this evening is a tremendous honor for all of us here in New Jersey. 
 It is appropriate that we have come together tonight in Trenton. On Christmas morning in 1776, George Washington crossed the icy Delaware River and surprised King George's mercenaries in their barracks here on these grounds. The Battle of Trenton was a turning point in the American Revolution.
Just as that revolution two centuries ago began in the Colonies, there is a revolution sweeping America today, begun not in Washington, D.C., but in the states. In Wisconsin, in Ohio, in Massachusetts, in South Carolina, in California. The American people are seeking freedom in a new revolution that began before I ever came to office.
It is a revolution of ideas, one in which the voters are given a clear choice between bigger or smaller government, higher or lower taxes, more or less spending.
It is a revolution about a free and sovereign people saying they want power to return to them, from their state houses, from their county governments, their city halls.
In elections all across America, the voters have chosen smaller government, lower taxes and less spending. They rejected the tyranny of expanding welfare state policies, the arrogance of bigger and bigger government, the frustration of one-size-fits-all answers.
In a word, they have chosen freedom.
They elected leaders like Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, who in his first month in office, cut state spending by $1.7 billion. Since then he's cut taxes five times and brought Massachusetts the third-lowest unemployment rate in the nation. And Gov. Pete Wilson, who has already reformed health care in California, using market forces to guarantee access for millions of uninsured, and made health care more affordable for small businesses.
They elected governors who said we should have smaller, more efficient government and meant it. Like Gov. Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin: he's cut spending, cut taxes and led the most comprehensive welfare reform movement in the country.
And Gov. Fife Symington, of Arizona, who became one of several Republican governors to cut taxes every year they were in office and see their economies boom.
In state after state, the revolution of ideas took hold.
By 1994, Gov. George Allen reformed the criminal justice system and abolished parole in Virginia. And the same month President Bill Clinton signed the largest tax increase in American history, Gov. John Engler signed the largest tax cut in Michigan history, helping bring the lowest unemployment rate to that state in 20 years.
Here in New Jersey, like so many other governors, I was told my tax-cutting policies were a gimmick. I heard we couldn't do it, that it was impossible, that it would hurt the economy.
But I had given my word to the people of New Jersey that we would cut their taxes. And we did.
In the first year, with the help of the New Jersey Legislature, we cut business taxes. We reduced income taxes not once but twice. We lowered state spending, not recklessly, but carefully and fairly. Just yesterday, I announced a third wave of income tax cuts, another 15 percent, taking us to a 30 percent reduction to put more money in the hands of families like yours. The results have been solid: state revenues are up, even from the income tax, and 60,000 more New Jerseyans are at work today than were a year ago, making this year our best year for job creation since 1988. And we did it all under a balanced budget requirement to our state's constitution.
In November, the revolution came to Washington. Now people want less government, lower taxes and less spending from their Federal Government. People want results.
In both houses of Congress, the Republican Party has been elected, like many of us in the states were, on an agenda of change.
We're committed to reforming welfare: to encourage people to work and to stop children from having children.
We want to force the government to live within its means by stopping runaway spending and balancing the Federal budget.
We want to lower taxes for families and make it easier to achieve the American dream: to save money, buy a home and send the kids to college.
We're going to stop violent criminals in their tracks with real prison time for repeat offenders and a workable death penalty. We must send a message to our young people that crime doesn't pay.
And we're going to slash those unnecessary regulations that strangle small business in America, to make it easier to create more jobs and pay better wages and become more competitive in the global marketplace.
We intend to create a new era of hope and opportunity for all Americans.
Many of these ideas are the same ones governors have been enacting here in the states. Time after time, Republicans -- and Democrats -- have found that things work better when states and communities set their own priorities, rather than being bossed around by bureaucrats in Washington.
Our colleagues on Capitol Hill are facing the same opposition we did, the same cries of "it can't be done" from the Washington-knows-best crowd --people who think government can't be too big and that there's a virtue in raising taxes. Well, there is nothing virtuous about raising taxes. There is nothing heroic about preserving a welfare system that entraps people. And there's nothing high-minded about wasting other people's money on big government spending sprees.
We overcame the same objections, the same stalling and distortion, the same foot-dragging. We've heard it all. And in the end, we have won the battle of ideas in our states.
Now it's time to win the battle of ideas in Washington.
If the people's agenda is to succeed in Congress, everyone needs to work together. And while at times tonight some of the President's ideas sounded pretty Republican, the fact remains that he has been opposed to the balanced budget requirement; he proposed even more government spending, and he imposed the biggest tax increase in American history.
It's clear that your votes in November sounded a warning to the President. If he has truly changed his big-government agenda, we say, "Great, join us as we change America." Republicans welcome your ideas for making government not bigger, but smaller. As we have moved forward and as we move forward in the next two years, the President and Congress should be reminded that success is not measured in the number of laws passed, but in the results. Is government serving the people better? Are neighborhoods safer? Are families stronger? Are children learning more? Are we better prepared to meet the future? Do we have more freedom?
The election in November was a beginning, not an end; and we are committed to fulfilling the verdict of the voters and enacting our agenda of hope for the families of America. Change is hard. But we're going to work hard. We will keep faith with America. We will keep our word. We will do what you elected us to do. We will give you results.
On Election Day, you gave us your trust. We accept your mandate. President Clinton, you must accept it as well.
Put the principles of smaller, more effective government into action. Reduce spending and cut taxes.
Two weeks ago, in my State of the State address to the people of New Jersey, I made them a pledge, which, in closing, I would now like to make to the American people on behalf of the Republican Party.
By the time President Clinton makes his next State of the Union address:
We will have lower taxes.
We will have more efficient government.
We will have a stronger America.
We will have more faith in our politics, more pride in our states and communities, and more confidence in ourselves.
We will go forward together, as one family with many faces, building a future with opportunity.
A future with security.
A future based on mutual respect and responsibility.
And most of all, a future filled with hope, for our children and our children's children.
Thank you very much and God bless America.

HEADLINE: Clinton Orders Assets of Suspected Terrorist Groups Frozen

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Seeking to underscore an American commitment to the fight against terrorism, President Clinton today issued an executive order intended to cut off the flow of funds from United States citizens to organizations suspected of terrorist activities in Israel and other countries.
Mr. Clinton's directive orders American financial institutions to search for and immediately freeze any accounts held in the names of Hamas, Islamic Holy War and 10 other organizations, and 18 of their top leaders. 
 It also forbids financial transfers from the United States to those groups and individuals and will seek to prevent them from gaining access to donations made to charitable causes in the Middle East.
Administration officials said it was too soon to know whether any assets would be uncovered.
While today's announcement at the White House emerged from an Administration review concluding that the United States could do more to limit terrorists' access to money, aides to Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the timing had been largely dictated by the quest for a tough-worded centerpiece to the State of the Union address.
Mr. Clinton's intention, according to the aides, was to use the speech in part to demonstrate his commitment to preserving gains in the Middle East against those who would scuttle peace efforts.
Even if the groups identified today do not hold accounts in their names, the officials said the directive could give the Government more power to block and deter transfers to them -- even when those are disguised as contributions to charity.
"It is not foolproof," a senior Administration official said at a White House briefing this afternoon. "It is capable of being circumvented through a variety of strategems." But another official said the measures could "essentially sever the lifeline that keeps these organizations going."
As evidence of the need for a firmer hand against terrorism, the White House pointed to the suicide bombing on Sunday in Jerusalem, which left 19 people dead and for which a Syrian-based faction of Islamic Holy War has taken responsibility.
In a highly personal letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, Mr. Clinton has expressed "disgust and anger" at that attack and said he was "personally sickened" by its celebration by Muslim militants.
Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, called the step "an important moment in the war against terrorism." Israel and leaders of major American Jewish organizations have long complained that contributors within American Muslim and Islamic communities may play a substantial role in raising money that ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.
The initiative was also greeted with approval by Republican leaders in Congress, although Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, also described it as "long overdue."
A statement issued by three major American Islamic organizations warned that the initiative could "have a negative impact on legitimate political expression by American Muslims and others."
But advocates of the plan said it represented no more than a first step, even though Administration officials said they would need to see further evidence that charitable contributions were being used to support terrorist operations before the Government would seek to block operations by Muslim and Islamic groups active in raising money in the United States.
Administration officials say that much of that money is used for legitimate purposes in building mosques, providing food and milk and otherwise helping Palestinian communities like the ones in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
But State Department officials have said that millions of dollars a year from the United States ends up in the hands of militants in the Hamas organization, whose total spending is estimated by Israeli officials at $30 million a year, and they said a test of the initiative would be whether it could cut back that flow.
For now, the names of groups and individuals whose assets are to be frozen or blocked under Mr. Clinton's order reads like a who's who list of organizations and people identified as terrorists.
In addition to Hamas and Islamic Holy War, they include the Palestine Liberation Front and its leader, Mohammed Abul Abbas -- also known as Abu Abbas -- as well as the two rival factions of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The list also includes two militant Jewish organizations, Kach and Kahane Chai, which were spawned by Rabbi Meir Kahane and were outlawed by Israel early last year.
The authority that Mr. Clinton invoked today in blocking the assets is provided to the President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which was used by President Carter to freeze Iranian assets when Americans were being held hostage in Teheran.
But the White House made clear that Mr. Clinton intended to ask Congress soon for even more sweeping authority to curb terrorism, including wider powers to use wiretapping and swift deportation procedures against suspects.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
The President's Address: 'We Heard America Shouting'

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's State of the Union Message last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans, again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy. And once again, our democracy has spoken. 
So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress, and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.
If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.
And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.
I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us. For we are the keepers of the sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era.
Over 200 years ago, our founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single, powerful idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea -- the American idea -- and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times. To Lincoln and to his Congress, to preserve the Union and to end slavery. To Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, to restrain the abuses and excesses of the Industrial Revolution and to assert our leadership in the world. To Franklin Roosevelt, to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism.
And to all our Presidents since, to fight the cold war. Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party. To Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war. And to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight, and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against Communism was won.
 
Goals of 1992
In another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change in opportunity and in security for the American people.
I came to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission: To restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world.
I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored. In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes. And I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor.
But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago.
Record numbers, record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy. We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world. We have almost six million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years.
Our businesses are more productive and here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities. But the rising tide is not lifting all the boats.
 
Tasks Still Ahead
While our nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder for less and less. While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month. And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us: our children, our families, our values.
Our civil life is suffering in America today. Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more. The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed.
What are we to do about it?
More than 60 years ago at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our nation new conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government. And from that simple proposition he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our nation to prosperity and defined the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century.
That approach worked in its time but today we face a very different time and very different conditions. We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility.
Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead. The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.
So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time. As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans.
That's what I want to talk with you about tonight. I call it the New Covenant but it's grounded in a very, very old idea that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them. And to give something back to their communities and their country in return.
Opportunity and responsibility -- they go hand in hand; we can't have one without the other, and our national community can't hold together without both.
Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of the new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose. We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government and ourselves.
 
Putting Country First
My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion. Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride. As we embark on this course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label we are all Americans. And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?
Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants. You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector -- and I was proud to sign it yesterday.
But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here. Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago. The American people look at their capital and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out.
As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual -- the gifts, the trips -- all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped.
Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices. I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time: There doesn't have to be a law for everything.
So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks, just stop.
We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing. But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too. We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want. We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's.
And as I have said for three years, we should work to open the air waves so that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by giving free TV time to candidates for public office.
When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the halls of this sacred building and cheered. This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about.
More important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works. Let's make it smaller, less costly and smarter. Leaner not meaner.
I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine's alive and well.
The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter. The old way of governing around here protected organized interests; we should look out for the interests of ordinary people. The old way divided us by interests, constituency or class; the New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country.
The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies. The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decision making from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy.
The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure. The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success.
The old way was centralized here in Washington. The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America, and we should help them to do that.
 
Role of Government
Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives and to enhance our security here at home and abroad.
We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.
I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is the source of every problem that we have.
Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs.
And we ought to do it together.
You know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was. But not much happened.
We actually did it. We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last two years alone.
Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $ 63 billion. The age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on David Letterman is gone. Deadwood programs like mohair subsidies are gone. We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices. We've slashed the small-business loan form from an inch thick to a single page. We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual.
And the Government is working better in important ways. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disaster.
You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who've dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires and they'll tell you that.
Government workers, working hand-in-hand with private business, rebuilt Southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget.
And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business.
 
College Loans
Now, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about. I want to just mention one because it'll be discussed here in the next few weeks.
University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities.
We shouldn't cap that program, we should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.
Previous Government programs gather dust; the reinventing Government report is getting results. And we're not through -- there's going to be a second round of reinventing Government.
We propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over a hundred programs we do not need like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program.
And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.
And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve. We need to help move programs down to the point where states and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job. If they can do it, we ought to let them do it. We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better.
Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for. It's time for Congress to stop passing onto the states the cost of decisions we make here in Washington.
 
Line-Item Veto
I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justified relief where we need to give it.
For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects. Last year was no different. There was a million dollars to study stress in plants and $ 12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work. It's hard to remove ticks; those of us who've had them know.
But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me the line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending.
But, I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities.
Our young people -- we should think of this when we cut -- our young people hold our future in their hands. We still owe a debt to our veterans. And our senior citizens have made us what we are.
Now, my budget cuts a lot. But it protects education, veterans, Social Security and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing. You should, and I hope you will.
And when we give more flexibility to the states, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every state, north and south, east and west.
Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants -- all these things are in the national interest.
I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations, but when we deregulate let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways and safer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water. Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations? You bet we do. But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water. We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps and we ought to do it.
 
Balancing the Budget
Should we cut the deficit more? Well of course we should. Of course we should. But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished, but instead should be helped.
I know many of you in this chamber support the balanced-budget amendment. I certainly want to balance the budget. Our Administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time.
If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people. They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, how it's going to affect them.
And we should be doing things in the open around here. For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security. I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would.
Nothing is done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system. This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant. It rewards welfare over work, it undermines family values, it lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support, it keeps a minority -- but a significant minority -- of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.
I worked on this problem for a long time -- nearly 15 years now. As a Governor I had the honor of working with the Reagan Administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988.
In the last two years we made a good start in continuing the work of welfare reform. Our Administration gave two dozen states the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.
 
Revamping Welfare System
Last year, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an Administration. We have to make welfare what it was meant to be -- a second chance, not a way of life.
We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to two years. But after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule. Anyone who can work must go to work.
If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay.
We should suspend driver's licenses, track them across state lines, make them work off what they owe. That is what we should do. Governments do not raise children, people do. And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.
I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform. But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.
We should -- we should require work and mutual responsibility. But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young or even because they're unmarried. We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school. But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street.
And I know all the arguments pro and con and I have read and thought about this for a long time: I still don't think we can, in good conscience, punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.
My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this, without regard to party or race or region. So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it.
But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America.
No one is more eager to end welfare.
I may be the only President who's actually had the opportunity to sit in the welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare, and I am telling you the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work. They also want to get off.
So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting. I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent. I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes. All of us have made our mistakes and none of us can change our yesterdays, but every one of us can change our tomorrows.
And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the state of California.
 
Cutting Back Crime
I know the members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country. But I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill -- longer sentences, three strikes and you're out, almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police -- and we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.
There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first.
Well if there are, let's talk about them and let's do them. But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work -- that we know work because the local law-enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing. Because local community leaders, who've worked for years and years to lower the crime rate, tell us that they work.
Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it and if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate, and I am convinced that it does, let us not go back on it, let's stick with it, implement it -- we've got four more hard years of work to do to do that.
 
Crime and Assault Weapons
I don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year. The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on 19 assault weapons.
I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it. And I know, therefore, that some of you that are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it. I just have to tell you how I feel about it.
The members who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities. I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore.
But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault-weapon attacks, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed.
I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with. I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility and are organized from the grass roots up, not by Federal bureaucracy.
The very best example of this is the National Service Corps -- Americorps. It passed with strong bipartisan support and now there are 20,000 Americans -- more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps -- working all over this country, helping person to person in local grass-roots volunteer groups, solving problems and in the process earning some money for their education.
This is citizenship at its best. It's good for the Americorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too. It's the essence of the New Covenant and we shouldn't stop it.
 
Illegal Aliens
All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.
The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our Administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more, by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy. America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We've become a great middle-class country; middle-class values sustain us. We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy.
America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost six million new jobs in the last two years, exports booming, inflation down, high-wage jobs are coming back. A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream.
If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our nation must have more of its benefits.
Today, too many of those people are being left out. They're working harder for less. They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves.
We cannot let this continue. If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale. And the people in the vast middle got very little growth and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then, fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked.
 
Government as a Partner
We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills.
That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last two years from Head Start to public schools to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable.
That's the first thing we have to do: We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.
Second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes.
We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $ 27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $ 1,000 a family.
And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses. Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited and we had to get economic growth up. Now we've done both, and now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.
But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives. The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families and their communities.
I have proposed a middle-class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities, because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves. It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes, in both the short run and the long run, in a way that benefits all of us.
There are four provisions:
First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school. If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic wellbeing of our whole country than even those things are. We should do everything we can to encourage it, and I hope you will support it.
Second, we ought to cut taxes $ 500 for families with children under 13.
Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time home buying or the care of a parent.
And fourth, we should pass a G.I. bill for America's workers. We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the states but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they -- if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage -- can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to two years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives. Let's empower people in this way. Move it from the Government directly to the workers of America.
 
Cutting the Deficit
Now, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk. We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly. Just two years ago it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit.
Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit. We began to do what others said would not be done: We cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion, about $ 10,000 for every family in this country. It's coming down three years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again.
In the budget I will send you, the middle-class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies. And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts. My budget pays for the middle-class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare, and I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts. That's not the right thing to do.
I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief. And some of them, I find quite interesting. I really want to work with all of you.
My tests for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes? Will it strengthen our families and support our children? Is it paid for? Will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?
If it does, I'll support it. But if it doesn't, I won't.
The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage.
It rewards work -- two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for four-and-a-quarter an hour. In terms of real buying power, by next year, that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.
Now I studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum-wage increase. I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market. But the most important thing is you can't make a living on $ 4.25 an hour. Now -- especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year.
In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue and I think it should be again. So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage.
Members of Congress have been here less than a month but by the end of the week -- 28 days into the new year -- every member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum-wage worker makes all year long.
 
Health Care
Everybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without and that's health care.
Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything. And the cold, hard fact is that since last year -- since I was here -- another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care. And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more -- most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people -- have seen their premiums skyrocket, their co-pays and deductibles go up.
There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.
Now I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family, but -- but I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew.
So I'm asking you that we work together. Let's do it step by step. Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done. Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices but that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick.
I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this: with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year. We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools. We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent to a disabled child. We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work, and we can find a way -- it may take some time, but we can find a way -- to make sure that our children have health care.
You know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade, but we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago -- the last time we were the most productive economy in the world.
So let's work together on this. It is too important for politics as usual.
 
Security and Leadership
Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about. A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders, they relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health and protecting those borders.
Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home. But it's not so. Our security still depends on our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy. We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.
The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point. I know it's not popular to say it tonight but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being. If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track.
Now let me repeat: it's not a loan, it's not foreign aid, it's not a bail-out. We'll be given a guarantee like co-signing a note with good collateral that will cover our risk.
This legislation is the right thing for America. That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it. And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly. It is in our interest and we can explain it to the American people, because we're going to do it in the right way.
 
After the Cold War
You know, tonight this is the first State of the Union address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America.
And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads. We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted. But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet.
This year, I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads. The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons.
To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation. It's smart, it's tough, it's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.
This year, I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad. As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice.
Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more. On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward. But the terrorists represent the past, not the future. We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.
Accordingly, last night I signed an executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process. It prohibits financial transactions with these groups.
And tonight I call on all our allies in peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism, we cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.
 
Well-Equipped Military
From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our nation would maintain the best-equipped, best-trained and best-prepared military on earth. We have and they are. They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit. But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the next six years.
I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President. Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction. We ask a very great deal of our armed forces. Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them. They go out more often to more different places and stay longer. They are called to service in many, many ways, and we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.
Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti.
We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East. All these endeavors are good in those places but they make our future more confident and more secure.
Well, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity not bureaucracy, enhancing security at home and abroad, empowering our people to make the most of their own lives.
It's ambitious and achievable. But it's not enough.
We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter and wiser, more than all the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in.
 
Values and Voices
Our fortunes and our prosperity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within -- from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads, voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens.
We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart. And we feel the common ground shifting from under us. The P.T.A., the town hall meeting, the ball park -- it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation.
Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity. We all know that while we here in this chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens where they work and where they live.
And it'll be made almost without regard to party. When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league and people would come up to me -- fathers and mothers -- and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats.
 
Not a Person to Waste
When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, Northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do. She hugged me and said, "Mr. President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here."
Now, why? We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day. Because as we move into this next century, everybody matters. We don't have a person to waste. And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better.
That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody -- for our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way. But they have an obligation: when they're doing well, to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.
For people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of expression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time.
We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem: the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage. I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with anti-pregnancy programs that work. But government can only do so much. Tonight, I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference. We can do this and we must.
And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders. You know, I'm proud of the fact that the United States has more house of worship per capita than any country in the world. These people, who lead our houses of worship, can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear, because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out. And our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference. They have a role in the New Covenant as well.
There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens. You know it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school. It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin. It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids. It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.
I know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress, to do these things. A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship. Most of us in politics haven't helped very much. For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads -- either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations. And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that is hardly conducive to honest and open conversations. But the truth is we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views.
If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground. And in this day everybody has a responsibility to do more of that. We simply cannot wait for a tornado, a fire or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another.
 
Making a Difference
I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about. Citizens. I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election, but they represent what we ought to be doing.
Cindy Perry teaches second-graders to read in Americorps in rural Kentucky. She gains when she gives. She's a mother of four.
She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year. She was married when she was a teen-ager. Stand up, Cindy. She married when she was a teen-ager. She had four children, but she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency and she's going to use her Americorps money to go back to college.
Steven Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City. He's been a national leader -- stand up Steve. He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing and he's worked with Americorps to do it, and the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.
Cpl. Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land. And I might add we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people, and he was one of them and we're proud of him.
The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit. The Rev. John and the Rev. Diana Cherry of the A.M.E. Zion Church in Temple Hills, Md. I'd like to ask them to stand. I want to tell you about them. In the early 80's they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house in the early 80's. Today that church has 17,000 members. It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States. It grows by 200 a month.
They do it together. And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together. They are -- Two things they did make a big impression on me. I visited their church once and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, D.C., line, in a higher-crime, higher-drug-rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them. Second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders and he left early to go back to his church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together to save their marriages and to raise their kids. This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America. We need more of it and it ought to be lifted up and supported.
The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Jack, would you stand up. Fifty years ago in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship. On February the 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet. Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them. In that moment he saved the lives of his companions and miraculously in the next instant a medic saved his life. He gained a foothold for freedom and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson, who's up there with him today, and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran, at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor. All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: Didn't matter where you were from or who you were. You relied on one another. You did it for your country. We all gain when we give and we reap what we sow. That's at the heart of this New Covenant. Responsibility, opportunity and citizenship.
More than stale chapters in some remote civic book they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God-given potential and be like them. And also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most-sacred covenant. I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
This is a very, very great country and our best days are still to come.
Thank you and God bless you all.

HEADLINE: Prisons Chief Quits, Citing Family Issues

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Correction Commissioner Anthony J. Schembri, under investigation following allegations that he did personal business on city time, resigned yesterday, saying family pressures prevented him from meeting the city's residency requirement.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised Mr. Schembri in a letter he read aloud at the end of a City Hall news conference on other issues, saying the Commissioner had worked "effectively and diligently to reform the department." But in response to questions, the Mayor also said that he believed Mr. Schembri, who had been in office 10 months, had "made the right decision." 
 The Commissioner's resignation from his $ 110,000-a-year post came as the Department of Investigation was completing an inquiry Mr. Giuliani ordered last November into reports that Mr. Schembri made a paid speech in Atlantic City on city time and billed the city for his drivers' overtime and tolls when they ran errands to Rye, N.Y., where he had been the Police Commissioner.
The inquiry also included the question of whether Mr. Schembri had taken up full residence in the city, as required by law.
Commissioner of Probation Michael P. Jacobson, a holdover from the Dinkins administration, will serve as Acting Correction Commissioner while a search for a new prisons chief is conducted, Mr. Giuliani said. The Mayor also promoted Bernard Kerik, a former police detective who has been executive assistant to Mr. Schembri, to First Deputy Commissioner. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Schembri would continue to receive his salary as a special adviser for an unspecified time.
The changes come as the city's prison system has been under strain, with the Mayor's criminal justice crackdown increasing the prison population even as his budget cuts have reduced the number of correction officers.
The prison population yesterday stood at 19,359, which is 1,752 inmates more than a year ago. In the same period, the number of correction officers has dropped to 10,673, from 11,077.
After Mr. Giuliani proposed new budget cuts and a reduction of 1,300 more correction officers and social workers in October, thousands of inmates staged several days of protests, refusing to eat or work. The administration subsequently reinstated 900 positions, but moved ahead with reductions in education and drug-abuse programs.
Mr. Schembri assumed the leadership of the city's prison system last March after 13 years of leading the small Police Department of Rye in Westchester County.
But at a time when Mr. Giuliani's policies were putting the prisons under new pressures, he became a lightning rod for the correction officers' union and lawmakers opposed to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to reduce the number of New York City's correction officers. The union yesterday praised his departure.
Mr. Schembri justified buying an $ 18,000 Mercury Grand Marquis by saying such a "nondescript vehicle" was necessary because of his concerns about personal security. His bodyguards followed him to Westchester on private business.
Mr. Giuliani ordered the Department of Investigation to look into Mr. Schembri after New York Newsday filed a Freedom of Information Request for agency expense and time records and reported a week's delay while Mr. Schembri's aides pored over them. The documents were released after the agency's special counsel ordered the Commissioner to reimburse the city for his workday in Atlantic City and $ 363 in tolls he had put on his expense accounts.
Some officials said such actions were starting to undercut Mr. Schembri's effectiveness. "He had a difficult job at best," said City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, the Queens Democrat who chairs the Public Safety Committee. "It really required a commissioner with credibility. Once his credibility began to erode, being able to cope with these difficult circumstances became even more difficult."
Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had received a briefing on the Department of Investigation's findings and expected to receive the full report by early next week.
Asked whether he had requested Mr. Schembri's resignation, the Mayor said, "The Commissioner made the determination that the residency requirements, which he was very hopeful that he would be able to deal with, were really putting him in a position where he was constantly being questioned."
Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Schembri had been "unable to sell his home at anything like a reasonable price."
Mr. Schembri did not attend the news conference, and his spokesman, Tom Kelly, declined to elaborate on the Mayor's statement. Mr. Schembri has said that he has been living in a Park Avenue apartment while his family remains in Westchester. In his letter of resignation, he said, "Unfortunately my family requires more of my time than originally anticipated and thus I cannot in good faith fulfill the residency requirements."
Mr. Giuliani made clear that he had no problems with the Commissioner's performance, praising him for making "major management reforms by reducing overtime and excessive bureaucracy."
In another staff change, Mr. Giuliani announced the appointment of Joseph J. Lhota as the city's Finance Commissioner. Mr. Lhota, 42, has been serving as chief of staff to John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. He was previously the director of public finance at CS First Boston Corporation, and his wife, Tamra, was a campaign fund-raiser for Mr. Giuliani.
The $ 110,000-a-year post became vacant earlier this month when Marc V. Shaw became budget director, replacing Abraham M. Lackman, who resigned to join the staff of the State Senate.

HEADLINE: Combatting Pataki, Democrats Offer Own Tax Cuts in a Bid for Middle-Class Support

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Seeking to recapture suburban and upstate voters for the Democratic Party, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has proposed reducing state income, sales and property taxes by $2.3 billion a year by 1997.
The proposal today represents the Democratic alternative to Gov. George E. Pataki's four-year plan to reduce state income taxes by $5.6 billion a year. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has said his plan would offer the greatest benefits to middle- and working-class people. 
 Under Mr. Silver's plan, a family of four earning $40,000 a year would pay $402 less in income tax than during last year. Under Mr. Pataki's plan, the same family would pay $847 less. Mr. Silver said his plan would also reduce sales and property taxes for that same family, but the amount would depend on the local tax rate and how much clothing the family bought each year.
Under both plans, the greatest tax benefits, in terms of percentage reduction in taxes paid, would go to families earning less than $60,000 a year. But Mr. Pataki's plan would provide a much deeper tax cut for wealthier taxpayers, those earning over $100,000, than Mr. Silver's plan.
Mr. Silver said his plan, while containing a smaller income tax cut than Mr. Pataki's, would provide deeper tax relief for the middle class through a combination of tax reductions. He would not only reduce income tax rates for most taxpayers, but also eliminate the state sales tax on clothing and place a cap on local property tax increases that would be tied to the annual inflation rate.
Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said his plan would be more appealing to the middle class because such taxpayers are more concerned about their local property taxes than about state income taxes. He called the sales tax on clothing "a regressive tax that affects the working people of the state most."
Mr. Silver said he thought that the state could not afford Mr. Pataki's plan, which some Democrats have said could cost as much as $6.5 billion a year when phased in. But he did not indicate how he would pay for his proposal, saying the Assembly Democrats would propose their own version of the state budget only after Mr. Pataki releases his budget plan on Feb. 1.
The state is facing a $300 million deficit in the current fiscal year that ends on March 31 and a projected shortfall of $4 billion in the next fiscal year. Next year's budget shortfall would grow by $1 billion if either Mr. Pataki or Mr. Silver's tax cut plans were approved. The current state budget is $34 billion.
The Democrats currently hold a 94-to-56 advantage in the Assembly, but the Republicans, who already control the State Senate, have made clear that their central political goal is to retake the Assembly in 1996. And Mr. Silver's proposal seems particularly aimed at shoring up Democratic lawmakers in suburban and upstate communities where voters overwhelmingly supported Mr. Pataki last year.
For instance, his proposal for a cap on property taxes would probably have the greatest impact in New York City's suburbs, where property taxes have recently risen in some communities by as much as 20 percent in a year. Also, the state's 4 percent sales tax on clothing has been blamed by merchants on Staten Island and in other communities along the New Jersey, Vermont and Pennsylvania borders for declining sales. All three of those states exempt most clothing from their sales taxes.
Mr. Silver said that eliminating the state portion of sales taxes on clothing would generate enough economic activity and new jobs to pay for itself, $600 million a year by 1997. "Right now, people are buying from catalogues or going across the border to New Jersey to buy the same item of clothing they could get in New York," he said.
Even before Mr. Silver's plan, New Yorkers were virtually assured of getting some tax relief, because the final phase of an income tax cut initially passed in 1987 is scheduled to take effect this year. That tax cut has been delayed since 1990 because of the state's fiscal problems, but Mr. Pataki has vowed to veto any efforts to defer it again.
Both Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki have said they want to modify the 1987 tax cut because it would actually raise taxes for about a third of all taxpayers, most of them people earning under $40,000 a year.
Under Mr. Pataki's plan, income tax rates would be reduced across the board, the number of tax brackets would decline from five to two and the number of people paying the top rate would decline. That top rate would fall from 7.78 percent to 5.9 percent and would apply to families earning more than $50,000 a year. The bottom rate would remain at last year's level of 4 percent and would apply to all families earning less than $50,000.
Mr. Silver's plan would alter the brackets so that fewer people paid the top rate, but his top rate would be higher than Mr. Pataki's. He would keep five brackets: a 4 percent rate for families earning under $30,000 a year; 5 percent for up to $37,500 a year; 6 percent for up to $45,000 a year; 7 percent for up to $65,000; and a top rate of 7.75 percent for families earning over $65,000 a year.
Both Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki would have the standard deduction rise from $9,500 to $13,000 for families. Mr. Silver would continue the so-called household credit for families earning under $32,000 a year; Mr. Pataki would replace that credit with a $200-per-dependent credit that could be claimed by any taxpayer.
Robert J. Bellafiore, a spokesman for the Governor, said that because the top tax rate is scheduled to drop to 7.5 percent under the 1987 plan, Mr. Silver's proposal would actually raise taxes slightly for wealthier taxpayers. "Democrats never learn," he said. "The people of New York State voted for small government, real cuts in spending and real cuts in taxes."
The state portion of the sales tax is 4 percent; municipalities and counties are allowed to increase the tax locally. In most places, the total sales tax is now 8 percent; in Nassau and Suffolk counties, it is 8.5 percent, the highest in the state.
Mr. Silver's plan would therefore reduce sales taxes on clothing everywhere in the state to 4.5 percent or lower, bringing levels much closer to -- though still not quite as low as -- taxes in most surrounding states.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE REACTION;
Republican Leaders Express Wariness of President's Conservative Embrace

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Republicans presented President Clinton tonight as a reluctant convert to the cause of a smaller, cheaper government more attuned to the needs of the middle class. Casting themselves as the authentic agents of change, the Republicans also suggested that Mr. Clinton's actions would not match his conservative words.
"While at times tonight some of the President's ideas sounded pretty Republican, the fact remains that he has been opposed to the balanced budget amendment, he proposed even more Government spending and he imposed the biggest tax increase in American history," said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, on behalf of her party. She referred to the 1993 budget package that raised income tax rates for the upper middle class and the rich, eliminated various deductions and increased the amount of Social Security benefits subject to tax. 
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, countered that the President's speech was "right on the mark" and a clear indication of his commitment to the middle class. "He made it clear that Democrats are going to fight for America's hard-working, middle-class families, and that while we cut the size of our government, we're not going to make our children, our veterans, or our elderly pay the price."
Mr. Gephardt also hailed Mr. Clinton's pledge of support for an increase in the minimum wage, a key issue with core Democratic constituencies. "No member of Congress has a right to stand in the way of this simple matter of economic fairness," Mr. Gephardt said.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, also praised the speech and said Mr. Clinton was "connecting with many of the themes that Democrats and Republicans indicated are priorities."
But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said in a cool response that while the State of the Union Message was "always important," the "more important and most powerful message remains the one that the American people delivered in November." He added, "We welcome any support the President offers as Republicans carry out our mandate to rein in government with less spending, less taxes and more freedom."
In fact, Republicans argued that Mr. Clinton was trying to wrap himself in Republican garb. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, suggested that Mr. Clinton "sounds like he's ready to sign the House Republicans' 'Contract with America,' " the campaign manifesto dealing with issues from tax cuts to welfare restructuring.
Still, even before Mr. Clinton's speech was over, the clear Republican message was that talk was cheap. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas and a Presidential hopeful, said the President "always gives a good speech" but added, "It's the President's deeds we're concerned with."
And Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, asserted, "All too often, President Clinton has signaled right then turned left, which only results in disaster."
For much of the day, Congressional Republicans were muted, presenting themselves as respectful of the Presidency, but consumed with their own agenda and convinced that they -- not the Adminstration -- were driving policy in Washington these days. Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, struck a conciliatory note at a news conference before the speech. "I am not going to go tonight and sit there and say, now, which pieces can I punch?" he said.
Other Republican leaders suggested that they believed they could afford to be magnanimous. "He's on a high wire; we're on a pair of skates," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference. "We don't have to worry about all these political decisions the White House has to make to keep him on the high wire."
Mr. Boehner added that he believed the dominant political event of the week would be not the State of the Union Message but the consideration and passage of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, which will reach the floor of the House on Wednesday.
Mr. Boehner also said that on Monday there was a discussion at a Republican leadership meeting about the need to exercise some restraint today.
"We shouldn't make it any more difficult for them than it already is," Mr. Boehner said of the President and the Democrats. This strategy had its uses for the Republicans. Among other things, it gave them a break in the intense partisan struggle over Mr. Gingrich and his book deal that has dominated much of the news in recent days.
With Mrs. Whitman delivering the formal Republican response, Mr. Gingrich was said to be happy to play a nonspeaking role tonight, part of the stately tableau of the State of the Union, sitting behind the President.
There were some sharper Republican responses today. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, declared, "The American people will not be fooled by a man who changes his opinions and agenda as frequently as the tides."
But Mrs. Whitman's address was largely an exercise in Republican image making, presenting the party as tested and proven on the state level and ready to take its tax-cutting, government-trimming program to Washington.

HEADLINE: Palestinian 'Martyrs': Defiant and So Willing

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GAZA, Jan. 24

 BODY:
If Abdel Rahim Sukar felt any grief today, he wasn't showing it.
His older brother, Anwar Sukar, was a suicide bomber from the Islamic Holy War group who blew himself up on Sunday in a crowd of Israeli soldiers, killing 19 Israelis and wounding more than 60. 
 "I cried a little at first, but later I stopped," Mr. Sukar said, as men and schoolchildren streamed to his family's house to pay their respects. "When I saw the flesh and blood of the Jews, I was happy.
"It was the best martyrdom possible," he said of his brother's death. "I'm proud of him, and I wish I could have been in his place. This made us walk tall."
Under a makeshift awning, somber but dry-eyed men sat in rows as loudspeakers broadcast eulogies in prose and verse. The suicide bomber was praised as a "heroic martyr of Islam" who had gone to paradise while "inflicting misery on the sons of Zion." Pictures of him and of other dead militants covered the walls, and an Islamic Holy War poster boasted, "We will shake Israel to its foundations."
The gathering illustrated how, while the Palestinians are supposed to be ending decades of conflict with Israel, many are not only still gripped by the struggle but enthralled by a cult of death.
The phenomenon seems to be striking deeper roots as Palestinian suicide bombers carry out a rising number of attacks, killing 57 Israelis in the last year. Just as the bombings have shaken Israel, they have also sent currents of admiration through young men here who declare that they, too, are eager to go to paradise killing Jews.
A generation that in other circumstances might have seen athletes or actors as role models seems to idolize the gunmen and suicide bombers of Islamic Holy War and its militant twin, Hamas. Their pictures hang in homes and are carried in wallets and on key chains. Walls are covered with graffiti saluting them and with bold drawings of their attacks. At some demonstrations, young men wear shroud-like sheets, showing their readiness to die.
The cult was on full display recently at a rally in the town of Khan Yunis honoring another local hero, Ayman Radi, who blew himself up last month in Jerusalem, injuring 13 people.
The crowd was entertained by a group of singers in black leather jackets and ties. Known as "The Martyrs," they looked something like teenage idols from the 1950's, but their songs were about a different kind of love.
"Ayman, pure lover of Jerusalem," the lead singer crooned. "You are safe in paradise next to God. The tears of your mother are roses and jasmine. We are Palestinian Muslims fighting the Jewish army."
Like an American boy with a pack of baseball cards, a youngster walked through the crowd showing off an envelope full of pictures of dead members of the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. Giant posters of Mr. Radi and fallen gunmen, one of them showing a uniformed fighter stepping on a pile of skulls, covered the stage.
Such worship of heroic death first spread here in the late 1980's, when the Palestinian uprising began and many young men witnessed daily bloodshed during street clashes with Israeli soldiers. In recent months, support for anti-Israeli attacks was fueled by growing frustration at the lack of change in living conditions under Palestinian self-rule, and by anger at Israel's continued presence in the Gaza Strip and its control of the area's borders.
To many Palestinians, the suicide killers are models of defiance, rebelling against a life of degradation. Their actions serve as an antidote to the constant nursing of grievances that is a habit here after decades of occupation.
"I'm not living like a human being," said a high-school student at the Khan Yunis rally who gave his name as Mohammed. "This is not a dignified life. Either an honorable life or martyrdom."
A man called Abu Rateb, who is married with children, said: "We're dead now. We live when the pieces of our bodies are collected in Tel Aviv."
Such an end is seen here as a beginning, a passage from a transient and grim existence to the pleasures of eternal life -- a world where, according to Islamic belief, martyrs enjoy 72 virgin brides and are next to God with other righteous men.
Hisham Hamad, a suicide bomber from Islamic Holy War who killed three Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip in November, wrote in his will: "The life of this world is just a game and an accumulation of possessions and children. What God has is better for me than all this. I am sad to leave you, but let me meet God. I love paradise more than this world."
Militant leaders reject assertions that people like Mr. Hamad are desperate and have given up on life, preferring to depict them instead as optimists who chose to sacrifice themselves to bring their people a better future.
"We don't call this suicide, which is forbidden in Islam," said Imad Falouji, publisher of a Hamas newspaper. "These are martyrdom operations. We are commanded to wage holy war for the sake of God. Here the attacker is assured success, he avoids arrest, inflicts heavier casualties on the enemy and gains matryrdom."
But to Dr. Mustafa al-Masri, a psychiatrist at Gaza's only community mental health program, such glorification of death is a sign of depression and despair.
"Our own society is somehow committing suicide," he said. "Look at our streets -- we are neglectful of everything. There is a depression in this country. At social gatherings you hear people talking about basic needs, political and economic problems, but there is no mention whatsoever of the future. In the hopelessness and helplessness of this world, there is the bright promise of the next life."
Dr. Iyad Sarraj, the program director, said that in such a state of impotence, a suicide attack can be a powerful attraction to some people. "It is an act of ultimate control," he said. "You control death, you control life, you control your environment and you decide when to die."
The path to a suicide bombing usually passes through membership in a small, highly disciplined and closed band of militants, where the individual loses himself in the group through total identification with its cause, the doctors said.
The bombers have typically been devout single men from poor backgrounds, in their early 20's, who have experienced a personal loss or traumatic humiliation at the hands of the Israelis, doctors add. Though such experiences are common here, they seem to have pushed some youths to extremes.
"There's a process of brainwashing," Dr. Sarraj said. "You live in a semi-hypnotic state. You become so overwhelmed with one idea that you completely isolate yourself from the rest of the world. You have to conform to the group, and within it you find a new identity."
Signs of this are evident in a notebook left behind by Mr. Radi, a 21-year-old policeman who had prayed regularly, fasted often and immersed himself in the Koran, according to his family.
"Life is beautiful," he wrote a month before he died, "but the more beautiful life is to be a martyr. Paradise is a delicious drink. Our enemies love life, but we adore death, so I am sacrificing my soul and everything I own to God."

HEADLINE: The Suburban Cowboys Of the Mild, Mild West

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo., Jan. 23

 BODY:
Booms in the West invariably seem to spawn mythic symbols.
During the cattle drives of the late 1800's, it was the wild shoot-'em-up cowboy, despite the reality of the typical wrangler, who mostly fought boredom on the lonely trails. During the oil bonanza of the 1970's, it was the flamboyant wheeler-dealer in a 10-gallon hat, probably up from Texas, a caricature that grew all the more vivid after the energy bust.
For the last four years, the symbol of boom times in the Rockies, the fastest-growing region in the country in the 1990's, has been the wealthy Californian. Thousands upon thousands of people called equity exiles are said to have sold their houses in Los Angeles for $300,000 to $400,000 or more, and fled that seemingly cursed urban sprawl for the pristine, wild-grass stretches of the mountains, where they can trot horseback across their new ranch ettes, untethered to congested America, except by fax and modem. 
 Like much of Western lore, however, this image is more grandiose than the truth. Californians have been heading to the Rocky Mountain States in droves. But for every Californian-turned-cowboy who has moved to the thistly range or the mountainside, thousands more have settled near cul-de-sacs in suburbs -- trading a monstrous sprawl for a manageable one.
In Colorado, for example, where the population grew at more than twice the national average last year, 80 percent of the newcomers settled in the suburbs.
The biggest gainer has been Highlands Ranch, a 14-year-old unincorporated development 15 miles south of downtown Denver that promotes good schools, safe streets and strict codes on house and lawn upkeep -- life in the Mild, Mild West. With 30,000 residents, up from about 15,000 in 1990, it is the fastest-growing planned community in the nation. The population is projected to reach 100,000 within 20 years.
While some Californians surely are coming to the Rockies with a bundle in home equity, and can retire early to Telluride, Colo., or Jackson, Wyo., a far greater number -- the workaday technicians and corporate middle managers -- are scrambling to meet mortgages and save for their children's college tuition.
"People look at me and say, 'Oh, you must be rich,' " said Gregg Myers, a 32-year-old shop foreman who bought a $100,000 house here in 1992 after moving from Santa Ana, Calif., with his wife, Diane, 32, now a part-time worker at a recreation center, and their three children, ages 10, 6 and 4.
"But I don't even consider myself to be middle-income, more like lower-middle," said Mr. Myers, a journeyman carpenter with three years of college. "And I just hired two new guys at work from California who are worse off than me."
The newcomers here tend to be technologically sophisticated, an attractive labor force that has motivated companies including Specialty Health Care Services and Chef America, a maker of snack foods, to move to the area from Southern California.
"In the old economy, the talent went where the companies were," said Phillip Burgess, the president of the Center for the New West, a policy and research organization in Denver. "But in the new economy, the companies go where the talent is."
The boom is gobbling up Colorado pasture land for home sites here in Douglas County, the second-fastest growing county in the country after Flagler County in northeast Florida. Residents here voted in November to use tax money to buy and preserve some of what is left of the pastoral charm that attracted so many newcomers in the first place.
"There used to be cows a block from my house," said Micki Clark, the leader of the Open Lands Coalition in Douglas County, "and now I look out the window and see a sea of rooftops."
But many people here look out their windows and see a portrait of the American Dream: rows of handsome two-story houses, meticulously maintained lawns and safe sidewalks filled with children at play.
"Maybe it's a case of growing up watching too much television -- you know, Andy of Mayberry," Mr. Myers said. "But I think people are yearning to belong in a community."
Planned communities, which are developed from a blueprint -- a place for stores here; a place for churches there -- are more common in the West than in the East or Midwest, perhaps because people here tend to be from somewhere else, but still want a hometown ambiance, even if it is a bit contrived.
The commuting time from Highlands Ranch to jobs downtown or at the Denver Tech Center, ranging from 20 minutes to nearly an hour, is often a snap compared with the highway crawl of Southern California. And the neighborhoods here do not have the deserted feel of a bedroom community during the day, because many women stay home with young children.
"Yuppies have a couple kids, and then they want a place that fits their idea of a small town in the Midwest," said Ms. Clark, who is also a mystery writer. "But I grew up in one of those Midwestern small towns, and believe me, it doesn't look like Highlands Ranch. For one thing, in a small town, half the people are poor."
Indeed, as Gregg and Diane Myers recalled, a cousin visiting from Nebraska shrieked in mock horror at the too-perfect picture of the suburban American Dream.
Mr. Myers chuckled as he described the cousin's expression of disbelief at the nearly identical look of the houses, the cars, even the people. "She said, 'This is not real -- I mean, everybody here has exactly 2.5 kids.' "
Rising to the defense of his community, Mr. Myers said that while there was a degree of conformity, there was also more openness to newcomers. When his daughter, Heather, started school as a new second grader in Bear Canyon Elementary School here, she was not excluded by the kind of cliques that often rule the social order in places where the same families have lived for generations.
"We're all newcomers here," he said, "so there's a kind of bond you feel with your neighbors."
The drawback, of course, is that people move out almost as routinely as they move in, because a big share of them are corporate employees who may be transferred every few years. And the experience of seeing friends move away, again and again, can become painful.
Trish Elledge, a 40-year-old civil mediator who has lived in Highlands Ranch since 1992 with her husband, Tom Swinehart, a lawyer, and their two young children, Zachary and Ashley, has formed strong friendships with a handful of women here, only to see them leave, one after another. In the last year, her five closest friends have moved away.
"As a person who has come here to make this a home, I just don't know if I can take this anymore," Ms. Elledge said. "I don't know if I'm going to invest a lot of time and feeling in friendships, because they're just going to go away."

HEADLINE: 'Theme Park' Atmosphere Is Part of Proposal for Yankee Stadium

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
New York City, in its latest proposal to the Yankees, has offered to create what one official called a "theme park" atmosphere at Yankee Stadium with stores and restaurants around the complex and with new roads leading to new parking garages at the ball park, officials familiar with the plan said yesterday.
The proposal was presented on Monday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, who had objected to an earlier plan because he said it failed to address traffic and parking problems that burden the stadium. 
 Although the finer points of the new design have not been drawn, estimates of the project's cost are as high as $600 million, making it the most extensive and expensive strategy for keeping the Yankees in the South Bronx that has yet to be presented. That figure, although far from a definite price, is more than twice the $250 million talked about less than a year ago as the cost of overhauling the stadium and the surrounding neighborhood.
According to officials who attended a meeting on Monday morning at Gracie Mansion, Mr. Steinbrenner indicated that the proposal was more to his liking. "He's taking it seriously and studying the details," Mr. Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said yesterday.
The plan was redrawn to meet the Yankees' desire to have a stadium along the lines of Camden Yards in Baltimore, a distinctive and self-contained entertainment park that is easy for fans to reach and has minimal intrusions from the outside world.
The object, said David Sussman, the Yankees' general counsel, "is to try to get it as close to the state-of-the-art facilities that are being built in other cities."
With Mr. Steinbrenner's veiled and not-so-veiled threats over the years to move his team from its legendary home in the South Bronx to the New Jersey Meadowlands when the team's lease expires in 2002, city and state officials have tried to answer each of his irritations with a new salve. Concerns over safety brought a troop of police officers to patrol around the stadium during games and at Mr. Steinbrenner's request, officials searched for alternative sites for a new stadium. In August, the officials hired the design firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum to draw plans for a renovated Yankee Stadium.
City and state officials say the latest version of the plan envisions constructing new exits and entrances off the northbound lanes of the Major Deegan Expressway leading directly into new parking garages that would be next to the stadium in what is now a park. A bridge from Harlem River Drive would also lead directly to the garages.
In front of the stadium, River Avenue would be widened and spruced up with new lighting and improved facades for existing stores. At the ground level around the stadium, shops and restaurants would be built, allowing the stadium to project an entertainment atmosphere to fans as soon as they were on the grounds. One city official speaking on condition of anonymity compared the desired effect to a "theme park."
Improvements to the stadium itself, already discussed publicly, include about 100 luxury boxes and a new outer wall for the stadium that would copy the original facade of Yankee Stadium. Inside the stadium, concessions and shops would be upgraded in a new concourse area.
The most striking differences between the December plan, which drew objections from Mr. Steinbrenner, and the proposal presented this week are the roads and parking garages that would allow fans to drive from the suburbs directly to the stadium without sitting in traffic on the streets of the South Bronx. Yankee officials have said fans had complained both about the difficulty of driving to the stadium and their fears of crime in the neighborhood.
Also, the new garages, which officials said were tentatively planned for part of Macombs Dam Park, would be next to the stadium, allowing fans to go from their cars directly to the ball park. The new garages would increase stadium parking to 10,000 spaces from about 6,500.
In the new design, said one city official who attended the meeting on Monday, the stadium is "really a self-contained area." But that could raise concerns among some residents and officials of the Bronx who had hoped that a renovated Yankee Stadium would be the centerpiece for neighborhood redevelopment.
Frank Mahoney, an economic aide to Gov. George E. Pataki, acknowledged "a lot of sensitivities" about creating a ball park cut off from the surrounding neighborhood. He said any park areas taken up by new garages would be made up for with new parks in the neighborhood.
A city official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the notion that the plan sought to insulate the stadium from the area and pledged that neighborhood groups would continue to be consulted. Instead, he said, the design is in line with the newest and most successful ball parks around the nation. "They want to be nice to the neighborhood," the official said of the team, "but they also want to give the fans what they want. They want to create an entertainment atmosphere."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON, WITH BOW TO G.O.P., REAFFIRMS HIS THEMES OF '92 AND ASKS NEW COOPERATION

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight sought to build a rationale for the second half of his term, at once defending his record and embracing many ideas backed by the new Republican Congressional majority, but amending them to suit the brand of centrist Democrats who elected him.
In a State of the Union Message that was by turns conciliatory and studded with pointed delineations of difference, Mr. Clinton pledged his cooperation in shrinking the Government, cutting taxes, overhauling welfare and cracking down on illegal immigration. But he repeatedly veered away from endorsing specific Republican proposals for dealing with those issues, instead presenting his own ideas as sensible, humane alternatives to more extreme courses of action. 
 Humbled by last fall's sweeping Republican electoral victories, Mr. Clinton offered only a few new programs in a speech that lasted 81 minutes, the longest a President has ever taken to deliver his State of the Union address. Rather, he turned to the themes of his 1992 campaign in resurrecting the notion of a "new covenant" of shared responsibility between government and citizens. [Transcript, page A18.]
Interrupted 96 times by mostly bipartisan applause, Mr. Clinton cast himself as the champion of working Americans by repeating his calls for tax breaks for the middle class and a revision of lobbying and campaign finance laws, priorities that faded in the first half of his term.
"I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor," said Mr. Clinton, who began his speech with congratulations to the newly elected majority and to the new Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich of Georgia. "But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was two years ago."
"We cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants," the President added. He argued that government should be smaller in size but not in spirit, called on the nation to participate in political discourse and vowed to oppose any efforts to roll back his victories on gun control.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who delivered the official Republican Party response from Trenton, took pointed note of the changed political landscape, saying with a chuckle that "some of the President's ideas sounded pretty Republican" and proclaiming that her party meant business.
"On Election Day, you gave us your trust," she said in her own talk to the nation. "We accept your mandate. President Clinton, you must accept it as well."
Just a year ago, Mr. Clinton stood at the same rostrum in the House chamber for an exuberant recital of his first-year record and a bold defense of his sweeping health care proposal. In 1993, he unveiled his economic plan with similar fanfare, to rousing cheers in a chamber where the majority Democrats had waited a dozen years to see one of their own in the White House.
Tonight, as the first Democratic President to face a joint session of a Republican Congress since Harry S. Truman almost half a century ago, Mr. Clinton cast his oratorical net wide but set his sights much lower.
He joked that he now knew how the Republicans must have felt on his own victory in 1992, and said with a nod to Walt Whitman that in both elections, "we did not hear America singing; we heard America shouting." Now, he said, "both of us, Republican and Democrats alike, must say, 'We hear you.' "
The President said that for the last two years he had tried to do his part.
"Our businesses are more productive, and here we have worked to bring the deficit down," he said. But he added, "The rising tide is not lifting all boats," and too many people are "working harder and harder for less and less."
He also called on Congress to clean its own house by passing comprehensive restrictions on lobbying, curbs that it stopped short of passing at the close of the last session and that the Republicans have blocked this year.
"There doesn't have to be a law for everything," Mr. Clinton said, asking members simply to stop taking gifts from lobbyists immediately.
"Just stop," he said.
"We don't have to wait for legislation to pass," the President declared, "to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing."
On topic after topic tonight, Mr. Clinton sought the political middle ground, extending an olive branch to Republicans but begging to differ as well. He said balancing the Federal budget was a worthy goal but challenged them to show how they could do so without raising taxes or endangering Social Security benefits.
He recalled his own longstanding commitment to overhauling welfare so that it became only a temporary transition to a life of work, but he warned against punishing children who need help most.
"I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform," he said. "But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting. Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor."
In others ways, Mr. Clinton split the differences.
He endorsed raising the minimum wage to bolster the earning power of the poorest workers, but without saying by how much. His advisers said he preferred an increase of at least 75 cents, to $5 an hour; Some Democrats favor increases twice that size, while some Republicans oppose any minimum at all.
The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said the President had opted for a general endorsement of an increase in the minimum wage as a step toward negotiated compromise, rather than a specific suggestion that might be dismissed out of hand. "This is obviously one that he could basically posture on and send something up that goes nowhere," Mr. Panetta said. "But his hope is that the Congress will recognize the need to do something with the minimum wage."
Among the steps the President endorsed on the immigration issue was adoption of a national computer system to keep track of citizens and aliens authorized to work in this country. That would allow employers to check the immigration status of job applicants. Such a system was recommended by a commission headed by former Representative Barbara Jordan, Democrat of Texas.
The proposal has drawn criticism from ethnic and immigrant groups, but the White House hopes it will stand as a contrast to more conservative proposals like California's Proposition 187, which, now stayed by the courts, would deny public services and benefits to undocumented aliens.
Mr. Clinton also called for a new public-private campaign against teen-age pregnancy, in which, Administration officials said, Hillary Rodham Clinton will probably play a role.
In the most starkly partisan moment of the evening, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that several members of the last Congress who voted for the ban on 19 types of assault weapons had lost their seats as a result and that "some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it."
Without using the word "veto," he said sternly: "A lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed. I will not let it be repealed."
That was too much for the Republicans who had applauded many of his other proposals; they remained seated and silent while most Democrats rose in applause.
As is his practice, the President had worried over and polished the speech until virtually the last minute, sending fourth and fifth drafts back to his principal domestic and foreign policy speech writers, Donald Baer and Robert O. Boorstin, in late afternoon. He spent most of Sunday and today in his study in the White House, fussing particularly with the opening and closing sections.
Aides said he had prepared for the address by reading old speeches, including the declaration of his candidacy for the White House in October 1991, when he promised to restore the American dream for "the forgotten middle class."
In fact, all the atmospherics of the President's address were intended to stress his support for ordinary working Americans and for partnership between government and citizenry.
Mrs. Clinton, who in past years was flanked in the House gallery by captains of finance, labor and big business whose support the Administration wanted for its economic and health care programs, sat tonight among members of Americorps, her husband's national service program, in which students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for community work. She also paid homage to a military that has often regarded her husband warily, sharing the row with Cpl. Gregory Depestre, a Brooklyn-born marine who was brought up in Haiti and served as a peacekeeper there last year, and with the family of Jack Lucas, a marine from Mississippi who served on Iwo Jima and was the youngest man in this century to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: NEWS ANALYSIS;
A Deflated Presidency

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
A year ago, the polls showed President Clinton in good political shape, buoyed by an improving economy. So he waved a pen at Congress and the nation. Give me a health care plan that covers everyone in America, he demanded; if you resort instead to half-measures, I will veto them.
In the end, of course, Congress gave Mr. Clinton no health care legislation at all, and the electorate gave him a swift punch in the nose, in the shape of sweeping Republican triumphs at the state, local and national levels. 
The State of the Union Message that the President delivered tonight was notably short on demands for action and long on appeals for comity, a demonstration of just how much he has been weakened in the last 12 months.
Then, he was on the offensive, promising change as broad as it was bold. He attacked those, like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, now the majority leader, who supported incremental change in health care. Now, he is on the defensive, proposing nothing remotely resembling the revolution that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton once espoused; instead, he called for gradualism a la Dole.
"Last year, we bit off more than we could chew," Mr. Clinton said in a moment of clear-eyed candor. "This year, let's work together, step by step, to get something done."
There were no explicit veto threats, although the President insisted he would not accept any tax cut that threatened to send the deficit soaring.
So much has the political climate changed that Mr. Clinton was obliged to defend the very idea of activist government. With politics and politicians under a cloud, with Washington a symbol of incompetence, with term limits and privatization in vogue, he sought to rekindle the faith in government that burned in the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy.
Politicians and public servants, he said, are "keepers of a sacred trust," not the self-aggrandizing windbags depicted by cartoonists and hosts of talk radio.
Many of those who sat before him, new to Washington and to public life, won election by attacking the records and even the motives of the Democrats who dominated the House of Representatives for four decades and the Senate for most of that time. To their way of thinking, upholding the public trust involves minimizing government, rather than putting it back onto a pedestal.
For those who hoped that the President would move to the middle in response to the election returns, the speech was a success. But for those who hoped for signs of a new political acuity and a new personal discipline in the White House, it must have constituted a disappointment -- almost an hour and a half long and a reminder of Mr. Clinton's seemingly endless nominating speech at the 1988 Democratic convention.
As Mr. Clinton spoke, his parlous situation was evident to the public. According to a new CBS News poll, 78 percent of the electorate expects Congress to have more influence over governmental affairs than he -- but many of the same respondents are dissatisfied with the way Congress is doing its job.
The months ahead will center on a battle for the symbolic high ground: are the Republicans the agents of change and the Democrats the defenders of the bureaucratic status quo? Or are the Democrats the agents of change and the Republicans the reactionary champions of trickle-down economics? After almost three months in which he played a largely passive role, the President joined that battle tonight, and its outcome will determine his electoral fate.
Mr. Clinton sought to go the Republicans one better, advocating "leaner, not meaner" government, calling for campaign-spending reform, attacking lobbyists and insisting that government should work for average Americans. Not only did he congratulate the Republicans on their victories, he even used some of their party's favorite phrases.
Still, the President spoke up strongly for several Democratic programs that the new Republican majority may try to eliminate, including gun control, the service corps and Medicare. He could hardly have done less without risking the alienation of his political base.
Echoing, with a bow to the politics of the 1990's, the words that Theodore C. Sorensen wrote for President Kennedy's inaugural, Mr. Clinton made this appeal to the nation: "We must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves. We should rely on government as a partner to help us do more for ourselves and for each other."
With the country already in open rebellion against tax levels that are lower than those of many Western democracies, the President will be hard pressed to find the revenue for even the modest kinds of initiatives that he seemed to be calling for. Some legislation, like the increased minimum wage that Mr. Clinton is seeking, would cost the Federal Government relatively little.
He may overcome the most formidable obstacles that the Republicans had hoped to place in the path of Big Government. Early ratification of a balanced-budget amendment by the requisite three-quarters, or 38, of the states, seems improbable.
In addition, the amendment appears unlikely to contain the Republican-proposed language, part of the "Contract With America," that would have required a three-fifths "super majority" to increase taxes. But it will probably still require more than a simple majority for tax increases. The likely formula is an absolute majority -- that is, a majority of the total membership, rather than those present and voting -- and that in itself is something the old Congress would never even have considered adopting.
Keenly aware of the President's skills as a communicator, to say nothing of the tactical advantages enjoyed by any occupant of the White House, the Republicans made collegial noises all day. Speaker Newt Gingrich said he planned to concentrate on the ideas he and the President had in common, not the points in the speech that he most strongly disagreed with.
But Republican arguments have already been embraced by the voters, and that has shifted the agenda.
Without last November's election returns -- and especially the failure of the Democrats to take a single seat in the House or the Senate away from the Republicans -- it seems improbable that Mr. Clinton would have returned to the idea of a middle-class tax cut, which he promised during the 1992 campaign, then abandoned in his campaign for deficit reduction beginning early in 1993.
Without those returns, would he have increased military spending? Without them, would Democrats like the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, be talking earnestly about a flat tax that differs only in emphasis from the one long espoused by right-wing Republicans?
And without Gov. Pete Wilson's overwhelming re-election in California, fueled in large measure by resentment against illegal aliens, would Mr. Clinton have chosen to place so much emphasis on that issue this evening?

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Help Persuade Financial Company to Stay

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In exchange for a pledge to keep more than 4,000 jobs in New York City for at least 20 years, the CS First Boston Corporation, a major financial company, will receive breaks on city taxes worth more than $50 million, city officials announced yesterday.
With its decision to stay in New York, CS First Boston plans to consolidate operations in a 1930's limestone building on East 24th Street owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. CS First Boston has 3,700 employees in four sites in the city. 
 For a year, executives said, CS First Boston has been considering alternatives to the high costs of doing business in New York City. One plan included moving operations that did not require a presence in Manhattan to New Jersey. In comenting on the decison to stay in New York, David C. Mulford of CS First Boston refused to say that the company would have left if the tax breaks had not come through. But Mr. Mulford added that the outcome of the search "probably would have been different."
The tax incentives will include a $27.3 million exemption on sales taxes for the purchase of equipment, fixtures and furniture and up to $17.7 million in tax credits that will be tied to job growth for 20 years. CS First Boston said it expected to add up to 5,550 jobs in that period.
Clay B. Lifflander, president of the Ecconomic Development Corporation and the Industrial Development Agency, which negotiated the deal, calculated that the city could recover the tax breaks in less than three months based on the estimated annual $115 million in tax revenues the company generates for the city.
Starting next year CS First Boston will move to 16 floors at 11 Madison Avenue, a prominent building that occupies the entire block bounded by Madison Avenue, Park Avenue South and 24th and 25th Streets.
The neighborhood, which real-estate brokers have called Midtown South, has emerged in recent years as a thriving office, retail and restaurant district, as service companies appreciate the architectural richness of older buildings.
The CS First Boston lease with Met Life, which continues to own and operate the building, is for 20 years. The companies would not give details.
In the move CS First Boston will give up 700,000 square feet in locations that include 509 Madison Avenue and 599 Lexington Avenue. With the transaction CS First Boston plans to increase its trading-floor operation threefold.
The North Building of the former Met Life headquarters was designed in 1932 by Harvey Wiley Corbett and D. Everett Waid. It is known for the vaulted entrances at each of its four corners.

HEADLINE: Albertis S. Harrison Jr., 88, Dies; Led Virginia as Segregation Fell

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Albertis S. Harrison Jr., who served as State Attorney General and Governor as Virginia made its last stand against racial integration, died on Monday at his home in Lawrenceville, Va. He was 88.
The cause was a heart attack, the Governor's office in Richmond said. 
 Mr. Harrison's time in office came as the state turned from a rural to an industrialized society, and he contributed significantly to that development with road construction and other economic programs. He also left a legacy of a greatly improved educational system.
Allied with the conservative organization headed by Harry F. Byrd Sr., Mr. Harrison took a more cautious position on desegregation, avoiding its doctrine of "massive resistance."
By virtue of his office, Mr. Harrison was involved in confrontations with the Federal Government as Attorney General from 1958 to 1962 and then as Governor until 1966. These included Virginia's legal battles to continue a poll tax and close public schools in Prince Edward County, which ended up leaving black pupils without a formal education for four years.
The county supervisors ordered the public schools padlocked to avoid integrating them. White pupils then attended a private academy with their tuitions subsidized by the state. Most of the 1,700 black children had no schools to go to while the issue was decided in Federal court.
Prince Edward County was the only school district in the country to resort to such extreme measures. In 1963, schools were ordered to open, and when the Supreme Court agreed in 1964, the supervisors gave in rather than risk prison. By then, the Governor was advising Virginians to heed the law unless they were willing to face prosecution, and civil-rights leaders were generally pleased with the level of compliance in the state.
After he left the Governor's Mansion, Mr. Harrison became a judge of the state's Supreme Court of Appeals, retiring in 1981. In 1968 he headed a commission that streamlined the State Constitution, and one clause the panel purged from the 1923 version was a commandment that "white and colored children shall not be taught in the same school."
Albertis Sydney Harrison Jr. was born into Southern aristocracy in Alberta, Va., in Brunswick County. His home sat on a tract deeded to an ancestor, Henry Harrison, by King George II in 1732. His family tree boasted one Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, along with William Henry Harrison and a second Benjamin Harrison, the 9th and 23d Presidents, respectively.
A graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, Mr. Harrison easily made his way into Virginia's political elite as he served as Brunswick County prosecutor before being elected Attorney General.
As Governor he persuaded the Legislature to increase educational financing for new schools and laboratories, to raise teachers' pay and to provide an enhanced teacher scholarship program, among other things. He pressed for state-supported colleges, technical schools and improved vocational training.
He helped to modernize state banking laws to attract investment and accelerated highway construction.
His survivors include his wife of 54 years, Lacey Barkley Harrison, and a daughter, Antoinette H. Jamison of Richmond.

HEADLINE: Beyond Wool And Down

BYLINE: By NEAL KARLEN 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
THE gaggle of grumpy old ice fishermen, looking mummified in untold layers of drab wool dating from the Eisenhower Administration, began making fun of my blindingly bright, state-of-the-art winter sports clothes as soon as I stepped onto the 14-inch-thick ice covering Lake Minnetonka just outside this city. The sunfish weren't biting that moment in subzero January, so my father's angling buddies took a timeout from their fishing holes to critique my outfit. I was testing the latest synthetic winter wear in the direst of circumstances -- in Minnesota, also known as the nation's icebox.
So there I was, looking like an extra from "Plan 9 From Outer Space," as they began their fashion review by laughing at my lightweight, waterproof three-fingered lobster gloves by Pearl Izumi ($40; all prices given here may vary from store to store). The gloves, designed with a synthetic called Entrant to provide the protection of mittens with the flexibility of gloves, locked my hands in a permanent Mr. Spock greeting. I was a nightmare in neon, not a properly dressed fisherman, my father's friends suggested, and I hid from sight the gloves' stitched-in terry-cloth nose wipe. 
 Nor were they moved when I showed off my "expedition weight" long underwear, made of Capilene by Patagonia (the top costs $60; the bottom, $45) and my Tempest parka by Montbell that weighs only 19 ounces and has water-repellent zippers and a double-front storm flap ($290).
They weren't even impressed by my Gore-Tex waterproof oversocks by Rocky ($40), one of the biggest footwear trends in the winter sports industry. "Ice fishing isn't a sport," scoffed Abie (the Mavin) Schwartz, 82, considered by many to be the dean of Minnesota winter angling. "Ice fishing is a punishment!"
Hearing the guffaws, I consoled myself with the knowledge that at least I was toasty and mobile in my lightweight get-up. At one time, only elite athletes and would-be Edmund Hillarys dressed in the new fabrics. But now these synthetic fibers can be found everywhere, in everything from lounge wear to panty hose. Even the eco-minded can rest easily, as polyester fleece fabrics like Polartec are being made from recycled plastic soft-drink bottles.
But they don't come cheap. Prices of winter skiing outfits can easily top $1,000, though if sales are any indication, buyers haven't seemed to mind. Polyester-based fabrics (which most of these synthetics are) now make up about 95 percent of the winter sportswear market, and sales have grown 20-fold in the last 15 years, according to several Midwestern outfitters. Sales of Polartec have grown 25 percent a year for the last two years, reaching $200 million in 1994, said Jeff Bowman, the merchandising manager at Malden Mills, the maker of Polartec.
Synthetics like Capilene and Polartec have been around for a while, but now there are a half-dozen weights of Capilene and more than 100 types of Polartec.
One almost needs a Ph.D. in chemistry to keep track of the ever-multiplying polyglot of fabrics, coatings and insulations, from polypropylene to Thermolite. They keep one warm when soaked (by either the elements or one's own sweat), by "wicking," or pulling moisture away from the skin while still insulating the body.
While a garment cannot be both 100 percent waterproof and breathable, most synthetics make it possible to enjoy all winter sports in weather ranging from a sleet storm to a blizzard. Manufacturers design clothes to match sports, from stop-and-go activities like rock climbing to continuous exertions like biking.
With so many choices, I decided to test a few of the latest clothes to see whether they were any match for the Minnesota winter.
I began my field test with a control study; I went cross-country skiing at Theodore Wirth Park on a windy 14-degree day wearing a cotton flannel union suit, cotton sweatpants and hooded sweatshirt and a woolen sweater. Within minutes I was sweating like a sumo wrestler; unwicked, within a half-hour I was frozen.
The next day, I ventured out in the synthetics. For a stop-and-go activity I chose ice skating at the Lake of the Isles rink. Though the temperature was a modest 27 degrees, my bare head and neck quickly felt numb. I put on a tasseled wool hat from Dale of Norway ($34) with a new polyester fabric called Gore-Wind Stopper that warmed the ears while avoiding scratchiness. A pullover Patagonia neck gaiter ($15) made of Synchilla, a fabric of recycled plastic, covered the throat.
Though polypropylene is often criticized for retaining body odors and burning up in the dryer, Early Winter's polypropylene midweight Prolite 5000 long underwear (pants $30, top $32) proved to be a good choice on the ice. Sweat wicked off quickly, keeping me dry as I skated hard, yet there was still enough weight to keep me warm while standing around watching the hockey players at the adjacent rink.
It had been snowing on and off all day, so for midlayer warmth I wore a North Face heavy fleece Denali insulating jacket ($160), a garment known to keep its warmth even when wet. My last layer was a Trekker shell by Marmot ($200), a totally windproof and waterproof Gore-Tex item that proved extremely useful when the flakes began to fall and blow again. Outdoor Research's two-fingered Gore-Tex glove ($65) kept the hands warm but not overheated.
Two days later, a midnight bicycle ride around Lake Calhoun at 10 degrees provided a good test for high-aerobic wear. I chose a light, highly breathable Aero/D top by Lowe Alpine ($80), with Microfiber, Lycra and reflective stripes. For bottoms, I wore Lowe's Powerstretch tights ($54), made of Polartec. I added a pair of lightweight Bugaboo pants by Columbia ($73). Two pairs of Ultimax hiking socks from Wigwam, made of wool blended with a variety of synthetics ($8.50 a pair), were enough to keep my feet comfortable.
The ultimate test, however, came the following afternoon, when I had the date with the ice fishermen. After they finished ridiculing my ensemble, they retreated to their fishing holes. They may not have been interested in my Gore-Tex oversocks by Rocky, but I had to know the truth about them.
I'd been assured that this oversock was so remarkably waterproof that I could stand in a bathtub full of water and not get my feet wet. Huddled inside an ice shack, I slipped off a Sorel boot that had been worn for 20 years by my late grandfather. The manufacturer's claim had better be right, I thought, as I stuck my foot into the water churning up through the hole in the ice, or I will never dance again. I listened for my scream, but it never came. The sock worked.
But does it matter? I went back outside with the tough old guys in their woolens. With what my new clothes cost, they estimated they could buy a new fish shack, a portable ice auger and enough minnows to last until the next millennium.
A few hours later, the most painful results were in. Abie Schwartz had caught 13 healthy sunfish, my father 7. Lying on the ice was my sole catch, a puny sunny, lighter even than my lobster gloves.
"Warm enough?" Mr. Schwartz said, laughing.
 
Modern Bear Grease
 Here are some of the most common synthetic fabrics and fibers found in winter sportswear:
 
CAPILENE -- A polyester fiber from the Patagonia company. The inner core repels moisture from the skin by pushing it to the outside of the fabric, a process known as wicking. The outer surface attracts this moisture, spreading it so that it dries quickly. Used in underwear, linings and socks.
 
ENTRANT -- An elastic coating of waterproof polyurethane that breathes through microscopic holes; the more Entrant painted on, the more waterproof and less breathable a garment. Licensed to several manufacturers for winter outerwear like gloves and for rain jackets.
 
FIELDSENSOR -- A synthetic yarn made by Toray, it wicks moisture away from the body. Most often found in first-layer garments and liners.
 
GORE-TEX -- A thin insulation laminated to a variety of outer fabrics, it provides both waterproofing and a way for sweat to escape. Used in outerwear, rainwear and active wear.
 
HOLLOFIL -- Du Pont's Dacron polyester hollow-fiber insulation that is often found in economy-brand apparel and sleeping bags. Hollofil II, its premium brand, reduces fiber-to-fiber friction that usually causes insulation to flatten.
 
MICROFIBER -- A tightly woven, very fine fiber that both breathes and offers protection against wind and cold. Among the brands available are Super Microft and Versatech. Used for ski outerwear, active wear and sleeping bags.
 
MICROLOFT -- This three-year-old Du Pont synthetic fiber, made of filaments thinner than human hair, works as an insulator. Highly water-resistant, Microloft is found most often in sleeping bags, gloves and outerwear.
 
POLARTEC -- The name for several fabrics made of polyester fleece by Malden Mills for many manufacturers. Polartec comes in several weights, including a polyester pile, a double-sided microfiber, a Lycra stretch version and a version made of recycled plastic. Used as an inner-layer fabric.
 
POLYPROPYLENE -- A strong, paraffin-based fiber (derived from petroleum) with wicking capabilities. Used in underlayers.
 
PRIMALOFT -- Interwoven polyester microfibers made by Albany International as a lightweight, heat-retaining alternative to down. Most often found in outerwear and sleeping bags.
 
SYNCHILLA -- Patagonia's brand name for Polartec fleeces.
 
THERMOLITE -- Dacron polyester by Du Pont that provides lightweight insulation for gloves, footwear and outerwear.
 
THINSULATE -- A light polyester blend by 3M of 35 percent polyester and 65 percent olefin that is spun into a thin insulation. Found in hats, gloves, outerwear and ski wear. NEAL KARLEN

Helping Mexico Help Us

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There is an old saying among bankers that when someone owes you $1,000 that's his problem, but when someone owes you $1 million that's your problem. That bit of wisdom is good to remember as you listen to the demagogues opining that Mexico's debt crisis is Mexico's problem. Mexico owes us $100 billion. That's our problem.
That is frustrating for a lot of people to acknowledge. And they are right to feel frustrated. The $40 billion rescue package that President Clinton has proposed for Mexico is a crazy cross between highway robbery and self-help -- a joint venture by Pancho Villa and Robin Hood. But on balance we have to go through with this bailout, because in today's intertwined global economy we can't save ourselves without saving Mexico, and we can't bail out the little guy without bailing out the billionaires as well. 
 There was a telling story in The Washington Post last week quoting "Congressional sources" as saying they saw "little political gain in approving . . . a plan to bail out Mexico's economy when members, particularly Republicans, believe they were elected to deal with problems closer to home."
I've got news for those Congressional sources: In today's intertwined global market, Mexico is "home." There is far more American industrial investment and mutual-fund investment in Mexico today than there is in our own state of New Mexico. And the economic collapse of Mexico would damage the U.S., Latin America and Canada far more than the bankruptcy of New Mexico. To some extent, "home" is where the wallet is, and right now, if you check your pension fund or mutual fund, you will find that your wallet is spread from Toronto to Tierra del Fuego.
In the 1982 Mexican debt crisis, Mexico's foreign debt was held by a few big American banks. That crisis was resolved by 12 bankers sitting in a dining room with a few Mexican officials and rescheduling Mexico's loans. Since then, though, global finance has been democratized. In today's intertwined global economy, the big holders of Mexican debt are not 12 banks but millions of individual Americans. If the Mexicans wanted to renegotiate with them, they would have to use Shea Stadium, not the 21 Club.
But where things get even more complicated is that those millions of investors fall into two categories. In one category are speculators who borrowed billions of dollars at low interest rates in the U.S. several years ago and invested them in Mexican bonds paying 11 percent. They made a killing, and now that things have gone sour, they are frantically dialing 911 for Uncle Sam. The problem is that the other investors in Mexico were your pension fund and mutual fund managers, investing your money in search of higher returns. And if Mexico goes Chapter 11, not only will millions of Americans lose directly on their Mexican investments, but indirectly from lost trade, jobs and destabilized financial markets. That is why Patrick Buchanan is a fraud when he postures as protector of the "little guy" and argues against the Mexican bailout. The truly populist thing to do is to protect the people's money, and, like it or not, Robin Hood and Billionaire Bob have a joint peso account.
The Mexico crisis also demonstrates how we have gone from a world dominated by superpowers to a world dominated by supermarkets. It is the Tokyo, New York, London and Frankfurt bond markets that will have as much say as governments in determining Mexico's fate. If Stalin were around to describe this new power structure he would ask: "How many mutual funds does the Pope have?"
In this crisis, the supermarkets told the Mexicans that they would only reinvest their money in Mexican bonds if Mexico restored investor confidence by pledging some Mexican oil revenues as collateral. The Mexicans, and the Clinton team, initially resisted this appeal, telling the markets that oil was Mexico's national patrimony, its crown jewels, and any Mexican government that hocked them could be toppled. They appealed to the markets to think of the big picture. Weren't U.S. Government guarantees enough?
The markets said they were interested in the bottom line, not the big picture, and they preferred jewels. Mexico is now going to have to put some oil on the table. In the first major test case between the superpowers and supermarkets, score this one for the supermarkets.

HEADLINE: The State of the President

 BODY:
A State of the Union address is normally about policies and promises. But at the center of President Clinton's speech last night lay a political question: Can this President, after a decent first year and a disastrous second, regain his standing with the American people and his own party? What lent drama to this speech was not what it said about the future of America but what it would show about the future of one man.
Bill Clinton is plainly aware how hard it is going to be to regain his footing. He cannot simply offer himself as a watered-down Newt Gingrich. But as he acknowledged in his first sentences, he cannot ignore the forces, including dissatisfaction with government in general and with his vacillating leadership in particular, that swept the Republicans to power. 
 The speech was extraordinarily long, but the President met the test of showing renewed engagement and the makings of an agenda that could compete with the Republicans'. He offered himself as a centrist alternative between the old-style Democrats and the new-style Republicans who have promised in their "Contract With America" to take a sword to social programs.
To that end, he pledged to reduce tax burdens on the middle class and "end welfare as we know it" -- and to listen to Republicans who seek the same ends. But he stressed he would not accept fiscally irresponsible tax-cut proposals that would "explode" the deficit, put economic recovery at risk or diminish Medicare. On welfare, he said he agreed that the goal must be to move people from "dependence to independence," but that he would not countenance legislation designed to punish people "because they happen to be poor."
He offered only a few new programs -- an unspecified increase in the minimum wage, an increased effort to identify illegal immigrants, a campaign against teen-age pregnancy, an incremental approach to health-care reform.
In a sense, this was a speech haunted by the President's own mistakes and missed opportunities. He challenged the Republicans to follow the spirit of campaign finance and lobbying legislation killed by the Democratic leadership of the last Congress. His "new covenant" language, taken directly from his acceptance speech at the 1992 Democratic Convention, had more to do with the way he successfully campaigned in 1992 than the way he has ineffectively governed in the White House.
Mr. Clinton had some winning ideas, but the test for him is making those words live through his behavior. He can regain his authority and regain a chance with the voters only by putting prolonged attention and specific legislation behind a few key items such as welfare reform, ethics legislation, further and responsible "reinvention of government" and what he called his "step-by-step" health-care reform. Mr. Clinton needs to show that he can winnow a defined menu of priorities from the intellectual buffet of his speeches.
As has so often been the case with this President, it is not his intelligence or grasp of policies that is in doubt, but his follow-through. This speech met the minimum requirement of giving him a toehold from which he can begin a march over the ground he has lost.

HEADLINE: Quake Recovery Doesn't Equal a Boon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Through Kobe's Rubble, an Economic Rainbow" (news article, Jan. 18) cites experts claiming that the earthquake in Japan could give a boost to an economy struggling to recover from a long recession. The economist Henry Hazlitt has passed on, but I imagine that he would have said, There you go again using the "broken window fallacy." 
 The expert is at least right in the first conclusion that there will be more business for the construction industry. But this new employment and industry arises at the opportunity cost of lost business elsewhere, which will not occur because money is redirected toward reconstruction.
As Hazlitt put it in "Economics in One Lesson," the experts "see only what is immediately visible to the eye" while neglecting invisible costs to the rest of the economy. If we accept this fallacy, we should also expect to see bombing campaigns included in the next fiscal stimulus package.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Still 'Steaming Ahead'

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The wisdom on Wall Street in recent months has been that the private investment partnerships known as hedge funds have lost their luster.
In fact, many shined in 1994. Despite the well-publicized losses of Wall Street's most famous hedge funds last year, many others did well. And many new funds are popping up, attracting both new talent and investors. 
 Names like Michael Steinhardt, Julian Robertson, Leon Cooperman and Mark Strome all suffered heavy losses in 1994 -- after they racked up gains as high as 143 percent in 1993. A few especially hard-hit funds even went out of business last year.
But the success of other, relatively small hedge funds has helped maintain interest in the sector even as some bruised investors have withdrawn their money. Kynikos Associates, a New York-based manager that specializes in profiting on falling stock prices, was up 44.5 percent in 1994. Investors in Bricoleur Partners of San Diego, which invests in the stocks of smaller-capitalized companies, had profits of 34 percent. And Long Term Capital Management, the bond arbitrage hedge fund started by John Meriwether, a former Salomon Brothers vice chairman, was up 20 percent.
And although the tremendous rate of growth fed by the high returns of 1993 has slowed, new funds are still being introduced, stealing some of Wall Street's top talent away from prestigious investment banks like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers.
There may even be some hedge fund legacies in the making. Wayne Cooperman, the son of Leon Cooperman, has formed a fund with Ricky Sandler, whose father, Harvey, is also a longtime hedge fund manager. David Steinhardt, the son of Michael Steinhardt, is also starting a fund.
"The ship is steaming ahead just as fast, and it is taking on more passengers," said George P. Van, chairman of International Advisory Group Inc., a consultant based in Nashville that tracks more than 600 funds and that estimates that a total of $ 120 billion is currently committed to about 3,000 funds. "Hedge funds are here for the foreseeable future. I don't think there has been any respite whatsoever."
The reason is that hedge funds offer both wealthy investors and managers the three things that they covet most: secrecy, a relatively unregulated environment and the prospect of immense profits.
Because they are private limited partnerships with 99 or fewer investors, the funds largely escape regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and are not required to make their results public. Indeed, the funds are barred from advertising their services.
This exclusivity means that the funds cater only to wealthy clients. For example, the funds tracked by Mr. Van require a minimum investment that ranges from $ 50,000 to $ 25 million.
The large majority of managers, including the biggest names, also have the bulk of their personal wealth tied up in the funds, which can be an extra measure of comfort for many outside investors.
In exchange for the promise of above-average returns, hedge fund managers receive between 1 percent and 2 percent of their funds as a management fee, as well as anywhere from 20 percent to 25 percent of the profits that they generate. Investors may be obligated to commit their money for as short as one month or as long as three years.
Hedge fund redemptions last year were more modest than many thought they would be, averaging around 15 percent for 200 funds tracked by E. Lee Hennessee, who runs a hedge fund advisory group at the Republic New York Securities Corporation.
And most of the withdrawals came from the larger funds. Budge Collins, a San Diego fund manager who divides $ 1 billion for investors among a variety of smaller hedge funds, said that his fund has expanded so far this year.
In addition, when it comes to hedge funds, bigger is not necessarily better. Many managers believe that the amount of money that poured into some of the bigger funds at the beginning of 1994 made them too unwieldy, limiting the kind of investments they could make. Meanwhile, the smaller funds performed better.
"We don't want to get big," said John H. Debs, one of the managers of NV Partners, an $ 80 million fund based in Palo Alto, Calif. "We're the old-fashioned hedge fund, the one those guys used to be before they got famous," he added, referring to Michael Steinhardt and George Soros.
Some managers even decided to shrink themselves by returning money to investors. The Tudor Investment Corporation closed two of its eight funds, reducing its assets under management to $ 1 billion from $ 1.7 billion. Paul Tudor Jones 2d, the company's chairman, said in a statement last fall that it would be easier for him to resume producing double-digit returns with a smaller asset base.
The term hedge fund, which dates back to the early 1960's, originated because the managers, in addition to buying stocks, could sell them short, meaning that they could bet that certain stocks would decline in value.
Proponents of such hedging strategies say that their odds of beating the market are increased because the probability of a hedge fund portfolio's declining in value is much less than that of a portfolio that can profit only if stock prices rise.
In the five-year period that ended on Sept. 30, hedge funds delivered a 12.4 percent average net annual return to their investors, compared with a 9.2 percent average annual return by the Standard & Poors 500-stock index, according to Mr. Van of International Advisory Group. Also, the average risk of loss for the funds was 17.3 percent, compared with 21.5 percent for the S.& P. 500, he calculated.
"If you look at the hedge fund universe, you get better performance at half the risk," said Mr. Collins, the San Diego fund manager.
Most mutual funds do not sell stocks short and do not borrow heavily to make larger bets because of complex tax and regulatory requirements. Therefore, the average investor cannot participate in a hedged-fund style portfolio.
Throughout most of their careers, the successful hedge fund managers like Mr. Steinhardt made their reputations as highly skilled stock pickers. It was only in the early 1990's, as the gap widened between short- and long-term interest rates, that they became known as "macro" managers because they borrowed heavily to make large bets on broad economic trends, like the direction of interest rates.
As their success gained more attention, money poured into dozens of new hedge funds specializing in a wide variety of investment strategies from emerging markets to takeover stocks. But the biggest new funds formed in 1992 and 1993 were Soros and Steinhardt wannabes.
By borrowing at short-term rates and investing in long-term bonds, these hedge funds made millions in 1992 and 1993 simply by holding their portfolios. And when bond prices continued to rise, they made even more money.
"In 1993, you couldn't make a mistake," said one newly minted macro manager who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It was impossible to lose money."
But when the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates last February, the party came to an abrupt halt.
At one point, Michael Steinhardt saw his $ 4.5 billion under management shrink by one-third in a matter of weeks. David J. Askin, who ran a supposedly "market neutral" fund, saw his $ 600 million under management implode when the bottom fell out of the mortgage-backed securities market. He subsequently filed for bankruptcy.
Major losses present a serious challenge to hedge funds because most managers have a so-called high-water mark, or an agreement that they will forgo their cut of the trading profits until their investors' losses are made good. That means that a fund that loses, say, 50 percent of its value must rebound 100 percent before the manager gets his investors back to even and once again can begin taking his 20 or 25 percent cut of the profits.
Mr. Steinhardt, whose partnership never had a provision for a high- water mark, considered closing his fund late last year. In the end, he decided to remain in business, but told his investors that he would not forgo his cut of the profits.
The decision shocked many investors and managers who thought it unfair that Mr. Steinhardt would be able to make 20 percent, or $ 300 million, through recouping the $ 1.5 billion needed to bring his investors back to where they started at the beginning of 1994.
But as it turned out only about 15 percent of the money in Mr. Steinhardt's funds was withdrawn from the fund at the end of last year, according to one of his investors who requested anonymity.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about hedge funds, comparing a sample of individual funds, misstated the net return to investors in Steinhardt Partners for 1993. Investors received a net return of 49 percent, not 38.4 percent.
 Because of an editing error, a second chart, with the continuation of the article, comparing types of funds, misidentified the source of the data. It was E. Lee Hennessee Group/Republic New York Securities.

During the 1980's, the advertising slogan at Credit Lyonnais was "The Power to Say Yes." These days, as the big state-owned bank claws out from under a huge pile of bad loans and ill-fated investments, the French taxpayers who are footing most of the cleanup bill can only wish that it had more frequently said no.
With auditors just now getting a handle on the scale of the problem at the bank, which is the world's largest outside Japan, Credit Lyonnais' chairman, Jean Peyrelevade, is deep in negotiation with the French Government on the terms of yet another bailout package. The Government last year put up $4.4 billion in fresh capital, loan guarantees and other aid to keep Credit Lyonnais afloat, and industry executives said the tally this time would be at least as much again. 
 Because the French Government is clearly unwilling to allow the bank, the nation's largest financial institution, to fail, Credit Lyonnais seems assured of survival. But its once grandiose vision of serving as the financial backbone of France and Western Europe has been largely shattered, replaced by a sober focus on its core businesses: retail and commercial banking in Europe, and commercial banking, capital markets and asset management in Europe, the United States and Asia.
"Part of the difficulty at Credit Lyonnais was that too much importance was given to size," said Olivier Perrain, a spokesman for the bank. "The focus on size is being abandoned. But we are confident we can still be a player on a worldwide level."
Mr. Peyrelevade is selling chunks of the company's far-flung holdings, hoping to raise $3.8 billion, and shutting down other operations and cutting employment by 10 percent to reduce costs.
In the last year he has sold $1.7 billion worth of assets, including a 19 percent stake in Adidas A.G., the athletic shoe company, and a 65 percent stake in the FNAC entertainment retailing chain. On the block now are the bank's 125 movie theaters in Europe and its bank subsidiary in Brazil.
Mr. Peyrelevade, who was brought in to clean up the mess a year and a half ago, hopes that with financial help from the Government, asset sales and cost-cutting, Credit Lyonnais will be able to wipe clean the legacy of its mistakes.
Those mistakes included big bets on real estate projects that later collapsed and direct investments in steelmakers, airlines and other companies that foundered during the recession. Altus Finance, the bank's investment arm, ran up big losses in 1993 and in the first half of last year.
Then there were the bank's loans to a veritable rogue's gallery. Big borrowers included Robert Maxwell, whose fraud-ridden media empire did not long survive him, and Bruce McNall, the former owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, who recently pleaded guilty to defrauding Credit Lyonnais and six other banks of more than $236 million.
The single biggest lending disaster may have been the bank's involvement with Giancarlo Parretti, a little-known Italian investor who persuaded the bank to finance his acquisition of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. Mr. Parretti and his partners, whose backgrounds and financial strength were hazy to say the least, then defaulted, leaving Credit Lyonnais -- and by extension the French Government -- the unlikely owners of a Hollywood icon.
The bank now has $2.5 billion on the line with MGM, including loans and additional funds pumped into the studio in an attempt to whip it into shape. Under American banking law, Credit Lyonnais will have to sell MGM by 1997, and it is still unclear how much of its money the bank will be able to recover through a sale.
Credit Lyonnais backed some winners as well. It was a partner with the New York investor Leon Black's Apollo Partners in acquiring, at firesale prices, the junk bond portfolio of the failed Executive Life Insurance Company of California. The bank's investment paid off handsomely when prices of the high-risk bonds bounced back strongly.
Good news, however, has been rare for Mr. Peyrelevade, an elite Socialist technocrat who previously ran Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurer. Hoping to move quickly to end the bank's woes decisively, Mr. Peyrelevade has antagonized the conservative Government by pressing for more and more financial help at a time when France is trying to pare back the bill for supporting ailing state-owned companies.
If the bank's woes have been traumatic within the institution, they have also helped speed a retreat by France from its "dirigiste" tradition -- state control of key industries, augmented by interlocking shareholdings and financial support among big companies -- which has long been accepted on both the left and the right here. The strategy was urged on Credit Lyonnais by the Socialist Government during the last decade.
As a result, the bank today holds big stakes in money-losing French industrial giants like Aerospatiale, the aerospace company, and Usinor Sacilor, a steel company.
The ultimate goal of the Credit Lyonnais cleanup is to privatize the institution, in which the French Government has a 76 percent voting stake. Public investors hold an additional 22 percent of the equity in the form of nonvoting shares. Other French financial institutions, such as Banque Nationale de Paris, have already been privatized, and are none too pleased at seeing Credit Lyonnais, their biggest rival, being underpinned with taxpayer money.
Moreover, with banking long since having become a global business, neither Credit Lyonnais nor any other French bank can afford to prop up other national industries at the cost of profits and international competitiveness.
"We are still in our hearts reasonably dirigiste," said one senior banker in Paris. "But we are also living in a market economy with international forces, and there are conflicts there. We are now in the process of solving those conflicts and inevitably they are being solved in the direction of more freedom."
A report this month by a group of French political and business leaders concluded that the experience of Credit Lyonnais "will not have been useless if it allows the French banking system to emerge stronger, better established and above all more useful in the long and complex transition from interventionism towards the market."
For now, though, executives and auditors are poring over the books, seeking to determine exactly how much the bank stands to lose from its bad loans and failed investments. Estimates of the total bill range as high as 50 billion French francs, or about $9.4 billion. But having believed last year that they had a handle on the size of the problem, only to find they had badly underestimated the cost, executives said no one could say for sure what the final figure would be.
The goal of the bank and the Government is to have a thorough audit completed and the bailout package completed by late March or early April. They then plan to close the bank's books for 1994 with the financial assistance package in place, allowing the bank to begin its accounting for 1995 with its old problems wiped out. Mr. Peyrelevade said last month that he believed Credit Lyonnais could be profitable this year.
Bank executives said the underlying business was in reasonably good shape. With 2,100 branches in France and 900 in the rest of Europe, Credit Lyonnais is confident of remaining a dominant force in retail banking as the industry consolidates and the European single market puts an increased premium on economies of scale. Analysts said, however, that Mr. Peyrelevade still had a way to go in bringing costs down to the levels of the bank's best competitors.
With the gradual end of the recession around the world, analysts said Credit Lyonnais should also see some growth in its corporate lending and capital markets activities.
"The bank could have fared much worse," said Sasha Serafimovski, who tracks Credit Lyonnais for Merrill Lynch. "Peyrelevade has done a good job to hold it all together."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Securities Given Lift By Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities rose yesterday for the first time in five sessions following a surprisingly successful Treasury auction.
Also helping bond prices were hints in the Senate testimony of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the Fed might be nearing the end of its yearlong round of interest-rate increases. 
 The Treasury auctioned $11 billion of five-year notes yesterday, which produced a yield of 7.79 percent. Traders said the auction, which drew good retail interest, went smoothly, with the yield slightly lower than the 7.80 percent the market had anticipated. It was also the lowest yield for a five-year auction in three months, since an October yield of 7.55 percent.
Earlier, the bond market picked up strength on what traders termed a short-covering rally as prices began to rise after Mr. Greenspan, in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee, declined to say whether the Fed would raise rates at its policy-making meeting next week.
While Mr. Greenspan gave the strong impression that the Fed had not yet finished raising short-term rates, some bond traders said they interpreted his remarks as hedging against an increase next week.
Short-covering occurs when traders buy back borrowed securities that they had previous sold short in the hopes profiting from lower prices. But if prices begin to rise instead of fall, though, the short sellers need to cover their short positions by buying back the securities to limit their losses.
Doug Burtnick, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the market turned stronger in the afternoon on the results of the auction. He said traders spent the morning hoping the five-year notes would cheapen so they could get them at a decent price.
"The problem with the Greenspan testimony was that it was interpreted in a number of ways by any number of people," Mr. Burtnick said. "The biggest interpretation was a softening-the-tightening stance, even that the Fed may not tighten. This brought buyers back to cover shorts."
Still, Mr. Burtnick said, "not everyone is thinking that the Fed is done tightening." He added, "In the meantime we may see an upside to the market but the market is prepared to punish those who get too complacent."
The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to a price of 9526/32 to yield 7.87 percent, down from 7.92 percent on Tuesday. Shorter maturities also rallied on the chance that there will not be rate increases.
The only new piece of economic data released yesterday -- that existing-home sales for December rose 1.8 percent, to 3.89 million units annually -- was said to have had no impact on the market.
"A lot of things fell into place for the market today," Mr. Burtnick said. He notes that the 30-year bond, which has traded within 2 1/4 points in December and January, will maintain that range over the short-term.
"While the market may be strong today," Mr. Burtnick concluded, "I don't think it is a sign that things have suddenly gotten well. This was just a matter of shorts being squeezed out of the market."
The municipal market, like that for Treasuries, gained on the day. The Bond Buyer's index of 40 issues remained unchanged, with the average yield at 6.81 percent.
Concerning the New York City bonds that were priced on Tuesday, Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said his firm saw big retail demand for the shorter maturities. The insured bonds went well, while investors picked up the long maturities.
But the sale by the city of some middle maturities was soft, causing it to extend the selling period.
Mr. Roden said that the New York City issue was not given enough publicity and that investors were reluctant to buy with the probability of a rate increase by the Fed so strong.
The following are the results of yesterday's five-year note auction:

HEADLINE: Greenspan Remark Raises Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stocks followed other financial markets higher yesterday, after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made some ambiguous remarks about inflation that seemed to indicate to many traders that any increase in interest rates next week might be the last for a while.
But some analysts said a rally in the bond market, which helped lift stock prices, might have been caused in large part by technical factors. 
 And whatever happened yesterday, the wild card remains the Government's report on fourth-quarter growth in the gross domestic product, set for release tomorrow morning. The market is looking for stronger growth than the third quarter's rate of 4 percent, perhaps as much as 4.5 percent.
"But I don't think a number north of 4.5 is in the market right now," said Todd Clark, managing director of Mabon Securities, meaning prices reflect that level of growth but not higher. "I can see the bond market giving back everything it gained and stocks following behind if we see a big number."
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.75 points, closing at 3,871.45. The broader Standard & Poor's rose 1.58 points, to 467.44.
But the Nasdaq composite index fell 2.22 points, to 760.98, pulled down in part by a rout in shares of the Compaq Computer Corporation and other high-technology companies.
After rising as much as 28 points on the Dow Jones industrial average, stock prices fell in the last half-hour of trading, where computer-guided trades appeared to sharply increase trading volume.
Meanwhile, bond prices rose and the yield on the benchmark Treasury 30-year bond fell for the first time in five sessions, to 7.87 percent from 7.92 percent. And dollar gained against the German mark, rising to 1.5167 marks from 1.5125 marks.
In his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, Mr. Greenspan reiterated a familiar position, but various traders interpreted his remarks differently.
Since 1994's inflation rate of 2.7 percent matched that of 1993, Mr. Greenspan said, "it would appear that we have gotten close to achieving effective price stability, though we are not there yet."
Mr. Greenspan added that the prospects of extending the recent trend of what he called low and hopefully declining inflation were "fundamentally good, but there are reasons for some concern, at least with respect to the nearer term."
Many traders interpreted those remarks to mean that the Fed would raise interest rates at the two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, which begins on Tuesday. Higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable and dollar-denominated assets like stocks and bonds more attractive.
But other traders noted that when asked if interest rates would rise soon, Mr. Greenspan replied, "I don't know."
It is possible that when bond prices did not fall with Mr. Greenspan's remarks, what is known as a "short covering rally" hit the bond market and spilled into stocks.
Short-sellers sell borrowed shares or bonds or dollars in the expectation that their price will fall. When prices do not fall as expected, the market is squeezed into a short-covering rally.
Compaq, the nation's largest computer maker, shocked Wall Street by reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 90 cents a share, instead of the expected 94 cents a share. Compaq also said that first-quarter profit would only equal last year's earnings of 80 cents a share.
Compaq, the most active stock of the day at 19.7 million shares, fell 5, to 37 3/8. A variety of computer stocks fell, too. Intel fell 5/8, to 70 7/8; Storage Technology fell 3 5/8, to 22 3/8, and Apple Computer dropped 41/64 , to 4063/64 .
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal with 342.3 million shares changing hands, about 5 percent above this year's daily average of 325 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.71 point, to 254.41, with advancing stocks outnumbering decliners by 1,201 to 956. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.12 points, to 438.52.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Compaq's Net Up but Stock Falls

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Shares in the Compaq Computer Corporation plummeted yesterday in unusually heavy trading after the company released fourth-quarter earnings that fell a few pennies short of Wall Street analysts' expectations. The slide by Compaq, the present leader in the personal computer marketplace, dragged many other technology stocks down as well.
Compaq shares closed yesterday at $37.375, down 12 percent, or $5, on volume of nearly 20 million shares -- far and away the most actively traded issue on the Big Board. Hewlett-Packard was down $2.375, to $103; Dell Computer off $1.875, to $42.75, and I.B.M. down $1.625, to $72.375. 
 Stocks of other computer makers also fell, as did those of chip makers like Intel, Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and Motorola.
Other earnings reports in recent days, including those of I.B.M. and Apple Computer, have led to declines in share prices even when earnings exceed Wall Street's expectations. That has left analysts to puzzle over what is going on, with some pointing to profit taking by mutual fund managers and other investors and others saying that investors are jittery about the economy.
Some analysts said yesterday that investors had overreacted to Compaq's earnings news and noted that the entire shortfall could be attributed to the devaluation of the Mexican peso. They also said that investors had been primed for several months to expect a slowdown in personal computer sales growth and seized on the Compaq release as evidence that the day of reckoning had come.
"I think there was an overreaction," said Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. "My perception is that Compaq is in the best position it's been in for years," he added, noting that the company should benefit in 1995 from new desktop machines using Intel's Pentium microprocessor, a refreshed notebook product line, consumer purchases and the recovery of the European economy.
Mike Murphy, publisher of the California Technology Stock Letter, a newsletter in Half Moon Bay, Calif., commented: "Wall Street was clearly looking for a problem. I don't believe there is a slowdown, but now we have to wait until the March numbers to see."
For the fourth quarter, Compaq reported earnings of $243 million, or 90 cents a share, up 61 percent from $151 million, or 58 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Fourth-quarter sales rose 48 percent, to $3.25 billion, from the $2.2 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 1993. Analysts had expected earnings of 94 cents a share, on average.
In a telephone interview yesterday, Darryl White, Compaq's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said, "I know that we delivered excellent financial results, and in many cases exceeded our own financial models." He said current Securities and Exchange Commission regulations constrained the company's ability to manage expectations more closely.
Compaq cautioned analysts to expect relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 1995 relative to the corresponding period last year, but Mr. White said this was entirely a result of a strategy to lower profit margins in order to gain market share. Compaq has brought gross profit margins down to 23 to 24 percent; a year ago they were 27 percent. "It's a much more competitive range for our market-share strategy," he said.
By one objective measure, the Compaq strategy has succeeded. According to Dataquest, a research company in San Jose, Calif., Compaq vaulted to the top in worldwide sales of personal computers in 1994, overtaking I.B.M. Compaq climbed to 10.3 percent in market share, from 8.1 percent, while I.B.M. dropped to 8.5 percent from 10.8 percent and Apple dropped to 8.5 percent from 9.4 percent.
David Wu, an analyst with S. G. Warburg, said the slippage of Compaq and the other technology stocks had more to do with market psychology than financial performance, but he nonetheless lowered his ratings on technology stocks across the board. "The market psychology has now turned on technology stocks from very positive to negative," he said. "Stocks with positive surprises don't go up; those with negative surprises get clobbered."
One exception to the technology slide yesterday was the Lotus Development Corporation, the software company, whose shares climbed despite a decline in earnings. The company reported that half its revenues now come from communications and work group software, which is less susceptible to competition from the industry giant, the Microsoft Corporation.

HEADLINE: Orange County Tax Advice

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Orange County, Calif., long a bastion of support for lower taxes and smaller government, was advised by its banking consultants to consider raising taxes to make it through its financial crisis.
The county's newly appointed underwriters, Goldman, Sachs & Company and A. G. Edwards & Sons, said in written presentations to county officials obtained by Reuters that higher taxes should be considered to boost the county's revenues. 
 Many county officials, however, said they still opposed raising taxes.
 "I support absolutely no new taxes to pay for the debacle," said the County Supervisor, Jim Silva. Aides to two other county supervisors said their bosses would also oppose new taxes.
On Dec. 6 Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection, after sustaining a loss now estimated at $1.7 billion in its investment pool.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in Broad Rise on Hint Of Increase in Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher against other leading currencies yesterday, strengthening after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, gave the impression that interest rates may rise again.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Finance Committee that the robust economy was growing too rapidly, which could ignite inflation.
"There are increasing reports that firms are considering marking up the prices of final goods to offset" rising raw material and production costs, Mr. Greenspan said. "But any such deterioration should be contained if the Federal Reserve remains vigilant." 
 The comments added to the expectations among currency traders that the Fed's Open Market Committee would increase interest rates at its meeting next Tuesday. Higher interest rates increase the dollar's value by making dollar-denominated securities more attractive to international investors.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5167 German marks, up from 1.5125 late Tuesday. It also rose to 1.2765 Swiss francs from 1.2710 francs. And the British pound fell to $1.5915 from $1.5975.
But the dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, falling in New York to 99.52 yen from 99.76 yen.
Most currency traders have been expecting the Fed to raise rates for a seventh time since February -- probably by half a percentage point -- to cool the economy and keep inflation low.
"There's no reason to think the Fed won't be on target with the rate hike," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank.
A report on home sales yesterday also showed evidence of economic strength. Sales of previously owned homes rose last year to the second-highest level ever, a real estate trade group said.
The dollar also benefited from "safe haven" buying earlier in the day, stemming from erroneous reports of the downing of a missile in Russia. A Russian news agency reported that a missile originating in Northern Europe had been shot down. It turned out that a Norwegian space rocket had been launched without incident.
But because Russia's military is embroiled in a war in Chechnya, the report set traders scrambling to buy dollars as a safe haven currency. Many had been short on dollars, so the spree pushed up the dollar more than a pfennig against the market in interday trading.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
BOEING CO. (BA,N)

 BODY:
The Boeing Company reported yesterday that fourth-quarter profits fell 48 percent, citing declining deliveries of its jet airliners, rising costs and lower investment income.
The company earned $157 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with earnings of $304 million, or 89 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue dipped 10 percent, to $5.12 billion from $5.66 billion. 
 Boeing delivered 270 commercial jets in 1994, compared with 330 in 1993.
Frank Shrontz, the company's chairman, said the improving performance of the airline industry must be sustained before substantial new orders for aircraft could be expected. But Mr. Shrontz said Boeing was making strategic investments in new products and businesses and manufacturing processes in anticipation of a return to long-term demand for commercial jets.
Boeing's military and space sales rose 8 percent, mostly because of the company's participation in the United States space station program.
For the year, Boeing earned $856 million, or $2.51 a share, compared with $1.24 billion, or $3.66 a share, in 1993. Revenue fell to $21.92 billion from $25.44 billion. (AP)

HEADLINE: Resales Up For Homes; '95 Dip Seen

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Despite rising mortgage rates, sales of previously owned homes rose to the second-highest level ever last year, but a real estate trade group predicted today that housing activity would slow significantly this year.
The existing-home sales rose 1.8 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.89 million from 3.82 million a month earlier, the National Association of Realtors said. 
 For the full year, sales totaled 3.97 million, up 4.3 percent from 1993's 3.80 million and second only to 3.98 million in 1978. All regions posted gains.
"Those are the best numbers we're going to see for a while," predicted John A. Tuccillo, the organization's chief economist.
The number of down payments on existing homes began dropping substantially last October, suggesting slower sales starting this quarter, the real estate group said. Contract closings often trail initial deposits by several months.
"My guess is that we'll see in February and March that something has gone haywire in the real estate industry," the association's president, Edmund G. Woods, said.
Mortgage rates rose last year from less than 7 percent in February to more than 9 percent last month. An increase from 7 percent to 9 percent would add $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage.
The Federal Reserve, which raised short-term interest rates six times last year to keep inflation in check, is to meet next week to consider whether to raise them again. Most analysts expect further rate increases then.
Prices of existing homes remained relatively stable last year. The median price was $107,700 last month, up from $107,400 a year earlier. The median is the midpoint, meaning that half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
Regionally, the West posted the biggest sales gain last year, a 7.1 percent advance, including a 2.4 percent gain in December. The median price in December was $143,600, down from $143,700 a year earlier.
The Northeast had a 4.2 percent gain in 1994, although sales in December were unchanged from November. The median price at the end of the year was $134,700, down from $137,000 in December 1993.
In the South, sales rose 3.7 percent last year, including a 9 percent jump in December. The median price was $92,400, down from $95,700 a year earlier.
Sales were up 3.1 percent in the Midwest, although they fell 6.4 percent in December. The December median price was $88,100, up from $85,700 at the end of 1993.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Fall Sharply As a 14-Month Rally Ebbs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper futures prices fell sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange after their failure to reach new highs prompted speculative profit taking.
Analysts said the volatile price action might indicate the market was at or near the end of a 14-month rally. 
 On other commodity markets, precious metals also weakened and lumber futures rose sharply. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities slipped 0.5 point, to 235.11
Copper for January delivery plunged 4.15 cents, to $1.403 a pound. The more active March contract sagged 3.35 cents, to $1.3835 a pound.
March deliveries matched Tuesday's intraday high of $1.427 early in the day, but failed to reach $1.429, the contract high set Jan. 19.
"There was just general disappointment we weren't able to better yesterday's highs, let alone recent contract highs," said a Paine Webber commodities analyst, Bernard Savaiko. "Profit taking set in then, and professional traders really started to lean on the market."
"I think the market's just about had it at these levels," said Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments. "It's beginning to show signs of weakness from a technical standpoint and even some fundamentals."
Among the negative fundamentals are slackening demand from China and perceptions that United States consumption will decline this year as higher interest rates slow economic growth.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said yesterday that the economy was growing too rapidly, a possible signal the Fed would soon raise interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan's comments prompted selling of precious metals, which tend to do best during periods of inflation and rapid economic expansion.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, February gold fell 90 cents, to $380.90 a troy ounce; March silver sank 4.7 cents, to 79 cents a troy ounce.
In lumber trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, spruce two-by-fours for March delivery leaped $10, the maximum daily advance permitted by the exchange, to $319.50 for 1,000 board feet.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
In the cloud of a natural disaster, some see a silver lining.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE Kobe earthquake destroyed 10,000 buildings, closed one of Japan's major harbors and broke the back of the transportation system. Look on the bright side, though. The monumental effort of reconstruction will help to power the sluggish Japanese economy from its worst recession in decades.
Sound familiar? You've heard it before -- and often from practitioners of what is called the dismal science. But don't take it too seriously. For, as any introductory textbook in economics will confirm, this quarter-truth drawn from the ideas of John Maynard Keynes begs to be qualified. And who better to do the qualifying than Paul Samuelson, author of the first economics textbook to bring the ideas of Keynes into the mainstream? 
 The core notion here, closely linked to what veterans of Econ 101 will remember as "the paradox of thrift," is simple. If people and factories are underemployed, the repairs after a disaster create income from resources that would otherwise have been idle. "Hurricanes make work for glaziers," Mr. Samuelson allows.
Actually, the consequences may prove even more serendipitous. When a homeowner digs into his savings (or insurance money) to replace the broken windows, the glazier is paid. And when the glazier spends the money on a new car, the incomes of auto workers go up. And so forth. This "multiplier effect" adds a little or a lot to the initial jolt of stimulus, depending on how much leaks out in the form of savings and taxes from each round of spending.
Governments can work the same miracle by putting money in people's pockets. Keynes facetiously suggested burying 100 notes in abandoned mines, thereby invigorating the moribund British mining industry. Hitler offered a different means to the same end: rapid rearmament, which made the Third Reich an island of prosperity in Depression-bound Europe.
What worked for Hitler also worked for F.D.R. "The true cost of the battleship Missouri was negative," Mr. Samuelson concludes, since the military buildup did not divert resources that would have been used to add value elsewhere in the economy.
Look closely, and you will see this Keynesian version of the free lunch popping up in the oddest places. Trade protectionists are gung-ho to create jobs and profits for American companies by making it harder for foreigners to sell their goods here. The idea is so powerful that it dominates the rhetoric of free traders, too. During the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement the White House talked endlessly of the jobs that would be generated by stimulating exports, and nary a word on how cheap imports from Mexico would bless American consumers.
Perhaps the trendiest variation on the theme comes from environmentalists. Don't think of the cost of recycling packaging materials or switching to eco-friendly fuels, Vice President Al Gore suggests; marvel at all those terrific high-paying jobs that will be created along the way.
How, then, can those without degrees from Harvard or Kennesaw State separate the cloud from the silver lining? Disasters can only do more good than harm, Mr. Samuelson argues, if a nation "has been experiencing bad macroeconomic luck or policies."
The Kobe earthquake fits the description since Japan has been wallowing in recession for years. So did Hurricane Andrew, which led Washington and the nation's insurers to pump billions of dollars into Florida when the construction industry was running at half-speed. But the North American trade accord presumably does not. Nor do power-plant scrubbers or space stations or antimissile defenses -- all of which drain resources from other productive activities when the economy is booming.
Put it another way. Suppose the new GATT world trade agreement does create a million jobs, as proponents trumpeted. If the American economy is already running near full employment, the Federal Reserve is pledged to destroy a million jobs by tightening credit. The alternative would be unacceptable inflation.
What makes the disasters-equal-jobs equation yet more problematic is that rebuilding property or manufacturing weapons is never the ideal way to stimulate an economy. For one thing, the specialized demand is bound to create production bottlenecks. Japan, presumably, will soon find itself with too few bulldozers to clear the rubble and too many factories producing cars that can't be driven on Kobe's streets.
More to the point, disaster relief adds to national output only when other policies to promote full employment have failed. In the case of Japan, bureaucrats in the Ministry of Finance have been sucking their thumbs for three years waiting for the recession to go away. "In my book," Mr. Samuelson says, "the Japanese economy is the worst managed in the world."

HEADLINE: Defense for Simpson Attacking Prosecutors' 'Rush to Judgment'

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson began their attempt today to convince jurors that he is not a murderer but the victim of a sloppy police investigation and a rush to judgment by overzealous prosecutors.
In the first three hours of his opening statement, Mr. Simpson's chief lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., described his client as a flawed but reformed husband, a conscientious father, a public-spirited citizen. He said the case against Mr. Simpson was precisely what the opposing lawyers said it was not: character assassination and a tabloid prosecution. 
 "This case is about a rush to judgment, an obsession to win at any cost and by any means necessary," he said. The prosecution, he continued, "talks about a trail of blood, where there is no trail."
"There are trails that lead toward innocence," Mr. Cochran said, "and they were not pursued."
Mr. Cochran said he would introduce two witnesses who either saw suspicious people on the street around the time of the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman or heard Mrs. Simpson shouting at an unidentified man after the time prosecutors say the killings occurred and only moments before Mr. Simpson was seen at his own home. He said the police had failed to interview these witnesses.
He also said that blood found under Mrs. Simpson's fingernails and on her thigh matched neither Mr. Simpson's blood nor that of Mr. Goldman and that blood found on her back had never been analyzed. Fingerprints, palm prints and shoe prints found on objects at the scene of the slaying, he said, were not Mr. Simpson's.
And Mr. Cochran hinted darkly at serious police misconduct, specifically that samples of Mr. Simpson's blood disappeared and then were used to fabricate evidence. "It seems to me that the fact that blood mysteriously appears on vital pieces of evidence and it's predicted what the results will be regarding DNA when that evidence is still in the police lab is devastating evidence of something far more sinister."
At the end of the day, prosecutors struck back, complaining bitterly that they had been ambushed by new material today, like the witness who was near Mrs. Simpson's house on the night of the slayings. They said the material should have turned over beforehand, and they demanded that Judge Ito address the issue. The judge scheduled a hearing for Thursday.
One highlight today, the second day of opening arguments, came when Mr. Simpson hobbled over to the jury box, pulled up the left leg of his pants and unveiled his knee. After summoning Mr. Simpson, Mr. Cochran told the jurors in the back row to feel free to stand up and then proceeded to give a guided tour of Mr. Simpson's battered knee, the legacy of a career on the gridiron. "There are scars going up and down and sideways," he said of what the incisions of four operations had left.
Mr. Cochran then discussed the consequences. He said Mr. Simpson was the only person authorized to use a golf cart at Pebble Beach because he could not walk 18 holes. He clearly implied that such a person could not have run in and out of a crime scene like a gazelle.
Moments earlier, Mr. Cochran described the chronic rheumatoid arthritis that afflicts Mr. Simpson's wrists. In stating that Mr. Simpson could not shuffle cards during a game of gin rummy on June 12, he implied just as forcefully that he could not have wielded a knife.
"He was perhaps the greatest running back in the history of the N.F.L., but you pay a price," Mr. Cochran said. "What no defense in the National Football League could do, mother nature and father time have taken their toll."
Mr. Cochran's presentation, largely low-key and conversational, occasionally impassioned, often disjointed, had not ended when court adjourned. He promised to conclude on Thursday with an examination of the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab, which he called "a cesspool of contamination."
Among the other points he made were: Tire tracks found at Mrs. Simpson's home did not come from Mr. Simpson's Ford Bronco. None of the hairs on the glove found there were Mr. Simpson's, while a hair on the ski cap came from someone else, according to the prosecution's own forensic tests. The blood samples cited by the prosecution in its opening statements on Tuesday were collected haphazardly and were "either old or degraded or contaminated by the people who collected them and tested them." The prosecutors, Mr. Cochran said, mentioned only five drops out of "thousands and thousands" that were found at the scene.
Given the amount of blood involved, Mr. Cochran said, what was remarkable about Mr. Simpson's Bronco was that it contained so little blood, not so much. Mr. Simpson has told the police that the blood in the car had come from a cut he suffered earlier that day. Evidence suggested, Mr. Cochran also said, that Mr. Goldman had put up a valiant struggle before he was murdered, yet photographs of Mr. Simpson taken after his arrest showed no bruises anywhere.
At one point Mr. Cochran produced a mystery envelope, thought to contain a knife Mr. Simpson bought several weeks before the killings but which, defense lawyers will argue, he never used. Prosecutors objected and the envelope was never opened, but afterward, another lawyer for Mr. Simpson, Robert L. Shapiro, said the contents of the package would prove that the police department was incompetent because they were overlooked during two police searches.
"In an effort to find any evidence not to exclude but to include Mr. Simpson, they searched everywhere in the area of Los Angeles. They searched Chicago; they searched everywhere they possibly could think," Mr. Cochran said. "They could not find the weapon or any clothes because Mr. Simpson, the evidence will show, did not have one."
What the authorities found, Mr. Cochran charged, they mishandled, using "covered wagon" methodology to handle "21st century cyberspace technology." Only once did he approvingly mention Irwin Golden, the deputy medical examiner: in recounting Dr. Golden's prior testimony that two knives might have been used for the killings. Otherwise, he faulted Dr. Golden for a multitude of sins, failing to analyze the contents of her stomach, appearing late at the crime scene, mixing and thereby contaminating evidence.
Just about the first person Mr. Cochran mentioned by name, after Martin Luther King, Lincoln, and Cicero, was Mark Fuhrman, the police detective who inspected the crime scene and later found a blood-stained glove at Mr. Simpson's estate that matched one found at Mrs. Simpson's condominium in Brentwood, and who, the defense contends, is a racist. The prosecution was hiding Mr. Fuhrman, Mr. Cochran charged, but the defense would smoke him out.
Turning to his suggestion about other suspects, Mr. Cochran said a couple on a blind date passed Mrs. Simpson's apartment at 10:25 P.M. the night of the murders and saw nothing amiss. Another woman, who was turned away when she called the police to report that she had spotted four men walking near Mrs. Simpson's condominium around the time of the killing, wearing ski caps and carrying something in their hands, then speeding away.
Those four men, two Hispanic and two whites, may have followed Ron Goldman there, Mr. Cochran speculated. But, he said, when the woman called the police after the killings to report what she had seen, she was told "we've got that case all wrapped up." She then called the District Attorney, whose operator said she was too busy talking to a psychic to speak with her.
"They didn't want to listen, because they had made their decision in this rush to judgment," he said. He hinted at additional evidence to come, including a bloody knife found by a bystander.
Repeatedly, Mr. Cochran said prosecutors had withheld facts and names from the defense because they did not fit into their theory -- a theory, he scoffed, whose central time line was built around the plaintive howls of a dog to prove the killings took place around 10:15 P.M. "They have to keep everything squashed in there," he voice rising in indignation. "You're going to see there there was no time to commit this crime."
Television coverage of the trial was given a reprieve early in the day, after Judge Ito exacted abject apologies from those responsible for inadvertently showing a glimpse of an alternate juror on Tuesday night. The judge threatened to pull the plug on the cameras but decided in effect to order that the camera be nailed down, that is, be limited to a single wide-angle courtroom shot, until certain modifications were made. Even that did not entirely allay his fears, however; concerned that jurors' reflections could be seen in plexiglass, he ordered it had it covered with hair spray.
Mr. Simpson's lawyers also began the even more formidable task of rehabilitating their client, who Mr. Cochran called "the living embodiment of the American dream."
Throughout the day, two huge photographs sat in front of the jury box: one showed Mr. Simpson, with his characteristic broad smile, hugging his daughter at the dance recital in which she performed the day of the killings; the other was taken the night before at a black-tie, $25,000-a plate Jewish charity function. With Mr. Simpson in the picture was Paula Barbieri, the model Mr. Cochran described as his client's girlfriend.
Those pictures, he said, symbolized several central points for the defense: that Mr. Simpson was a good family man, who insisted on returning from New York for his daughter's recital to atone for missing her first communion; that he was in a good mood that night, and not glaring at Mrs. Simpson menacingly, as prosecutors say; that he was reconciled to the end of marriage and had moved on to someone else, and that he was a public-spirited man, too busy being good to do bad.
Mr. Cochran talked of Mr. Simpson's "circle of benevolence" and what he called his "philanthropic largess." So often was Mr. Simpson out of town for charity affairs or shooting films and playing in Bryant Gumbel's golf tournament, Mr. Cochran said, that he could not have stalked anyone. Those instances where Mr. Simpson showed up where Mrs. Simpson already was, he said, were mere coincidences.
Mr. Cochran took issue with prosecution assertions that Mr. Simpson turned his wife into a Barbie doll, stressing that when he bestowed gifts upon her, like apartments in San Francisco and Laguna Beach, "there were no strings attached." He said Mr. Simpson was a good provider, giving Mrs. Simpson $4,000 a month for food. Far from keeping her unemployed, as prosecutors have said, he encouraged her to pursue a career as a decorator, finding her work and paying her to redecorate their own home.
In other respects, his account of Mrs. Simpson was more equivocal. He described an incident in which Mrs. Simpson slapped a maid and mentioned pointedly how she and her circle of friends went out dancing until 3, 4, 5 in the morning. "Nobody was controlling these women," he said. He also said it was Mrs. Simpson, not his client, who pushed for a marital reconciliation.
For the most part Mr. Cochran, wearing a blue suit and red tie and a two-toned handkerchief to match, spoke quietly to jurors, without flourishes for which he is known. At times he grew more intimate, clasping his hands and leaning over the lectern.
The jurors, wearing tags containing numbers and bar codes, watched intently but without emotion. A few took notes in pads the court had provided; one sipped Evian water.
Several pitches seemed aimed at the overwhelmingly black jury. Mr. Cochran quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and noted Mr. Simpson's rise from a poor and "spindly-legged youth" with rickets to a man "able to amass some assets."
Mr. Simpson bought a house for his aged mother, he added, pointing to the dignified elderly woman in a wheelchair sitting in the gallery. He also noted that every year Mr. Simpson anonymously donated $5,000 to a charity for inner city black youth, and that he continued to buy uniforms for children in in Potrero Hills, the poor neighborhood in San Francisco in which he was reared.
"This is the man," he said. "He became rich and famous, but he didn't forget."

HEADLINE: Aid to Mexico and Immigration Are Linked

 BODY:
In an effort to generate support for a package to aid Mexico in its economic crisis after the devaluation of the peso, top Administration officials said they had asked Mexico to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing into the United States and control its economic policy strictly. 
 But after more than four hours of hearings by the House Banking Committee, not a single member, regardless of party, expressed support for the $40 billion in loan guarantees in the Administration package.

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN GIVES STRONG IMPRESSION RATES WILL CLIMB

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Giving the strong impression that the Federal Reserve has not yet finished raising short-term interest rates, Alan Greenspan told Congress today that several harbingers of revived inflation required the Fed to remain "vigilant."
In an appearance before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, avoided direct comment on the central bank's policy-making meeting next week, where Federal Reserve officials have long been expected to vote to raise interest rates again. At the same time, Mr. Greenspan said nothing to disabuse Wall Street of that notion. In comments that echoed those of other Federal Reserve officials in recent days, he clearly implied that the economy remained too robust to count higher inflation out. 
 Tightness in the labor market and other strains on the economy could "lead to some deterioration in the price picture in the near term," Mr. Greenspan said, "but any such deterioration should be contained if the Federal Reserve remains vigilant."
Still, the financial markets saw glimmers of hope in his testimony that next week's expected increase could be the last for a while. Stock and bond prices rose.
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last February in its effort to prevent what it views as a runaway economic expansion in excess of 4 percent annual growth from causing prices to accelerate. By gradually raising rates, the central bank hopes to squeeze consumer and business borrowing enough to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace of roughly 2.5 percent.
But the danger -- which economists at the Chrysler Corporation and other industrial companies are increasingly worried about -- is that the Federal Reserve may be overreacting and could topple the economy into another recession by tightening its monetary grip too much.
Even though inflation has been running at less than 3 percent for three straight years -- the best record since the early 1960's -- the Federal Reserve is worried that the economy has been too strong recently for its own good.
"I see it as crucial that we extend the recent trend of low and, hopefully, declining inflation in the years ahead," Mr. Greenspan added. While the prospects are "fundamentally good," there are grounds for "some concern." Mr. Greenspan cited, for example, the fact that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.4 percent, in contrast to that of the late 1980's "when wages and prices accelerated appreciably." While consumer prices and the prices of goods going out the factory door have barely budged, he said, the costs of parts and supplies at earlier stages of production were starting to accelerate.
Mr. Greenspan also used the occasion to lecture Congress about the risks of widening the Federal budget gap. With both Republicans and Democrats proposing tax cuts this year, Mr. Greenspan contended in response to questions that the budget deficit was the nation's No. 1 economic problem. He urged lawmakers not to make it worse, insisting that any revenue loss should be minimal and, in any case, should be made up by equal or greater spending cuts.
"We're going to have chronic fiscal problems if we don't cut spending," Mr. Greenspan said, declaring tax cuts to be of low priority and best accomplished by lowering tax rates. By contrast, the current proposals, from both Republicans and from President Clinton, rely primarily on tax credits that would do nothing to lower rates in ways that might provide greater incentives for work and savings.
Mr. Greenspan also said he was "a little chagrined" that the findings of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform were not taken more seriously. The 32-member commission, headed by Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, found that spending on Social Security and other Federal benefit programs were rising at unsustainable rates. But the commission disbanded at year's end after failing to agree on a remedy it could recommend to the President.
Mr. Greenspan said much of the so-called inflation premium in rates on long-term bonds would simply evaporate if action were taken on this front and would result in lower interest rates.
Returning to a theme he expounded earlier this month, to the delight of Republicans looking to free up money for tax cuts, Mr. Greenspan said that the deficit could be narrowed simply by eliminating the bias in the Consumer Price Index that causes overpayment of entitlement benefits and an excessive inflation adjustment in tax rates.
Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed believed the index overstated inflation from 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points, recommended today that Congress specify a commitment to maintain the purchasing power of retirees while eliminating the bias that overpays them.
Mr. Greenspan also recommended that the retirement age be moved back to reflect changes in life expectancy.
In commenting on the risks of inflation, Mr. Greenspan pointed out that more companies were buying materials in advance because they thought they might become more expensive or in short supply. Reports of worker shortages have become "more common," he said. These are all signs pointing to the prospect of greater price increases.
On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan said, "trends in money and credit expansion have remained subdued" and have not yet become the financial tinder needed to kindle higher inflation.
Committee members made little effort to dissuade the Fed from pushing rates up again despite pleas from auto makers and some other industries that the cumulative restraint -- much of which has yet to be fully felt -- could prove too much.
An exception was Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, who said that higher rates would make it even harder for Mexico to resolve its financial crisis. Mr. Greenspan responded by saying that Mexico would benefit from the Fed's proper focus, the long-term growth of the United States economy.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Proposal Beyond Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today began debating a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, one of the most profound measures to come before Congress in years. Set aside the claims and counterclaims about Democrats being profligate and Republicans wanting to destroy Social Security and bankrupt the states. Those are political side issues.
What is really at stake is a fundamental and ostensibly permanent change in the way the American Government works. Powerful arguments can be made for and against such a change. Here is an examination of three of the strongest arguments for such a constitutional amendment and the way opponents are rebutting them. 
 As a matter of principle, the Government should have to live within its means just as states and cities and families do.
Until relatively recently, this was the dominant view of American fiscal policy. Except during wartime, large Federal deficits -- the difference between what the Government spends and what it receives in taxes and other revenues -- were out of the question. Proponents of the amendment often cite this quotation from Harry S. Truman: "There is nothing sacred about the pay-as-you-go idea so far as I am concerned except that it represents the soundest principle of financing that I know."
Most economists agree that the huge deficits the Government began running in the 1980's are dangerous to the future. Charles L. Schultze of the Brookings Institution compares the deficits to termites gnawing at the foundation of a building. Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard says the country is consuming its seed corn.
James M. Buchanan of George Mason University, winner of the 1987 Nobel Prize in economics, told Congress a few years ago that the country had "lost the moral sense of fiscal responsibility."
But many who feel most strongly about the need to reduce the deficit do not favor requiring that revenues match expenditures every year. "There is nothing magic about a balanced budget," Mr. Friedman said.
Ideally, they say, the budget would be in surplus in good times, and run manageable deficits when the economy was in recession.
In fact, states and cities and families do not always balance their budgets. State and local governments issue bonds to finance projects like turnpikes or sewer systems. Families take out mortgages on their homes and loans to pay college tuition. No one considers that financially irresponsible. And no one, opponents of the amendment say, should consider it wrong for the Federal Government to go into debt periodically to make the country better for the next generation.
But the Federal Government is like a family that borrows heavily to finance vacations each year. The Government's debt has increased at a faster rate than its income year after year after year. If a state or a family did that, it would be in trouble, too.
Without the discipline of a constitutional amendment, politicians will never take the steps necessary to reduce the deficit.
The deficit, forecast to be $176 billion this year, has fallen for the last three years because of the strong economy and because of deficit reduction measures enacted in 1990 and 1993. But primarily because of the rising cost of health programs, it will resume shooting up next year, unless new steps are taken, until it reaches a whopping $322 billion in 2002, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office.
The problem is that the deficit cannot be reduced substantially simply by eliminating wasteful programs and cracking down on welfare cheats, as some conservatives seem to think, or by raising taxes on the wealthy and slashing spending at the Pentagon, as some liberals apparently believe.
The only way to get the Government's finances under control is to enact measures that would be unappealing politically -- so unpopular, in fact, that they could cost the politicians who support them their jobs.
A constitutional amendment might provide these politicians the political cover they need to cast courageous votes.
The argument on the other side is that the politicians will still face the hard choices about raising taxes and cutting spending, and their votes will be no less unpopular because of a constitutional requirement.
Some opponents of the measure fear that relying on a constitutional amendment instead of political leadership could result in Federal judges making policy that elected officials should be making. That, of course, is what happened when politicians failed to desegregate schools, and judges stepped in and decided which children went to which schools.
The requirement that the budget be in balance would force the Government to set priorities.
For years, politicians have acted like hungry people in a free buffet line. Rather than decide which dishes to take, they simply pile up their plates with everything.
Under the budget laws enacted in 1990 and 1993, priorities must be addressed when new programs are considered. Taxes cannot be cut without offsetting spending cuts or tax increases. Similarly, Government benefits cannot be increased without counterbalancing measures. And discretionary spending, which includes everything from battleships to ballpoint pens, is frozen so that if spending is raised for one item, another must be cut.
But nothing requires the Government to strip programs and examine tax breaks already on the books. A balanced-budget amendment would require the President and Congress to decide between the ham and turkey and roast beef on their plates -- to review every program in the Government and decide which ones to keep and which ones to discard.
There is little incentive for politicians to do this now. They win votes by cutting ribbons and passing out favors. Few constituents vote for politicians who specifically take something away from them.
The other side of this argument is that a constitutional amendment would not relieve the pressure on politicians to respond to their constituents. So instead of doing it by spending money or granting tax deductions, they might adopt less obvious measures. They could impose or withdraw regulations, place new requirements on states or businesses, set up quasi-government authorities to borrow money or find other means to satisfy voters that are less visible, less efficient and less controllable than writing checks.

HEADLINE: Gore Rules Against Merger of A.I.D. and Others Into State Dept.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Administration has rejected proposals by the State Department to consolidate three major independent agencies under the department's authority, senior Administration officials said today.
Vice President Al Gore made the decision not to consolidate the three -- the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- after asking the State Department three weeks ago to come up with suggestions for streamlining the foreign-policy apparatus. 
 But the issue remains open because several prominent Republicans in Congress have urged eliminating A.I.D. and the arms control agency.
The White House decided against merging the agencies into the State Department because they are already trying to cut staff and costs and a new consolidation would impede such efforts. "It's important to finish the restructuring task inside each agency," said one senior Administration official.
According to one official, Mr. Gore decided against consolidation because, with so much on the Administration's foreign policy agenda, there was concern that such a move would set off jurisdictional battles between the agencies' personnel and the State Department.
Officials from all three agencies had put up a fight to remain independent, saying consolidation would be time-consuming and would make it harder for the Government to carry out their missions.
For example the arms control agency, which has 250 employees, was set up in 1961 to be a voice that would be free of Pentagon pressure to increase the nuclear stockpile and State Department pressure not to hurt diplomatic relations.
The Agency for International Development, which has 2,950 employees, was set up the same year to concentrate on long-term development strategies while the State Department focused on shorter-term diplomatic concerns.
Mr. Gore is to meet with the heads of the three agencies on Thursday to inform them of his decision not to merge them into the State Department.
Administration officials said Secretary of State Warren Christopher was neutral on the reorganization proposals, which were backed by Thomas E. Donilan, his chief of staff; Lynn E. Davis, undersecretary for international security affairs, and Timothy E. Wirth, the State Department counselor.
By some estimates, the merger would have saved more than $200 million a year. When the Administration announces its "no merger" decision, it will also announce streamlining by the agencies, several officials said.
For example, A.I.D., which has already closed 23 offices overseas and cut its staff by 10 percent, is to announce additional closings, agency officials said.
Joseph D. Duffey, director of the United States Information Agency, said in an interview tonight that merging his 8,300-employee agency into the State Department would have complicated his streamlining efforts. He has eliminated most of the agency's magazines and traveling exhibits, and has merged many of its overseas libraries and commercial reference centers.
"We have already made many shifts and changes, and we feel we're still in the process," Mr. Duffey said.

So there was a ghoulish curiosity in the crowd that gathered outside the High Court of Malawi the other day, hoping to see the fallen ruler and his confederates endure that humbling ritual of accused celebrities, the perp walk. 
 "Kamuzu, you have killed our sons!" some chanted, and a few yelled for blood. But most stood quietly, eager to see if this man who once held them in thrall would look any different now that he had been cut to mortal size.
Eight months after he conceded defeat in an election that was forced upon him, Dr. Banda has been charged with ordering the murder of four top officials of his own Government. The men were rounded up by the police and clubbed to death with hammers and crowbars.
The 12-year-old crime, its grisly details itemized in 1,000 pages of testimony, has absorbed this little sliver of southeast Africa, a country that prides itself on being a pocket of gentleness in a cruel continent.
Even more than the elections last May, the case has become a rite of passage from the rule of one man's whim to the rule of laws.
"We're not wanting vengeance in this matter," said President Bakili Muluzi, who defeated Dr. Banda. "We're not even wanting to use it as a political issue. But according to the laws of Malawi, you kill, you are tried."
Echoing some of the gawkers outside the courthouse, he added, "We must put the record right and make sure that nobody in my position, today, tomorrow, would ever commit atrocities like that and get away with it."
In his mid-90's and reportedly given to depression and lapses of memory, Dr. Banda lives under luxurious house arrest and faces the possibility of being hanged if he survives the year or more his murder trial is expected to take. His lawyer, Lovemore Munlo, describes Dr. Banda as being "in terrible shape."
So far, Mr. Munlo has gotten his client excused from appearing in court.
Dr. Banda (he earned a medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Tennessee) led the protests that won independence from Britain in 1964. Within two years he had consolidated all power in his own hands.
The Victorian peculiarity of his rule -- he dressed formally in homburg hats and ordered long-haired male tourists shorn at the airport -- made him seem more comical than brutal. Even now many Malawians revere Dr. Banda as the father of their country, and blame any cruelties committed during his rule on his despised right-hand man, John Tembo, who also faces charges in the case.
But the murder accusation, compiled by an independent commission created by Mr. Muluzi, has badly battered Dr. Banda's lingering reputation as a strict but well-intentioned patriarch.
The commission found that in 1983 four men whose loyalty Dr. Banda had questioned -- three Cabinet ministers and a member of Parliament -- were arrested at police roadblocks, blindfolded, taken to a forest outside Blantyre and killed.
"I was the one who had the hammer and I hit him at the back of the head, where I knew, according to my police training, he would die immediately," said one policeman whose testimony filled pages of a local newspaper.
The police packed the bodies into a blue Peugeot and rolled it over a cliff, and later presented the deaths to the country as an accident.
The commission had only circumstantial evidence that Dr. Banda and Mr. Tembo ordered the men killed. The police official to whom Dr. Banda supposedly gave the command later died, although his wife and deputy say he told them about his instructions.
But Robert Mzikamanda, who was secretary of the investigating commission, said there was "debate, but no doubt" about Dr. Banda's role. Within days of receiving the report, the chief prosecutor ordered the former President and three others arrested.
Dr. Banda's lawyer, Mr. Munlo, says the police must have acted on their own. The murder case, he argues, is a vengeful circus intended to distract public attention from the economic misery that has conspicuously worsened since Dr. Banda lost power.
"There is an enthusiasm to punish Dr. Banda," the lawyer said.
It is true that President Muluzi could use a timely reminder of how bad things used to be, since many of his people are already muttering that life was better under Dr. Banda.
Since the elections, the currency has lost more than half its value. The inflation rate is over 40 percent. Foreign aid, which keeps the Government afloat, is threatened by Republican control of the United States Congress and by competition from the more glamorous new democracy in nearby South Africa.
The Government is also under pressure from others who lost husbands and fathers to search the past to its depths.
Vera Chirwa, a human rights lawyer, contends that thousands died mysteriously. She and her husband, Orton Chirwa, spent 11 years in prison, much of the time manacled hand and foot in solitary confinement. Her husband died in custody in 1992.
"It's not enough," she says of the current murder case. "My children would like to know, how did their daddy die?"
But in an interview at the hilltop palace he inherited, Mr. Muluzi said his country cannot afford a witch hunt, even if it wanted one.
Investigating the one case, he said, has already cost his impoverished Government $250,000. In addition, courts have made huge compensation awards to victims of the past Government, which Mr. Muluzi calls forcing the new democracy to "pay for Banda's sins."

HEADLINE: Trying to Help Aid Plan, U.S. Asks Mexico for Border Crackdown

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In an effort to overcome Congressional opposition to a proposed emergency aid package for Mexico, top Clinton Administration officials said today that they had asked Mexico to help prevent illegal aliens from crossing into the United States and to place strict controls on its economic policy.
The proposed conditions for the bailout package would effectively give the United States enormous influence in how Mexico deployed its police along the countries' border, battled narcotics and managed its economy. 
 But in the more than four hours of Congressional hearings on the package today, not a single member of the House Banking Committee, Democrat or Republican, expressed support for a $40 billion set of loan guarantees -- in which the United States would essentially co-sign a loan to the country -- and several members vowed to defeat it.
By the end of the day, Republican leaders who earlier had predicted quick approval of the package, probably by the end of this week, were saying that it would take far longer to negotiate and that the outcome was in doubt.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, complained that the White House had failed to rally its own party around the deal and said that despite his support for the plan, Republicans would not engineer its passage alone.
"Unless there is some help on the other side of the aisle, forget it," Mr. Dole said. "It is not going to happen."
In the most explicit description yet of the conditions that would surround a loan guarantee, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that Mexican leaders had agreed "in principle" to turn over to the United States all of their country's earnings from foreign oil sales if Mexico defaulted on American-guaranteed loans.
The loans would be intended to restore investors' confidence in Mexico and enable it to borrow money again on world financial markets after last month's devaluation of the peso. The devaluations were caused by Mexico's overborrowing of short-term funds and printing too much money.
Even while the Clinton Administration's promise of tough conditions was appearing to win few converts on Capitol Hill, it remained unclear how Mexico would react to the escalating list of political and economic conditions tied to any loan. Opponents of the Government in Mexico City have already criticized plans to tie repayment of any loans to the state-run oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, and the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has repeatedly said that it would accept no conditions that compromised Mexican independence.
Asked about objections in Mexico, a senior Clinton Administration official said today, "The fact is, they don't have a lot of bargaining chips."
At today's hearing Mr. Rubin, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, fielded heated questions about the proposed rescue and warned again that the United States had little choice but to come to Mexico's rescue.
If Congress fails to act, Mr. Christopher said, "America's prosperity and security will be put at risk" as the financial crisis spreads around the world.
Later, in an interview, Mr. Rubin predicted that if the package was not approved quickly, there could be "a catalytic impact around the world" as investors pulled billions of dollars out of other emerging markets that have followed Mexico's formula of economic reform.
"This creates the possibility of less capital," Mr. Rubin said, "and social and political troubles that could follow."
But the Administration is facing growing objections, many from members of Congress, who complain that the biggest beneficiaries of the loan guarantee will be some of the richest American and Mexican investors. Those investors bought $28 billion in the Mexican notes, or tesobonos, that the government cannot pay off since the 35 percent devaluation of the Mexican peso.
The Administration's problem is that the United States cannot bail out Mexico's economy -- and thus help preserve 700,000 American jobs that are linked to exports to Mexico -- without also saving a raft of investors both here and abroad. Those investors run the gamut from millionaires to holders of pension and mutual funds that joined the boom in investing in Mexico.
So far, the Administration's message that the stakes go far beyond bond holders has largely fallen on deaf ears on Capitol Hill.
"People don't understand it," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, "and they think it's a bailout of big guys."
Compounding the Administration's troubles is widespread confusion over what Mexico would be required to do in return for the help.
Mr. Christopher has fought to keep political conditions -- especially on illegal aliens and drugs -- out of the authorizing legislation in Congress, for fear that opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement would load the bill with more and more demands. So the Administration is pressing for a "side letter" from Mexico, in which the Zedillo Government would commit itself to crackdowns on emigration and narcotics without making that a strict condition of the loan.
Even the financial conditions are murky. There are several versions of the bill authorizing the loan guarantee, but the Administration has yet to submit a single bill for formal debate.
Today it was rushing to placate Democrats who insisted on new conditions that would require Mexico to tie wage increases to increases in productivity, a way of assuring that Mexican products -- already, thanks to the devaluation, a third cheaper in dollar terms than they were a month ago -- will not be made even cheaper.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the banking committee and supports the bailout, said today that the bill was "the most ad hoc process of development of legislation I have experienced in my public life."
Administration officials said they were walking a tightrope between satisfying Congress and preventing the insertion of conditions so onerous that they would slow Mexico's growth or lead to the spread of anti-government uprisings. Some members of Congress say that the guarantees of repayment are a sham and that the United States, for example, would hardly cut off the money Mexico earns from oil if the Mexican economy worsened.
"What we're going to do if the deal goes south is take the money they will desperately need to keep their people fed?" asked Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts. "Politically, it will never work."
Mr. Kennedy, echoing a theme heard from conservatives and liberals alike today, said: "Let the markets work it out."

HEADLINE: Leader Calls Essex County Debt-Riddled

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The new Essex County Executive warned today that the county was facing a deficit of $161.5 million, or nearly one-third of its operating budget, accusing his predecessors of mismanaging the books so badly that he had been left with a pile of unpaid debts.
The County Executive, James W. Treffinger, a Republican who won office by painting the county government as corrupted by decades of Democratic rule, vowed that he would not raise taxes to make up for the deficit. He said he would try to close it by selling assets, controlling spending and, if necessary, laying off some of the county's 6,000 workers. 
 He also said he would consider transferring some of the county's responsibilities to municipalities, a proposal that was quickly criticized by some local officials.
"This is the worst fiscal crisis ever to befall a county in New Jersey's history," Mr. Treffinger said at a news conference this morning at the Essex County Hall of Records. "If this county fails to take the necessary steps to completely downsize, overhaul, cut and turn around the county's operations, then financial disaster will be the price of such failure."
[Many of New Jersey's local officials reacted with dismay today at their first glimpse at how much state aid they can expect under Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's 1996 budget. Article, page B6.]
Mr. Treffinger's report on the deficit capped off a year of disarray in Essex County, New Jersey's largest. Last February, the previous county executive, Thomas J. D'Alessio, a Democrat, was convicted on Federal extortion charges just as he was putting together the 1994 budget.
Donald Biase, the county administrator, served as acting county executive, but for much of the year the government appeared rudderless. The 1994 budget was not adopted until August for a fiscal year that had begun in January.
The budget practices criticized by Mr. Treffinger had already caught the attention of Wall Street. Moody's Investors Service, a leading bond-rating firm, downgraded the county's bonds from A1 to A last month, saying that county officials had not shown proper fiscal discipline and had allowed debt to increase at too great a pace. A lower rating generally means that a bond issuer must pay higher interest.
The report today infuriated some Democrats on the county's governing body, the Board of Freeholders, who charged that Mr. Treffinger had rounded up any possible financial liabilities that the county might have and crammed them all into the 1995 budget in an attempt to smear the Democrats.
The Freeholder president, Joseph DiVincenzo, said he was so disgusted by Mr. Treffinger's move that he had decided to call for the abolition of the county executive form of government, which has existed here since the late 1970's. Mr. DiVincenzo agreed that the fiscal crisis was serious, but he also maintained that every new county executive plays with the statistics in an effort to lay the blame on his predecessors.
"Every time this happens, two years into the new administration, there is a miraculous turnaround and the new administration claims they have created a budget surplus," Mr. DiVincenzo said.
Mr. Treffinger said the 1995 deficit had ballooned to $161.5 million because he had been forced to come up with money for bills that Democratic officials, he contended, had repeatedly put off paying. That spending included millions of dollars in contributions to litigation and worker's compensation funds, he said. The 1995 deficit also includes a $35.5 million shortfall left from 1994.
Mr. Treffinger said state regulators had given him more time to write the 1995 budget. He said he hoped to submit it by March 1.
Responding to the Democratic attacks, Mr. Treffinger denied that he had manipulated the budget figures.
"The numbers speak for themselves," he said. "For the first time we have described the real cost of running this government. For the first time, we don't have a smoke-and-mirrors budget."
Mr. Treffinger met with Moody's officials on Tuesday in New York City to assure them that he was taking strong steps to rein in spending. Paul Devine, a vice president at Moody's, said Mr. Treffinger was correct in laying out all the county's liabilities in the 1995 budget, instead of spreading them out over a series of budgets or hiding them.
"It's important to note that some of these things might be a liability over the next year, but not on a continuing basis," Mr. Devine said. "But we liked the fact that they are willing to put everything on the table and look at all the issues they have to address."
Mr. Devine noted that the county's bond rating was downgraded not only because of its budget difficulties, but also because the county is becoming increasingly urbanized, a change reflected in more poverty and unemployment, along with higher costs for social services.
Essex County has nearly 800,000 residents, and includes low-income urban areas like Newark and East Orange, as well as wealthy suburbs like Montclair and Short Hills.
At his news conference today, Mr. Treffinger likened the county's fiscal crisis to that in Orange County, Calif., a comparison that some fiscal experts said was overstated. But Mr. Treffinger said that if he were to rely only on new property taxes to meet the budget gap, there would have to be a 62 percent tax increase. That, he said, he would not do.
"Raising taxes has not solved the problem," he said. "It has only exacerbated the problems in Essex and enhanced a governmental culture of tax, spend and borrow."
Glenn Grant, the Business Administrator of Newark, the largest municipality in the county, called the county's budget gap "devastating." He said Mayor Sharpe James was open to meeting with county officials to discuss how Newark could help. Yet he cautioned that the city already handled enough of the county's responsibilities.
"Our Mayor has said we want to work with the new County Executive," he said. "But I can't allow Newark taxpayers to bear an unfair burden for the county's failure to run a good operation, to keep their fiscal house in order."

HEADLINE: Prof. Edward Shils, 84, Is Dead; Researcher on Intellectuals' Role

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Prof. Edward Shils, a theoretical sociologist noted for his research on the role of intellectuals in the formation of public policy and the exercise of power, died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 84.
The cause was cancer, according to the University of Chicago, where he held the title of distinguished service professor. 
 One of the most sought-after experts in his field, Professor Shils was esteemed for his erudition and the breadth of his interests. His ties with the University of Chicago went back more than five decades, and he had continued to write and travel and meet with students until just weeks ago.
Professor Shils taught sociology, social philosophy, English literature, the history of Chinese science and many other subjects that reflected his grasp of various cultures and fields.
He spent part of the year in England, where he was associated with the University of London, Kings College and Peterhouse at Cambridge University, and the London School of Economics. Over the years he had lectured at various European universities.
He was the editor of Minerva, a quarterly that is circulated internationally as a "review of the social, administrative, political and economic problems of science and scholarship." He founded the journal, published in London, in 1962. It was named for the Roman goddess of wisdom, invention and technical prowess, and its influence belies its modest circulation of about 800.
In 1979, at the invitation of the National Council on the Humanities, Professor Shils became the eighth person to deliver the annual Jefferson Lecture, the highest national distinction for scholarly achievement.
He also received the Balzan Prize, awarded by an Italian foundation for fields without Nobel Prizes. In presenting Professor Shils the 1983 prize, the foundation cited him for combining the empiricism of American sociology with the theoretical thinking of European sociologists, thus contributing "toward a truly universal, general sociology, as opposed to the 'French,' 'German,' and 'American' sociologies."
Born in Springfield, Mass., Professor Shils graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1931 and earned a master's degree at Cambridge in 1961. In 1933 he went to the University of Chicago as a research assistant and became an instructor and, by 1950, a professor.
As a high school student, he discovered the work of the German sociologist Max Weber, whom he continued studying and writing about throughout his career. He translated works by Weber as well as the sociologist Karl Mannheim.
Among his many publications and books was "Tradition" (University of Chicago Press, 1982). Showing the sweep of his knowledge with a wide-ranging analysis, the book's theme was that the modern tendency to exalt in the new just because it is new ran counter to basic anthropological and sociological realities.
He is survived by a son, Adam, of Chicago.

HEADLINE: Outsider Art Comes In

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SLESIN 

 BODY:
WHEN Calvin and Ruby Black settled in the California desert in the 1950's, they opened a rock and crystal shop. To attract attention to it, they carved child-size dolls from redwood and sugar pine, then costumed them and set them outside, even on the roof. These figures came to be known far and wide as the Possum Trot dolls.
Fewer than 60 dolls were ever made. But four of them now live in Gael and Michael Mendelsohn's house overlooking a golf course in Westchester County. "There's Gina, on the left, and that's Jan," Mrs. Mendelsohn said, "and then there's Muffins. I think the Blacks thought of her as their own child." 
 Mrs. Mendelsohn, who has a master's degree in folk art studies, is not without her own feelings of parental pride.
Outsider Art is on the move. For quite some time, the sculptures, carvings, paintings, dolls and masks by 20th-century artists who never had formal training have been lining the walls of pristine SoHo galleries, intriguing visitors with their colorful "canvases" (cardboard, plywood, concrete), their media (aluminum foil, discarded Masonite, house paint, rusted metal) and their raw energy.
Now, Outsider Art is coming home to roost in master bedrooms, as dining-table centerpieces, and in sedate entrance foyers from Lake Shore Drive in Chicago to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
Even though the prices of Outsider Art continue to rise at auctions, galleries and art fairs, many of the works are still affordable for first-time collectors. But fans say it's their human, down-to-earth appeal -- the visual equivalent of singing the blues -- that strikes a responsive chord. "After the hype and pretentiousness of the 80's, I feel that Outsiders manifest a return to honesty and integrity," said Marion Harris, a dealer in
Simsbury, Conn. Three years ago, she discovered Jerry W. Coker, a 58-year-old Arkansas artist who makes portraits of people he has known -- he calls them "identity masks" -- from pieces of tin and metal.
More and more people are entering the Outsider arena, following in the tracks of celebrity fans like Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Peter Gabriel, Jonathan Demme, R.E.M. and the Talking Heads.
This weekend, collectors, dealers, curators and scholars are expected to converge at the center of the outsider art tornado: the third annual Outsider Art Fair, which opens tomorrow night and continues through Sunday at the Puck Building in SoHo.
"This is an art show that's become a convention," said Sanford L. Smith, the organizer of the event, which will feature 34 dealers -- three from Europe, the rest from all over the United States.
The term "Outsider Art" may have first been used by Roger Cardinal, a British historian, in his book, "Outsider Art" (Praeger, 1972), about the work of people "innocent of pictorial influences." He was referring to the French artist Jean Dubuffet's vast collecton of art by mental hospital patents, now housed in the Musee de l'Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland. But the term "outsider" has been expanded to include all kinds of self-taught, visionary and intuitive artists.
Many of the artists that are now considered top of the line will be represented at the fair, from William L. Hawkins, an Ohio painter who died four years ago, to Minnie Evans, a North Carolinian who died in 1987, and Simon Sparrow, a painter and street evangelist who was born in 1925 in West Africa and now lives in Wisconsin.
Mr. Hawkins usually included his birthdate -- July 27, 1895 -- in his dynamic paintings, some in house-paint enamel on Masonite. Mrs. Evans's work as a gatekeeper in a North Carolina garden inspired her lush floral compositions, done with graphite, ink and crayon. Mr. Sparrow used beads, glitter and costume jewelry in his collage, which often have a religious theme.
"Much of the work breaks preconceptions of what people think self-taught art can look like," said Aarne Anton, the owner of American Primitive Gallery in New York. "The diversity of materials used and the range of personal visions continues to extend the horizons of the field." That may be because the artists, some of them preachers, often bring to their work a strong spiritual component. Many come from the rural South and from Pennsylvania; often they had led ordinary lives only to bloom as artists in old age.
The urban environment is also becoming a fertile source for younger artists. Curtis Cuffie of Manhattan is an artist represented by Art on the Edge, a nonprofit group of artists who are homeless.
"His life and his art are one," said Tina White, the group's director. Mr. Cuffie assembles his totemic sculptures on the sidewalks from discarded fabric, old cans and broken clocks.
Joseph Jacobs, the curator of paintings and sculpture at the Newark Museum, where "A World of Their Own: 20th-Century American Folk Art" opens tomorrow, said: "While the 19th-century folk artists positioned themselves within a tradition, the 19 artists selected here all work in what I call 'esthetic isolation.' And most of these artists don't think of their own work as art."
But the people who collect it certainly do. Some trust their own instincts while others are interested in what are now considered the blue-chip names in the field: "I like the more recognized artists, and when I buy I like to buy stories," said Mrs. Mendelsohn, whose collection now includes pieces by Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Sparrow, Thornton Dial, Bill Traylor, William Edmondson, Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger.
Mrs. Mendelsohn has covered windows and removed mirrors in her house to get more wall space for her collection. "These things are fun and colorful and often make me laugh," she said, adding, "And make Michael cry when he gets the bills."
Frank Maresca and his partner, Roger Ricco, of the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in SoHo, have represented Mr. Hawkins since they first saw his work 12 years ago in Columbus, Ohio.
"He was dipping his one paintbrush into cans of enamel paint and producing some of the most surprising and fresh images that I had ever seen," Mr. Maresca said.
Prices for large Hawkins paintings have gone from $3,000 to $4,000 a decade ago, Mr. Maresca said, to $30,000 to $50,000 today.
Outsider Art often elicits an emotional bond. "I call them my family," said Carmen de Lavallade, the dancer, pointing to the painted concrete busts by Vernon Burwell in the SoHo loft she shares with her husband, Geoffrey Holder, the choreographer.
In fact, letting go is sometimes hard to do. But 47 of the couple's American folk art and Outsider pieces will be sold at auction at Sotheby's on Monday.
"It's time to share them," Mr. Holder said.
Guests at Monty and Anne Hill Blanchard's traditionally decorated Upper East Side apartment often ask -- diplomatically, of course -- whether the paintings leaning against the bookcase or the sculptures standing on the Oriental rugs have been placed there only temporarily.
"Oh, no, this is how we really live," Mrs. Blanchard usually replies.
A professor of economics who is originally from Alabama, Mrs. Blanchard and her husband, an investment banker who comes from North Carolina, have collected more than 400 pieces of Outsider Art in the last decade.
Their apartment is dotted wall to wall with works by artists now considered the masters of the moment.
There's an early glass tower by Howard Finster on a 19th-century Southern sideboard in the foyer, and a red, white and blue Hawkins painting of a building in the living room. "Discrimination and Electricity," a three-dimensional piece by Thornton Dial is in the dining room; so is a bejeweled Simon Sparrow collage of a lion, which hangs above a silver tea service.
"As different as they are, they all capture us with their visual intensity," said Mrs. Blanchard.
The furniture in the living room of the small East Side duplex in which Herbert Waide Hemphill Jr., has lived since the late 1950's was long ago under the avalanche of birdhouses and paintings, weathervanes and painted signs, carved animals, skeletons and masks that fill every inch of the space.
A founder of the Museum of American Folk Art, Mr. Hemphill, 66, began with a duck decoy when he was 7. In his 60 years of collecting he has amassed about 2,000 objects, sculptures and paintings, 450 of which have been acquired by the National Museum of American Art in Washington.
"I bought things that no one else wanted or that dealers had the eye to buy but couldn't resell," he said.
Up until a few years ago, Mr. Hemphill traveled far and wide with a friend who would drive him around, taking a Southern route to the West, returning East through the Dakotas along back roads.
Arriving in a small town, Mr. Hemphill would search out the local artists. "The preacher would know, the newspaper would know, the bar would know," he said. "There were artists everywhere," he said. By all accounts, there still are.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH EDWIDGE DANTICAT;
Haitian Tales, Flatbush Scenes

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
IT was the kind of dark, cold New York winter day that sun-drenched people from the Caribbean dread. But Edwidge Danticat, a 25-year-old Haitian-American novelist who immigrated to Brooklyn a little more than a dozen years ago, would not let it dampen her spirits.
"You want some coffee, tea?" she said in a soft melodic voice, as if the liquids would warm the day. "The tea is cannelle." 
 So Ms. Danticat (her name is pronounced ed-WEEDJ dahn-tee-CAH), the author of "Breath, Eyes, Memory," her first novel, which was published by Soho Press last spring and received respectful reviews, set small flowered, ceramic cups on a coffee table. She settled into a plastic-covered velour chair in the beige-carpeted living room of her parents' attached brick home in East Flatbush and explained that the cannelles, or cinnamon sticks, had been bought just blocks away, from Haitian street vendors.
"It's wonderful," she said, pouring the steamy light brown liquid into the cup. "It's like 'infusion' tea. Haitians think of tea as a cure-all."
While much is written about the troubled, mountainous island nation, Ms. Danticat's debut novel is probably the first to chronicle the Haitian-American experience. In the last decade, the number of Haitian-Americans has grown to more than a million; their communities are centered in New York and Miami.
The book is about four generations of Haitian women who struggle to overcome poverty, powerlessness and abuse. The story is told through the point of view of Sophie Caco, a teen-ager who, after spending years with her aunt in rural Haiti, is reunited with her mother in Brooklyn. Sophie feels compelled to return to Haiti after she learns that her birth resulted from her mother's rape there.
Critics have praised Ms. Danticat's vivid sense of place and her images of fear and pain, which have been compared to Alice Walker's.
The New York Times Book Review said the book "achieves an emotional complexity that lifts it out of the realm of the potboiler and into that of poetry."
Ms. Danticat has dared to probe into some of the most painful and hidden Haitian traditions, including "testing," a mostly rural practice in which a mother inserts her fingers in her daughter's vagina to ascertain that she is still a virgin.
"Haitian men, they insist that their women are virgins and have their 10 fingers," Sophie's aunt says after Sophie is tested, explaining to her the virtues of virginity and the reasons for testing.
Sitting in her living room, Ms. Danticat said that among Haitian-American women, "there is a great deal of rage toward the book." At readings across the country, she said, some of the strongest opposition comes from middle-class Haitian-American women who consider themselves modern and liberated. They are ashamed of things like testing, she said, and some, raised in cities, are shocked to learn that it is exists.
"I think a lot of people see Haiti as the good guys against the bad guys," she said. "It is so much more complex than that."
Ms. Danticat insisted that the story is not about herself, although she too was raised for several years by an aunt in Port-au-Prince after her parents -- her father, Andre, is a cabdriver, and her mother, Rose, is a factory worker -- left for Brooklyn in search of a new and better life. She said the most autobiographical aspect of the book is the heroine's emotional reaction to coming to America. Like Sophie, Ms. Danticat said it left her feeling severed from her roots.
"The first time was when my mother left, when I was 4," Ms. Danticat said. "I remember vividly being yanked from her as she was getting on the plane. The second time was coming here. My uncle had a laryngectomy. At that time I was the only person who could read his lips and understand what he was saying. Without me he would have had no voice."
Ms. Danticat began working on what became her first novel soon after she arrived in Brooklyn, in 1981. Taunted at school for her Creole lilt and her not-so-hip wardrobe and coiffure, she found solace in her writing. Even her dimpled and expansive smile faded as she recalled the painful memories of those early years in New York.
"It was very hard," she said, shifting in her chair as if to dispel an intense feeling that was still with her. " 'Haitian' was like a curse. People were calling you, 'Frenchy, go back to the banana boat,' and a lot of the kids would lie about where they came from. They would say anything but Haitian."
It was a time when the bodies of Haitian boat people routinely washed up on the beaches of South Florida. The early 1980's was also a time when Haitians were officially classified as a high-risk group for AIDS by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Her love for Haiti and things Haitian, of which she spoke again and again in the course of a day's visit, was deepened by memories of neighbors in her first building who helped her through the tough years.
On Sundays, they shared pumpkin soups, as people do in Haiti. They looked after each other.
"It was a . . . la cour," she said, referring to a Haitian courtyard, where almost communal living is commonplace among the poor, especially in the countryside. "It was a shelter in a storm."
The ambiance at that building, in Flatbush, was not too different from that in Bel Air, the teeming Port-au-Prince slum where Ms. Danticat spent 12 years before coming to America.
"This friend of mine kept saying that in Haiti his mother had a maid, but here his mother is a maid," she said. "I can be friends with women that, if we lived in Haiti, our paths would never cross. People where I was from were the maids."
Ms. Danticat, however, has become a quintessential Haitian-American, living in both worlds and speaking flawless American English interrupted with an occasional Creole word.
She dresses smartly and conservatively. On this day she was wearing an ankle-length black skirt , a black sweater and moccasins; her hair was in long, narrow braids. She looked every bit the Barnard College and Brown University graduate that she is.
She has blended her two worlds, and when she talks about her beloved East Flatbush, her delight shows through.
She relishes the sounds of calypso, compa and reggae that thunder from the assorted shops along Avenue D in the East 40's, a stone's throw from her parents' home. The conversations on the streets are enlivened by hints of the Caribbean, peppered with a Haitian Creole clip here and a Spanish intonation there.
In fact, after living in Providence, R.I., where she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at Brown, she craved the familiarity of East Flatbush and rushed back to Brooklyn and her family, which includes three brothers -- Eliab, 24, a teacher in the Bronx, and Kelly, 20, and Carl, 18, both college students.
"To me, Brooklyn is the world," she says, adding that she tells people she is from Brooklyn by way of Haiti. "I can eat Haitian food or any food I want. You just can't get that anywhere."
In the tradition of Haitian families, where art and literature are seen more as pastimes than vocations, her parents still think of her as unemployed.
But she is very much at work.
A tiny room on the second floor, decorated with her Alpha Kappa Alpha relics and African tarot stickers, serves as her bedroom and office.
She writes on a Macintosh that is perched on a desk under a loft bed. It is there she completed a second book, "Krik? Krak!," a collection of short stories to be published by Soho in April. She is doing research on another novel about Haitian sugar-cane cutters in the Dominican Republic.
When she rejoined her family in New York in 1981, Ms. Danticat told her father of her aspiration to become a writer. But he had other ideas. He told her she could write on weekends. A more respectable profession like medicine would be more suitable, he thought.
"My parents think that it's a hobby that ended up well," she said of her writing. "The only time that my work seemed honorable was when they came to the book party. That's when they finally grasped the importance of it."
During her high school years, Ms. Danticat said, she barely spoke above a whisper because she was embarrassed by her accent, which has now faded to almost nothing.
Having published her novel, she has to wear the mantle of being "the voice" of Haitian-Americans. It is a responsibility that she has accepted hesitantly.
"I think I have been assigned that role, but I don't really see myself as the voice for the Haitian-American experience," she said. "There are many. I'm just one."

HEADLINE: Public Television and 'Elitism'

 BODY:
When the new Congress swept into Washington, budget axes at the ready, the Public Broadcasting Service became a prime candidate for the chopping block. PBS was an "elitist" enterprise, the ax-men said, a frothy confection of opera and animal programs, aimed at the rich folks up East. But a poll conducted this month by the respected Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton for PBS finds broad, bipartisan support for the very system that many in Congress seem bent on dismantling.
The poll, which sampled 1,005 Americans age 18 and above, reveals an especially deep concern about the declining quality of programming on commercial television; 82 percent believed that commercial television was too violent, especially for young chilren. Nearly 85 percent of the respondents said Congress should either maintain public television's funding at current levels or increase it -- with nearly half of those who responded advocating an increase. Support for public television was broadly bipartisan, reaching 80 percent among Republicans, 86 percent among independents and 90 percent among Democrats. Nine in ten respondents disputed the charge that public television is "elitist," saying that PBS programming offered something for people from just about all backgrounds, regardless of education and income. 
 Government funds support a mere 14 percent of the PBS budget, at a cost of $1.09 per American per year, but they provide a crucial core of support to generate additional contributions. The myth of "elitism" is exposed by the way the money is actually spent. WNET-TV in New York City receives 7.78 percent of its money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; the rest comes from private sources. But WJWJ-TV in Beaufort, S.C., gets 55.3 percent of its budget from the corporation.
The richer stations could survive without public money. The poorer, often rural stations could not. The collapse of government funding would lead to a truly elitist system, with the richer regions having access to quality and educational programming and the poorer regions left to the mercy of the marketplace, meaning commercial television.

HEADLINE: A Proposal Worth Fighting For

 BODY:
On three separate occasions during his State of the Union address, President Clinton declared that he and the Republicans must work to "build the middle class and shrink the underclass." He said too many Americans had been left behind by the economy's recovery, and he offered several remedies. One was new -- raising the minimum wage. One was old -- cutting taxes on the middle class. The others consisted mainly of limp warnings to Republicans not to pass irresponsible welfare programs or constitutional amendments.
The minimum-wage proposal is worth fighting for. It would fulfill the President's campaign pledge to make work pay -- by which he meant that full-time workers should earn enough to raise their families out of poverty. Mr. Clinton said he would let Congress write a minimum-wage bill and decide how much the rate should be raised, a strategy reaffirmed by his aides today. He needs to be more assertive and shoot for a $5-an-hour minimum. 
 He reaffirmed an earlier pledge to trim taxes on the middle class while warning that he would reject a tax cut that "explodes the deficit." He was less forthright on other issues. He opposed punitive welfare reform, but did not threaten to veto a G.O.P. attempt to strip welfare programs of the guarantee that Congress would provide money to serve every eligible family. Mr. Clinton said he would fight a balanced-budget amendment but, oddly, he did not reject outright an idea he knows is rancid.
Some Administration officials have recommended raising the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5. At that level, a fully employed parent of two children would earn almost $10,500, and could also qualify for a tax credit -- in effect a cash rebate -- of up to $3,500 and food stamps worth about $3,000. After subtracting payroll taxes, the family would keep about $16,000 -- enough to lift it out of poverty.
The G.O.P. objects because higher wages, it says, threaten to strip low-wage workers of their jobs. The evidence is mixed, but most research shows that employment effects are small, perhaps trivial. Research also shows that most minimum-wage workers are adults, not teen-agers. Nor can Washington achieve the same end by boosting the tax credit alone; the complexity of this credit creates a strong disincentive to work at higher wages.
Sadly, the Republicans seem viscerally opposed to Mr. Clinton's proposal -- even though his small hike would leave minimum wages, after accounting for inflation, well below levels that prevailed in the 1970's.
Though Mr. Clinton drew few sharp lines Tuesday night, fudging on the balanced budget amendment and on the G.O.P.'s welfare bills, he scored a rhetorical hit on the minimum wage -- pointing out that his audience earned more in a month than minimum-wage workers earn in a year.

HEADLINE: THE 104TH CONGRESS: THE VOTERS;
Some Who Like What They Heard but Are Sure They've Heard It Before

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIVER GROVE, Ill., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Frank Faruggia's family and half a dozen friends, frequent guests in a household that always seems to be bustling with them, sat watching the State of the Union address on a television set in the Faruggias' kitchen on Tuesday night.
As President Clinton spoke of coming "to this hallowed chamber two years ago on a mission," admitted that he had made some mistakes since then but told too of the lower unemployment and inflation the country had experienced under his stewardship, Mr. Faruggia just stroked his beard. 
 As the President declared that he was "proud to say tonight that our country is stronger that it was two years ago," Mr. Faruggia's friend John Valentino, a plant engineer, lighted another Marlboro.
As the President resurrected his "new covenant" and spoke of plans to ease the financial burdens of the middle class, Mr. Faruggia looked over at Mr. Valentino, and the two of them laughed.
"New Deal, New Society, New Contract, New Covenant," Mr. Faruggia said. "Same dragon, different head."
It was as if they had heard all this before, they said. And although they could not find much to disagree with in the President's speech -- who is against welfare reform or less bureaucracy, they asked -- they doubted that Mr. Clinton or even the new Congress would do much of anything.
"It's like a cheap life vest," Mr. Faruggia, a 40-year-old part-time police officer who owns a hot dog stand and repairs cars on the side, said of the speech. "It'll float two or three weeks, and then it'll go down the tubes."
The skepticism runs deep in this working-class Chicago suburb of 10,000 people, where a few elections ago most people would tell you they were Democrats but where last November most people went Republican like the rest of the country. This used to be Dan Rostenkowski territory. But in November the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee lost by 66 percent to 34 percent here in River Grove to Michael Flanagan, an unemployed lawyer who had never held elective office but who was Republican in a Republican year.
This used to be Clinton country as well. But since the President's election, Loretta Page, Democratic precinct captain, has become Loretta Page, Republican precinct captain.
"I was a Bill Clinton fan," said Mrs. Page, who watched the President's address in her own home, not far from the Faruggias'. "I voted for him because he made you feel good, and it helps he's good-looking. But I think, 'Poor Clinton, he tried to bite the whole apple and swallow it.' He needed to pick something and stay with it."
He vacillated, she said, on welfare, could not get a health care overhaul passed and seems ineffectual to her. So she is a Republican now. "We have changed here in the village," she said.
In Mr. Clinton's address, Mrs. Page heard nothing to pull her back to the Democrats. Not that she disagreed with much of what he had said. She supports the assault-rifle ban enacted last year, his call for changes in the health care and welfare systems, and the minimum-wage increase he spoke of. "You couldn't disagree with it," she said. "It was so generic. You hear it over and over and over. How many times can you hear it and you don't see any result from what you're hearing?"
She began reciting her disappointments. "Remember a year ago he said he would not sign a health care bill except his own?" she said. "He came on strong. What did we get? We got zero."
Yes, she said, she knew that Congress had not come up with a health care bill and had sidetracked the Clinton plan. "But you see, he's the head," Mrs. Page said. "It was up to him to muster support or do whatever he had to do."
But some of those skeptical of Mr. Clinton said they would not write him off just yet. Similarly they said they would not necessarily vote for a Republican Presidential candidate next time, with Republicans already in control of Congress. "Right now we got enough of them in there," Mr. Faruggia said. "Too many is not good."
Nor do they necessarily see the new Speaker of the House as their leader of choice. People in River Grove are still asking themselves, Who is this Newt Gingrich, and how did he become whoever he is so fast?
"You'd think he was just given the throne next to Jesus," said Donald Gedeon, a retired X-ray installer who voted Reagan, Reagan, Bush, Clinton in the last four Presidential elections and now has his doubts about both parties.
"I think everybody's given up on these politicians," Mr. Gedeon said. "No matter who's in, they can't do the job. We got the budget deficit, the trade deficit. We got this crime coming in and drugs coming in by the warehouse-load. We got the education system coming apart at the seams. Everywhere you look, we got a tragedy.
"We need to all go to church and pray this all works out. They say when there's nowhere to go, you'll go to you knees." ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Jan. 24 Business Day article on Canada's weak dollar: Such problems will continue as long as the Quebec elite persist in their quest for power under the guise of independence. With companies just beginning again to invest in Canada, another referendum this year will renew the age-old doubt that may pull Canada back into recession. 
 While independence will spell economic strife for Canada, it will mean catastrophe for Quebec; the United States will have a third-world country north as well as south of the border.

HEADLINE: In Congress, A Wave Of Humbleness

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SENIOR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
After months of depicting Washington as a den of spoiled scamps, the 86 newly elected members of the House of Representatives have made an alarming discovery: they have to live here.
Suddenly, looking like a Washington outsider is dreadfully inconvenient. Living near the Capitol is key. Long hours are unavoidable. So the freshmen, faced with the grim realities of legislative life, are nearly collapsing on themselves to show that their spiritual roots are still back in their districts. And they have dingy, gloomy, tiny digs in Washington to prove it. 
 "I think they're putting up lean-tos in front of the Supreme Court," Representative Barney Frank, a longtime Democrat from Massachusetts, said, rolling his eyes. "They've got this downscale competition going on: 'I have a smaller apartment than yours. My furniture is shabbier than yours.' It's vogue to minimize your contact with this place."
Never mind that many of the new members of this class come from some of the nation's toniest neighborhoods. Never mind that some of these freshmen spent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of their own fortunes to defeat their opponents. Now that they have arrived on Capitol Hill, many of them say they are living lives of collegiate austerity, cramming themselves into tiny studio apartments, sleeping in twin beds, purchasing furniture at Ikea.
"They're afraid of giving the impression that Tom Foley did," said Peter Tierney, the Congressional liaison at Yarmouth Management, a property management company on Capitol Hill. Mr. Foley, the defeated Speaker of the House, owns a legendarily beautiful town house near the Capitol, complete with a lap swimming pool in the backyard.
"They say that they want a place to sleep and that's it," Mr. Tierney added.
The desire to appear unentrenched is particularly urgent among the 73 new Republican Representatives, many of whom campaigned for term limits and decried the complacency of Democratic incumbents. Nearly all of them make a point of saying that they are not bringing their families to Washington. And few are buying places of their own, even though it may be more cost-effective than renting.
"My wife and I had a choice between renting a nice place far from the Capitol or a dump nearby," said Representative Jon Christensen, Republican of Nebraska, who ran campaign advertisements showing pictures of his opponent's half-a-million-dollar home in Chevy Chase, Md. "We chose the dump."
Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina whose net worth is roughly $ 1 million, according to his office, is sleeping on a a single futon in his office, he said, because he does not want to attach himself to Washington.
During his campaign, Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee, went so far as to propose that the Government build officer-style quarters for members of Congress at two military bases near Washington. When he brought the idea up in Washington, it didn't go over well with his peers.
Representative Wamp is living in a hotel. "I'd rather not own any furniture in Washington," he said. "This forces me to go back to my district."
Austerity, of course, is relative. Representative Wamp, though he may not be investing in furniture, is still spending $ 70 for every night he passes at the Capitol Hill Suites. (He said he hoped to be in Washington no more than 12 nights a month.) And while it may be humble by Capitol Hill standards, Representative Christensen's two-bedroom apartment rents for $ 900 a month -- about the going rate, said Buck Waller, a property manager at Yarmouth Management.
Over the last two decades, members of the House have been living increasingly rootless and humble lives, Congressional scholars said. They pointed out that now many of the members have working wives or husbands who can't simply pick up and leave their jobs. And owning two homes, after all, is extremely expensive, considering that Representatives are paid $ 133,644 -- a pay cut for many of them -- and do not receive a housing allowance. Representatives are also getting younger -- 59 percent of this year's freshmen are 45 or younger -- which often means that they have young children.
"As a mom, I know I can't uproot my children in the middle of a semester," said Sheila Jackson Lee, a newly elected Democrat of Texas. But transience, some freshmen are realizing, also comes at a price.
"Most are frightened about the prospect of leaving their families, yet they've made their commitments," said Mark Foley, a freshman Republican of Florida. "They're honor bound not to settle here, with their discussions of term limit and so on. But I've seen them moping."
Peter Hoagland, the defeated Nebraska Democrat, said he bought his half-million-dollar house in Maryland because he wanted to be with his five children. "That kind of bogus campaign rhetoric, in the end, is going to discourage members of Congress from bringing their families out here, and it will make the House even less family-friendly than it already is," he said last month as he was packing up his office.
Because the Washington housing market currently favors buyers, a few freshmen who can afford a second home are kicking themselves for having eliminated the option of buying one.
"I pledged in my primary campaign not to buy a home," said Representative Jerry Weller, Republican of Illinois. "It has limited my options. It probably would be more economically efficient to purchase a condo somewhere."
According to seasoned realtors in this city, freshmen aren't living all that differently from some of the most seasoned lawmakers on Capitol Hill; they're just a bit louder about living low on the hog.
Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, lives in a small, rented apartment on Capitol Hill. Dick Armey, the new House majority leader, slept in the members' gym for a year until then-Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. kicked him out. When Representative Sanford unrolls his futon in his office, he joins a fraternity of Congressmen who sleep in their offices, including Representative John Linder, Republican of Georgia.
Several longtime Democratic Representatives have been crowding together for years. Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut and George Miller of California share a two-bedroom town house on Capitol Hill. Representatives Schumer and Gejdenson sleep in the living room.
"The arrangement includes cookies," said Representative Miller, who owns the apartment and has a wife and five children back in Martinez, Calif. "I do the laundry, and Durbin traps the rats."
The churlishness of last year's electorate has also made the freshmen nervous about settling in. "Once I begin to look at this place as my home, I'm sure the voters of my district will want to return me to Rhode Island for good," said Patrick J. Kennedy, a new Democratic Representative who watched his father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, endure a close race before winning last November.
Every class has its exceptions. Sonny Bono, the singer-turned-mayor-turned-Republican Congressman, has purchased a $ 600,000 town house in Hillandale, a gated community in the city's Georgetown section. He will move in with his wife and two young children.
"When I was wrapped up in a celebrity career, I wasn't as solid on the family end," said Mr. Bono, who also has two grown children from previous marriages. "Now, I'm able to rectify that."
Perhaps the most surprising potential-buyer exception is Representative George Nethercutt, Republican of Washington, who handily defeated Speaker Foley after portraying him as the ultimate victim of Washingtonitis. The Representative is hoping to buy a house for his family right outside Washington.
"Do I want to spend $ 2,000 or $ 3,000 in rent, or toward a mortgage?" he said. "It's simply economic for me."
Could purchasing a home send the wrong message to his constituents?
 "There's a certain reality to this life of being a member of Congress," he said. "I think the voters understand that. Besides, I can always sell it."
 The article also misstated the number of children of Representative George Miller, Democrat of California. He has two children, not five.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Home Section last Thursday about the living quarters of some members of Congress referred incorrectly to Representative John Linder, Republican of Georgia. He has a town house in Washington; he does not sleep in his office.

Dollar Steady, With Report On Economic Growth Due

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against most leading currencies as dealers waited for today's report on the gross domestic product for further clues about the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.
Many dealers said they already expected the Fed to raise rates by half a percentage point. A robust G.D.P. report could prompt the Fed to raise rates more steeply, they said. Higher rates make dollar-denominated investments and deposits more attractive. 
 "If the Fed doesn't raise rates by half a percent, the dollar will be in big trouble," said Laurence Hayward, a currency dealer at Nationsbank of Texas in Houston. "People expect them to do at least that much."
The dollar is likely to gain if the gross domestic product figures show that the economy grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent or more during the fourth quarter, Mr. Hayward and other dealers said. It rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter.
Yesterday, in late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.5177 German marks from 1.5167 on Wednesday. It slipped to 99.40 Japanese yen from 99.52 yen. The dollar was unchanged against the Swiss franc, at 1.2765 francs. The British pound fell to $1.5905 from $1.5915.
Earlier in the day, the dollar had slumped amid concern that Congress would not approve the Clinton Administration's proposed $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico.
Turmoil in Mexico's financial markets hurts the dollar because of the close economic ties between the two countries. Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner. Since the Mexican Government devalued the peso, it has fallen 37.6 percent against the dollar.
"The Mexico package is key, and the dollar will ultimately suffer if it doesn't go through or if it has too many conditions attached to it," said Peter Wilson, a bond analyst at the Nomura Research Institute in London.
Senator Jim Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, told Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a Congressional hearing today that the aid effort was "collapsing in dramatic fashion." His comments renewed doubts on the plan's future.
The dollar rebounded later, after the International Monetary Fund said it had reached a tentative agreement to extend $7.8 billion in loans to help the Mexican Government resolve its financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Dow Slips by 1.01 in Restrained Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market ended another erratic session with little change yesterday in restrained trading, as traders awaited the Commerce Department's estimate today of fourth-quarter economic growth.
As such, the market continued on the trend that it has followed now for six straight sessions, in which it ended with little change but showed pronounced volatility during the day. 
 Traders say that pattern is likely to persist until next Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting to decide whether or by how much to raise interest rates.
"We're going to jump around up and down, but at the end of the day we'll be pretty flat," said David H. Butler, director of equity trading at Kemper Financial Securities Inc.
Yesterday was typical. After the Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 18 points by 12:30 P.M., it rose another 17 points before finally closing at 3,870.44, down 1.01 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.88 point, to 468.32, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 3.41 points, to 757.57.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 312 million shares changing hands, about 4 percent below this year's daily average of 324 million shares.
"It was a very confusing day," said Bill Allyn, director of listed trading at Jefferies & Company. He noted that corporate earnings reports were strong so far, which is normally bullish for stocks. "But the market would be up a lot more if there wasn't this uncertainty about interest rates hanging over everything."
Many traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates by at least half a percentage point, so stock and bond prices are likely to show little reaction if the Fed does indeed announce such a rate increase.
But a rate increase of less than half a percentage point might be viewed as a drag on the market because traders would suspect that the Fed was weakening in its fervor to fight inflation, analysts say. Conversely, a larger increase of, say, three-quarters a percentage point might signal to markets that the Fed was finished raising interest rates for the year. Markets would probably rally then, Mr. Butler of Kemper Securities said.
The big newsmaker of the day, and the most active stock at some 14.5 million shares, was Dr. Pepper/7Up, which hit a 52-week high of 32 5/8 before closing at 32 1/2, up 2. Dr. Pepper's board accepted a $2.5 billion buyout offer from Cadbury Schweppes of Britain.
Affymax, a Netherlands-based pharmaceuticals company, also established a 52-week high of 30 before closing at 29 1/2, up 11. Glaxo the British pharmaceuticals giant, offered to pay $485 million, or $30 a share, for Affymax.
In still more merger news, Hillhaven, a hospital-management company, touched a 52-week high of 26 7/8 and closed at 26 1/4, up 3 3/8. Horizon Healthcare, a rival, made a surprise bid for Hillhaven, offering $28 a share. Hillhaven said it would study the proposal.
Bertucci's, a pizzeria chain, hit a 52-week low of 7 before closing at 8 1/2, down 2 1/4. Bertucci's said its fourth-quarter earnings were likely to be unchanged from the year before and that sales were "disappointing."
ALC Communications, a long-distance telecommunications company, dropped 2 1/2, to 28 1/2, after it reported fourth-quarter net of 45 cents a share, 3 cents below Wall Street expectations.
Gentex, an auto parts maker, fell 3 1/8, to 22 3/4, after it reported fourth-quarter net of 26 cents a share, one cent short of analyst projections.
And Singer, the sewing-machine maker, established a 52-week low of 25 3/8 before closing at 25 1/2, down 2 7/8. It reported fourth-quarter net unchanged at 69 cents a share.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.51 point, to 254.92. Advancing stocks almost equaled declining stocks, with 1,115 gainers and 1,019 decliners. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.78 point, to 437.74.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up in Price For 2d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were up yesterday for the second consecutive day after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Budget Committee that the "torrid growth is slowing down."
In a clear sign that investors are confident the Fed will not quickly raise interest rates again if it nudges them up next week, as expected, prices of Government securities rose in all maturities. While Mr. Greenspan, in a second day of Congressional testimony, warned of a possible rise in inflation in the near term, he said it "can be contained by the Fed." 
 The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the months ahead, meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
Yesterday, the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to a price of 965/32 , to yield 7.83 percent, down from 7.87 percent on Wednesday, its lowest in a week. In the last two days the market has rallied a full point in price, or about $10 for every $1,000 in bonds that investors hold.
Early yesterday, the Commerce Department's latest report on durable goods showed a rise of 1.4 percent in December, after a 3.2 percent gain in November. But durable goods orders outside military orders fell eight-tenths of a percent.
Ronald R. Reuss, chief economist at Piper Capital Management, in Minneapolis, said that the market responded when Mr. Greenspan said that the torrid pace of economic growth was slowing. "If the economy can slow to a 2 to 3 percent growth mode it will take pressure off the Fed from continuing to raise rates," Mr. Reuss said.
"We still expect the Fed to raise rates next week, because there is still insufficient evidence of a slowing," he said. "The first signs were in the retail numbers at year-end, and now we would expect housing to slow along with exports because of the devaluation in Mexico, and because it raises the price of American goods substantially."
Most market participants still expect the Fed to raise interest rates 50 basis points next week in an attempt to insure that the economy slows enough to contain inflation. "But at the same time the Fed must be careful as the economy slows, it does not want to remain too tight, for too long," Mr. Reuss said.
Municipal bond prices were little changed for a second day as investors concentrated on this week's $2.7 billion supply of new debt.
Bonds from New York City's $658 million debt offering started trading in the secondary market, with the 7 1/4 percent bond due 2024 up a half- point to a price of 99 to yield 7.33 percent. When the bond was sold on Tuesday it was yielding 7.37 percent, 15 basis points higher than had been expected. That reflected concern that the city's $650 million budget deficit for the 1995 fiscal year could cause the rating agencies to downgrade the city's debt and make it more expensive to borrow.

COCA-COLA CO. (KO,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings jumped 22 percent on strong volume increases, particularly in foreign markets.
The world's largest beverage company reported net income of $567 million, or 44 cents a share, up from $466 million, or 36 cents, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
 Per-share earnings matched the mean estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue climbed 19 percent, to $4.02 billion from $3.37 billion.
International volume in cases increased 13 percent in the quarter, exceeding Coke's estimate last month that it would rise 10 percent to 12 percent. The company said its international volume had increased by double-digit percentages for the last six months. Domestic volume rose 8 percent in the quarter.
For the year, Coke's net income increased 17 percent, to $2.55 billion, or $1.98 a share, from $2.18 billion, or $1.67, in 1993. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $16.17 billion.
International soft drink operating income rose 18 percent in 1994 on volume growth, price increases in line with inflation, improved efficiencies and the effects of a weak dollar, Coke said. The company did not disclose its operating income gain for the United States.

A theory says even the Dow doesn't like San Diego's chances.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
POOR San Diego. Even the stock market seems to be forecasting that the Chargers will lose the Super Bowl.
That forecast comes from a theory that says the performance of the stock market in the two months leading to the Super Bowl can indicate which team will win. It makes no sense, of course, but it has worked well during the last two decades. 
 The theory, introduced in this column six years ago, holds that the franchise ranking first in the alphabet -- in this case, San Diego, as it faces the San Francisco 49ers -- will win if the stock market has gone down from the end of November through game day.
Unfortunately for the Chargers, the Dow Jones industrial average ended November at 3,739.23, and since has risen to 3,870.44. Barring a collapse in trading today, the stock market will have voted with the bookies, who have installed the 49ers as 18 1/2-point favorites.
Just why, you might be asking, should the Dow have anything to do with the Super Bowl? It doesn't, but Wall Street has long searched for a connection, or at least a correlation. A theory saying that the Super Bowl forecasts the stock market has been around for years, and has done surprisingly well, though last year's game provided a forecast that would not work out unless the Dow zoomed to at least 3,945.43 today.
With that theory in mind, this column set out six years ago to use the stock market to forecast the football game. We introduced a theory that during the previous 14 years would have correctly forecast 12 of the games, using a simple alphabetical approach. Since then, it has gotten five of six correct, raising its record during two decades to 17 of 20.
That is not bad. During the same period, the favorite team in Las Vegas betting has managed to win only 15 of 19 times. (One game, in 1982, went off with no favorite, and so does not count.)
The theory is that if the Dow rises from the end of November to the Super Bowl, then the franchise from later in the alphabet will win. Most times the market goes up, and most times the team from later in the alphabet wins. It has been the misfortune of the American Football Conference, which has lost 10 consecutive games, to often be represented by teams from early in the alphabet. The theory holds they will win only if the Dow has dropped before the game.
The only times in the last two decades that the theory has failed to work were in 1982, 1986 and 1990.
As it happens, San Francisco was involved in two of those games, winning despite the fact the market had fallen coming into the Super Bowls of 1982, when it beat Cincinnati, and 1990, when Denver was the loser. In the other failure, a rising market did not help New England, when it lost to Chicago in 1986.
As for the better-known Super Bowl indicator, which uses the results of the game to forecast the market, the theory is that if a team from the old National Football League wins the game, the stock market will go up in the following year. If one from the old American Football League wins, the market will go down.
Last year's Super Bowl victory by the Dallas Cowboys (old N.F.L.) over the Buffalo Bills (old A.F.L.) forecast a rising stock market. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Since the last Super Bowl, the Dow is down. As a result -- and barring a big rise today -- that indicator's record of forecasting the stock market is now 24 of 28, with failures after the 1970, 1987, 1990 and 1994 games.
Anyone who thinks either of those indicators makes any sense, or should be relied upon in buying stocks or betting on football games, probably should not be permitted to manage his or her own money. But such a person might be interested in the following forecast: If San Diego does win the Super Bowl, the economy will tank in 1995.
That is based on the fact that the last three years that saw at least one quarter of decline in gross domestic product were 1982, 1986 and 1990. Those were also the years that the stock market failed to forecast the results of the Super Bowl.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods' Best Rise in 16 Years

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Factory orders for durable goods like cars and computers rose 1.4 percent in December, capping the biggest annual increase in 16 years, the Commerce Department said today
But analysts noted the strength at the end of the year came from military and transportation orders. Excluding those components, demand was much weaker than it appeared. 
 Orders for durable goods -- products expected to last three years or longer -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $161.4 billion in December. It was the second straight advance, including a 3.2 percent gain to $159.1 billion in November. Orders dropped eight-tenths of a percent in October.
The December increase helped push orders for 1994 up 13.9 percent, the biggest advance since an 18.3 percent surge in 1978. Orders rose 8.6 percent increase in 1993.
"Over all, the report still shows strength in the manufacturing sector, but there are a few signs of softness emerging," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
These signs, she said, include a possible drop in retail sales during the December shopping season and a recent buildup of inventories at the wholesale level that could mean fewer orders as businesses clear excess stocks from their shelves.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testifying on Capitol Hill for the second straight day, said there were signs that the buoyant economy was "simmering down."
"The very torrid rate of increase is slowing down," Mr. Greenspan told members of the Senate Budget Committee. "It's no longer flat out. Fairly good moderate growth is occurring."
Nonetheless, most economists expect the Federal Reserve to increase short-term interest rates next week for the seventh time in a year in an attempt to insure that the economy cools off enough to keep inflation from accelerating.
In another report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 325,000, lowest since 321,000 during the week ended Dec. 24.
New jobless claims had risen to 354,000 during the week ended Jan. 7, mostly as a result of seasonal factors. In its durable-goods report, the Commerce Department said military orders shot up 65 percent last month, led by large increases for ships and tanks. Excluding the military component, orders dropped eight-tenths of a percent.
Military orders are often volatile, Ms. Reaser noted, adding that "the increase is not going to be an ongoing factor." Military orders fell 6.2 percent in November and 16.3 percent in October.
The orders for ships and tanks also helped drive the transportation sector up 5.4 percent. Without this sector, orders were up just one-tenth of a percent.
Other increases included primary metals, up 5.2 percent, and electronic and other electrical equipment, up 3 percent. But orders for industrial machinery and equipment were down 5 percent, the second dip in a row.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft were down four-tenths of a percent, the second monthly decline. These orders often are a barometer of business investment plans.
But unfilled orders rose seven-tenths of a percent, the fourth consecutive advance, suggesting the need for faster production and more jobs.
Shipments increased seven-tenths of a percent, the seventh gain in a row.

HEADLINE: Small Companies Lead Way As Massachusetts Rebounds

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The empty, unrented buildings along Boylston Street are beginning to fill with freshly painted shops and coffee bars. Not far away, Fidelity Investments' new trading room, larger than a football field, juts into Boston harbor like a brilliantly lighted luxury ship boarding for its maiden voyage. And along Route 128, the suburban highway where the now-shrunken computer giants of the 1980's got their start, new stars with names like Powersoft are emerging.
The signs of economic revival have been unmistakable for months. While the rest of the Northeast remains in the doldrums, Massachusetts, hit harder in the last recession than any other state, is coming back. But this recovery is different. The state's big manufacturers like General Electric and Digital Equipment -- engines of growth in the past -- are on the sidelines. Instead, more than ever, the people of Massachusetts are counting on small, little-known companies to give them work. 
 These particular small companies make the Massachusetts recovery a microcosm of the sort of economic growth that may give the United States an edge in global markets, in the view of many economists and policy makers. The recovery is led mostly by high-tech operations that hire the nimble and the very skilled to turn out pioneering products and develop new services ahead of anyone else.
But there is a catch. These companies, like similar operations elsewhere, offer few jobs to former assembly-line workers. Tens of thousands of these workers lost their jobs here when the boom that former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis touted as the Massachusetts Miracle collapsed more than five years ago.
"I think that a 'recovery with holes in it' is a not-unfair characterization of what is going on in Massachusetts," Gov. William F. Weld said in an interview. Nor does he hold out hope that many production workers who lost their jobs will see their old wages of $13 to $16 an hour. Standard manufacturing, even of computers, is dying in Massachusetts, he said, and "no governor better try to swim against the tide on that one, or you are destined to failure."
Going with the tide, Governor Weld has presided over a recovery that has added back nearly half of the 355,000 jobs lost since late 1988. In retrospect, the economy hit bottom in 1992, a year after Mr. Weld, a Republican, took office. But the job growth was too spotty until recently for anyone to declare with any certainty that the recovery was for real.
"It is a sober and gritty recovery," said Ira Jackson, a senior vice president at the Bank of Boston. "The hubris and arrogance of the region have been deflated, but we are getting some confidence back."
As always in Massachusetts, the recovery is centered in Boston and environs, where the state's employers are concentrated. Last year's job growth reached 4.7 percent, more than double that of any other Northeastern state and well above the rate for the nation as a whole.
But the rebound is uneven. Boston's famous hospitals, for example, are merging and cutting staff even as medical industry employment is rising smartly at outpatient clinics, for home care, and at H.M.O.'s. Similarly, while several banks failed or merged during the recession, shedding thousands of workers in the process, mutual funds based here are stronger than ever, now managing a fifth of the nation's fund assets.
Fidelity alone has added 2,000 employees since 1992, including many of the 160 young men and women who staff the new trading room. It is built over a wharf in the city's modernistic World Trade Center. Here Fidelity handles a portion of its own vast securities and foreign exchange trading, and increasingly acts as a broker for big institutional investors like pension funds.
"We think if we build a good trading machine," said Sherif A. Nada, president of Fidelity Capital Markets, "we can compete with Goldman, Sachs; Salomon Brothers, and Morgan Stanley for these investors."
But for all of Boston's vigor as a financial center, the heart of this recovery -- and its future -- seems to lie with small, high-tech companies developing and selling new software, medical devices, biotech drugs and telecommunications equipment. They cluster along Routes 128 and 495, which arc around Boston and its universities, the training ground for many high-tech entrepreneurs.
A lot of the small companies fail, of course, driven under by competitors who develop a new software twist, a better medical device or a stronger sales force. And that may prove the Achilles' heel of the recovery. "I would be skeptical that a long wave of economic growth for Massachusetts can be built on the basis of small companies trying to eat one another's lunch," said Bennett Harrison, an economist now teaching at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "Their life expectancy is too short."
Still, in this expansion many more of these small operations are surviving than failing. As a group they have contributed nearly 40,000 jobs to the state's employment growth since early 1992. Now Governor Weld and his advisers are gambling that at least some of the minor leaguers will hit on popular products and become leading employers, mimicking Microsoft's growth in the Seattle area or Intel's in the Silicon Valley of California.
"We are on an upward curve," said Prof. Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School, a Weld adviser. "When a company gets to 500 employees or more, as several have, and then grows at 20 percent a year, you have rapid job creation."
With this model in mind, Mr. Weld has pushed into law several tax cuts and other measures intended to reduce the cost of doing business in the state, and thus make smaller companies more willing to expand here. Home building and retailing, along with other support industries, would then flourish to serve the new, educated workers. And Massachusetts would once again enjoy a prosperity that in the past had depended on manufacturing as a base.
Textile mills and shoe factories made the state wealthy early in the century, and a different set of big manufacturers -- military contractors and minicomputer makers -- performed that role in the 1980's, the next period of great prosperity.
Raytheon and General Electric added tens of thousands of workers in the 1980's to make jet engines, missiles and other weapons, only to lay them off as military spending fell. Similarly, Digital Equipment, Prime Computer, Data General and others took on tens of thousands of workers when their minicomputers became hot sellers worldwide, only to shed them as desktop personal computers displaced the cabinet-sized minicomputers. And as they shrank -- Digital's payroll in the state has fallen to 13,500 people from 34,000 in 1989 -- they gave up their quarters along the Route 128 high-tech corridor to newcomers.
The Powersoft Corporation, for example, which has developed a way to write personal computer software more easily, now occupies the landscaped glass and brick building where Digital's directors once met. Most of Powersoft's 500 employees in the state are college graduates, the norm for these small, information-oriented companies.
That is also the case at the EMC Corporation, which eschews manufacturing, like nearly all of the growing companies in Massachusetts these days. EMC, whose main product is software that permits small storage disks to talk to one another and to big computers, sells the software already embedded in a cabinet-mounted disk system. But the disks themselves and the other equipment are purchased ready-made from suppliers, mostly from out of state. The testing, final assembly and the loading of the software take place at an EMC plant on Route 495.
The manufacturing companies that soared in the 1980's have shed more than 100,000 jobs since 1988, most of them held by workers with only high school diplomas -- forcing these employees to scramble for other work or more schooling, or both.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, in a study of 3,000 former military workers, found that most, after periods of unemployment, did indeed find new work. They went into retailing and office work and jobs like truck drivers, cooks, landscapers and mechanics. Some joined the small machine shops that still dot the state. The unemployment rate, partly in response, has fallen to 5.7 percent from 9.6 percent in May 1991. But they took pay cuts of 20 percent on average, raising an economic quandary that is particularly acute in Massachusetts.
The recovery is fostering, in effect, two sets of workers, two levels of pay, two standards of living and two outlooks on life -- what Sara Johnson, a New England specialist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm in nearby Waltham, calls the "Massachusetts Dichotomy."
Rodney Gagnon, a 26-year-old software engineer, is in the upper tier, where switching jobs is routine rather than wrenching. After graduating in 1990 from the University of Massachusetts, he joined Banyan Systems Inc., whose networking software helps personal computers talk to one another. He left in 1993 for an I.B.M. job in Florida. "I wanted to try a large company and try living in another area," Mr. Gagnon said.
The I.B.M. job soured and Mr. Gagnon rejoined the fast-growing Banyan last July at $45,000, a bit more than his I.B.M. salary and $7,000 above his last wage at Banyan. "I am expecting a promotion in July to senior software engineer and I would guess a raise of 8 percent," he said with confidence.
Susan Comeau, 41, also made the transition from job loss to work, but in the lower tier. Officials at General Electric, which has eliminated 7,000 jobs at its jet engine plant in Lynn, hold her up as model of retraining.
Anticipating a layoff, Ms. Comeau enrolled a couple of years ago as a business student at a local college. "My choice was to retrain and not to beat a dead horse into the ground by trying to match my old salary," she said. She found a marketing job last year at Nutramax Products, which sells eye drops, cough drops, baby products and the like.
The pay is $26,000 a year, far below the $40,000 Ms. Comeau earned after 21 years as a G.E. production worker. Anger about this is self-defeating, Ms. Comeau says, and she must concentrate on her new career in case her husband, still a G.E. employee, loses his job, too.
"Now I'm an apprentice again," she said. "But the potential is there to get my old salary back a few years down the road. That's what keeps me going."

Clinton Warns Major Leagues To Settle Strike

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Warning that the major league baseball strike was trying Americans' patience and imperiling thousands of jobs, President Clinton today threw increased White House power behind efforts to force a mediated settlement.
Mr. Clinton ordered a Federal mediator to bring baseball's players and owners back to the bargaining table, and he set a Feb. 6 deadline for them to make substantial headway toward ending the strike. Otherwise, he warned, the Government would ask the mediator to propose a solution. 
 With the start of spring training looming and no settlement in sight, the strong words from the President were reinforced on Capitol Hill, where some members of Congress have threatened to strip baseball of its antitrust exemption if the dispute is not settled.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, who volunteered his office today as a site for renewed negotiations, did not mention that prospect directly. But he said Congress might have to act in some way. "If the players and owners are unable to find common ground and find it soon," Mr. Dole said, "then we will have to find some way to empower those who are the most important element in the baseball equation, the fans themselves."
Together, their warnings made plain that neither the White House nor Congress wants to be seen as standing by passively now that another baseball season may be in peril. Spring-training camps are due to open on Feb. 16, and the regular season is scheduled to begin on April 2.
But the thrust of Mr. Clinton's message appeared to reflect particular concern about the potential peril for Florida, the state that plays spring host to 20 of baseball's 28 major league clubs and one that is crucial to his political prospects.
"America has been living without baseball for too long," Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued today. Saying the dispute was "imperiling the livelihood of tens of thousands of workers whose jobs depend on baseball," he declared: "It is time for this strike to end."
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner of baseball, and Donald Fehr, the players' union chief, said today that they welcomed Mr. Clinton's statement and looked forward to renewed talks. But at a meeting in Washington where mayors from around the country told baseball players and owners about their concern over the strike, neither side expressed much optimism that the dispute could be resolved quickly.
The Florida economy is more dependent on spring-training tourism than is Arizona's, the other warm-weather state where the major league clubs have long set up camp and attracted thousands of fans. Florida is also the only one among the country's largest states whose Governor, Lawton Chiles, is a Democrat, meaning that it has become particularly important for Mr. Clinton to maintain his goodwill.
It has been more than a month since talks between the players and owners broke down. With the training camps due to open soon, the owners are now moving ahead with plans to field teams with replacement players -- a prospect that could sap spring training of much of its appeal and one that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole both signaled that they hoped to avert.
The President has no power to force an end to the strike, and he has stopped short of endorsing the threats by members of Congress to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption if the dispute is not settled. But his strong statement was most direct intervention since the strike began last Aug. 12, and his aides said it signaled a decision within the Administration that the mediator, Bill Usery Jr., should now adopt a more assertive role.
Mr. Clinton did not appoint Mr. Usery, a former Labor Secretary, until last Oct. 14, more than two months after the strike began, and he has seemed content to allow the mediator to play a low-key role. But in his statement today, the President asked Mr. Usery "to bring the owners and the players back to the table, and to step up the pace and intensity of his mediation efforts." He said he wanted Mr. Usery to consider putting forward his own recommendations if the players and owners are not at least on track toward a speedy settlement by the Feb. 6 deadline.
While the timing appeared to have been coincidental, Mr. Clinton's appeal was certainly reinforced by Mr. Dole's message, who invited the players and owners to use his offices for "some good old-fashioned, brass-knuckled bargaining."
Administration officials said today that Mr. Clinton's statement had been drafted after weeks of deliberations in which Labor Secretary Robert Reich and Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel who is the President's chief adviser on the issue, had grown increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for a settlement of the strike.
In the statement, the President said he still believed that it would be best if the owners and the players settle their dispute themselves. But he warned that the strike had left baseball with "a tarnished image," and he suggested that a more aggressive Government role was necessary in part because the prolonged dispute was "trying the patience and depressing the spirits of millions of baseball fans -- including me."
Mr. Clinton said he would ask Mr. Usery to offer his own recommendations for a settlement after Feb. 6 "if he believes it appropriate." In an interview tonight, Mr. Reich described such a step as one that would "bring a great deal of public pressure to bear" on the players and owners to settle their dispute.
For his part, Mr. Fehr said: "Major league players welcome today's action by President Clinton to stimulate a resumption of bargaining and intensive mediation. The players have been ready and willing to resume bargaining since the owners broke off talks Dec. 22. Now, more than a month after the owners walked away from the table and implemented their salary cap, it is apparent that spring training is in jeopardy, as well as the 1995 championship season. We hope the owners well agree to return to the bargaining table."

HEADLINE: Defense Dept. Plans to Close Fewer Bases

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Facing resistance from the military services, Defense Secretary William J. Perry today backtracked from a top Pentagon goal and said the round of base closings this year -- which had been expected to be the largest of four -- would be smaller than anticipated.
In a speech to the United States Conference of Mayors, Mr. Perry said fewer bases would be ordered closed than in 1993 because "in previous rounds we closed those relatively easy ones." 
 "Everything from now on will be more difficult," he said.
Mr. Perry later said he had trimmed the Pentagon's original goal in recent weeks after the military services told him it would be too difficult and too costly in the near term.
Fewer closings would send aftershocks through the Pentagon and the country. While they would spare many communities economic turmoil, they would also shrink the long-term savings the Pentagon had been counting on to help pay for troop salaries and new weapons after the turn of the century.
Three independent commissions, which met in 1988, 1991 and 1993, decided to close 70 major installations. It takes five to six years to shut a base, which in the short term is very expensive.
Mr. Perry said today that it would cost $15 billion to close and clean up the 70 bases, but that by the end of the decade the Pentagon would save more than $4 billion a year by doing so.
By the Secretary's own admission, the services are keeping open more bases, depots, shipyards and laboratories than the shrinking post-cold-war military needs, bleeding money from training and operations accounts. He said today that the overall size of the military had dropped by 33 percent in the past eight years, but that the number of installations had shrunk by only 20 percent.
As recently as last fall, lawmakers and senior Pentagon officials anticipated even larger long-term savings from the closings this year, which some officials predicted would be larger than the three previous rounds combined.
But as the services began to consider what they would actually close, they dropped hints to Mr. Perry that their original estimates were overly ambitious. The services are to submit their final recommendations to Mr. Perry in the next few weeks.
The Secretary does not make the final decision on base closings, but he has tremendous influence. By March 1 he will submit a list of recommended closings to an independent commission, which can then add or subtract bases. Under the base-closing legislation, Congress will have to approve or reject the panel's decision as a whole later this summer.
Mr. Perry gave the first signs of pulling back a month ago when he told reporters that he expected the 1995 round of decisions to be "about the size" of the 1993 round, when 35 major bases were ordered closed and 27 others were reduced -- or in some cases expanded.
But in recent weeks, the Secretaries of the three armed services have told Mr. Perry that after the three previous rounds there were no more obvious targets and that their reduced budgets could not pay for the cleanup of a large number of bases.
"We're down to the tough choices, and the question of how much money we have for closing and cleanup," said one senior Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as did others in the department.
Another official said, "In a time when our budget is under considerable pressure, we are constrained by the up-front costs of closing."
The official said that even with fewer closings than planned this year, the military would still reap billions of dollars in long-term savings from the reduction in bases.
Pentagon officials said today that they might ask Congress to approve legislation authorizing additional base closings in the future, depending on the recommendations the services submit to Mr. Perry.
The Navy accounted for most of the base closings in 1993, but the Army is expected to provide the majority of the closings this year.
Army officials have already expressed concern about closing many bases in the United States before troops from deactivated units in Europe can be reassigned to posts in this country.
"We're taking very seriously the goal of tailoring the cold-war infrastructure to the post-cold-war Army of 495,000 people," a senior Army official said. The Army's strength is now about 530,000.
Army officials insist that the Army has more than fulfilled its share of closings by shutting down scores of installations in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.

HEADLINE: Mexicans Deny They Would Order Border Crackdown in Return for U.S. Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Mexican officials strongly denied today that they would agree to block migrants from crossing illegally into the United States or give American officials greater influence over their anti-drug efforts in return for $40 billion in proposed loan guarantees.
United States officials also backed away from suggestions on Wednesday that they would try to use the aid to win such concessions from Mexico. 
 "We have been very, very, very careful in dealing with the Mexicans on this," said an American official familiar with the discussions. "In some cases we may want to push the Mexicans farther than they are. But we are trying to make the case to people that we are already working well together, and that we are getting increased assurances of cooperation."
"We are not," the official went on, "trying to come up with any sort of political conditions on this."
What commitments Mexico might make to win Congressional approval of the loan guarantees in the United States has become a sensitive political issue in both countries.
Without waiting for the Clinton Administration, Congress has variously demanded the opening of Mexico's state-run oil industry to private investors, Mexican efforts to stop illegal migration to the United States, and an end to Mexico's amicable relationship with Cuba.
In response, a growing number of Mexicans have begun to oppose the plan, arguing that the loan guarantees and their conditions could jeopardize the independence of this country without solving its deeper economic problems.
"The series of conditions that the White House and the United States Congress seek in order to aid Mexico financially show the characteristics not of an economic operation but of open and inadmissible blackmail," the left-leaning newspaper La Jornada editorialized on its front page last week.
As in the United States, much of the criticism in Mexico comes from political agendas that go far beyond the $40 billion. And as was the case in earlier negotiations over the foreign debt and North American trade, the outcry may partly serve the Mexican Government's cause by hinting to the American Congress that refusal to help could bring more political instability south of the border.
Many Mexican political analysts believe their countrymen care less about the threats to their sovereignty that the loan guarantees might imply than about the economic disaster that could ensue if they are voted down.
Yet concern about a nationalistic backlash has become increasingly evident in the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. One after another, senior Mexican officials have been paraded in recent days to promise that the country's dignity will not be risked. In a hastily scheduled speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Zedillo himself mentioned the word sovereignty 19 times.
"The highest aim of my Government is the full exercise of national sovereignty," he said. "We will accept no commitment that violates national sovereignty or threatens the legitimate interests of the Mexicans."
Mexican and United States officials have not differed in their public description of the financial conditions of the proposed guarantees.
Because of the difficulty Mexico faces in persuading investors to renew the $28 billion in short-term debt securities it has outstanding, it plans to use the guarantees to issue new debt bonds that would be repayable over a period of up to 10 years. Mexico would pay a commission and interest. As collateral, the Mexican central bank would also have importers of Mexican oil deposit their payments with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, putting them under American control in the event Mexico had trouble paying them back.
Just as American critics of the guarantees have portrayed them as outright loans, so have Mexican opponents suggested that they would give the United States control over Mexico's oil exports. But the more political conditions that might be attached to the plan have been even more open to interpretation.
According to officials from both countries involved in negotiations on the assurances Mexico might offer to make the loan guarantees more attractive, Mexico has said it will pledge greater cooperation with the United States on such matters as immigration, drug control and environmental protection along the border. But the assurances that Mexico would provide are not expected to be very specific, and they are not expected to require new formal agreements.
On the migration issue, senior Mexican officials said the Zedillo Government's main commitments would be to promote greater economic development in regions that have traditionally exported undocumented migrants to the United States and to expand a special police force created to deal with crime along the border.
Mexico has already announced that it is considering both of those steps, and officials said they might consider allowing migrants caught sneaking across the border to be deported into the Mexican interior.
In testimony Wednesday before the Banking Committee of the House of Representatives, Secretary of State Warren Christopher cited the expansion of the special police force as an example of the "very significant" actions that Mexico would take on law enforcement and narcotics.
Yet the force, known in Spanish as the Grupo Beta, has in fact had the primary mission of protecting undocumented migrants from criminal attacks.
Mexican officials said that what the Zedillo Government was prepared to do about narcotics was to increase the exchange of intelligence between the two countries and step up their cooperation in fighting money laundering by traffickers. The administration has also made those commitments in the past.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Tentatively Approves $7.8 Billion Loan to Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
While skirmishing over a proposed emergency aid package for Mexico continued in the United States Congress, Mexican officials announced here today that the International Monetary Fund had tentatively agreed to lend Mexico $7.8 billion, the largest loan made by the organization in its 50-year history.
The Mexican officials said they believed that the money, because of the international commitment it represents, would boost Mexico's chances of getting the larger package of loan guarantees from the United States. Opponents of the $40 billion American package have complained that the United States would bear too much of the burden for Mexico's rescue. 
 In Washington today, top Administration officials appeared for a second day of questions about the proposed loan guarantees, and garnered little support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, urged the Senate to vote for the loan guarantees to prevent a financial panic around the world.
Mr. Greenspan said that "if this was strictly about Mexico, I would say there is absolutely no reason" for a Federal bailout, adding, "But it is not just about Mexico."
Several senators said that while helping Mexico was a laudable national goal, they were having a difficult time explaining to constituents why American taxpayer dollars should be put at risk to bail out Mexican leaders -- and American investors who put $16 billion into short-term Mexican bonds -- while Orange County, Calif., is permitted to go into bankruptcy without Federal intervention.
"I know no one in the financial community who is against this," said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. "I know no one in my constituency who is for it. There is no support."
At a news conference at the National Palace in Mexico City today, Guillermo Ortiz, the Finance Minister, and Miguel Mancera Aguayo, Governor of Mexico's Central Bank, said the Monetary Fund's loan would complement but not replace the $40 billion in proposed guarantees by the United States.
Whatever money Mexico draws from the fund must be paid back in three to five years. Mexico could use the money the way it uses its international reserves, to buy pesos to stabilize the currency or pay off maturing bonds.
Loans guaranteed by the United States could last as long as 10 years, allowing Mexico to rearrange and extend its external debt, which is now dangerously concentrated in bonds lasting one year or less. As confidence in Mexico wanes, investors are redeeming those short-term bonds in large numbers, putting increasing strains on the Mexican economy.
Mexico wants to use the United States guarantees to issue long-term bonds to replace up to $28 billion in short-term bonds that are indexed to dollars and will fall due this year.
To make the $7.8 billion loan announced today, the International Monetary Fund had to make a rare exception to its rules. Mexico still owes the fund more than three-quarters of a $4.8 billion loan authorized in 1989. Each of the 179 member nations may borrow against an established quota, but outstanding loans from the fund must be deducted from that amount.
The rule was waived in this case, but Mexican officials had to submit a disciplined economic recovery plan, and agree to the fund's supervision for the duration of the loan.
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, said in a statement today that Mexico's recovery plan was "strong, coherent and credible."
The fund's executive board is expected to vote on the loan commitment on Wednesday, with approval all but certain.

HEADLINE: Fishing Rights Ruling With Bounty of Anger

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SUQUAMISH, Wash., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Chief Seattle, who is buried here within view of the city that was given his name, died more than 120 years ago. But a treaty he signed with a simple "X" in 1855 continues to haunt ancestors of the Americans who claimed this land from the natives.
Citing a clause in that treaty giving 15 tribes in the region fishing rights, a Federal court ruling last month gave Indians the right to take up to half of the shellfish from Puget Sound, one of the nation's top producers of oysters, crabs and clams. 
 With the ruling, the Indians plan to begin harvesting shellfish from private beaches, state parks, even areas where commercial oyster growers have set up elaborate farms. Land owners, outraged over the decision, which they call a grave threat to property rights, say they may press Congress to abrogate parts of the 19th-century treaty.
The ruling by Judge Edward Rafeedie of Federal District Court in Los Angeles has generated new animosity between Indians and non-Indians who have been fighting over fishing rights for most of this century. Two weeks ago, gunshots were fired over the heads of Indians who were digging clams on a beach on the Olympic Peninsula.
No one was hurt, but some property owners say the gunshots could be a harbinger of things to come if the Indians try to take shellfish from private land.
"Things are starting to heat up," said Bill Dewey, manager of an oyster farm and a spokesman for 65 shellfish growers in Puget Sound. The court ruling, he said, "has the potential to devastate this industry, and people are very upset."
The dispute hangs on a few words in a treaty dated Jan. 22, 1855, signed by Chief Seattle and dozens of other leaders of various Puget Sound tribes, with Isaac Stevens, the territorial Governor. Recent court rulings have interpreted a clause in that treaty to mean that the Indians get half of the valuable fish in the Puget Sound area. This clause has proven to be a continual struggle in the multimillion-dollar fishing industry.
In some years, Puget Sound, with more than 2,000 miles of coastline on inlets, fjords and islands, is the leading shellfish producer in the nation. Its oyster and clams, particularly the huge geoducks that can fetch $8 a pound in Asian markets, are sold worldwide. The shellfish growers say they will not be able to operate their businesses if Indians come onto their tidelands.
The Indians, who now take less than 4 percent of Puget Sound's shellfish harvest, mostly from public land, say the property owners are overreacting. They say they can harvest half the tideland marine bounty without disturbing the saltwater farms that have been developed over the last century.
Their treaty, signed by President Franklin Pierce, approved by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, is not something that should be subject to political whim, the Indians say.
"Treaty rights are property rights, but you don't hear the property rights freaks in the new Congress or the Washington State Legislature coming to our defense," said Tony Forsman, executive director of the Suquamish Tribe, one of the 15 tribes that have signed treaties allowing them to take fish from Puget Sound. "You hear all this talk about the 'Contract with America,' and the Contract with Washington State. What about the contract with the Indians?"
The Suquamish, whose small reservation is just across Puget Sound from Seattle, have about 800 members. Chief Seattle was a leader of the Suquamish and the Duwamish, another Puget Sound tribe.
The treaty of Point Elliott, which Chief Seattle signed, is similar in wording to other treaties Governor Stevens made in a whirlwind tour around the Pacific Northwest.
In each of these treaties, the Indians ceded most of Washington Territory to the United States, in return for reservations, a cash payment and the right of taking fish at usual and accustomed places "in common with all citizens of the Territory."
Twenty years ago, in a decision that set off a war of words, vandalism and lawsuits, Judge George Boldt of Federal District Court in Seattle ruled that the phrase "in common with" in the treaty meant that the tribes could take up to half of all the salmon in Washington. That ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court.
Last month, Judge Rafeedie extended Judge Boldt's ruling to shellfish. But he went another step as well. The treaty says that tribes cannot take shellfish "from any beds staked or cultivated by citizens." But Judge Rafeedie said the tribes could harvest clams or naturally occurring shellfish that may lie beneath the cultivated beds. This interpretation surprised both sides.
"A lot of oyster farmers cultivate natural production to help their farms," Mr. Dewey said. "What this court ruling means is that the Indians could come in and get 50 percent of our labors, without paying anything for it. That makes it impossible to run a business."
In addition, waterfront property owners are concerned about the ruling, which they fear will let Indians will trespass on their yards and driveways to get to the tidelands.
"It's our view that the Indians gave up the right to any access to this property once they ceded it to the United States," said James M. Johnson, a lawyer for United Property Owners of Washington.
The Indians of Puget Sound have been in court for decades, trying to uphold the fishing provisions of their treaties. In more than 30 cases in the Federal appeals courts, the Indians have lost only once.
Now, with the shellfish ruling, the Indians say they see a chance to build a new tribal economy in a fast-growing industry, worth at least $30 million annually in Puget Sound.
The shellfish growers have proposed that the Indians get their 50 percent on designated public beaches. Before the court ruling, the tribes had proposed numerous settlements, including an offer somewhat similar to the one now promoted by the shellfish industry.
It was rejected, Mr. Forsman of the Suquamish Tribe said, because "these political leaders have not had the guts to stand up and deal with us on a government-to-government basis." Mr. Forsman was one of the main negotiators for the Indians. After the tribes won in court, they said they had no incentive to renegotiate.
Property owners say there is an incentive. If the Indians start harvesting shellfish from private land, as they indicated they will in a plan put forth two weeks ago, they will face harassment and threats to their lives, property owners say.
"If they go ahead and hit the beaches, there's probably going to be more people shooting over their heads and other problems," Mr. Dewey said.
The Indians cannot start harvesting half the shellfish until Judge Rafeedie enters his final order. He has asked that all sides submit a plan to him, by the end of January, outlining how they would manage the shellfish.
The shellfish industry and property owners have appealed his decision. If they get to the Supreme Court, they feel they have a backdoor chance with the new, more conservative court, to overturn the much more significant Boldt decision on salmon.

HEADLINE: Civil Justice System Is Overhaul Target

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Major proposals for remaking the civil justice system, long a priority of the Republican right, are almost certain to reach the floor of Congress within the next few months. But the thrust of proposed changes is still much in doubt.
House Republicans have pledged a quick vote on The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act, a grab bag of measures intended to strengthen defenses against torts, lawsuits seeking damages -- what Corporate America sees as an unprincipled attack on property and enterprise and what many consumer groups see as their leverage against corporate power. 
 But some Senate Republicans hope to redirect Congress's energies toward less ideologically charged questions regarding the cost of civil justice. Their goal is to force plaintiffs and defendants to think long and hard before taking cases to court -- and, in the process, assure swift resolution of disputes and a slashing of the nation's legal bills by tens of billions of dollars.
While there is bitter disagreement over the virtues of the Senate and House proposals, both friends and foes characterize the Senate's approach as revolutionary. "These initiatives are more Draconian than any we have previously seen," said Pamela Gilbert, the legislative counsel for the Malkin & Ross law firm who has served as the senior lobbyist for consumer groups opposed to overhauling product liability laws. "Together, they would virtually eliminate tort actions."
Changes to the rules governing damage suits have been a political issue for at least two decades. Proponents focus on the impulse of courts to pick the deepest pocket and the incentives to fraud. Opponents defend the system as the best way of assuring justice to the average American. But the political debate has largely been driven by financial interest.
On one side are businesses and insurers seeking to limit their liability. On the other are independent plaintiffs' lawyers whose incomes are leveraged on both the volume of claims and the size of settlements and jury awards. Plaintiffs' lawyers have won most of the legislative battles, often with the quiet cooperation of the defense bar, which also has a financial stake in keeping the lawsuits coming.
While civil justice reform does not rank with affirmative action or welfare as a hot button for the Rush Limbaugh crowd, it probably commands greater support from the new Republican Congressional majority than the higher-profile provisions of the "Contract With America" -- in part because it places Republicans squarely on the side of business, large and small, and against the trial lawyer bar. What is more, the change in Congressional leadership will make it difficult for opponents to block floor votes.
The civil justice measures in the "Contract With America" are relatively easy to analyze because most have been pressed by business lobbies for some time.
Most prominent is a "loser pays" rule, under which the loser in a court case would pay both sides' lawyers' fees. Proponents see it as the answer to what they consider a legal form of blackmail, cases in which plaintiffs make unsubstantiable claims because they know it is cheaper for defendants to settle than to go to war. The plaintiffs' bar has generally condemned "loser pays," saying it would discourage many ordinary citizens from filing justified lawsuits. Last week, the American Bar Association's committee on litigation denounced the proposal as "a regressive tax on the right to litigate."
The "honesty in evidence" provision is drawn from the same ideological well. It would bar the admission of expert testimony in Federal court unless the testimony was based on "scientifically valid reasoning" and the expert's compensation was not linked to the outcome of the case.
The target is what Peter W. Huber, an engineer and lawyer, called "junk science" in his book "Galileo's Revenge" (Basic Books, 1993). But Tom McGarity, a law professor at the University of Texas who is identified with plaintiffs' rights, said the Supreme Court had already given judges sufficient discretion to shield juries from disreputable evidence. Professor McGarity worries that the new test would lock in establishmentarian views of science.
"The courts are not qualified to judge scientific merit," Professor McGarity argued in a recent interview.
The House Republicans' proposed changes in product liability laws also fit the business-versus-trial lawyers' mold. Defendants would be liable for punitive damages only where there was "clear and convincing evidence" of malice. "Joint liability" for pain and suffering would be ended, effectively blocking disproportionately large claims against defendants who had played minor roles in causing injury. And product sellers would be liable only for the harm they themselves caused. Kmart could thus not be punished for selling a poorly designed chain saw.
Yet another big-ticket item on the House's civil justice agenda is a change in securities law that would limit "strike" lawsuits, class-actionsuits by owners of securities who claim that management has exaggerated a company's health. Proponents acknowledge that stockholders need some means of redress, but argue that the right has been abused by trial lawyers who have turned the process into high-stakes extortion.
"Management can't afford to bet the company's future on a jury verdict," said Tom Proulx, a co-founder of Intuit, a California software company, who is now leading a coalition opposed to strike suit abuses. "Even meritless cases must be settled."
While House Republicans wish to tilt the torts playing field, two Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Spencer Abraham of Michigan, want to change the nature of the game. Their goal is not to stop unmerited legal claims, but to drive down the cost of civil justice by deterring litigants from using expensive legal strategies and by giving lawyers incentives to settle.
For starters, the two would abolish the "collateral source" rule that allows a successful plaintiff to collect once from his own insurer and a second time from the defendant.
Trial lawyers have long argued that plaintiffs should not be penalized because they were prudent enough to buy insurance. But Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization, says that the most significant result is overuse of the health care system. He notes that in Hawaii, where the state provides universal health insurance, tort claimants averaged 53 visits each to chiropractors, costs that would have to be compensated a second time by losing defendants.
Also high on the McConnell-Abraham list is a measure to prevent plaintiffs' lawyers from taking excessive contingency fees when substantial compensation is never in doubt. Where the defense made an early offer of settlement -- say, $100,000 -- and the offer was accepted, the plaintiff's lawyer would be able to collect only reasonable hourly fees. Where the plaintiff rejected the $100,000, his lawyer would be permitted to collect only a fixed percentage of an award in excess of the originally offered sum.
"Attorneys' compensation should be proportional to what they risk," said Jeffrey O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia who, with Mr. Horowitz, has provided much of the intellectual horsepower behind the Senate proposals.
Most striking, the two Republicans would expand on a radical idea offered a decade ago by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is now the House minority leader. Where, early on, a defendant acknowledged liability for economic losses -- the plaintiff's lost income, uncovered medical bills and the like -- he would not be liable for punitive awards or pain and suffering damages unless the plaintiff could demonstrate "willful misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt."
The point, Senator McConnell said, is to keep cases from dragging "when the parties just want to get it over with." Both sides, he said, stand to benefit: Defendants would avoid the risk of giant losses, while injured plaintiffs would not wait years for compensation.
Trial lawyers counter that there is more to law than "getting it over with," asserting that justice requires adequate incentives to go to court.
Just how the politics of civil justice reform will sort out is anyone's guess. While Republican leaders are sympathetic to the idea of delivering bills for early floor votes, the committees with jurisdiction could bog down on other parts of the Republican agenda.
First clues will come from the response to Congressional hearings, which will probably be held next month in both houses. Bill Kristol, a Republican strategist and chairman of the Project for a Republican Future, said much would depend on how the issues were framed.
"Republicans need to make this a pro-citizen initiative, not a pro-business one," Mr. Kristol said.
In the Senate, legislation may be broken into pieces, with product liability, securities law and the McConnell-Abraham proposals considered separately. There may be tactical advantages to one big push, but supporters worry that the least-popular provisions could leave the entire effort vulnerable to filibuster, the way provisions favoring drug companies helped sink product liability legislation last year.
"If 41 people are against you," Senator McConnell recalled, "you're dead."
Perhaps the greatest imponderable is the role of the White House. In the debate on product liability legislation, President Clinton cautiously sided with opponents of change.
But in the aftermath of midterm elections, some members of the White House staff have reportedly been lobbying for a fresh look at civil justice, one that might help the President reclaim the role of New Democrat. From this perspective, the McConnell-Abraham proposals may offer Mr. Clinton an attractive alternative to the House Republicans' approach.
"He could take credit for a bill that helps the people who work hard and play by the rules," Mr. Kristol said.
For the moment, the President has no official position. All that Abner Mikva, the White House counsel, will say is, "The Administration is looking at the options."

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW;
Bolivar as an Idealist Thwarted by Messy Reality

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 26

 BODY:
Toward the end of Thea Musgrave's intriguing new opera, "Simon Bolivar," which is receiving its world premiere performances at the Virginia Opera here this week, there is a scene in which the many flaws of the work recede to the background, and the vital episodes of this acidic score come together. Bolivar, who is still known in South America as El Libertador for his fight against Spanish colonial rule, is ill and near the close of his career.
After bloody battles, he has led six countries to freedom, but he has also been stymied again and again in his attempts to unify them. There have been conflicts among his generals, quarrels over whether to compromise the revolution's ideals and outrage over his own lust for power. 
The scene depicts him in a fevered delirium in which figures from his past emerge out of choral clamor to condemn his actions; he begins to see his life's work unravel. The music also recapitulates its past: the thudding rhythms of battle, the dissonances of sinuous wind lines, a drone that has been a sign of dread, and fragments of biting lyricism. The opera, in this scene, shows what it might have been with a tighter conception, and what it still is, intermittently: a tragedy, in which honorable political goals become muddied, and idealism is thwarted by messy human realities. Shortly thereafter, the stage Bolivar despairingly sings what the real Bolivar actually wrote: "Those who serve a revolution plough the sea."
In the excellent performance I saw on Thursday night (the last will be on Sunday, before a short run in Richmond), this was the emotional climax of an evening that was alternately powerful and predictable. Ms. Musgrave, who was born in Scotland, is something of a "house" composer here. Her husband, Peter Mark, is the general director and principal conductor of the Virginia Opera and this is the fourth of her operas he has presented (including "Mary, Queen of Scots," which also came to the New York City Opera).
"Bolivar" was originally commissioned by the Los Angeles Music Center Opera and the Scottish Opera, both of which canceled their plans to stage it, apparently because of economic problems. Mr. Mark took it on, led a polished performance, and made certain that it was given a striking production by Lillian Garrett-Groag, with sets by John Conklin. The opera will also be given an entirely different production in March at the Staatstheater Regensburg, in Germany.
Mr. Conklin created a look for this work in his "Ghosts of Versailles" manner: a unit stage that shows a room from a classical museum in which plaster has fallen, pillars are awry and a giant Napoleonic picture inspired by David hangs crookedly at mid-stage. This set is bothersome at first because of its blunt symbolism of revolution and old-world wreckage. But Ms. Musgrave's opera quickly segues from one battle scene or encounter to the next in a restless, abridged version of Bolivar's life, running events on fast-forward, so that Mr. Conklin's unchanging design actually ends up giving some surreal coherence to the historical fantasy.
But one of the work's problems is that Ms. Musgrave is of two minds. She wants to be both a realist and an idealist about Bolivar, a tragedian and a soap-box orator, and the two styles wrestle with each other. There is no need, for example, for the dutiful piling on of battle scenes (finely choreographed by Holly Harbinger, who has billing as "Fight Master") or for the crudely conceived framing of the work. It begins with a revolutionary teacher, Simon Rodriguez, raising young Bolivar's political consciousness, and ends in a modern dictatorship in South America, where Rodriguez's contemporary counterpart does the same for a latter-day Bolivar who gazes up in awe at a gargantuan statue of the revolutionary. This is Ms. Musgrave making points rather than making drama.
In fact, her score is too full of italics. The battle scenes use tapes of real gunfire and by the middle of the work, the rebellious music has become so unrelentingly aggressive that there is nowhere else for it to go. Even the choice of language is partly politically motivated. Ms. Garrett-Groag, who is Argentine, convinced Ms. Musgrave to translate her English libretto into Spanish and provide English supertitles, perhaps in a quest for cultural authenticity; this was to no great advantage, since the singers did little to make a case for the language's sound and style.
But Ms. Musgrave is also too talented a dramatist to let this be simply another operatic life of a political saint. When the music succeeds, it manages to evoke a mixture of aspiration, frustration and anger that Ms. Musgrave sees in Bolivar. Stephen Guggenheim did not quite have the right heroic tenor to pull this off; he tended toward a light, somewhat tight sound, without giving the character's constant duress enough color or modulation. Ms. Musgrave's portrait of Manuela, the woman Bolivar loves, is actually the most compelling; her lyrical singing lines can have a fearsome power; a despairing second-act aria surges with fiery bitterness. Amy Johnson's soprano is not sensuous, but its skillfully used, slightly edgy precision brought the role to life.
The score also glinted with imagination when its obsessive Expressionism was tempered with elements of South American folklore, including a dance that Bolivar himself knew, a Venezuelan melody, and, in a private joke, a pavane that comes from Ms. Musgrave's "Mary."
More of that imagination would have helped the structure of the drama as well. Had this opera tried to tell less of Bolivar's life with fiery musical rhetoric, and focused more closely on the nuanced psychological and political confrontations in the second act, had it avoided preaching and not retreated from its tragic insights, it would have borne a large harvest; as it was, there was much to admire, but much energy was also spent ploughing the sea.

Orioles Are the Pride Of America

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
IT'S nice to hear elected public servants talking about ending the baseball strike. But how can we help them?
I have a suggestion. Go out and buy a Baltimore Orioles baseball cap and wear it, day and night, until further notice. Their black-and-orange insignia has become a symbol of resistance to scab baseball. 
 Forget all the flapdoodle of the Dallas Cowboys being America's Team. That was just a marketing slogan from a haughty regional football team.
It is fitting that the Baltimore Orioles play only a few miles from Fort McHenry, where Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner." The Baltimore Orioles are America's Team now.
"I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my baseball," -- Nathan Hale Angelos.
The Baltimore Orioles respect the baseball fans of America. The owner, Peter Angelos, is on record that he would rather play no games at all than send out a team of replacement players.
"Give me baseball or give me death," -- Patrick Henry Angelos.
A lawyer who has worked with unions, a newcomer to baseball, Angelos does not want to insult the history of baseball by digging up stock clerks and putting them in the uniform worn by both Robinsons and all the Ripkens, too. Now America must use the Orioles' ball cap as its banner.
"Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, But spare my Orioles' dignity," -- John Greenleaf Whittier Angelos.
Why wear the cap of one of the new-breed crotch-grabbers of the National Basketball Association? Never mind the faddish San Jose Sharks cap. Forget about the black-and-white Raiders cap that once stood for mindless biker-style resistance. Give up the black-and-white Chicago White Sox cap. Put away your old Jordan Bulls cap. Both those teams are owned by Jerry Reinsdorf, one of the leaders of the salary cap-or-scabs movement.
Even in the dead of winter, wear that Orioles ball cap, particularly if you're inside the Beltway. They're starting to pay attention now. Yesterday, President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, both offered their services to help end this strike.
The politicians are apparently hearing from merchants in Florida and Arizona who fear a huge drop in tickets and hotels and restaurants for the annual pilgrimmage to spring training if the owners send in the clowns.
The President set a deadline of Feb. 6 for the owners and the players to settle their grievances.
If it does not happen before then, the President and the Senator could presumably put bipartisan pressure on Congress to rescind baseball's exemption from antitrust legislation. Even that gesture would be worth something at this point. It's getting ugly out there.
Owners are holding ludicrous tryout camps, bringing in nobodies. The owners are issuing pious statements that they will cut ticket prices for these threatened scab games. Some lumbering oaf is going to wear the uniform of Willie Mays. Some splay-footed reject is going to wear the uniform of Roberto Clemente. Some incompetent is going to wear the uniform of Al Kaline. How dare they?
Only one other team has shown respect for baseball. The Toronto Blue Jays, forbidden by provincial law from using replacement players, might play their so-called official games in Florida, but at least the Blue Jays' management will not force Cito Gaston and his coaches to work with these desperadoes. The club leadership understands it would be wrong to make proud baseball people work in public with unskilled labor. For that, all Canadian baseball fans should wear a Blue Jays cap, as a sign of respect for the game.
There are complex issues to be worked out. The players, of course, are arrogant and overpaid and simplistic, and wouldn't identify with other unions. But it is the owners who are still fixated on a salary cap to solve the troubles they made by spending too much money. The owners have put vendors and ushers out of work in the big cities; now they threaten hotel maids and busboys with unemployment in Florida and Arizona. I'm sure they don't care.
Put on your Blue Jays cap in Canada. Put on your Orioles cap in the States. Let the caps send the owners and the players and the politicians a message: Baseball, yes. Scabs, never.

HEADLINE: Governor Whitman's Trade-Offs

 BODY:
The popularity of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's plan to cut New Jersey's personal income tax by 30 percent in three years cannot be disputed. Her swift delivery on that promise has propelled her onto national television and high up the list of potential Republican nominees for Vice President.
But the publicity must not obscure the facts. Mrs. Whitman tells the nation that she and her party stand for smaller government, but the $15.9 billion budget she presented this week is $1 billion more than the last one by the previous Governor, Jim Florio. What's more, her stunning record of income tax reduction has overshadowed its less welcome accompaniment: increases in other taxes in the name of fees and "closing loopholes," and postponement of state expenses through long-term borrowing and the delay of payments to public pension funds. 
 Some of Mrs. Whitman's proposals seem blind to the people they hit. She wants to tax the full price of discounted items purchased with store coupons, a move that targets the thrifty and the poor. She also pretends her proposal to continue a supposedly temporary surcharge on motor vehicle registrations is not a new tax. Those who expected it to expire on schedule are entitled to disagree.
On a larger point, the Democrats have scored with their charge that she is forcing local property taxes up by curbing state aid to localities and school districts. She asserts, disingenuously, that the state has no say over property taxes. In reality it has considerable sway. What Trenton does affects local budgets in all sorts of ways.
However, the Democrats' assertion of a direct link lacks proof, too. Common sense says they are right; if state aid goes down, local taxes are apt to go up. But there is another option -- less local spending. To that end, Mrs. Whitman's new budget includes two innovative incentives -- penalties for school districts with excessive administrative costs, and rewards for districts that save money through regional cooperation.
As for her spending program, Mrs. Whitman is frank to admit it involves pain. While total aid to schools is up, most of the increase goes properly to "special-needs" urban school systems; roughly half the state's districts will take a cut. Her most striking proposal for savings is a plan to eliminate 3,400 state jobs, primarily through privatization. Perhaps some jobs are not needed. Even so, this is a brutal transference of state salaries into the pockets of taxpayers.
The strength of economic recovery in New Jersey has helped Mrs. Whitman cut taxes even faster than she promised. But the boldness of her move in that direction is diminished by her lack of concern for future taxpayers who will face the bills she postpones.

HEADLINE: Myopia on Mexico

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has failed to rally Congressional support for its plan to stabilize Mexico's peso. That is alarming. The crisis threatens to engulf not only Mexico but other recently reformed Latin American economies as well. U.S. financial interests are also at risk, from Wall Street speculators to the pension and mutual-fund accounts of millions of middle-class Americans. Finally, the crisis is a major test of Washington's ability to act decisively in an international emergency that is as close to home as those emergencies come.
Yet even after hearing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the Federal Reserve's Alan Greenspan describe the economic dangers, and Secretary of State Christopher the diplomatic consequences, members of House and Senate committees remained decidedly cool to the package. The plan would provide $40 billion in loan guarantees, at minimum financial risk to the U.S. 
 That is a troubling start to a Congressional session in which bipartisanship will be required on matters of vital national interest. There has been little political courage on this issue from either party, but Democrats are most conspicuously to blame. Most of them opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which only passed because most Republicans voted for it. Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, hint they would be willing to mobilize Republican support behind the guarantees, but only if the Democrats share the political risks.
Some Congressmen believe, wrongly, that the guarantees would help Mexico at the expense of the U.S. Populists criticize the rescue package as a bailout of rich speculators, which, in part, it is. Liberal Democrats want to use the loan guarantee legislation as a way to reopen negotiations on Nafta, particularly on issues like wages and working conditions in Mexico. Conservative Republicans want to use it to impose structural changes in the way Mexico runs its economy -- forcing Mexico, for example, to establish an independent currency board and privatize its state oil company.
All these goals have merit. But holding the loan guarantees hostage to them flagrantly offends Mexican sovereignty. President Ernesto Zedillo, who is already under fire for his insistence on freer markets and more democracy, among other things, could never agree to such conditions. Humiliating the Zedillo Government would set back the goals of both American liberals and conservatives.
With a volatile crisis south of the border and back-benchers of both parties paralyzed by shortsightedness, the Clinton Administration and Republican and Democratic leaders of both houses need to work together to make clear the importance of passing the Mexican loan guarantees without further delay.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
$40 Billion Questions

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
It's a normal thing: ask for a loan, or go co-signer, and you have to answer a few questions.
We don't want to seem stingy or mean, but maybe U.S. and Mexican officials involved in the Mexican economic disaster would not mind skipping their press conferences and do a little answering under oath. After all -- $40 billion, you know. 
 1. Exactly when did these officials find out Mexico was in deep trouble because of its borrowing from foreign and Mexican investors?
Two New York Times correspondents (David E. Sanger and Anthony DePalma) report that in the summer of 1994, both governments knew about it. Which officials, please?
2. Seeing trouble coming, what did they publicly tell Mexicans and Americans so they could hold up before buying more pesos or bonds?
Nothing, it appears, even though some investors were getting private word that made them antsy.
3. Why the silence?
The Mexicans did not want to interfere with the grand economic press they were getting, or with the ambitions of two politicians. Ernesto Zedillo wanted to be elected president. The outgoing President, Carlos Salinas, wanted to be chosen head of the World Trade Organization. Any audible gurgles from a Mexican economy drowning in debt would not do either man much good.
4. And the U.S.: Could it be that the Administration had so enthusiastically promoted Mexico that it would have been terribly embarrassing -- an election coming up and all -- to disclose that Mexico "suddenly" could not go on backing up its pesos and bonds unless the U.S. offered heavy loans to bail out investors?
These questions and others raised by the conduct of the two Governments point to deliberate concealment of important reality -- cover-up, you might say.
So: It is not common sense to lend $40 billion more to a country whose leaders so botched things up, to be handled by the same American officials who participated in tamping down the economic truth.
The Administration and some investors tell us not to worry -- the collateral will be Mexico's oil revenues. Also we will watch their economy, like regular hawks.
Great: First we become the day-to-day overseers of the Mexican economy. The Mexican people will just love that. Then, if Mexico defaults, Sheriff Yanqui goes in and grabs the oil revenues that it regards as a national patrimony.
The only way the Mexican Government could prevent a revolution would be to renege on oil payments before the first one was made.
Americans who talk about seizing Mexican oil revenue seem never to understand the deep national emotions of third-world citizens -- particularly when told to shut up because they can't afford pride.
Given those passions, the political explosiveness of the collateral and the cover-up record, the loan carries risk and is not the failproof "loan guarantee" both countries say it is.
Then the question is if the $40 billion is needed to save Mexico and the world economy. Who says so?
Representative Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, is proposing something less grandiose. He says lend Mexico less than $10 billion, for one year. Then use our clout in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to get them to take over. That would reduce U.S. risk, but not thrill the other nations. (If the collateral is sound and the cause so important, why do Germany and Japan, eager trading partners of Mexico, so demurely hang back from making the loan?)
Economic aid is often justified -- but not $40 billion to a country whose mess was created by the cowardice of bureaucrats and the mistakes of investors, theirs and ours.
Americans would be foolish -- I am being exquisitely polite today -- if they agreed to any loan before they found out which American and Mexican investors would be the big beneficiaries. Then, we need aloof testimony from expert non-officials and non-politicians on how much damage would really be done if the loan is refused.
Would it touch off world crisis -- or just prevent losses that countries and investors should handle themselves -- if they want to play big shots in a free market?
And those questions at the beginning -- even for a miserable $10 billion, sworn testimony would be nice.

HEADLINE: Margaret Kahn Ryan, 93, Financier's Daughter, Dies

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.
She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said. 
 Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.
She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.
Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."
When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.
The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."
Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."
Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.
In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.
Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.
Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.
Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Mexico Needs Vigorous Growth, Not Austerity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ronald I. McKinnon's "Flood of Dollars, Sunken Pesos" (Op-Ed, Jan. 20) is one of the few accounts of Mexico's financial crisis that focuses on the devastating role of foreign investors. But Mr. McKinnon identifies only half of their fault. 
 He points to the international bankers and mutual fund investors, mostly in the United States, who were "eager to overlend" -- pushing capital into Mexico during 1993 and 1994 -- but are "jittery" investors and "likely to pull their money out in a crisis." Yet he misses the point that the specified crisis was not so much generated inside the Mexican economy as precipitated by the foreign investors themselves, together with rich Mexican nationals, when they lost their nerve last year, in reaction to Mexico's political, not economic, disturbances, and pulled out huge amounts of capital.
Mexico's deficit on current account was not troublesome in itself. And it is incorrect to attribute the deficit to domestic inflation (since inflation actually fell from 145 percent a year in 1989 to 8 percent in 1993 and still less in 1994). Nor was the deficit due to any runaway consumption and importation (the rise of Mexican imports in 1994 was mostly covered by rising exports).
From this we can see the error of the Zedillo "recovery plan," which is to reduce import excess by imposing domestic austerity, in effect causing a recession. What Mexico needs is a return to vigorous growth, with renewed inflow of foreign capital. For this, the proposed international guarantees on Mexico's loans are essential.

HEADLINE: Mexico Needs Vigorous Growth, Not Austerity;
Free Trade as Welfare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The collapse of the Mexican peso and the call for a $40 billion bailout are only two of the nasty side effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement that many of us predicted two years ago. This is but the beginning of a process that will continue until Mexico is drained of natural resources and the United States is drained of jobs and money. 
 Recently you spoke editorially of the need to end "corporate welfare." Free trade is the greatest corporate welfare scheme of all. It is nothing more than a taxpayer-supported subsidy of multinational corporations, which have cut themselves free of any allegiance to the countries that spawned them. The result is that financial assets and production facilities are moved across international boundaries with no thought to the terrible social, environmental and economic consequences that follow.
President Clinton and Congress have a difficult choice to make. They can ward off economic collapse and possibly revolution in Mexico by spending $40 billion we don't have -- knowing that this solution is only temporary and the crisis will recur.
Or they can bite the bullet, find other, less costly ways of shoring up Mexico, and let the free-trade frenzy subside to a manageable level, even if some corporations are damaged in the process. For the sake of both the United States and Mexico, they should choose the second alternative.

HEADLINE: Where the Blue Paper Cups Are;
A Warehouse Store in Queens Serves Ethnic Traditions

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
After they have saved enough money frying breakfasts and washing produce, just before they are ready to fling open the doors of their gleaming new bagel shop or deli or diner, there is still one last ritual to perform, one rite of passage that will usher the foreign-born entrepreneurs into the mainstream of the culinary life in Queens.
They must buy their first case of Greek-style blue paper coffee cups. And most likely, they must purchase it at Zahner's Cash and Carry restaurant supplies in Woodside. 
 Each week, the vast, densely stocked warehouse store at 62-35 30th Avenue sells at least 400 cases of the takeout cups, which are so ubiquitous that they have become a staple of any police show or movie attempting to demonstrate its New York authenticity. At 1,000 cups a case, that's 1.7 million cups of "we are happy to serve you" a month, almost enough for a cup of overheated coffee for every man, woman and child in the borough.
And the cups' Hellenic statuary is no longer reserved for the Greek diners that first made them popular. Now they are demanded in bulk by Colombian coffee shops, Pakistani and Korean delis, and, increasingly, Arab- and Turkish-owned restaurants and stores. Serving coffee and milk in the blue cups has become an essential part of the immigrant restaurant experience.
"Everyone wants that cup, no matter what language they speak," said Elisa Deixler, the store's manager. "It's the only paper coffee cup we sell. Twenty-seven dollars a case, not including lids."
For Ms. Deixler and her staff of 40, selling paper goods, chinaware and bulk foods to the borough's restaurateurs has brought New York City's shifting immigration and economic patterns directly to their cash register. As it has for generations, the restaurant business remains a popular portal into the middle class for many newcomers, and the store's location at the center of northwest Queens puts it at ground zero of the city's most diverse ethnic-restaurant district.
To the north are the taverns and diners of Astoria, to the south the Irish pubs and Korean barbecues of Woodside and Sunnyside, to the east the Indian and South American restaurants of Jackson Heights and Corona. On any given morning, proprietors from all these ethnic group and more gather around the pot of free coffee at Zahner's cashier station, their two-level carts bulging with butter, soup stock, soybean oil, and paper goods.
Nichos Gregoriou, owner of the Pinocchio Greek restaurant in Astoria, was first in line on a recent day, stocking up on cases of tomato paste, Open Pit barbecue sauce and napkins. Behind him was Tony Esposito, owner of Pastafina Restaurant and Pizza on Third Avenue at 28th Street in Manhattan, buying 15 dozen eggs, 20 pounds of angel hair pasta, and cases of feta cheese and thyme. Peter Bodziony, whose mother owns Stylowa, a Polish restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was next, followed by Maissa Ahmed, proprietor of Maissa's Bagel Shop in Astoria.
Sipping a last coffee before they began the day's lunch preparations, the owners grumbled collectively about the state of the food-service economy.
"I come here almost every day from Manhattan because it's cheaper here in Queens, and these days every dollar counts," Mr. Esposito said. "That should tell you something about how business is doing."
"It's O.K. lately, not great but O.K.," said Ms. Ahmed, an agricultural engineer who came to New York four years ago from Egypt. "But there are many days when I want to go back home and be an engineer."
Ms. Ahmed, whose bagel shop supports her husband and four children, said many immigrants with a little money to invest continue to put it in the restaurant business, which allows them to build an independent economic base before moving on to other middle-class pursuits.
"People come here and want to work on their own," she said. "They do not want to work for someone else. You put in a lot of hours, but we all know how to cook and usually like to do it."
Ms. Ahmed confirmed the general impression at Zahner's that many more immigrants from the Middle East have been moving into the restaurant business lately. Scott Wexler, executive director of the New York Tavern and Restaurant Association, said he shared the sense that the Greek domination of the restaurant industry in Queens -- where coffee shops and diners have long predominated -- has given way to a far broader spectrum of owners.
"We're seeing a lot more different ethnicities," he said. "Frankly, I think it takes someone not experienced in the difficulties of working in the industry to want to get into it."
When Hy Cohen bought the bar-supply business from the Zahner family in the mid-1950's, it was a tiny operation in Jackson Heights without a single wok or phyllo pastry. Now, said Ms. Deixler, Hy Cohen's granddaughter, at least 90 percent of her customers have a first language other than English, and she has hired employees to match.
"We've got guys who speak Greek, Hindi and Spanish," she said. "Now what we need is somebody who speaks Korean. That would help a lot."
The store, one of the largest of its kind in the city, is unusual in two respects that have made it particularly popular with small ethnic restaurants. For one, it stocks everything from whisks and uniforms to bulk feta cheese and ketchup packets. For another, it is self-serve, allowing patrons with limited English to select or simply point to the items they want, rather than filling out an order form.
Its popularity has allowed the store to develop an early-warning system on demographic food trends. Over the last two years, employees realized that Greek immigrants were starting to prefer the more lucrative construction trades.
"All of a sudden, we started getting more requests for Arab pocket pita and less for gyros pita," said Marios Christodoulides, the store's Cypriot-born floor manager. "We knew something was going on."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Fire Away at Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Republicans were isolationist on peacekeeping but expansionist on NATO, cooperative on counterterrorism but stingy on the peso.
Granted, a single hearing of the House Committee on International Relations is not a Republican Rorschach test. But in their two-and-a-half-hour encounter today with Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the state of the world, the Republicans left no doubt that their approach to foreign policy would be more scattershot than strategic. 
 Despite the Republicans' determination to strengthen the United States economy, for example, more than one member attacked the Administration for its pro-business decision last year to ignore China's poor human rights record and to extend its trade privileges. By contrast, not one Republican brought up Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Russia's military assault on Chechnya was mentioned only in passing.
And while Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, argued that the United States should open its doors to the Cuban refugees in camps in Guantanamo, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, urged an airtight naval blockade should Fidel Castro again allow his people to flee.
The issue highest on the Republicans' agenda is to limit the American role in United Nations peacekeeping and in its financing.
In his testimony today, Mr. Christopher attacked the Republican plan, warning that it could leave the United States with an unacceptable choice for every emergency: "acting alone or doing nothing."
The House bill being discussed, which is similar to legislation introduced in the Senate, would both challenge the authority of the President as Commander in Chief and drastically change how the United States calculates its contributions to United Nations peacekeeping.
Under both plans, the President would have to seek Congressional approval to supply troops to a United Nations operation under a foreign commander, and the Pentagon would have to charge the United Nations for much of the equipment and services it now provides free.
Such an approach could cost the United Nations $ 1 billion a year, and much more if other countries that donate troops, equipment and services follow suit. If enacted, Mr. Christopher warned, the proposal "would threaten to end U.N. peacekeeping overnight," and would almost certainly lead others to withdraw their voluntary contributions.
Mr. Christopher said the proposal to force the President to seek Congressional approval before putting American troops under United Nations command "is unconstitutional, and it is certainly, in my judgment, very bad policy."
Mr. Christopher found an ally in Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, who asked whether the United States could have aided South Korea in the 1950's or fought to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 if the bill had been law then.
"They could not have," Mr. Christopher replied.
The committee is to complete a draft of the peacekeeping portion of the bill on Friday, before the measure goes to the floor, even though Representative Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and former chairman of the committee, contended that the Democrats had not seen the latest version and that he wanted to delay consideration until next week.
Even Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Christopher's Republican predecessor, told the committee two weeks ago that "micromanagement" of foreign policy was a "bad idea," and he admonishing members not to waste time challenging Presidential prerogatives.
For the most part, the Democrats today rallied around the Administration's foreign policy performance.
Proving that one's place in the pecking order of Washington can rise or fall abruptly, they chose heaped praise on Mr. Christopher, the man probably most excoriated for the foreign policy performance of the last two years.
"I find it interesting that thus far, you have not received a single commendation for the many achievements of your service as Secretary of State," Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, told Mr. Christopher. "So let me publicly state that on behalf of the vast majority of the American people, I want to thank you for your indefatigable efforts in so many parts of the world, for doing so much to bring about peace and prosperity on this globe."

HEADLINE: Haunted by Conspiracy

BYLINE: By Michael Eric Dyson; Michael Eric Dyson is author of "Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X."

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
The allegation that Malcolm X's daughter Qubilah Shabazz conspired to murder Louis Farrakhan focuses attention on two crucial issues: the persistent role of conspiracy theories in contemporary black culture and the contradictory legacy of Malcolm X, assassinated in a Harlem ballroom 30 years ago next month.
The Shabazz case brings to the surface a submerged but powerful current of lingering suspicions toward the Government. It is well known that for decades the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried out an aggressive campaign of monitoring and subverting black leaders and organizations. From the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Black Panthers, from Paul Robeson to Jesse Jackson, black activists were subjected to a range of perverse tactics designed to distort their public image and undercut their influence. 
 Such abuses dramatically increased the level of distrust, bordering on paranoia, of many blacks -- not only toward the Government but toward each other, as fellow activists sometimes turned out to be informers. Since then conspiracy theories have continued to proliferate, a ragtag combination of fact, fantasy and fear.
Unfortunately, the proponents of such theories sometimes ignore real culprits lying closer to home. In the 1960's political groups like the Black Panthers and Nation of Islam had authoritarian, almost repressive tendencies; anyone who raised objections to the group's strategy or criticized its leaders was dealt with harshly. Conspiracy theorists were quick to blame outside manipulation for the resulting turmoil, when the source of the trouble was clearly within.
Many blacks were caught in a dilemma. If they acknowledged the vicious acts of intimidation by the Government, they were admitting that conspiracy theorists had a point. But if they played down Government interference, because they suspected black groups of exploiting conspiracy thinking, then they risked understating the extent of outside manipulation.
The Shabazz accusation dredges up many of these anxieties. Unquestionably, the timing of the Government's announcement provoked enormous skepticism. If it knew about the alleged murder plot for seven months, why wait until now to bring charges, just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the assassination?
It is probably fruitless to hope for an answer to this question. But more important, we should not allow this sad and bizarre turn of events to distract us from the more difficult business of reassessing Malcolm X's life and work. And such a reassessment is overdue, for it could point the way toward a moral and social climate in which it no longer makes sense to kill a human being because the vision he or she promotes is strange or threatening.
Perhaps the most harmful legacy of 1960's militant nationalism is the idea that principles can be defended with violence. Though not always manifest in physical violence, intolerance is still expressed rhetorically in the black community. Malcolm X himself was known to call Martin Luther King Jr. "Uncle Tom" and "Reverend Dr. Chickenwing." But he was able to change his mind -- primarily because he was also able to criticize himself, a quality that sometimes seems to be extinct among American leaders.
In one facet of his thought, however, Malcolm's views never wavered. His harsh indictment of the depredations encouraged in the ghetto -- drugs, prostitution, hustling -- reflected a fundamental puritanism. Despite his withering public assaults on white morality, Malcolm, like many blacks, breathed in the ethical atmosphere of mainstream America.
His conservative morality in a sense prevented him from truly respecting or understanding aspects of black culture. He saw mostly pathology in the conk, the Lindy Hop and the zoot suit, largely because he associated them with his past, the days when he was Malcolm Little, an unrepentant hustler. Yet like contemporary hip-hop culture -- which Malcolm would most likely have condemned for its explicit sexuality and glamorization of drinking and drugs -- black ghetto culture of the 1940's and 50's must also be seen as a bulwark against the racism of the larger society that embodied the spirit of ordinary people.
Black youth today, for its part, has rightly fixed on Malcolm's rage at racism and economic misery. Angry words from his speeches have appeared in rap songs, on posters and on T-shirts. One can only hope that his humanitarian legacy will eventually prove as powerful a resource. Surely this is the most lasting feature of Malcolm X's thought -- the vision of social and personal transformation he expressed in his last year, when he renounced narrow nationalism and embraced people of all colors as brothers and sisters.
As we approach the 30th anniversary of his death, one of the greatest gifts black people can give one another is the ability to disagree -- and to turn our disagreements not into reprisals but into opportunities for communication and understanding.

The Economy
 Signs of slowdown were evident in a report showing that economic growth had accelerated to 4.5 percent. Despite the strong growth, the data also showed inventories of unsold goods climbed more rapidly than expected, suggesting that factory orders could taper off early this year. [Page 1.] 
 A top computer security expert is intent on catching hackers who used a new break-in technique to steal files from his own well-guarded computer. The stealth and sophistication of the attack indicated that many of the millions of computers connected to the global Internet network could be at risk. The expert, Tsutomu Shimomura, considers solving the crime a matter of honor. [33.]
 Orange County suspended all 17 employees of the treasurer's office after finding questionable accounting practices. [43.]
 
Companies
 Time Warner will pay $2.3 billion for the cable television business of Houston Industries. The acquisition would give Time Warner 690,000 subscribers in five states, strengthening its position as the nation's second-largest cable system operator. [33.]
 The effects of two jet crashes continue to weigh on USAir. The carrier estimated that it lost $110 million in revenues in the fourth quarter because passengers continued to avoid it after crashes in July and September. The estimate is in addition to the $40 million in revenue the airline said it lost in the third quarter. [33.]
 A hearing into the Sept. 8 crash of USAir Flight 427 was suspended to give Federal investigators more time. [6.]
 Complaints against Kidder Peabody and three former executives have been recommended by the S.E.C.'s New York office. The civil administrative charges being considered entail securities fraud in the case of Joseph Jett, who has been accused of manufacturing $350 million in phony bond trading profits. [33.]
 The Sumitomo Bank expects a loss of about $2.8 billion this fiscal year as it writes off mountains of bad loans. The disclosure was a stunning one in Japanese banking, which is typically conservative and taciturn. Few banks are expected to follow the lead of Sumitomo, the third-largest bank in the world. [33.]
 The Wellcome Trust still intends to sell its 39.5 percent stake in Wellcome to Glaxo despite management's rejection of the bid. The decision diminishes Wellcome's chances of evading a $14 billion hostile takeover offer by the rival British drug maker. [35.]
 Lockheed agreed to pay a $24.8 million penalty as it pleaded guilty to Federal charges of bribing an Egyptian legislator in the $79 million sale of three C-130 Hercules transport planes. [35.]
 
Markets
 Treasury bonds surged. Investors were heartened by data showing a high level of inventories, signaling a slowdown. [33.]
 Stocks ended little changed, with earnings news driving many stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.07 points. [34.]
 The dollar was weighed down by concerns about the prospects for the United States loan package to Mexico. [44.]
 Gold prices fell sharply after the Government reported strong growth but with low inflation. Energy prices also dropped. [44.]

 A plan to rescue Mexico is headed for defeat in the United States Congress, the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, warned. [3.]

 The retirement plan of Orange County employees may be at risk. The California county's bankruptcy serves as a warning for the millions of other people who work for states, local governments and nonprofit groups that offer similar retirement plans. [31.]

 Even the not-so-rich can now be venture capitalists. [32.]

HEADLINE: 17 Orange County Workers Are Suspended With Pay

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan. 27

 BODY:
All 17 employees of the Orange County treasurer's office were suspended with pay today after the discovery of still more questionable accounting practices within the agency.
"These irregularities are, in my opinion, serious," said Tom Daxon, the interim treasurer brought in from Oklahoma as part of the crisis team dealing with the bankruptcy of the nation's fifth-largest county. 
 The decision to place the entire staff on leave "came after discovering additional indications of accounting irregularities within the agency," the county said in a statement.
Mr. Daxon and other officials told a news conference there was no indication any of the employees placed on leave had broken any laws.
"We want to make certain that people who do business with Orange County understand that the business that goes on in the treasurer's office is beyond reproach," Mr. Daxon said. The vacated treasurer's office positions will be filled by county employees from other departments and selected county employees with finance and accounting skills.
Last Saturday, county officials said $85 million had been diverted into two special accounts at the treasurer's office. The latest estimate of this and other diversions is now between $130 million and $140 million, according to Mark Rohman, an expert with the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, which is reviewing the accounts.
The effect of the diversions was to transfer some losses from Orange County itself to about 135 California agencies participating in an investment pool, officials said.
Bruce Bennett, the lawyer heading the financial reorganization for the county, said it did not change the overall loss estimate of $1.7 billion.
The treasury office shake-up came a day after a top executive of KPMG Peat Markwick said the accounting firm's name had been incorrectly used to imply endorsement of a $600 million Orange County bond offering underwritten by Merrill Lynch & Company, the county's lead broker.
Merrill Lynch maintained that its dealings with the county had been proper. But Peat Marwick's assertion sheds new doubt on whether bond buyers were misled about the county's risky bets on interest rates.
Bond buyers have sued Merrill Lynch and have previously indicated they intend to add Peat Marwick and other professional advisers to the county as defendants.
The official statement for the bonds says twice that Peat Marwick approved inclusion of its auditing report and the 1992-93 Orange County financial data it had certified.

HEADLINE: Bonds Gain On Signs of A Slowdown

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds rallied yesterday, driving rates down to their lowest level in more than three months, on signs that the economy might be cooling off and that inflation remained in check.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 14/32 , to 9710/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.73 percent, from 7.83 percent on Thursday. The market had its biggest one-day gain yesterday since Dec. 2, and the 30-year bond's yield was the lowest since Oct. 19, when it was 7.67 percent. 
 For investors, the last three days of trading have added about $21.25 for each $1,000 of bonds.
While the Commerce Department reported yesterday that the economy grew at a strong 4.5 percent pace in the last quarter of 1994, the data also showed that inventories of unsold goods climbed more rapidly than expected. The high level of inventories signals that production and growth could slow if consumers cut back spending.
The other positive in the report on gross domestic product was the inflation data. The implicit deflator number, which measures pricing within the overall economy, was up 1.6 percent, from 1.9 percent in the previous quarter, and up 2.1 percent for 1994 -- the lowest rise in 30 years.
The data "suggest that we have yet to see evidence of a pickup in inflation," said Michael Englund, chief economist at MMS International in San Francisco. "In general, it also helps to lock in the expected 50- basis-point Fed increase next week," he said. The Federal Reserve, which last raised short-term interest rates on Nov. 15 by 75 basis points, is widely expected to increase rates after its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
While many traders and analysts say they expect the next increase by the Fed to be its last for some time, Mr. Englund said he saw at least one more increase coming at the Fed's March 31 policy meeting. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times since last February in an effort to slow the economy and prevent inflation from accelerating.
Bond prices have climbed since Wednesday, when Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate Budget Committee that the "torrid growth is slowing down." Mr. Greenspan's testimony instilled confidence among investors that the Fed's strategy was working.
Prices of municipal bonds and mortgage securities also surged yesterday.
Although there were signs that growth may slow in the months ahead, the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter still showed that the economy was strong, a fact that makes it even more likely that the Fed will raise rates next week. Mr. Englund of MMS International said, "It was obvious from the G.D.P. estimate that there was sufficient widespread momentum in the fourth quarter, despite efforts by the Fed to slow basic growth." He said strength in consumption had run above the trend for the last three years.
Among the signs of strength in the fourth quarter were equipment spending, which grew at a 20 percent clip. "The interest-rate-sensitive equipment sector is further evidence that the Fed's efforts to slow the economy have thus far been inadequate," Mr. Englund said.
The bond market will next turn its attention to next week's announcement by the Treasury about the size of its quarterly refunding and the Government's report on January employment, which will be released on Friday.

HEADLINE: Stocks Finish Mixed On Economic Report

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday, despite a rally for bonds that saw their biggest gains in more than two months. Stock and bond traders reacted differently to news that the economy grew as strongly as expected in the fourth quarter but that growth may be slowing.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.45 points, to 3,857.99, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.07 points, to 470.39. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index gained 1.34 points, to 758.91. 
 For the week, the Dow lost more than 11 points.
The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a robust 4.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, but that a large part of the growth -- more than one-sixth -- appeared to come from a buildup of inventories.
Such a buildup, analysts say, may indicate that the economy is slowing, as companies are unable to sell goods that are piling up in warehouses. A slowing economy would mean the Federal Reserve was more likely to curb its pattern of raising interest rates.
"If I were on the Fed and looking at these numbers, I would do nothing for now," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, head of a global economic consulting firm that bears her name.
"But considering what the market expects," she said, "I'm sure the Fed will go for a 50-basis-point increase" at its at its meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, or later in February. Fifty basis points equals half a percentage point.
Following the release of the G.D.P. report, bond prices rose sharply; the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell for the third consecutive day, to 7.73 percent from 7.83 percent.
Traders said several technical factors might have accounted for the stock market's turning in a mixed performance. For example, several stocks with rising prices did not trade at the beginning of the session and thus did not counteract the morning's drop.
"It was a funny market from the standpoint of a lot of delayed openings missing the day's highs, which basically occurred in the first 15 minutes of trading," said Donald Kimsey, a senior technical analyst at Smith Barney.
Walt Disney, LSI Logic and others had delayed openings, often because of order imbalances following the reporting of earnings. Disney, after hitting a 52-week high of 50 1/2, closed at 50 1/4, up 3, after reporting a surge in earnings on Thursday. LSI Logic, a semiconductor company, rose gained 3 1/4, to 43 1/2, on strong fourth-quarter profits reported on Thursday.
Lakeland First Financial Group, a savings and loan in New Jersey, hit a 52-week high of 29 1/2, before closing at 28 3/4, up 7 1/4. Valley National Bancorp, also of New Jersey, agreed on Thursday to buy Lakeland for $128 million.
Other companies' stocks fell on their earnings outlook. Microtouch Systems, a maker of screen-based systems for computers, fell 4 3/4, to 30 3/8, after analysts who follow the company said first-quarter revenue was likely to decline from that of the fourth quarter.
Similarly, Legent, a computer software company, fell 4, to 30 1/4, after it reported first-quarter revenue growth that was less than analysts expected. Trinova hit a 52-week low of 24 1/4, before closing at 25, down 3. Trinova, which makes rubber products and air-conditioning systems, warned analysts of a likely slowdown in business.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 339.5 million shares changing hands, about 14 percent above the daily average of 298 million shares for the last six months.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks closed slightly higher yesterday after a week of big losses. The Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 33.51 points, to 18,104.35. For the week, however, the Nikkei was down 735.87 points, or 3.9 percent.

Concerns About Mexico Aid Erode Dollar's Early Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against leading currencies yesterday as concern about the prospects for United States aid to Mexico offset a mounting conviction that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next week.
The dollar surged in early New York trading after a report showed that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. 
 The report on gross domestic product confirmed expecations that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Higher rates make dollar-denominated investments and deposits more attractive to foreign investors.
But the dollar's gains evaporated after Republican leaders expressed doubts that there would be enough Congressional support to gain approval of the Clinton Administration's $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico.
"Mexico still weighs on the dollar," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
Mexico's financial crisis has been a drag on the dollar because of concern that it could harm growth in the United States. Mexico is the United States' third-biggest trading partner. There are also concerns that the Federal Reserve might be compelled to sell dollars for pesos to support the sinking peso, which has fallen almost 40 percent since it was devalued on Dec. 20.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5194 German marks before settling at 1.5150 marks in late New York trading, down from 1.5177 marks on Thursday. The dollar was unchanged at 99.40 Japanese yen. It slipped to 1.2746 Swiss francs from 1.2765 francs. The British pound fell to $1.5890 from $1.5905.
The dollar fell after House Speaker Newt Gingrich said it would be "hard work" for Congress to approve the aid package.
While the dollar has been supported by expectations of another Fed increase in interest rates, it may take an increase of 75 basis points to bolster the dollar because a smaller rise has been anticipated for so long, said Andrew Larkin, currency salesman at Postipankki Ltd., a Finnish bank in New York. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Sumitomo Bank Expecting Huge Loss From Bad Loans

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In what analysts say was a signal of the first annual loss for a major Japanese bank since the end of World War II, the Sumitomo Bank said today that it expected to report a loss of about $2.8 billion this fiscal year as it writes off mountains of bad loans.
The announcement, which stunned bankers here, reflects the magnitude of the bad-debt problem afflicting Japanese banks. But the move by Sumitomo, the third-largest bank in the world, was also praised by analysts as a bold attempt -- at least for the normally conservative Japanese banks -- to bite the bullet and resolve problems quickly. 
 "It's a gutsy move," said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. "It's completely unprecedented. It will make other banks answer the question of why they are not doing that."
Many major banks in the United States have had losses from writing off bad debts. Investors often regard these moves as positive for the long run because they speed the cleanup of the balance sheet.
But in Japan, analysts said, the all-powerful Ministry of Finance has restrained banks from reporting losses for fear of undermining public confidence in the banking system.
As a result, banks have been disposing of their bad loans bit by bit, and selling stock in companies they own to compensate for the write-offs. "If every bank did not take equity gains, every bank would have a net loss," said Elizabeth Daniels, banking analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo.
The slow disposal of bad debts, however, has been delaying Japan's recovery from a three-year-long recession, because banks weighed down with bad loans have been reluctant to lend new money.
Analysts said Sumitomo's action might be emulated by some other banks, but not by many. Most banks do not have the financial strength that Sumitomo has to withstand a big loss. And the Finance Ministry, which approved Sumitomo's move, might be reluctant to see the practice spread too widely.
"To suddenly start having a half-dozen or a dozen banks taking a loss, that might cause some worries," said J. Brian Waterhouse, an analyst with James Capel in Tokyo. He and other analysts said they saw little risk to Japan's banking system from Sumitomo's action.
Sumitomo, part of the huge Sumitomo Group based in Osaka, is considered one of the most prestigious, aggressive and profit-oriented banks in Japan. It owns 12.5 percent of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street firm.
But Sumitomo ran into trouble because of billions of dollars of loans it made to the Itoman Corporation, a scandal-tainted trading company. Itoman invested wildly in real estate and bought Picassos, Chagalls and other works of art as a way to launder money, resulting in the arrests of several executives. Itoman was rescued by Sumitomo Bank and absorbed into another company in the Sumitomo Group in 1993.
Sumitomo Bank said today that it had been planning to write off 500 billion yen, or about $5 billion, worth of loans in the second half of the fiscal year, but has now increased that to 800 billion yen, or about $8 billion. This includes all the Itoman loans still on Sumitomo's books.
While the bank will sell some of its stock holdings to partly compensate, it predicted it would still end up with a net loss to its parent company of 280 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, in the fiscal year that ends March 31. Until today the bank had been forecasting a net profit of 35 billion yen.
At a news conference today, Yoshifumi Nishikawa, a senior managing director, said the bank made a "strategic choice" that would improve its financial condition in the medium and long term. He said the loss would be for this year only.
Sumitomo, which had 1.2 trillion yen, or $12 billion, of nonperforming loans on its books in September, said it had a strong capital position and could withstand the loss.
Sumitomo's announcement came after the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The bank's shares had ended the day at 1,610 yen, a loss of 20 yen.
Most Japanese banks made unwise loans during the late 1980's, when Japanese land and stock prices were soaring wildly. But in the early 1990's, the "bubble" collapsed and Japan plunged into a recession.
Japan's 21 major banks reported 13.3 trillion yen, or about $133 billion, of bad loans in September, but that excludes restructured loans on which the banks receive little or no interest. Ms. Daniels of Morgan Stanley estimates that bad loans actually total 40 trillion yen, or $400 billion.
In October, the Nippon Trust Bank essentially collapsed and predicted a loss of $1.6 billion this fiscal year. Mitsubishi Bank rescued it by purchasing control for about $2 billion. Two weeks earlier, Mitsubishi had absorbed $1 billion in losses to prop up two affiliated finance companies.
In December, the Bank of Japan aided the takeover of two ailing credit associations, the first such use of public money.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Sent Lower By Low-Inflation Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Precious metals tumbled yesterday after the Government reported strong growth but with low inflation.
In its report on the nation's economic growth, the Commerce Department said its broadest gauge of inflation rose by 2.1 percent during 1994, the lowest in three decades. 
 "With lower inflation, there's no real reason to buy gold," said Leonard Kaplan, vice president and chief trader with Imperial Bank in Los Angeles.
On other commodity markets, energy and coffee prices fell sharply, dragging the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities down 1.48 points, to 234.01.
Gold for February delivery fell $4.90, to $376.80 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, while March silver dropped 12 cents, to $4.675 an ounce.
Gasoline prices fell to a two-week low amid concern that New Jersey will switch to selling a cheaper motor fuel, slashing demand by as much as 40 percent for the cleaner-burning grade traded on the futures exchange.
"The market's saying it's spooked by the fact that New Jersey could back out and there hasn't been any clarification yet that they can't," said John Saucer, an analyst with Smith Barney Inc. in Houston.
In March, New Jersey wants to begin selling gasoline with less methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive that helps reduce carbon monoxide emissions. The state contends it can meet Federal air standards with less of the additive in its gasoline, and has cited concern about possible adverse health effects caused by it.
Gasoline for February delivery slumped 1.37 cents, to 56.07 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since Jan. 13. March crude oil fell 29 cents, to $17.95 a barrel.
Coffee prices plunged after Brazil, the world's largest producer, failed to join other growers in withholding exports.
Growers in Brazil met Thursday night to discuss a retention plan designed by producers in Central America and Colombia to keep coffee off the market until prices rise. The meeting adjourned without an agreement to join the plan.
"They just agreed to meet next month, and the trade thinks that means they aren't going to be able to keep a cap on supplies," said Luis Bethart, a coffee trader at Lamborn Futures Company in Miami.
The March coffee contract fell 4.5 cents, to $1.625 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the lowest for an active contract since Dec. 20.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Less Affluent Players Join Super-Rich Game

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
EVERY investor dreams of discovering the next Apple Computer or Intel. But investors who get in long before a public stock offering have the most to gain. And small start-up companies fail at an alarmingly high rate, leaving many people holding the bag.
To spread the risk, venture capital funds bet on many companies. Getting into such a fund, though, generally requires an investment of at least $1 million. 
 Now the United States Trust Company in New York, whose clients range from the super-wealthy to the somewhat affluent, has created a fund that requires a more modest commitment. Though not quite a populist play, the fund is open to bank clients who are willing to put up just $15,000 and who have investment portfolios of $250,000 or more.
The managers of the fund, called the UST Private Equity Investors Fund, hope to raise $50 million.
"It is a high-risk proposition, and should be sold to those who can take that risk," said David I. Fann, the fund's president and chief executive. "But we are trying to develop the ability to further diversify our clients' assets into areas that do not behave the way traditional equity or debt instruments behave."
Mr. Fann and Frederick Taylor, the bank's chief investment officer, consider the timing good because of a slowdown in corporate financing and initial public offerings. "A lot of companies that would have gone public this year won't be going public," Mr. Fann said. "These firms will still require capital, and the only place they have to turn to is the private marketplace."
Venture capital funds have often disappointed. Despite the risks, the top-performing funds have done only about as well as large company stocks over the last decade.
"The upper quartile of venture capital funds have about a 13 percent annualized rate of return," said Jesse Reyes, a managing director at Venture Economics Information Services, a Boston-based subsidiary of the Securities Data Company. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks has posted an average total return of 14.78 percent the last 10 years, Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm, calculated.
"Most investors looking at venture capital now are expecting returns of anywhere from 13 percent to 15 percent," Mr. Reyes said. "Ten years ago, people were expecting returns of 25 percent to 30 percent."
Expectations have fallen in part because so much more money is chasing companies. By the end of 1993, venture capital firms had $34.7 billion, up from $6 billion in 1980, Mr. Reyes said.
Venture capital funds were not always dominated by the super-rich. Many publicly traded venture capital companies were begun in the early 1960's, said Steven P. Galante, editor of Private Equity Analyst, a monthly newsletter, "but they went private in the 1970's and 1980's."
Investors in the funds typically profit when a start-up company is sold or issues public stock. If the company fails, the money is gone.
U.S. Trust cautions clients that it may take four years for the capital to be fully invested, that the money cannot be withdrawn at a moment's notice and that any gains will not be realized for years.
"The main thing to realize is that this is a long-term, illiquid investment," Mr. Galante said.
The new fund carries smaller fees than its big-ticket cousins. Fees will be 1.5 percent of assets when the fund is fully invested, compared with 2.5 percent to 3.25 percent elsewhere, Mr. Reyes said.
The fund is also structured to be less risky. At least 70 percent of its assets will be invested in later-stage venture capital companies, described as closely held enterprises with more than $5 million in annual revenue, and middle-market companies, with annual sales of $25 million to $250 million. No one company will account for more than 10 percent of the fund's assets.
To take advantage of prominent manager's skills, the fund can invest up to 30 percent of its assets in buyout, private equity and other venture capital funds.

HEADLINE: Economy Grew At a Brisk Rate In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The economy accelerated to a 4.5 percent growth rate in the final three months of 1994, the Government reported today, but ended the strongest year in a decade with clear signs that the slowdown long sought by the Federal Reserve may be at hand.
In financial markets, bond prices surged, driving interest rates lower, as analysts concluded that a slowdown could mean the Federal Reserve was close to the end of a credit-tightening it began a year ago to keep inflation in check and the business expansion from overheating. [Page 33.] The broad stock market was steady, but blue-chip stocks fell. [Page 34.] 
 The Wall Street response was prompted by the Commerce Department's latest quarterly report on the nation's output of goods and services, which showed that the strong growth at the end of 1994 failed to cause inflation to budge. The report also disclosed that inventories of unsold goods climbed more than expected, suggesting that factory orders could taper off early this year as stores scaled back their demands for new supplies. That caused a scramble among private analysts to trim their forecasts of economic growth for the first half of 1995.
While most economists still expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates at its policy meeting next week -- probably by half a percentage point -- it now appears much more likely that any increase would be either the central bank's final move for a while, or at least that any subsequent action would be minimal.
"The slowdown in this economy is here," predicted James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. "That big inventory number is the 400-pound gorilla that is jumping all over first-quarter growth."
It was not clear exactly what caused the large buildup in unsold goods, but analysts tended to interpret it as a tailing-off of consumer buying at the end of the year rather than as an intentional restocking of store shelves.
Nothing in the report pointed to an impending recession. Still, the inventory buildup and other economic signals suggest that the overall 1994 growth rate of 4 percent could turn out to be the last big advance in the continuing expansion that began in spring 1991.
Higher interest rates finally seem to be taking their toll. Car sales, for instance, appear to be peaking as dealers reduce their orders to avoid extra financing costs, causing some auto makers to idle factories producing models that were hot sellers only a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, there is evidence suggesting that Christmas sales were disappointing and that home building may slow after unexpectedly strong autumn and early winter sales, which benefited from warmer than usual weather.
Putting it all together, Mr. Annable, the bank economist, marked down his forecast for growth in the gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced within the nation's borders -- in the January-March period to 2.3 percent from an earlier prediction of 3 percent. He also said the pace for the spring quarter might be less than 2 percent.
This would be below the roughly 2.5 percent rate that economists generally consider the fastest an economy with relatively low unemployment can grow without intensifying inflation. That growth rate is the target often cited by Fed officials.
Inflation remained remarkably subdued in the fourth quarter, today's report also showed, with the index of prices paid by American residents up at a 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.5 percent in the third quarter. For the year, the inflation rate was 2.6 percent, compared with 2.8 percent in 1993.
"The economy has not enjoyed such a healthy combination of strong growth and modest inflation in 30 years," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Last year's inflation-adjusted gain of 4 percent was up from 3.1 percent in 1993 and was the best year-to-year increase since a 6.2 percent burst in 1984, when the economy boomed after pulling out of a recession that ended in 1982. Measured on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, the increase was also 4 percent, the strongest rise since 1987.
Robust consumer spending and business investment undergirded the fourth-quarter gain of 4.5 percent, but much of the attention went to the jump in inventories, amounting to $68 billion at an annual rate, up from the already hot pace of $58 billion, on average, for the two preceding quarters.
Inventory figures, however, are notoriously hard to interpret, since stockpiles can rise for opposite reasons: conditions so bad that consumers have stopped buying or conditions so good that store owners have aggressively restocked their shelves.
Whichever the case, a buildup of inventories adds to G.D.P. in the period in which the goods are produced and implies that there will be a subsequent subtraction from future quarters as the excess is worked off.
Rosanne M. Cahn, director of the economics department at CS First Boston, expressed a relatively benign view of the situation.
"The pace of inventory restocking picked up," she said. "But stocks had been drawn down too much by the end of 1993." Still, once these goods are sold in coming months, she added, the higher level of inventories "will reinforce the 1995 slowdown once it gets under way."
John M. Godfrey, chief economist for Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla., largely agreed, describing the latest inventory data as sowing "the seeds of softness later on."
Despite earlier reports pointing to lackluster holiday shopping, the report released today found that consumer spending for the quarter accelerated to a 4.6 percent rate of growth from 3.1 percent in the July-September period.
This, however, was heavily concentrated in cars, light trucks and other durable goods, where a slowdown in sales is already evident in the reports from auto makers that they are temporarily closing some plants and offering rebates on some vehicles.
Growth in spending for nondurables like clothing slackened in the fourth quarter, just as many apparel chains and department stores had indicated in their post-Christmas reports. Mr. Annable predicted that consumers would be increasingly restrained this year by high amounts of debt, fewer new jobs and rising interest rates.
Consumers still maintain substantial buying power, however, and personal savings actually climbed a bit to 4.6 percent of disposable income after standing at 4.1 percent in the spring and summer quarters.
Businesses continued to invest feverishly in equipment during the quarter, lifting growth to a 20.2 percent annual rate. However welcome as a sign of the growing competitiveness of American industry, that is a pace, analysts said, that probably cannot be sustained much longer.
"The economy is becoming increasingly dependent upon business investment," cautioned G. David Orr, chief economist of the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: Dole Warns White House That Plan to Bolster Peso Will Not Pass

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, signaled today that the White House plan to rescue the Mexican economy by guaranteeing $40 billion in loans is headed for defeat in Congress.
 After two weeks of debate, the program is "out there in limbo somewhere," he said. 
 Mexico abruptly devalued the peso in late December to make it easier for the Government to repay vast short-term loans overseas. Since then prices have risen sharply and investors have shied away, and the Government needs a major infusion of cash to support the peso and restore confidence.
 Senator Dole, who pledged support for the plan two weeks ago, said many Democrats and Republicans who had supported the idea of helping Mexico are recoiling at the Administration's proposal, which calls for Washington essentially to act as a co-signer for Mexican bonds.
 In hearings this week, top Administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, won over few legislators. Administration officials appeared to regroup today, meeting leaders on Capitol Hill and talking vaguely of restructuring the plan.
 Mr. Dole said that he was sympathetic to Mexico's plight and that he wanted to help, but he suggested that the loan guarantees may not be enough to solve Mexico's problems. Mr. Clinton, he said, "needs to step up to the plate," adding, "Something dramatic has got to happen."
 Mr. Dole concluded: "I see people who were for it saying, 'I'm not going to vote for this thing.' 'You were for it last week.' 'That was last week.' "
 Mr. Dole suggested that the Administration had been increasingly hurt by questions of who would benefit. "Is it politicians from Mexico, and Wall Street?" he asked. "If that's the case, I don't want to cast my vote to expose the American taxpayer to any risk at all. It's not our purpose to bail out people who made bad investments."
 Some Democrats also say support is eroding, in part because there is no bill actually before either house.
 The Administration has been loath to commit the plan to writing until it can negotiate conditions acceptable to Democrats like Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the minority leader, who are insisting on minimum-wage requirements and other assurances that Mexican companies would not increase their competitive advantage. Mexican products already cost 35 percent less in dollar terms than before the devaluation.
 But the White House also has to satisfy Republicans who are nervous about seeming to promote a package that has little public support.
 "It's like waiting for Godot right now," said one Democrat working on the negotiations. Republicans, he said, do not want to meet on the subject. "Meanwhile, support is eroding on both sides," he said.

HEADLINE: Governors Propose a Limit To U.S. Control of Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
On the eve of a White House conference on welfare policy, leaders of the National Governors' Association have devised a bipartisan proposal that would give states the option of taking a single Federal payment each year and designing their own welfare programs, with hardly any Federal regulations.
 Although President Clinton called the conference to promote bipartisan cooperation on welfare, top Administration officials have already expressed reservations about some elements of the association's plan, saying they could hurt poor children. 
 In a confidential memorandum to the President, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said Mr. Clinton would make a big mistake by "leaving welfare reform to the states in a grand bargain with the governors."
 "Simply passing the buck to the states is not welfare reform," she declared.
 In a similar vein, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said that Mr. Clinton wanted to protect "the entitlement side" of welfare, which guarantees that cash benefits will be available to people who meet certain eligibility criteria, regardless of the number who apply or the total cost. "You can't just roll the dice and hope that the states are going to pick that all up," Mr. Panetta said on Thursday at a meeting with journalists.
 Administration officials said they would play down such disagreements at the conference on Saturday, where Mr. Clinton will discuss welfare with six governors, sixteen members of Congress, two state legislators, two mayors and two county officials. The Administration hopes those attending will endorse certain basic principles, described as follows in White House documents:
 "Anyone who can work should do so. Welfare reform should include time limits. Anyone who brings a child into this world ought to be prepared to take financial and personal responsibility for that child's future. Teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock childbearing are important problems that must be addressed through comprehensive welfare reform."
 The leaders of the association, who are attending the White House conference, have circulated a draft of their proposal among other governors, but have not made it generally available. Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is chairman of the association, said in an interview today that he believed the full organization would endorse the proposal at its winter meeting, to be held here from Sunday through Tuesday. He described the proposal as "a reasonable compromise" between Republicans who wanted complete state flexibility and Democrats who wanted the Federal Government to guarantee some basic standard of living for children.
 The proposal would give states a choice of two alternatives to replace the main Federal-state welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
 States could take a lump sum of Federal money, or a block grant, to assist poor families and children in any way they wanted, "with no Federal restrictions." State plans "would not be subjected to Federal approval or Federal revision," and states would not have to put up any specific amounts of their own money to match the Federal dollars.
 Alternatively, states could continue welfare as an entitlement program. But they would have far more freedom than they now have to define eligibility, adjust benefit levels and design their own programs.
 With this option, the Government would set time limits for the receipt of welfare benefits, which would be "contingent on compliance with a social contract"; that is, welfare recipients would have to begin work within a specified time.
 Under the proposal, state officials would gain vast new discretion even if they kept welfare as an entitlement program. They could, for example, provide assistance in the form of vouchers rather than cash; penalize welfare recipients who failed to attend school; require teen-age welfare recipients to live with their parents, and "limit benefits to mothers with additional children born while they are on welfare."
 But the governors said they opposed Federal legislation that would "mandate such state policies."
 Some Republican governors, like John Engler of Michigan and Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, want to consolidate scores of Federal programs in a handful of block grants. But Governor Dean, a Democrat, said: "A lot of governors are concerned about what a block grant with a cap will do to state budgets and to the poorest, most vulnerable people, who are children. Under our bipartisan proposal, even in states that take the block grant with no Federal oversight, children must be the beneficiaries so they don't fall through the cracks."
 Aside from that requirement, he said, governors who chose the block grant would generally be free to "do their thing."
 Mr. Panetta, the chief of staff, said the proper degree of state flexibility was "an area of dispute" with the governors. One purpose of the meeting on Saturday is to "try to bridge the differences," he said.
 In addition to Mr. Dean, the Democratic Governors who devised the proposal are Mel Carnahan of Missouri and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware. The Republican Governors are Mr. Thompson, Mr. Engler and Arne Carlson of Minnesota. Mr. Thompson is vice chairman of the association. Mr. Carnahan is chairman of its committee on human resources, and Mr. Carlson is vice chairman of the committee.
 In her memorandum to the President, Dr. Shalala said that the governors' proposal for block grants seemed "consistent with your strong commitment to state flexibility" and was, in some ways, preferable to the "Draconian cuts" proposed by House Republicans. But she said block grants "hold considerable dangers."
 "Block grants fail to protect vulnerable children, will not result in real welfare reform and will not protect the states from economic changes," Dr. Shalala said.
 She also told the President that any move toward block grants would increase variation in the amounts of assistance offered to poor people in different states. "Some states would lower their already meager state contributions to benefit levels, and some states would completely eliminate eligibility for some groups of people," she predicted.
 In announcing the conference with the governors last month, Mr. Clinton said he wanted "an honest dialogue about our country's broken welfare system."
 A Democrat invited to the conference said today: "The White House staff is nervous. They are trying hard to make sure it doesn't blow up in their face because of partisan disagreements."
 Republicans working on the conference said they were somewhat irritated with the Administration. On the one hand, they noted, Mr. Clinton said he wanted a bipartisan dialogue. On the other, they said, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agriculture Department have issued studies portraying Republican proposals on welfare as extremely harmful to welfare recipients, schoolchildren, pregnant women, infants, farmers and the retail food industry.
 The governors oppose a part of a welfare bill proposed by House Republicans that would terminate benefits for legal immigrants. Mr. Panetta said the President would not support such a "perverse provision."

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Threaten Balanced-Budget Measure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Hours after the balanced-budget movement rolled its constitutional amendment, juggernaut fashion, through the House, the Senate served notice today that it might not be so compliant.
 At a news conference, Senate Democrats who had voted for a similar amendment in the past hinted broadly that they could change their minds unless the Senate's Republican majority agreed to produce a detailed budget-balancing plan as part of an amendment package. 
 They backed that up with a letter to the majority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, urging that both parties draft legislation to erase the Federal deficit by 2002, the earliest an amendment would take effect.
 Forty-one Democrats signed the letter -- the minimum number, perhaps coincidentally -- that would be needed if Democrats chose to filibuster the amendment. Many oppose the notion of an amendment but say they favor a specific plan to balance the budget.
 "The Republicans have said they're going to increase defense spending, provide a tax cut, protect Social Security and reduce the deficit to zero by 2002," said the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. "We think they owe it to the American people to explain how."
 Mr. Daschle, one of four Democratic leaders at the news conference, denied that the letter was a filibuster threat. But he added that Democrats expected a full debate on the need for a deficit-reduction plan when the balanced-budget debate began next week. He said his own support for an amendment would be in doubt if a plan was not forthcoming.
 Another Democrat who signed the letter, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, called the 41 signatures a signal to Republicans that Democrats could make trouble if their concerns were not addressed.
 "But," Mr. Leahy added, "I don't think anybody wants to filibuster something that requires a two-thirds vote to pass anyway."
 In truth, Mr. Daschle and the other Democrats have the Republicans in something of a box. Because the Senate's 53 Republicans need 60 votes to stop a filibuster and 67 votes to pass the amendment if all 100 senators vote, no balanced-budget amendment is going anywhere without Democratic help.
 The White House and Democratic leaders in Congress have been reluctant to oppose the popular amendment movement outright; indeed, many Democrats in Congress, like Mr. Daschle, favor some form of the measure. But all say it is irresponsible to pass a balanced-budget amendment without giving the states a clear explanation of the cuts in Federal money and services that it would bring.
 After Senate passage, 38 state legislatures would have to ratify the amendment before it would become part of the Constitution.
 Republicans rejected efforts to append a budget-cutting explanation to the House version of the amendment, saying that any budget forecast purporting to cover seven years of economic growth and recession would itself be irresponsible.
 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed polite interest in the idea when the amendment was considered earlier this month, but also rejected it.
 Mr. Dole, who will control the pace and content of the balanced-budget debate, was noncommittal when asked about the Democratic letter. "It's a nice letter," he said, adding that he had not had time to consider it.
 In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia said he planned to schedule a House vote in April 1996, close to the deadline for filing income-tax returns, on another constitutional amendment, which would prohibit tax increases without the approval of three-fifths of the total membership of both chambers of Congress.
 Many tax increases can now be enacted by majority vote, although the House rules bar income-tax increases without the consent of three-fifths of all representatives voting.
 Mr. Gingrich and other party leaders offered the vote to House freshmen to soothe their anger after a version of the balanced-budget amendment that included the three-fifths requirement failed to attract enough support to pass the House.
 In other action, the House subcommittee that oversees military appropriations approved legislation today that allotted $3.2 billion in emergency spending for Pentagon operations in Haiti and elsewhere, as well as additional money for military pay.
 The action drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who noted that only $1.4 billion of the new spending was offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget. That means that the bill would add $1.8 billion to the Federal deficit, something Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, called "incredibly ludicrous" in the wake of the House's approval of a balanced-budget amendment.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "DOING THE MATH -- Voting On a Balanced Budget" Last year, the senate failed to approve the balanced budget amendment, voting 63 to 37 in favor, or four votes short of a two-thirds majority. Eleven senators, 7 of whom voted for the amendment and 4 who voted against, were not re-elected. This year, the 11 new senators, all Republicans, plan to vote for the amendment. It takes 34 senators to block a constitutional amendment. The outcome will turn on the votes of several Democrats who voted yes last yer but now say they are having second thoughts.

HEADLINE: Group Offers Plan to Give Historic Area Modern Look

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In an effort to lift the local economy and turn one of the country's oldest historical areas into a bigger tourist attraction, an organization that promotes the United States Constitution has announced a proposal to develop a high-tech, underground museum with exhibits on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Liberty Bell.
 A proposed $170 million Constitution Center, to be financed largely through private donations, would replace a parking garage beneath the mall facing Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was adopted and the Constitution was drafted. 
 The Liberty Bell, now displayed in modest quarters a block from Independence Hall, would be moved a half-block farther away into a new steel and glass pavilion at the ground-level exit of the proposed museum.
 The museum would feature galleries with computer games and a theater -- one film presentation is already called, "Is This a Great Country, or What?" Visitors could see original drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and Bill of Rights and sign electronic copies with a laser pen. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are in the National Archives in Washington, where they will remain.
 Mayor Edward G. Rendell and other supporters of the project, which is sponsored by the National Constitution Center, say it will pump $200 million a year into the city's economy and revitalize the mall.
 The National Park Service, which administers the area, known as Independence National Historical Park, will have the final say on its development and has not said where it stands on the plan, the most ambitious of several under consideration.
 Critics of the center's design say the glitz and gizmos could trivialize the history the center celebrates. Mounting the same kind of arguments used successfully last year when residents of Northern Virginia forced the Disney Company to abandon plans for a history theme park near Civil War battlegrounds, opponents of the museum plan say its designers might be tempted to simplify interpretations of the Constitution to appeal to a wider and younger audience.
 "The Constitution is complicated," said Craig Eisendrath, the former executive director of the Pennsylvania Humanities Council, a state agency that promotes the arts. "To dumb-down stuff for the American public is destructive."
 Mr. Eisendrath was one of about two dozen members of the board of the National Constitution Center, which was created by Congress in 1988 to insure "continuing interpretation" of the Constitution within the 44 acres of Philadelphia's land supervised by the Park Service. He and seven other members quit the board in 1990 because they believed that the museum's designers were not emphasizing the educational aspects of the project.
 The opponents also say that the proposal would detract from other parts of Philadelphia's historical district, like the Betsy Ross House and the small museum on the site of the house where Benjamin Franklin lived, and destroy the colonial ambience of the area.
 Robert M. Brasler, who is president of the National Constitution Center, predicted that, in time, detractors would vanish. "I have a feeling they'll see the light," he said in an interview.
 The group expects to finance the project with private donations, corporate gifts and sponsorships, direct-mail solicitations and help from grass-roots organizations like Kiwanis Clubs. The center also plans to ask the city and state for $42 million.
 "All this is just a wish list, what we anticipate," said Mr. Brasler, who expressed optimism that the money could be raised. "But we haven't asked for anything yet."
 Nor have the city and state indicated they would be willing to contribute.
 The Park Service has devised six more modest plans for the park, costing from $57 million to under $10 million. None stress an appreciable economic boom to the city. The most ambitious would feature a new pavilion for the Liberty Bell, a new visitors' center and an underground Constitution Center smaller than the one proposed by Mr. Brasler's group. The least expensive would leave the Liberty Bell where it is, improve the landscaping around the mall and create a modest memorial to the Constitution.
 After considering all proposals, including the one from Mr. Brasler's group, the Park Service intends to announce a choice in December.
 At first, Mr. Brasler's group considered several ideas to develop a center promoting the historical significance of the events that took place in the district. At the same time, the Park Service began its own review, as it does periodically with all national parks.
 None of the ideas aroused much public interest until the National Constitution Center pitched its proposal to Mr. Rendell as a means to attract almost twice the 1.4 million people who visit the park now. That, they predicted, would aid the local economy by creating 2,500 permanent jobs and generating $19 million in new city and state taxes.
 At a news conference last week when plans for the center were announced, Mr. Rendell provided a political boost for the plan and urged the Park Service to adopt it.

HEADLINE: George Baker, Harvard Dean And U.S. Adviser, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
George P. Baker, dean of the Harvard Business School in the 1960's and a leading authority on transportation, air defense and the organization of business and government, died on Wednesday in the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix. He was 91.
 The cause was complications from a stroke, the business school said. 
 Mr. Baker served on Federal agencies and on the Harvard faculty for more than three decades, retiring as dean of the business school in 1969.
 He led the school's drive to raise money for 22 endowed professorships, or almost twice as many as had been established in the 50 previous years. Throughout his career at Harvard, he held many governmental and corporate positions.
 After World War II, he served as director of the Office of Transport and Communications Policy at the State Department, leading a delegation to a conference that completed the first bilateral agreement on international air rights.
 In 1948 he was named vice chairman of President Harry S. Truman's Air Policy Commission, which planned the nation's strategy for a larger and more strategic air defense and a concept of mutual deterrence in the cold war.
 Fulfilling a commitment made by President John F. Kennedy, Mr. Baker helped organize a group of Harvard Business School faculty members in 1964 to assist Central American countries in integrating their economies.
 In 1969 he was a member of an advisory council appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to recommend changes in the organizational structure of the executive branch to make it "a more effective instrument of public policy."
 Mr. Baker, who was trained at Harvard as an economist, was attracted to the transportation field as a boy when he developed a lifelong fascination with railroads.
 He was an instructor in economics at Harvard College from 1928 to 1936, when he moved to the faculty of the business school. He earned a doctorate in economics at Harvard in 1934.
 He left the business school in 1940 to serve on the Civil Aeronautics Board, becoming vice chairman in 1942.
 After World War II, in which he served in the Army, he specialized in transportation issues at the business school. When the Korean War began, he directed the center that coordinated the school's military research programs.
 In 1963 he ended the business school's policy of admitting only men.
 In addition to being a leading consultant to major airlines, railroads and government, he served as a director of numerous major corporations, including the Mobil Oil and Lockheed Aircraft Corporations. After his retirement from the business school, he was a bankruptcy trustee for the Penn Central Railroad.
 From 1954 to 1968 he was president or chairman of the Transportation Association of America. He was also president of the Transportation Research Foundation. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations
 Mr. Baker moved to Phoenix in 1978, where his first wife, Ruth, died in 1981.
 He is survived by his second wife, Mary; a son, George Jr., of Boston; two daughters, Sarah Uhle of Salt Lake City and Ruth Ursul of Brookline, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
Dispelling a myth about class warfare but confirming a decline of old values.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
Are the vociferous battles that Americans have long waged over values a reflection of class warfare?
 Reacting to the radical questioning of American institutions and beliefs that flourished in the 1960's, many conservatives and disillusioned liberals said, "yes." They contended that the challenge to long-held moral and social standards was the work of a powerful "new class" of educated professionals or "knowledge workers." 
 Infected with the "adversary culture" of intellectuals, this new class was said to be contemptuous of all stable norms, including the work ethic and what have since been labeled family values. The new class, the theory went on, sought to expand government, ostensibly in the name of ideals like insuring racial justice, combating poverty, protecting the environment and ending discrimination against women, but fundamentally because a larger government gave the new class itself more power over the business civilization that it supposedly scorned.
 "The simple truth," wrote the neo-conservative grandmaster Irving Kristol, "is that the professional classes are engaged in a class struggle with the business community for status and power."
 All this made for good polemics but fuzzy sociology. To make the menace of the new class convincing, conservatives and neo-conservatives suggested that it comprised not a small knot of intellectuals, journalists and political analysts, but a vast number of Americans who had benefited from the rapid expansion of higher education and the society's new need for technical knowledge.
 Although the "new class" specter still haunts conservative nightmares, Prof. Steven Brint, a sociologist at the University of California at Riverside has now produced a study that may finally put it to rest.
 "In an Age of Experts: The Changing Role of Professionals in Politics and Public Life" (Princeton), Professor Brint concludes that instead of forming a coherent bloc with a distinctive outlook, the nation's middle-class professionals are splintered into at least five major spheres.
 These he maps as business services (like financial analysts and corporate lawyers); applied science (engineers and geoscientists, for example); culture and communications (including academics, journalists and television directors); civic regulation (judges, government administrators, interest group experts and the like), and human services (like teachers, social workers and nurses).
 Just to see that map is to realize how diverse the so-called new class is and how many professionals work in large firms and generally entrepreneurial settings.
 So it is not surprising to find, as Professor Brint does, based on an extensive review and analysis of public opinion surveys, that on economic issues related to business, labor and government welfare programs, middle-class professionals are slightly more liberal than business managers and executives but much more conservative than the average American. They are strikingly conservative on issues like crime control and military policy.
 "Even the most liberal segment of professions -- the people who would be counted as members of the 'new class' in any version of the theory -- were, by and large, far from unconventional in their tastes or decidedly left-of-center in their political views, and they certainly show little opposition to the basic organizing principles of a business civilization," Professor Brint writes, relying on both poll data and his own systematic analysis of intellectual journals.
 In one important aspect, Professor Brint's findings appear to support the original new class theory, at least at first glance. Middle-class professionals are "relatively skeptical about moral certainties" and they remain clearly more liberal on numerous social issues, including civil liberties, personal choice regarding sexual matters, tolerance of political protest and acceptance of women and minorities.
But Professor Brint marshals evidence to show that these qualities stem from demographic realities, not professional status.
 Professional ranks contain more women, minorities and young people -- groups more likely to hold liberal social views. Among high-income managers, for example, census data show that about 5 percent were under the age of 30 in 1980 and fewer than that were women. But among professionals, nearly 30 percent were under 30 and more than 25 percent were women.
 All this is part of a larger story that Professor Brint tells, not just about the new class, but about the transformation of the very concept of professional. Early in the century, he says, professional status was defined as much by a sense of ethical and public responsibility as by specialized knowledge. Today, professionals increasingly define themselves strictly in terms of their command of technical matters, by their marketable knowledge and skills.
 Professor Brint discerns a real loss in this shift. The older notion of professional was susceptible to arrogance, but it also represented important precapitalist and nonmarket values that gave moral balance to a business civilization. By contrast, he suggests, both in economic and social matters, the new professionals have largely replaced public-spiritedness with private mindedness.

HEADLINE: Pataki Asks CUNY and SUNY to Cut Costs

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has asked the State University and the City University of New York to cut their spending by $40 million over the next five months to help the state close a $300 million gap in its current budget.
In letters sent out Thursday to university officials, the State Budget Director, Patricia Woodworth, told the State University that it must reduce spending by $25 million and City University that it must reduce spending by $15 million. The cuts, which must be completed by June 30, would represent about a 2 percent reduction in state aid for each system, state budget officials said. 
 "This is no different than what we are expecting from other state agencies," said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state budget division. "The difference is, with other state agencies, we have the right to impose hiring freezes, contract freezes and other spending reductions so that we can insure that what is being spent is for critical things. We do not have that kind of control with the university systems."
Democratic legislators said, however, that while Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, has the authority to cut spending in the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, he does not have the power to make cuts after that date without the Legislature's consent. That means the lawmakers could ease the cuts, they said.
"It would be fair to say this would meet with stiff opposition in the Assembly because SUNY and CUNY are the institutions middle-class people have availed themselves to for higher education," said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Democrat of Manhattan.
The prospect of a cut in state aid comes as City University's trustees are considering declaring a financial emergency at their regular meeting on Monday because of a proposed $7 million cut in aid from New York City for the current academic year.
The declaration would be the first step to laying off tenured faculty members at City University's six community colleges, which would bear the brunt of the city cut. City University is also preparing to defer enrollment of 6,000 community college students into the fall semester.
Rita Rodin, a City University spokeswoman, said City University officials were already pondering layoffs to cope with an additional proposed cut of $20 million in city aid for the 1995-96 academic year. The system has a $1.2 billion annual budget, of which $800 million comes from the state.
"We can't just absorb a state cut," she said. "We've had major cuts over the past few years even as our enrollment has grown."
Michael Riley, a State University spokesman, said university officials were still reviewing options and that he could not comment on what actions might be taken. But he said a $25 million midyear cut in the State University's $1.17 billion state budget was "considerable."
Both systems, with their low tuition, have long been distinguished as educational stepping stones for minorities and the poor. The State University system, with 64 campuses throughout the state, has 400,000 students and a full-time faculty of 15,000. City University, in addition to its 6 two-year colleges, has 10 senior colleges and 4 graduate schools for a total of 213,000 students.
State University union officials said that the $25 million, coming more than halfway through the academic year, would have the impact of a $50 million full-year reduction. They said that was potentially enough to cause layoffs, course cancellations and reductions in library hours and other services.
"We took a lot of hits since 1990," said William Scheuerman, president of the United University Professions, the union representing the State University faculty and professional workers. "We're right to the bone. Any cuts are going to hurt."
A $50 million midyear cut in state aid to the State University in the 1990-91 school year led to a $300 per year tuition increase in 1991. It also led to increases in course sizes, shutting down of campus buildings during holidays and reductions in library hours.
"Any cut like this that affects the quality of the program is shortsighted," said Linda Rosenblatt, a spokeswoman for the New York State United Teachers, the teachers' union. "SUNY drives the economy in many communities. This is a cut that could cost you in the long run."
City University officials declared financial emergencies in 1991 and 1992. The first was a response to a proposed $22 million budget cut by the city and state, which was ultimately reversed by the city and thus did not lead to layoffs. The 1992 declaration led to a small number of layoffs.
In addition to deferring 6,000 students into the fall semester to deal with the city's proposed $7 million cut this year, City University officials are also considering canceling as many as 1,864 class sections, or 28 percent of the total. The hardest hit would be college algebra, English composition and introductory courses in fields like psychology, sociology and history.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Charities Say Donations Are Weak

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Last winter, as the nation edged its way out of the recession, many New York City charities reported slight increases in private donations. But this season, officials at some of the city's largest social service agencies say giving has been surprisingly weak.
While giving has remained stable on a national level, all but one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund say that donations are flat or lagging up to 10 percent behind last winter. Citing reasons as various as the welfare reform movement and the mild winter, they say that a lag in all private giving -- not only to the Neediest Cases -- jeopardizes their most basic programs as record numbers of New Yorkers seek help. 
 Although the poor local economy is probably the central reason for the decline, the heads of many charities say they believe that cynicism at the government level is also to blame. The House Republicans' proposal to slash welfare benefits and eliminate other social programs, they say, has maligned the poor and discouraged middle-class Americans from giving.
"The cynicism coming from City Hall, Albany and Washington is taking a harsh toll," said Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of UJA-Federation of New York. "People are being told that the poor take advantage of them, and that does begin to have a financial impact."
The Children's Aid Society reported that its donations have increased about 5 percent, or $200,000. But Philip Coltoff, the executive director, said most of the increase has been in restricted gifts. Unrestricted donations that support the society's health clinics, mental health programs and preventive services, are up by about $6,000.
"When you look at our core services for children, we are barely holding our own," Mr. Coltoff said. "When people hear the constant theme that the poor are getting too much, it definitely discourages philanthropic giving."
New York charities appear to be faring worse than others around the country, perhaps because the city has not recovered from the recession at the same rate as others. Whereas the stock market flourished in 1993, it was fairly unstable in 1994, and wealthy donors may have been less inclined to give.
Ann Kaplan, director of research at the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, said that on a national level, giving has remained consistent with last year. But in the aftermath of the recession, many charities in New York City remain vulnerable, particularly those that rely heavily on small, individual donations.
At Catholic Charities, Archdiocese of Brooklyn and Queens, private gifts are about $300,000 behind last winter. And at the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, a 10 percent drop in unrestricted donations has limited the number of cash grants the agency provides to poor people. Megan E. McLaughlin, the executive director, said the money, which is given out once a month, is gone within a few hours.
Charity officials are even pointing to the recent warm weather as a possible deterrent. In frigid weather, they said, the effects of poverty are more visible and moving, and people are more likely to help.
"There is no doubt that weather affects the way people treat the poor," said Donna A. Santarsiero, executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service. At her agency, individual donations picked up slightly over the holiday season, but are still down by about 10 percent from last year. The loss of private funds threatens rehabilitative programs for disabled adults and a program in Brooklyn public schools to prevent child abuse, among other things.
Another factor affecting charitable giving, officials say, is race. Ms. McLaughlin said that as increasing numbers of social service recipients are black and Hispanic, the white middle class is less likely to help. Immigrants of all races are also seen increasingly as "undeserving poor," she said.
"There is a belief that the only people who benefit from our programs are people of color," Ms. McLaughlin said. "In many cases, that makes it easy not to care."
But if cynicism and prejudice are major factors, charity officials say, they are equaled by a sense that the widespread, deep-rooted misery in this city is unsolvable.
"The situation around us has been going on for so long that people have become immune," Mr. Coltoff said. "They don't want to accept that they have to give again and again to make a difference."
The Rev. Kevin Sullivan, director of social development at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, suggested that some Americans might have stopped giving because they aren't getting the speedy results they are accustomed to.
"We like to solve problems and we have made all these huge efforts," he said. "But they have failed, and that has dampened people's spirits."

The Goldilocks Recovery

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
ECONOMICS WAS LABELED "THE dismal science" in 1850 by the historian Thomas Carlyle, and its metaphors are suitably fearsome and depressing. An arrangement in the 1970's for exchange rates to fluctuate within a band within another band was called the snake in the tunnel, and the total of the unemployment and inflation percentages was called the misery index. In the 80's an aborted economic recovery was called a dead cat bounce. Even its euphemisms for recession give the users a sensation of seasickness, as in rolling readjustment.
How pleasant it was, in this sad trope-a-dope, to hear an economist introduce a happy figure of speech to the droopy discourse. It happened at a White House briefing this month by Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, and Laura Tyson, the Council of Economic Advisers chair. (Ms. Tyson is the chairwoman of the group, and not a piece of furniture, but the official Clinton terminology labels her chair. Although the White House press office, in its releases, uses an o to spell advisors, her council styles itself advisers, the spelling preferred by Merriam-Webster's Collegiate, 10th Edition, and by American Heritage. Advisors -- perhaps influenced by supervisor -- is listed first by Webster's New World Dictionary, Third Edition, giving cover to the White House press office and to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Anthony Lake, who uses the controversial -or ending in spelling his informal title of National Security Advisor. However, most newspaper stylebooks, including that of The New York Times, use adviser, but who listens to the elitist media and its culture of personal destruction anymore? Amid this babble, a voice of cool authority is needed. My advice: in this devolutionary political era, don't knuckle under to any White House spelling diktat; spell it adviser. Live free or die. End parenthesis.) 
 Standing next to Adviser Tyson, whose hair is auburn, Secretary Reich made his sunnily hirsute contribution to economic jargon, referring to "the Goldilocks recovery -- not too hot, not too cold. . . ."
This catchy figure of speech is drawn, of course, from the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," in which a hungry young blond woman breaks into the home of an absent family of carnivorous furry mammals. She samples their porridge, their chairs (the furniture, not their discussion leaders) and their beds. The comparisons invariably lead her to the bowl, chair and bed of the smallest bear, which in the case of the cereal was neither too hot nor too cold, and in the cases of the furniture neither too hard nor too soft, but -- just right.
The satisfaction of the bedtime story to the children of statisticians is in the discovery by Goldilocks of the perfect mean. (Others find in this story an example of the rip-off of third-world resources by the industrialized nations, but that could not be the Secretary's intent.)
Even as the Secretary of Labor was purveying the just-right picture of a Goldilocks economy, an anonymous White House aide was telling Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times about growing out of childish things, and adopting a less certain view of the political scene after the takeover of Congress by Republicans: "A lot of this is still seeing through a glass darkly."
Some spinmeister in that White House reads the Bible. This expression comes from I Corinthians 13, in which the Apostle Paul writes: "When I was a child, I spake as a child . . . but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then [we shall see] face to face. . . . " The point is that wisdom will come when a person wrestles with his personal angel and comes face to face with God's grace: "now I know in part: but then shall I know even as also I am known."
The phrase through a glass, darkly is used today to confess to uncertainty. But not even the most spiritually evocative phrase is above parody: Mark Twain, in his laceration of James Fenimore Cooper's obfuscatory prose a century ago, wrote about his target: "He saw nearly all things as through a glass eye, darkly."
 
Eye of Newt Revisited
"Allow me to join the herd of herpetologists," writes C. Leon Harris, professor of biological sciences at SUNY-Plattsburgh, "who are no doubt giving you a forked-tongue lashing for your definition of newt."
The faithful reader will recall a piece on eye of newt, an ingredient tossed into the witches' brew in "Macbeth." The creature whose eye was used, I explained, was "a small lizard related to the salamander and sometimes confused with a spotted eft."
Belay that. "A newt, like the salamander, frog and toad, is a member of a class of animals called amphibians," writes John Tucker of New York in collaboration with David Grow, a herpetologist with the Oklahoma City Zoological Park. "A lizard, on the other hand, is a member of an entirely different class of animals called reptiles."
Leo Kretzner, biochemistry prof at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, explains further that "Amphibians and reptiles, while both in the vertebrate class, are members of separate orders. Their common body form is an example of convergent evolution." He notes, "The metaphorical appeal of a politician named after a reptile is obvious," but it would be wrong. However, the satirical possibilities are there: "After all, as a bona fide amphibian, the newt is slippery skinned and abandons its young."
W. T. Edmondson, a zoology professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, agrees: "A lizard is a reptile with a dry, scaly skin, while newts and salamanders are amphibians, frequently described as being slimy."
Other herpetologists -- it is fair to characterize my many correspondents on this as a herd -- dispute the sliminess factor. But even worse: "The Shakespearean witches' brew was a toxic mixture," writes Myrna E. Watanabe of Yonkers. "Newts secrete the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin," the writer continues, adding slyly, "structurally the same as the toxin found in the puffer fish."
Now let's clear up the confusion that has long been bothering me between the newt and the eft. Back to herpetologist Harris in Plattsburgh: "An eft is the adult terrestrial stage in the life cycle of an otherwise aquatic newt"; apparently when a newt grows tired of life in the water and climbs up on land, it becomes an eft.
Professor Harris adds etymological illumination: "Considering an eft to be a newt is not the result of confusion. The word newt resulted from a misdivision of an ewt, which in Middle English meant an eft."

Farewell, My Suite

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
I have spent much of my working life trying to convince people that it's "the mix, not the match" that makes for great-looking interiors. A radical suggestion coming from someone who was born and bred on perfectly matched furniture. But then, weren't we all? Furniture suites were the backbone of bedroom communities all across America: their stiff bearing made possible by chemical preservatives, their pseudo-historical styling as close to the original as Spam is to roast pork. But after years of editorial finger-wagging, the furniture suite is finally receding from the interior landscape. The ultimate proof of this came at this year's furniture mart in High Point, N.C., where even the most mass-market purveyors were pitching mixed sets over cookie-cutter ensembles. Now that a new era is dawning, I feel it's safe to wax nostalgic about the old, for the furniture suite may have lacked style but it had plenty of raison d'etre.
To the postwar homesteaders who believed most ardently in it, a matched set stood for progress, convenience, economic well-being and durability. More important, the furniture suite relieved an entire class of upwardly mobile suburbanites from the stress of having to make design decisions on a dime. 
 I think of my mother, who had been on the first convoy to the Philippines after Pearl Harbor. She'd been told to take all her belongings, furniture included, and then proceeded to live in a Quonset hut for the next four years. When she came back, chairless, and married my father, also chairless, they had to start furnishing from scratch. They didn't have time for Personal Style.
I grew up in a seven-set household. There was a color-coded suite for each of my three sisters and me, plus something Directoire-esque in the dining room; Williamsburg-y in the den. (I have yet to figure out the provenance of the master suite, but it was loaded with gold medallions.) Over time, the suites did not grow old, did not sag or fade. In fact, they never caused my mother a moment's worry. (The white lacquered set in my own bedroom even withstood my Italian grandfather's cigarette burns.) It was we who aged, moved on, wised up. The furniture remained pristine all the way to the Salvation Army. I wasn't sorry to see it go, but I understand perfectly all that it stood for and all that it accomplished.

Drug War, II

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
THE MAIL ABOUT THE LOST "WAR ON drugs," discussed here on Dec. 18, has been formidable. It has brought tomes and treatises, the thoughts of prisoners and preachers, and much evidence of anxiety across the land. Although most of the government warriors, from the Commander in Chief down, prefer to avoid the subject, people seem desperate for more discussion of alternatives to the failed policies of prohibition and interdiction.
The media have carried the news of the nation's defeat, but they do not dwell, as they would in a conventional war, on the daily cost and humiliation. Still, the letters from readers imply widespread support for the conclusion that there is no way to win the war so long as small, easily smuggled bundles of addictive cocaine or heroin can finance a large and aggressive criminal sales organization. Prohibition is what makes drugs so profitable, yet the thought of legalizing their distribution, even with rigid controls and treatment programs, arouses the fear of infecting millions of new addicts. 
 That fear, if valid, explains a central dilemma that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan dug out of his writings of two years ago. The nation's choice of policy -- legalization or prohibition -- offers a choice of outcomes, he wrote: "An enormous public health problem on the one hand, an enormous crime problem [concentrated among minorities] on the other." Since he disliked the choice, he ducked, wishing instead that medical researchers would more vigorously pursue a chemical "blocking or neutralizing agent" to move drug users "as near to abstinence as possible."
One researcher, Dr. Pietr Hitzig of Timonium, Md., actually foresees such a possibility in experiments with a fenfluramine-phentermine combination. But the protocols for controlled study of its effectiveness are still under review, he writes.
From a different perspective, Prof. Avram Goldstein of Stanford's Medical School also argues for recognizing drugs as a health problem: "We do not need to legalize the drugs, we need to decriminalize the users and offer universal treatment, while seriously enforcing the prohibitions on sale and distribution."
What that might mean was suggested by Daniel W. Weil, a former director of corrections for Cook County, Ill., who observes that a nation unable to control its eating, drinking or smoking habits nonetheless expects, indeed demands, that drug addicts kick the habit -- or become sellers or commit crimes to finance it. He favors dispensing drugs at minimal or no charge "to registered addicts" under close supervision at government clinics. Any "possession or sale" of narcotic drugs outside the premises would remain illegal.
The Open Society Institute created by George Soros, the financier, sponsors the Lindesmith Center to challenge "conventional" thinking about drugs. Its director, Ethan A. Nadelmann, argues from historical experience that in a legal market consumers prefer less potent drugs. Both the health and crime problem could be reduced, he contends, if drug "use" were distinguished from the drug "abuse" fostered by profit-seeking criminals.
But to Joseph A. Califano Jr., the founding president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, any "stamp of legality" on snorting cocaine or smoking crack would bring drugs a "new social acceptability," lead to a huge increase in the number of addicts and "light a new flame beneath health care spending." In a new book, "Radical Surgery" about health care policy, from which he has drawn the essay on page 40 of today's Magazine, the former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare pleads for a better balance of spending between enforcement of the drug laws and research, prevention and treatment.

BY FAR THE MOST POTENT PACKAGE IN THE mail response, however, brought the galleys of a book by a freelance writer, William Adler, to be published by Atlantic Monthly Press in April. He calls it "Land of Opportunity: One Family's Quest for the American Dream in the Age of Crack" and without the help of any illegal substance, it will blow your mind.
His tale was inspired by Isabel Wilkerson's front-page article in The Times of Dec. 18, 1988, recounting the trial of four brothers who moved to Detroit from rural Arkansas and turned an upstart marijuana business into a giant crack conglomerate "run like a Fortune 500 company."
The Wilkerson report was startling enough. She found a vast organization of kids "not using drugs as consumers but as capitalists," many lured from the cotton fields to be given a rigorous discipline, salaries up to $ 100 a day and an impressive work ethic: "If you are planning on getting rich," the gang's crude policy read, "you must forget about your girlfriends and family. You will not have too much time for parties and concerts. With hard work and dedication, we will all be rich within 12 months."
Understandably, Mr. Adler perceived a rare chance to illuminate the dynamics of the crack trade, from the coca paste production in Peru and Bolivia, to jungle refineries in Colombia, to wholesalers in Florida, then through "weight dealers" to street retailers like the Chambers brothers.
Like any successful entrepreneurs, he writes, they "learned how to buy wholesale, mass-produce and market their product and track inventory. . . . They implemented strict quality control measures, devised employee rules and regulations, benefit plans, performance bonuses, a customer incentive program. . . . At the height of their power, they grossed, conservatively, 55 million tax-free dollars a year."
Most commendably, Mr. Adler also explores the crushing poverty and prejudice into which the Chambers boys were born in Marianna, Ark., and the collapsed Detroit economy in which they found their customers. As he observes, "There is a reasonable explanation for the crack whirlwind: the head-on collision during the 1980's of the cultures of greed and need."
Mr. Adler lingers with his story after the Chambers boys are arrested and put away to note that smaller dealers were soon jostling to replace them. Of the 1,015 people sent to overcrowded prisons in the first three months of Detroit's major "crackdown on crack," nearly 80 percent were soon freed to find that drug selling remained a "rational" career choice. Many of the youngest Chambers employees returned to tiny Marianna, some to straighten out and go back to Lee Senior High, others to ply the retail and marketing techniques they had learned up north. Within just six months after the trial, the town's police chief reported, "I got a helluva crack problem down here."
So does all America so long as prohibition makes drug dealing the most profitable -- often the only profitable -- ghetto career, turning customers into pushers to replenish an unconquerable guerrilla army.

How a Legend Tapped the Rock Underground

BYLINE: By Fred Goodman; Fred Goodman, a contributing editor for Rolling Stone magazine, is writing a history of the rock-and-roll industry.

 BODY:
IN 1963, THE STUDIO MOGUL JACK
Warner bought Reprise Records from Frank Sinatra. The deal did not signal an appreciation of the record business by the studio head: Reprise -- even with Mr. Sinatra on its roster -- was a loser. Rather, Warner's studio had recently enjoyed a hit with "Ocean's 11," a Las Vegas caper film featuring the singer and several of his "rat pack" buddies, and the purchase of the label was part of a broader deal to tie up Mr. Sinatra as an actor. Even if Reprise continued to lose money, it was a cheap way of assuring that Mr. Sinatra would make movies for the studio -- a potential gold mine for Warner Brothers.
The deal did prove a gold mine, but not because of Frank Sinatra. Reprise gave Warner Brothers the services of a man whose ultimate value to the company over 31 years would dwarf Mr. Sinatra's: Mo Ostin.
At 68, the balding, bespectacled and low-key Mr. Ostin looks more like the controller he is by training than the monumental cultural visionary and business tactician he has proved to be. He stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of Warner Brothers Records on Dec. 31 after losing an unusually public corporate power struggle. But long after the dust of his departure has settled, Mr. Ostin's contribution to the record business will endure. Under his direction, Warner Brothers was transformed from a small, struggling label into the world's largest record company and the financial engine that drove Steve Ross's Warner Communications. Most significant, however, was the way Mr. Ostin achieved the transformation: by embracing the rock underground of the 60's when other, more conservative labels were loath to do so. 
 He built his company by developing careers rather than chasing hit records, a long-term strategy that empowered the rock underground and enriched Warner Brothers. But today, when record companies have become major profit centers for huge multinational entertainment conglomerates, quick hits are the order of the day. It is unlikely that this new global record industry will produce another executive of Mr. Ostin's patience and perspective.
"My feeling was always follow the artist, follow the music," he says. "It will lead you to the money." As a result of that philosophy, Warner Brothers Records became a creative and financial powerhouse and the label most admired by artists. George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Miles Davis, Elvis Costello, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, R.E.M., the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Quincy Jones have been among the established artists to come to Warner Brothers in the last 15 years. In contrast to the situation at other labels, money was rarely a deciding factor.
"We signed with Warner Brothers because of Mo," says Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, which jettisoned a more lucrative deal with Sony Music. "For me, dealing with most companies and most big record guys like Mo is always sort of uncomfortable. I feel like there's something going on that I don't understand. But he looks you in the eye, and you know there's an honest man talking to you."
Mr. Ostin says embracing rock music was "purely pragmatic business." Indeed, at the same time that Reprise was signing Jimi Hendrix, its sister label, Warner Brothers, was releasing Johnny Sea's pro-Vietnam War single, "Day for Decision." Still, once Mr. Ostin got a taste of the new music culture, he took to it with real fervor. By the late 60's Warner Brothers had been transformed from a record company whose roster was typified by Dean Martin and Allan Sherman to the home of the Grateful Dead, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Frank Zappa and the Fugs.
"Mo believed in personal freedom," says Ed Sanders of the Fugs. "The most important thing was that no matter how chaotic our vision was, he let us pursue it and lay down our brains on tape as we saw fit. He didn't do everything for money."
Mr. Ostin's willingness to empower artists grew out of his earliest experiences in the business. In 1954, when he joined the jazz impresario Norman Granz's Clef Records as controller, Mr. Ostin saw that Mr. Granz allowed artists -- including Count Basie, Billie Holiday and Dizzy Gillespie -- the freedom to make their own records. "Those guys got in the studio and improvised," says Mr. Ostin. "They had more control over their material than other artists might."
At Reprise, Mr. Ostin extended that control to rockers. When Joe Smith, a Warner Brothers executive, signed the Grateful Dead in 1967, it proved a turning point -- not because of their early albums, which didn't sell particularly well -- but because the Grateful Dead were standard-bearers of the drug culture. They were notorious -- and, by inference, so now was Warner Brothers. The group proved a magnet for other rockers who suddenly wanted to be on the label.

TO DEVELOP BOTH THE ART-
ists and the label, Mr. Ostin adopted an approach that Irving Thalberg had used in the 30's to turn MGM into a leading movie studio: hire the best people and give them their heads. Mr. Ostin believed that if he put the right recording artists under contract and paired them with a staff of outstanding producers and marketing executives, Warner Brothers would make the best records and attract the most ambitious artists.
At a time when other record companies were getting rid of staff producers, Warner Brothers was collecting them. Mr. Ostin's protege, Lenny Waronker, was the key executive on a staff that ranged from such eccentric producers as Van Dyke Parks and John Cale to mainstream hit makers like Richard Perry and Ted Templeman.
Mr. Ostin also assembled an irreverent team to handle advertising and marketing. While other labels stumbled over selling the new culture in the underground press -- Columbia's faux hippie campaigns like "The Man Can't Bust Our Music," for example, were publicly ridiculed -- Warner Brothers soared. The down-home honesty of Neil Young was promoted with a free bag of dirt from the Los Angles hippie haven Topanga Canyon; an ad for the Grateful Dead featured a "Pigpen lookalike contest," playing on the nickname for Ron McKernan, the band's hard-drinking keyboardist.
Mr. Ostin's approach also attracted other entrepreneurs and executives. "It was like walking into another world, a whole different planet," says Quincy Jones, who had spent more than 30 years in the music business before joining Warner Brothers in the early 80's. He points out that Mr. Ostin waited 10 years before he delivered his first album. "He'd noodge me and remind me," says Mr. Jones, "but he knew that when it was time I'd do it." That album, "Back on the Block." won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
Tom Silverman, who sold his hip-hop label Tommy Boy to Warner Brothers in 1989, views Mr. Ostin as "a natural Taoist."
"He's a guy who goes with the flow without overmanaging it," Mr. Silverman says. "He let people sink or swim on their own, as opposed to other labels where you got called on the carpet when you have your first failure. All of the charisma of Warner Brothers Records is Mo."
In Steve Ross, Mr. Ostin found a boss whose laissez-faire style of management matched his own. Mr. Ross's faith in Mr. Ostin paid huge dividends as the rock underground became the mainstream with best-selling artists like Fleetwood Mac, Prince and Madonna. In 1969, when Ross purchased the label's parent company, Warner-Seven Arts, the music operation's revenues were less than $200 million. In 1992, the year Mr. Ross died, those revenues exceeded $3.2 billion. During Mr. Ostin's tenure, the Warner Records Group -- which acquired Atlantic Records in 1967 and the Elektra label in 1970 -- added domestic and international distribution companies and its own manufacturing plant. By the mid-70's, Warner Brothers Records had come from nowhere to surpass Columbia as the industry leader.
Even competitors give Mr. Ostin his due, including Walter Yetnikoff, the former chairman of CBS Records who had vowed to "destroy" his rival. "I came up against Mo I don't know how many times, and I had very deep pockets," says Mr. Yetnikoff. "It's hard to knock anything Mo did."
Despite Mr. Ostin's extraordinary contribution to the growth of a company that has since become a part of the Time Warner conglomerate, Ross's death precipitated a change in management style that eventually led to Mr. Ostin's departure. He says only that he is leaving because the corporate culture has changed and that leaving was his decision, but he was reportedly unhappy at having a new boss, Bob Morgado, and at having his freedom to run the label curtailed. Mr. Ostin has said he will continue to work in the record business and is weighing several offers.
The industry's new economics, where business types have the final say over creative types, means there will probably be no more Mr. Ostins: executives with the freedom to shape large labels in their own image and throw their weight behind unorthodox signings, as Mr. Ostin did in 1968 with Tiny Tim.
"I signed unusual people all the time, whether it was the Fugs or the Sex Pistols or Captain Beefheart," Mr. Ostin says. "Tim was so unusual, he was so freaky, it just appealed to that perverse side of me."
Tiny Tim's commercial success was one more small proof of Mr. Ostin's business savvy. Even more telling, Mr. Ostin remains proud of the music on Tiny Tim's album. "The Beatles told producer Richard Perry that they loved that album," he says. "You should listen to it. It's wonderfully made."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN AUSTIN

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS; PETER H. LEWIS, who reports on cyberspace for The Times, lives in Austin.

 BODY:
AUSTIN surprises many first-time visitors who arrive expecting the capital city to be, well, more like Texas. Instead of dusty plains they find a hilly, green oasis laced by rivers and walking trails, where high-tech wizards, musicians, writers and artists are more common than cowboys or oil magnates.
Austin, which calls itself "The Live Music Capital of the World" for its many nightclubs and outdoor concerts, has been struggling to maintain its laid-back charm while coping with one of the fastest growth rates in the nation. But with the arrival of spring, which in Austin can begin in late February and is fully sprung in March, the town has more than enough charm and energy to share. 
 The economic bust of the late 1980's has ended with another boom. Formerly forested hilltops are increasingly covered with houses, and traffic, though modest by New York standards, has longtime locals grousing. Counting its swelling suburbs, Austin's population will probably surpass one million this year, nearly double its size a decade ago.
More than 100,000 students, half of them at the University of Texas, help keep the city intellectually lively and physically active. Hikers, bikers, runners, golfers, rowers, climbers, sailors and tennis players take advantage of the spring weather and fill the city's 11,800 acres of parks, and its winding lakes and rivers.
Austin has, per person, the highest bookstore sales among the country's 50 largest cities, the most highly educated populace among cities of 200,000 or more and the most computer-literate citizenry.
But Austin likes its parties, too. It claims the most restaurants, bars and movie screens per person of any American city.
 
Events
 The South by Southwest (SXSW) Music Festival in March has emerged as one of the most popular venues for new bands hoping to get the attention of record companies and critics. This year, the festival has expanded to 10 days of creative discussion, workshops and dusk-to-dawn entertainment, starting with a film festival March 10 to 12, and continuing from March 14 to 16 with a multimedia festival exploring the merger of computer technology and entertainment.
The music festival, however, is the big draw, and from March 15 to 19 hundreds of bands will fill the area's clubs, with jam sessions often spilling out into the streets. Hotel rooms and airline tickets are typically hard to come by around festival time. Wristbands good for admission to most clubs (arrive early) cost $35 and are available from Star ticket outlets, (800) 966-7469. The festival is headquartered at the Austin Convention Center, 500 East Cesar Chavez Street, (512) 476-5461.
A full pass to all music seminars and performances costs $250 until Feb. 24 and, after that, $295 until the festival begins. Call (512) 467-7979.
The annual Texas Hill Country Wine and Food Festival is scheduled for March 30 to April 2 at various locations around town, centered at the Four Seasons Hotel. On March 31 at the Four Seasons, there will be a tasting of signature dishes from 20 of the area's top restaurants. Tickets that will admit listeners to most festival events are $275. Friday through Sunday. Tickets are also available for individual events. Information: (512) 329-0770.
The annual Spam-O-Rama, on April 1, draws hundreds of devotees of the canned-meat product, for cooking and sculpture contests. The event will be held at the Cedar Door, 910 West Cesar Chavez Street, (512) 416-9307, from noon to dark.

 
The Outdoors
 Because temperatures rarely dip below freezing, and often sneak into the 70's and 80's even in midwinter, the city's 172 parks, 18 public and private golf courses and 30 miles of walking trails are busy year-round. The rolling hills to the west of town provide gentle challenges to hikers and bikers. A free map of the trails and other outdoor guides are available from the Austin Parks and Recreation Department at (512) 499-6700.
A short stroll south from Sixth Street, the main venue for music clubs, brings a visitor to Town Lake. The lake was created when a dam was built on the Colorado River, which flows through the center of town. It is lined with wide paths that accommodate feet and bicycles with equanimity.
The spiritual soul of Austin is Barton Springs Pool, on Barton Springs Road in Zilker Park, (512) 476-9044. Generations have gone to splash in the constant 68-degree water of this 1,000-foot-long spring-fed swimming hole. The pool is open 5 A.M. to 10 P.M. daily. Admission is free until mid-March, when it is $2, 50 cents for children 12 to 17, and 25 cents for children under 12.
Two of the most dazzling displays of nature return to Austin each March: wildflowers and bats.
Depending on such variables as sun and rain, the wildflower season typically begins on St. Patrick's Day, peaks in April and continues until May.
The formal opening of the new National Wildflower Research Center is scheduled for April 8 and 9. This 42-acre facility on the south side of town, at 4801 LaCrosse Boulevard, includes an innovative system of roof-top rain collectors, viaducts and cisterns integrated into Texas ranch- and Spanish mission-style buildings. Admission is free on rain days; when the sun shines, it is $3.50, $2 for students and seniors, $1 for children up to five years. Hours are 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday. For more information, (512) 292-4100.
The swallows of Capistrano are pikers compared to the bats of Austin. More than a million and a half Mexican free-tailed bats return late each March to the Congress Avenue Bridge downtown, creating the largest urban bat colony in North America. Starting before dark each day, a milelong cloud of bats billows into the sky. Even people who are intimidated by the flitting critters -- which avoid humans even more carefully than humans avoid them -- can enjoy the fact that they keep the city relatively free of mosquitoes until October. For information, call Bat Conservation International at (512) 327-9721.
 
Night Life
 Sixth Street flows through the center of Austin's music scene downtown, and in the course of a few blocks, a stroller will pass through currents of jazz, blues, rock, reggae, Mexican-influenced Tejano, pop, Texas swing, country, folk and assorted hybrids that pour from the doorways and make up "the Austin sound."
Not all the music clubs are downtown. Blues fans go to Antone's, 2915 Guadalupe Street, (512) 474-5314, where touring rock stars frequently show up in the wee hours. Open 8:30 P.M. to 2 A.M. Monday through Saturday; cover charge $3 to $12.
Any time after Independence Day (which in Texas means March 2, the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto), the music is likely to move outdoors -- often to Zilker Park or the banks of Town Lake near the statue of Stevie Ray Vaughan, an Austin-based blues legend who was to the guitar what Jim Bowie was to the knife. For concert and entertainment listings, check the weekly Austin Chronicle or the Thursday issue of The Austin American-Statesman.

 
Where to Eat

 Austin's restaurant scene is spiced by Southwestern, Gulf Coast and Mexican influences. Dining even in the finer restaurants is "Austin casual."
Zoot, just west of downtown, 509 Hearn Street, (512) 477-6535, is popular for imaginative dishes like salads of spinach and tatsoi (a green) with spicy walnuts, candied kumquats and sundried tomato vinaigrette ($5.95), and roasted duck breast on wild rice corn cakes ($15.95). Open every night 5:30 to 10:30. Dinner for two with wine, $65.
One of the most innovative menus in town is actually 25 minutes outside of town, at Hudson's on the Bend, 3509 Ranch Road 620 South, (512) 266-1369. The brave may want to try Omar's rattlesnake cakes with chipotle cream sauce ($7.50). Entrees often include such local or exotic meats as ostrich, venison, pheasant, elk and javelina (a boarlike creature), as well as more familiar fish, fowl and meats ($18 to $30). Dinner for two with wine, about $90.
Vegetarians can find refuge at the funky West Lynn Cafe, 1110 West Lynn Street, (512) 482-0950, which applies similar creativity to such dishes as the chile relleno ($8.50 at lunch, $7.95 at dinner), a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with jack cheese, corn, peas, brown rice, cilantro and Southwestern spices. Open at 11 or 11:30 A.M. daily and closes between 9:30 and 10:30, depending on the day of the week. Dinner for two with wine, $45.
Janis Joplin used to sing for her supper at Threadgill's, 6416 North Lamar Boulevard, (512) 451-5440, where, on Wednesday nights, one can still hear local musicians while sampling the vegetable plate that typically includes several down-home Southern favorites ($4.95). Open 11 A.M. to 10 P.M. daily. Dinner for two with Lone Star beer: $25.
 
Where to Stay

 The historic Driskill Hotel, 604 Brazos, (800) 527-2008, fax (512) 477-2214, has been deep in the heart of Austin's social and political life since 1886. The 177-room hotel is at the head of the Sixth Street entertainment district and a short walk from both the newly renovated State Capitol and Town Lake. Some say it also has a friendly ghost. Rates start at $122 for doubles, suites from $200.
Budget: Fifteen minutes west of downtown is the quiet 45-room Melbourne Hotel and Conference Center, 4611 Bee Caves Road, (512) 328-4000. The Melbourne is a good base for those who want to explore the hill country. The rooms include a small refrigerator. All rooms are $75.
Several national franchise hotels offer budget accommodations along Interstate 35 near downtown, including Ramada Inns, Motel 6, Holiday Inn and Best Western. One with modest rates and convenient location is the La Quinta Inn Capitol, 300 East 11th Street; (512) 476-1166, fax (512) 476-6044. Its rates start at $61.
Austin's historic areas offer several bed-and-breakfast options. The 10-room neo-classical Governor's Inn, 611 West 22d Street, (512) 479-0638, offers rates of $49 to $99, including a hearty breakfast.
Luxury: The Town Lake hike and bike path begins just beyond the swimming pool at the Four Seasons Hotel, 98 San Jacinto Boulevard; (512) 478-4500, fax (512) 477-0704. The Cafe downstairs is one of the best restaurants in town. Rates are $155 to $220; suites $210 to $1,200. Lakeside rooms have the best bat views.
Ausin's most luxurious secret is the Barton Creek Resort and Country Club, 8212 Barton Club Drive, (512) 329-4000, about 20 minutes west of downtown on the cusp of the Texas hill country. The ranch-style resort has 147 rooms, an elaborate fitness center and spa and several restaurants. Through February, special rates are $125 for a single, $135 for double. When golf season officially starts in March, room rates rise to $175 and $190. Greens fees plus cart for 18 holes: $80 on weekdays, $90 weekends.

HEADLINE: 'Carousel' Comes to a Stop As Its Cast Takes a Final Bow

BYLINE: By SARA KRULWICH 

 BODY:
EVEN AS TEARS FELL,
along with the final curtain at the Vivian Beaumont Theater earlier this month, "Carousel" was not entirely over. Nicholas Hytner's shimmeringly dark version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical has a new destination -- Tokyo -- and a new cast -- Japanese.
The Lincoln Center Theater presentation, originally produced by the Royal National Theater in London, received accolades when it opened in March of last year and went on to win five Tony Awards, including best musical revival. 
 Now, with its sets and costumes by Bob Crowley, the classic musical will open in Japan in May (where its top ticket price is expected to be close to 14,000 yen, or about $140 at current exchange rates; take that, Broadway complainers).
So the grim 19th-century New England factory that Julie Jordan escapes to ride the galloping red carousel horses with Billy Bigelow will live not only in memory. And as cast members in New York embraced, took snapshots, signed posters of the show and filled out unemployment forms, they, too, lived -- to be part of the next play or musical they join.
As the song says, and though it's not from "Carousel" it's true: Another opening, another show . . .

HEADLINE: Wyoming's Animals, Observed

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES; STEVEN A. HOLMES is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
WE parked the car on a deserted snow-swept road in Grand Teton National Park. As we unloaded our gear we paused to gaze at the craggy mountain peaks across the valley, disappearing in the cool January mist. But it was getting late, so our little group of six quickly snapped on snowshoes and set off through the deep, powdery snow, past stands of aspen and pine. About a mile into the forest we began scanning the treetops for our quarry. Five or six minutes later I spotted it: a kind of smudge sitting in the branches of a lodgepole pine.
"Hey Tom!" I yelled to the leader of our group as I pointed upward, "what's that up in that tree?" As we climbed a gentle slope toward the tree, we saw a porcupine, sitting serenely about 40 feet up. Tom Segerstrom, the research biologist who led our trek, filled a hypodermic needle with a blend of muscle relaxant and sedative, hooked it on a five-foot-long injection stick, grabbed a net and shinnied up the pine. We watched quietly, so we wouldn't scare the animal, as Mr. Segerstrom maneuvered close and stuck him in the left hip with the syringe. While he waited for the drugs to take effect, Mr. Segerstrom held the net underneath the porcupine. But, rather than dropping straight down, the animal tumbled backward off the limb, bounced off the net and fell to the ground. 
 Still in my snowshoes, I shuffled over to the animal, who was breathing shallowly, eyes blank. His mouth was slightly agape, exhibiting sharp orange teeth. I pulled on thick buckskin gloves to protect my hands from quills, hefted him by the tail and laid him on a big towel to keep him off the cold snow. Mr. Segerstrom was soon back on the ground, ashen-faced and angry at himself for the net mishap. But he had little time for self-reproach. He quickly got to work measuring and weighing the porcupine, ascertaining its sex (male) and collecting data for a research project on porcupines -- a project that we were able to observe and participate in.
After he recorded his observations, Mr. Segerstrom attached a blue tag to the porcupine's left ear and gave Jennifer, my 8-year-old daughter, the honor of naming him. She chose "Eric." Eric was still pretty groggy, but beginning to stir under the towel. Mr. Segerstrom waited until he was fully recovered while the rest of us showshoed back to the car. Fifteen minutes later he joined us, reporting that when last seen, Eric was scrambling up a tree.
A lanky native of Minnesota, Mr. Segerstrom, 39, has worked as a field biologist with the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. In 1986 he started the Great Plains Wildlife Institute, a commercial venture that finances research on animals using the proceeds of wildlife-viewing tours.
"I'm doing what some people are calling free-market environmentalism," Mr. Segerstrom says. "I'm trying to show that it's good for enterprise, that wildlife generates revenue and jobs and economic activity."
Prices for the institute's winter trips range from $65 an adult for a four-hour expedition to $1,980 for a six-day trip. Under Mr. Segerstrom's guidance, participants help with observation and information-gathering. He and his staff later convert their data into reports for state and Federal agencies or papers for scholarly journals.
In this case Mr. Segerstrom and a graduate student from the University of Montana were conducting research on how porcupines are affected by forest fires. We were in an area near one destroyed by one of the devastating Yellowstone National Park fires in 1988. Seven years after the blaze Mr. Segerstrom was trying to determine whether the porcupines had returned to the fire-doneged area or had remained on the periphery.
In and around Jackson Hole, there is no shortage of subjects to study: elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, coyotes, eagles, martens, hawks, beavers, otters, minks, sage grouse, bison, bears and more. Winter is a wonderful time to view this menagerie. Forced out of their isolated high-altitude habitats by snowstorms and plummeting temperatures, big mammals like elk, deer and moose migrate to winter feeding grounds in the valley.
The valley -- Jackson Hole -- is about 20 miles wide and 60 miles long, hemmed in by the Tetons that rise dramatically to the west and the more gentle sloping Gros Ventre Range to the east. The prime lure for most winter visitors is skiing; as a bonus, there are plenty of opportunities to view wildlife. Bordering the highway running from the airport to the town of Jackson is the 25,000-acre National Elk Refuge, where some 7,500 head of elk spend the winter months. It can be toured by horse-drawn sleigh. Other options include a guided cross country ski tour, snowmobile trip or excursions by dog sled in the nearby Grand Teton National Park.
But for both entertainment and education, we opted for a day tour with Mr. Segerstrom.
Our group, which included a marketing executive and freelance writer along with my wife, Marian, and daughter Jennifer, set out early one morning in Mr. Segerstrom's four-wheel drive Chevrolet. He provided powerful binoculars and 1,000-magnification telescopes for each of us. When someone spotted an animal, we would grab our scopes and hook them onto the car's side windows or pop up through the vehicle's sliding roof hatches and set them up on mini-tripods.
Mr. Segerstrom is a natural teacher, especially with children. At the start of the day, he endeared himself to Jennifer by asking her to sit up front with him and keep a list of the animals we would see. With his help, she categorized our finds -- among them, waterfowl, large mammals and raptors -- as he patiently advised her on the spellings.
Traveling in the elk refuge we saw a group of coyotes nuzzling in the snow, searching for field mice. Suddenly, one began to hop backward on all four legs, a sign that he had sniffed out a meal. He dug his snout deep into the ground, but when he raised it, his jaws were empty. For the moment, the mouse had escaped. As we watched, Mr. Segerstrom played recordings of the coyotes' moody high-pitched wail over loudspeakers on the car to see if the animals would respond. But, busy with their hunt, they paid us no heed.
A short way down the road and high above us on a stone outcropping, we spied several Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, including mature rams and ewes with their lambs. The horns of one adult circled almost completely around his ears, like enormous spit curls.

OUT in the huge meadow was the elk herd itself. Inclined by nature to stick together, the males stayed in one part of the refuge while the females huddled with the young several yards away. Pawing through the light layer of snow, the animals seem to have no trouble finding grass. When harsher weather and deeper snows set in, the rangers will supplement their diets with alfalfa pellets; nevertheless, scores will succumb to the harsh conditions and the lack of food.
At Nowlin Pond, in the refuge, three trumpeter swans floated regally on the chilly water amid merganser and pintail ducks. Snow white with ebony beaks, they are the world's largest species of waterfowl, weighing up to 30 pounds, with a wing span of eight feet. Mr. Segerstrom had Jennifer note the number of swans, the exact location and time they were spotted, and whether they had bands around their necks indicating they had been captured and tagged as part of a census of native trumpeters. Since 1991, the number of swans in the region has been declining, and biologists suspect the problem to be an invasion of Canadian swans competing for food. Mr. Segerstrom would report his observations to the State Game and Fish Department.
Lunch, which is included in the tour price, was at Jackson's Wort Hotel, where the menu includes buffalo steak and venison stew. Once a part of the town's red-light district, the Wort was a haven for illegal gambling, and occasionally cowboys rode their horses into the hotel's Silver Dollar Bar, named for the 2,032 silver dollars laid into its serpentine counter. Despite its history and Old West memorabilia, the Wort wasn't built until 1941.
South of town, we saw several bald eagles, including one sitting on a sandbar in the Snake River feeding on a dead eagle. Seeking a better photo angle, I urged Mr. Segerstrom to inch the car closer to the bird. He was reluctant, fearing we would scare the bird off its meal. Sure enough, as we moved closer, the eagle took flight. I contritely absorbed the lesson about impinging.
Mr. Segerstrom drove us to sites where he had seen buffalo earlier in the week, but we never did spot the behemoths. We also hoped to catch a glimpse of an otter snoozing in the sun, but no luck.
As we headed northeast from Jackson, Mr. Segerstrom told us to look for huge black shapes against the white landscape and thickets of red willow bushes. We soon had a moose in our sights. As we looked through the telescopes, we focused on one near a stream chewing indolently on red willow, its favorite food. For the rest of my stay in Jackson Hole, I never passed a clump of red willow without scanning them to see if any moose lurked about.

Sole Expense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former principal dancer with the Dance Theater of Harlem, I am aware of the financial struggles of professional dancers living on sub-starvation wages ["Dancing Precariously on the Bottom Line," Jan. 8]. In addition to the cuts in funding and fierce competition faced by modern-dance companies, ballet companies have an extra handicap in their efforts to stay solvent: they must spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on pointe shoes. (New York City Ballet, for example, spends $500,000 annually.) 
 Unfortunately, these delicate satin slippers, made of paste and cardboard, begin to disintegrate after a few releves. At about $55 a pair, they are a parent's nightmare. A more durable, better quality slipper may eventually provide some financial relief to ballet companies -- and to the parents of budding ballerinas.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Long Island;
6 Downtowns Form Business Improvement Districts

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
RIVERHEAD wants to capitalize on the area's tourist economy.
Huntington needs to do something about the kids who hang around its bars. 
 Great Neck wants to promote its stores to a wider radius of shoppers.
Long Island's central business areas may not be suffering from the same crime and problems pf the homeless that gave rise to many of Manhattan's Business Improvement Districts.
But over the last four years, six Long Island downtowns -- in Great Neck, Cedarhurst, Huntington, Patchogue, Riverhead and Westbury -- have turned to that same solution. And it looks like a seventh BID will soon start up in Greenport.
"Only a well-funded central business authority can compete with a shopping center with a huge war chest," said Robert Werner, a Great Neck property owner.
All of the BID's are grappling with economic and demographic forces that are unlikely to reverse themselves with the current economic improvement. Malls, including huge ones like Americana in Manhasset and strip malls along the Long Island Expressway, have simply siphoned away too many downtown shoppers.
Many Long Island downtowns entered the 90's with their shopping streets pockmarked with vacant stores. The remaining stores found themselves increasingly competing against new outlet centers and discount megastores, offering bargains within easy driving distance.
Ad hoc merchants' groups that tried cooperative ads or other joint competitive attempts generally fell apart.
"There's always a core group that will do the work and provide the funds, and a group that figures it will get the free benefit," said Patricia E. Frankenbach, who owns a store that sells uniforms in Riverhead and is vice president of the Riverhead BID.
Shopping-center tenants are not allowed such recalcitrance. Most are required in their leases to chip in for advertising and promotion. Thus, the centers can afford full-page newspaper ads and fancy promotions.
"The neighboring malls simply presented a more united face," said Bernard Flaton, a landlord who helped start Cedarhurst's BID last April.
The Long Island BID's are having to fight back without much money. By law, a BID's budget cannot exceed 20 percent of a general municipal tax. In New York City, that tax includes school taxes. In most Long Island villages, school taxes are separate, so the general municipal tax is a relatively small figure. Great Neck's BID, Long Island's largest, covers an area with 32 office buildings and 250 stores, yet its budget is only $140,000 a year.
Still, the BID's have been able to afford holiday decorations, street fairs, jazz concerts and advertising. Several have set up recruitment committees to woo new stores to town. And others have quietly pressured local property owners and storekeepers to do a better job of cleaning up, and to be flexible in negotiations.
"We try to get landlords to split the cost of building out a store, or to take $10 a foot rather than hold out for $13," said David Friedman, a Westbury jeweler who is president of the Westbury BID.
The results can be heartening. In most of the BID areas, store vacancies are down and shopping traffic is up. BID officials insist a great deal more than an improving economy is at play.
"With a BID you don't have to knock on doors every time you need money," said Ron M. Edelson, executive director of the Great Neck BID. "You can plan things."
Mr. Edelson offers this example: Great Neck's annual downtown street fair used to be a haphazard affair, with each merchant maybe hiring a clown, or arranging for face-painting for kids.
Last year the BID paid for an antique car show, kiddie rides and a food court. And it got the word out in advance: Bobby Rivers of WNBC-TV provided live coverage of the event.
It had a record turnout.
"WHEN you have Channel 4 saying, 'Come to Great Neck today,' you get people who normally wouldn't come," said Millie Gubbins, who has run a local restaurant, Millie's Place, for 18 years.
Actually, until recently, many Long Island downtowns might have suffered from the spotlight. Patchogue's BID, which was formed in November 1991, took as its first tasks putting in new sidewalks and street lights and arranging for extra police in its downtown parking areas.
"We needed beautification and security before promotion," said Gerard R. Nocita, Patchogue's deputy village clerk.
But now Patchogue is promoting with a vengeance. Late last year Burlington Coat Factory opened a large Patchogue outlet. And Mr. Nocita says the BID is trying to woo the Brookhaven town hall away from Medford, its current home.
Huntington, too, is concentrating on safety and cleanliness. Its downtown has weathered the recession fairly well, but its new BID sees itself as preventive medicine.
"This is an upscale area, and it can't be adequate, it has to be excellent," said James S. Margolin, the BID's president.
Huntington's BID only officially came into being on Jan. 1, but the village gave it an advance on its $75,000 annual budget. It used the money for holiday decorations and new trash receptacles, and to start Sunday trash pickups "so Monday morning doesn't look so terrible," Mr. Margolin said.
Huntington's BID will also pay for a private security officer to patrol at night in warm weather and at high traffic times like Halloween and New Year's Eve.
"We have so many bars and restaurants, and they are frequented by so many young people, that we simply have to have better security," Mr. Margolin said.
Huntington has been luckier than some in that it has attracted Sam Goody's, Bombay Company, the Gap and other Triple A national retailers. Other Long Island BID districts either do not have large-enough storefronts to accommodate such chains, or have conceded such product lines to the malls.
"The megastores and malls are in our backyard now, and that's where the clothing and shoe stores belong," said Mr. Friedman of Westbury. "We need service stores, and stores that will help us capitalize on the traffic the malls generate."
Through direct mail and cooperative advertising, the Westbury BID has been promoting sights around the town -- including the sight of Mr. Friedman's artisans making jewelry. And it has offered brokers extra bonuses for bringing in new service stores, like appliance-repair shops and restaurants.
Riverhead, too, is de-emphasizing traditional retailing in favor of what Ms. Frankenbach calls a "tourist economy." Its BID has persuaded the local government to buy an abandoned movie theater and turn it into a cultural center. It encouraged a local businessman to start paddlewheel lunch and dinner cruises on the Peconic River. It is working with the Okeanos Research Federation, which may open an aquarium in the center of town. Its real estate committee, meanwhile, is gearing up to woo restaurants and other tenants that can cater to the traffic that such operations might generate.
GREAT NECK, in contrast, remains geographically isolated enough to get a bit of protection from mall competition. But that sword cuts both ways: It is on its own peninsula, so it is not a town that anyone goes through on the way to someplace else. And a few chain retailers -- CVS, for example -- have opened in town, providing a boost for the landlords but a kick to the long-time local shopkeepers.
"We were a trendy, upscale, boutique shopping area that always felt immune to the ups and downs of the economy," Mr. Edelson said. "Then this recession hit, and we found out we weren't immune at all."
What local merchants want most from their BID is publicity. "The BID can help show what this town really has to offer," said Neil Jacobson, who owns Vogue Discount, a health and beauty-aids store that Mr. Jacobson says has been "devastated" by competition from discounters like CVS.
The BID already has bombarded consumers with newspaper ads and direct-mail brochures. Soon it will widen its net, to ensnare shoppers from New Hyde Park and Manhasset to the east, and from Bayside to the west.
But the BID's consumer research has indicated that shoppers will continue to defect to malls unless service in Great Neck stores is vastly improved. The BID is developing seminars about the mechanics of personalized selling -- say, calling customers when an item they might like comes into stock. And it hopes to persuade Great Neck merchants to share data about customers.
"That's not easy, getting store owners to share, but we think we can do it," Mr. Edelson said. "We have to."

HEADLINE: Grand Central Makeover Is Readied

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FROM floor to star-speckled Sky Ceiling, a $113.8 million makeover of Grand Central Terminal is poised to begin this year, after almost a decade of planning, rethinking, deal making and just enough actual restoration to have whetted the appetites of many commuters and visitors for more.
The rebuilding project would be the most ambitious in the landmark's 82-year history. It would fundamentally alter the way people use the terminal, opening new spaces, passages and vistas throughout the structure, with more staircases and escalators to integrate the different levels. The plan would increase by as much as 80 percent the areas devoted to stores and restaurants. 
 "The chances of this project's survival are good," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "This has a long history, it has support from the business community and from my board and we've been very creative about how to finance this."
Construction could begin on the Main Concourse "in the next couple of months," said Susan E. Fine, director of real estate for the M.T.A. The Metro-North Commuter Railroad would meet $30 million of the total cost through its capital program. The balance, $84 million, would be raised through the sale of bonds.
Although the Grand Central project may be more credible than ever as a real estate venture, its political future is not clear, given Gov. George E. Pataki's determination to "cut spending and then cut it again." No decision has been made about the terminal by the month-old administration. The Governor's deputy press secretary, Robert D. Bulman, said only that "all projects are under review," adding that "with a $5 billion budget deficit looming, everything is under consideration."
Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson said he and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani were "very positive and very enthusiastic" about the project. "We both understand how important it is to revive a very major landmark and a gateway to the city," said Mr. Dyson, who is in charge of finance and economic development. "This is one of the projects of the M.T.A that we endorse."
Peter S. Kalikow, a developer who sits on the M.T.A. board and heads the Governor's transition committee on transportation, said of the project: "My sense is that it should go forward. Among other reasons, it's actually self-supporting. It creates enough cash flow to service any debt that would be incurred."
Ms. Fine said she believed the economics of the Grand Central rebuilding could survive budget-cutters' scrutiny because, as she wrote in a recent memorandum to the M.T.A. board, the "retail improvements will ultimately yield increased revenues that will cover the cost of the bonds."
"We're spending money that the rents generate," she said. "These are not dollars that would otherwise go into the subway."
The increase would come from the creation of up to 80,000 square feet of new retail space, higher rents and a "more dynamic" leasing program, Ms. Fine said.
IN a financial model developed by the M.T.A. and Lehman Brothers, the authority could expect $13 million in rent from Grand Central tenants in 1999, the first year after completion of the project, or $5.6 million more than would otherwise be realized. In 2009, the redevelopment is expected to generate $17.5 million in rents, or $7.5 million more than would otherwise be realized.
Mr. Kalikow said the project "relies on the principal of privatization, in effect, which is what Governor Pataki sets as a very important goal in his administration."
LaSalle Partners will direct and manage the work and Williams Jackson Ewing will handle retail planning and leasing. The same team was allied in the 1988 renovation of Union Station in Washington as a shopping and dining center.
Robert F. Works, a managing director of LaSalle, said, "The contracts have been written with strong incentives for maximum performance, as if we did have our money in it, and that allows us to create the same kind of success as at Union Station, where we did have an equity interest."
The plan has been drawn up by Beyer Blinder Belle, which last month won the architecture firm award from the American Institute of Architects for its overall body of work, "incorporating vital new uses for our landmark structures." The partner in charge of Grand Central is John Belle.
The total project cost is $113.8 million, of which $71.7 million goes to construction and $25.9 million goes to architectural, engineering, management, leasing, financing and legal fees, marketing and promotion, retail tenant allowances and insurance. Another $16.2 million is earmarked for contingency reserves and engineering by Metro-North.
In the construction budget, $27.5 million is for the Main Concourse, $15.7 million for the Suburban Concourse, $8.6 million for the balconies, $6.6 million for a new loading area, $5.5 million for the new 43d Street Passage, $4.8 million for a new monumental staircase in the Main Concourse and $3.1 million for the relocation of offices.
The project has won an approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, although some details were debated.
"There was this enormously positive response to the fact that there was going to be a major investment," said Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the commission. "It is not just a cosmetic plan, although it will have great cosmetic impact. They are really going to do functional work in the terminal to upgrade and modernize it."
The plan has not yet been approved by the state Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, acting as the state historic preservation officer. Gov. Pataki's choice for that post is Bernadette Castro, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate seat held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
"We start with a general sense of approbation and delight at the resurgence of concern and support for Grand Central," said J. Winthrop Aldrich, deputy commissioner for historic preservation, a holdover appointee. "I think the courage, leadership and imagination of Metro-North and the M.T.A. is commendable."
"It's fair to say we had pretty minimal issues," Mr. Aldrich said. One of those concerns -- also expressed by the city commission -- involved how much space would remain open on the balconies, which are largely to be given over to use by restaurants. "We agreed to make 20 percent of the balcony areas public," Ms. Fine said.
Mr. Aldrich said he could not hazard a guess as to when the agency would sign the necessary memorandum of agreement.
ONE might examine the plan as if one were walking through the terminal, entering through the center doors on 42d Street, under the pale green Pershing Square viaduct.
The former Waiting Room, second only to the Main Concourse as a grand public space, was restored in 1992. It was once thought that its best reuse would be as a restaurant. However, a number of successful seasonal markets have been conducted in the room since then and it is likely that this will be continued on a more permanent basis.
Between the Waiting Room and Main Concourse is a walkway lined by ticket machines and abandoned ticket windows. These would be replaced by an open balustrade, turning the walkway into a bridge over the broad ramps that converge below, leading to the Oyster Bar and Suburban Concourse. Office space built over the ramps in 1927 would be removed, opening them to the concourse skylights.
The Main Concourse would inspire a double take -- literally. At the east end, where there is now a Chemical Bank automated teller center, a monumental new staircase would be constructed, virtually a mirror image of the staircase that cascades down from the Vanderbilt Avenue taxi portico.
The key problem for the state commission is the appearance of the new staircase. It cannot copy the west staircase too closely, according to Federal guidelines, as it might confuse observers into thinking that it was an original element. Mr. Belle said its balustrade would have simpler details than the west staircase, so the two would "fit like gloves" from a distance but retain their distinction on close inspection.
This staircase would lead up to the East Balcony, long the home of the Kodak Colorama and now the virually inaccessible site of eight rather scraggly looking potted trees. With the new staircase in place, it would become a restaurant.
Restaurants would also be installed in the North Balcony, on either side of the escalator bank. This space is now vacant. One restaurant might wrap around to the corner of the West Balcony now occupied by the Cafe at Grand Central.
The other half of the balcony, now a waiting area, would also become a restaurant, which might extend through an elevator lobby to the Campbell Apartment. Although it looks like a sumptuous residence, this was the office in the 1920's of John W. Campbell, president of the Credit Clearing House. It has a two-story ceiling, walnut paneling, travertine walls, oak floors, leaded-glass windows, fireplace and wine cellar.
To give restaurant patrons on the balcony a clear view into the concourse, the floors are to be raised on 18-inch platforms.
Restoration of the Sky Ceiling above the Main Concourse would be financed in part by $1 million from the Grand Central Partnership and $2 million from the Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, Ms. Fine said.
A preview is afforded in the southeast corner, where a 35 by 75 foot patch was cleaned in 1991, revealing the feet of Aquarius and the stream of water from his jar.
(The mural visible today is a copy painted in 1944 by Charles Gulbrandsen on 4-by-8-foot fiberboard panels cemented over the original ceiling. Mr. Belle said the 1913 mural was beyond salvaging, because of water damage before the 1940's and the way the fiberboard panels were attached.)
WEST of the Main Concourse, new escalators would be built where there is now a Lindy's restaurant and Haagen-Dazs shop. Clustered near these escalators would be the new waiting room, parcel room, toilets and station master's office. Beyond this area is the Incoming Train Room, which was restored in 1985. Mr. Works sees this as a possible book and magazine store, with a cafe, perhaps decorated in a railroad motif.
The West Shuttle Passage that leads from the subway would be closed to permit the creation of large blocks of retail space in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 square feet.
These stores would front on a renovated East Shuttle Passage, the ceiling of which would be doubled in height through the elimination of office space overhead that is now used by Federal Express. This passage also leads up to the semicircular entrance at Vanderbilt Avenue and 42d Street.
East of the concourse, many changes would be evident. Most fundamental would be the creation of the 43d Street Passage, leading to a new entrance on Lexington Avenue, in a 46-foot channel between the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Graybar Building. Occupying the space is a two-story building that used to be a bank branch, tunneling through which is the covered driveway leading to the terminal's loading dock.
To create the passage, the loading dock had to be shifted elsewhere. Ms. Fine said she negotiated an arrangement to move the terminal's loading area to five of the Graybar Building truck bays on Depew Place.
Much of the existing bank structure would be reused for the new passage. There would be a new limestone facade, with an entablature inscribed "Grand Central Terminal," above which a large clock would serve as pediment. Within the passage would be high-quality take-away food dealers (think Zabar's, Dean & DeLuca or Macy's Cellar).
The parallel Graybar Passage is already distinguished by its broad space, travertine walls and vaulted ceilings. But the passage in the Hyatt Hotel is fairly bleak. The storefronts would be rebuilt with shallow bay fronts and marble pilasters, recalling somewhat the arcades of London. The area would be renamed the Lexington Passage.
At the west end of the 43d Street Passage, directly across from the new AT&T calling center, another new set of escalators to the lower level would be constructed.
These escalators, the new east staircase and the new Oyster Bar ramps will all serve to make the Suburban Concourse more accessible. It would become a food court, not unlike the lower level of Union Station.
Eight of the enormous double-sided oak benches from the old Waiting Room might be reused in the concourse, arranged in two diamond patterns of four benches each, which would accommodate diners on the inside and passersby on the outside.
Food counters and showcases would be in the concourse but preparation, cooking and storage areas would be located behind the 18 unused ticket windows. Doors would be cut into six windows, which was another source of contention at the landmarks commission.
Ms. Raab, who was persuaded of the need to do so, said: "That cut makes it possible for there to be food service in the lower concourse. That's a beautiful space. I long for the day when people are using it."

HEADLINE: ART;
Esthetic and Sentimental Aspects in Two Shows by Women

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

 BODY:
AT the Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick is "A View of One's Own," a show of 80 works drawn from the collection bestowed by the National Association of Women Artists, formed in 1889, on Douglass College at Rutgers University.
The collection ranges from Mary Cassatt's drypoint of a woman, illustrated on this page, to a painting by Judy Chicago, well known for her 1970's installation of a dinner table set with plates shaped like female genitals. Her work here is a folk art-style painting of childbirth, covered with embroidery by another hand. 
 Another current show is the smaller display by contemporary women at the gallery at the Kent Place School in Summit.
Groundbreakers though they are by comparison, the women at the Zimmerli seem more concerned with esthetics than their counterparts at Kent. Proclaming this at the start of the show is Janet Scudder's nude, apparently designed for a fountain. The roughly half-life-size bronze stands hipshot, raising an admonitory finger at the frog sitting at her feet. For some, the subject's elegance may disqualify it from being regarded as art. It is a fine sculpture, nonetheless.
What follows is not exactly an adventure, nor is it a survey; it is, rather, a miscellany that includes good lesser-knowns as well as the tried and true. Two color woodcuts worthy of attention are Margaret Patterson's "Sailboat," with its implications of Post-Impressionismt cloisonnism, and an Art Deco landscape by Blanche Lazzell. Then there is a turbulent painting of a parade by Theresa Bernstein, an Expressionist with Ashcan leanings who, according to a pamphlet accompanying the show, found New York City to be much as it is now, a contrast between "entertainment and unemployment."
Abstractionists like Alice Trumbull Mason and Helen Frankenthaler are absent, but Elizabeth Bishop is present with an unusually animated etching of a couple in conversation. New to this observer are Takayo Noda, Helen Gerardia and Olga Poloukhine. Ms. Noda's color etching of retrousse shapes is remarkable not only as a successful blend of Japanese and Western influences but also as a bold design in rich colors with a velvety texture.
Ms. Gerardia contributes a 1960 casein landscape translated into an abstraction of dark verticals and horizontals on a creamy ground and an earlier lithograph of a church evoking the daintier geometry of Viera da Silva. In Ms. Poloukhine's recent egg tempera, women in a subway car strap-hang together -- Byzantine personages with solemn faces.
As for the stars, Louise Nevelson has not yet reached her prime in the all-black relief of 1959 that is composed mainly of semicircular ledges stacked vertically and horizontally. She receives some no doubt unintentional homage from Dorothy Dehner in "Window With a View," an unpainted wood construction of 1978. Alice Neel scores with a marvelous etched portrait of a man whose head seems to have been squashed in a vise. Other notables include Pat Adams, Minna Citron, Clare Leighton and Miriam Schapiro.
The show continues through March 26. Hours for the museum, at George and Hamilton Streets, are 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and noon to 5 P.M. weekends.
To say that the sense of grievance missing from the Zimmerli production is all too apparent in the Kent Place anthology is not to fault its curator, Judy Lapides, who directs the gallery and teaches art at the school. It is, rather, to comment again on the sentimentality that seems to afflict all special-interest groups.
The chief exponent in "Voices" is Kathleen Yacoe-Hughes, whose series of small oils reflects on the mother-daughter relationship, from (naturally) the daughter's viewpoint. A white image shaped like a molar metamorphoses into a pair of figures joined like Siamese twins, evolving finally into two landscapes scratched in gray paint and divided by the words "She ran away."
Robin Middleman contributes a locket-size version of a self-portrait by Frida Kahlo, the unofficial patron of female martyrs. But she also includes a painting of herself embedded in broken china and checkerboard images of heads, one dotted with cut-outs of cherubs and other Victoriana. In a large black drawing of an upside-down nude, Millicent Sabater celebrates the Queen of the Amazons. Betsy Regan is represented by fragmentary paintings of bones, Roslyn Rose by designerish assemblages (one is illustrated).
The piece de resistance, however, is the wall "tiled" with canvases recording the artist Elyse Taylor's "Passage in Life," of which the most memorable features an English telephone booth painted red on a black ground.
On the credit side, the installation is crisp and professional; likewise the gallery, which is on a campus that is part Swiss chalet, part Tudor in style, and it is open Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. The address is 42 Norwood Avenue in Summit, and the show closes Feb. 10.

Weiss presents the ultra-rightists in Idaho as wacky, paranoid cranks because they fear that trends toward a New World Order and a cashless economy are depriving Americans of their freedom. But they are right that the growing power of distant economic elites is making democratic oversight of economic choices more difficult, contributing to inequality within and between nations, and shrinking opportunities for small businesses and farms. The replacement of cash with computerized transfer of funds facilitates access to all kinds of information about personal finances and consumer choices to those willing to pay for it.

HEADLINE: How Much for a Life? Try $3 Million to $5 Million

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
YOU'VE watched in horror a dozen times: Scenes of barely recognizable aircraft parts strewn across smoldering moonscapes, with the occasional shoe or child's toy the only reminders of lives snuffed out in unimaginable terror. And no doubt you've wondered when it would be your turn, a thought quickly shrugged away but never truly forgotten.
Flying, everyone knows, is a risky business. Any expense that makes it safer thus seems an expense worth making. And the only question most people ask after a crash is how to get the regulators to get off their duffs before the next one. 
 But the truth comes in shades of gray, not black and white. Americans' obsession with the tiny probability of dying in an airline accident is, at best, a distraction from the reality that commercial aviation is one of the great blessings of the age. At worst, it is an invitation to expensive and even self-defeating fixes, a symptom of our inability to cope sensibly with risk. But Republican conservatives in Congress are now pressing for a more sharp-penciled analysis of the cost of Government health and safety regulations.
Just how safe is flying in America? Based on the experience of the last two decades, Arnold Barnett, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sets the probability of dying from unnatural causes on your next commercial jet flight at about one in seven million. A flier who boards a jet each day can thus expect to meet the grim reaper every 19,000 years.
The propeller planes linking hundreds of small cities to big airports are three or four times as dangerous. But that only brings the odds of ending up a grim statistic to one in two million. The chance of suffering a heart attack while waiting for the conveyor belt to mangle your luggage is much greater.
The yawning gap between the actual and imagined risk of flying no longer surprises specialists in risk analysis, who make careers of explaining why people who brush aside the dangers of driving on icy highways or gorging on cookie dough ice cream are so ready to believe that portable phones cause brain cancer. But a comparison of the way risk analysts think about safety with the way Government balances risk against potential gain is sobering.
Probabilities alone don't offer much insight into which chances are worth taking. That question, suggests the brave new science of risk analysis, can be answered only by weighing the cost of avoiding a statistical death against the subjective value of life.
Try that one again. Assume for the sake of argument that it would cost $500 per car to put anti-skid brakes in each of the 10 million cars sold this year -- a total of $5 billion. Assume that installing the gadgets on this year's fleet would ultimately save 5,000 lives, or $1 million per life. Assume that, on average, people value their lives at up to $5 million. Since the $1 million cost of saving a life is less than the $5 million value of life, the safety feature must be worth buying.
Sounds O.K., at least until the part about the value of life being $5 million. Who is to say that a life is worth $5 million rather than $500 million?
One answer is Americans couldn't afford to spend $500 million. Kip Viscusi, an economist at Duke University, estimates that if the entire gross national product were devoted to making life safer, there would only be $55 million available to prevent each accidental death. So, at least in this limited sense, life must be worth less than $55 million.
More to the point, people voluntarily accept the risk of death in return for money all the time. Dozens of studies have imputed a value to life from data on the extra wages required to lure workers to perform dangerous jobs. If, for example, it takes an extra $100,000 in lifetime earnings to persuade miners to cope with one extra chance in a hundred of premature death underground, miners must implicitly value their lives at no more than 100 times $100,000, or $10 million.
Dozens of other studies have focused on the cost of safety devices that are voluntarily purchased in order to assay how much people are willing to spend to reduce the probability of accidental death. If smoke detectors cost $20 and are widely seen as reducing the risk of a fiery death by one chance in 10,000, buyers must value their lives at at least 20 times 10,000, or $200,000.
These studies hardly produce uniform answers -- nor do risk analysts expect them to. After all, people have very different "tastes" for risk. But researchers are still willing to generalize. Most middle-income Americans, they say, usually act as if their lives were worth $3 million to $5 million based on what they demand in extra pay for dangerous jobs and what they spend for safety devices.

A FEW Federal agencies, notably the Department of Transportation, evaluate new health and safety regulations by comparing an estimate of the cost per life that would probably be saved against a benchmark figure. But most are too savvy to be caught putting a value on life. And in some cases, the law actually bars consideration of cost in deciding how safe is safe enough.
The result is a hodgepodge of cost-effective regulations mixed with inconceivably expensive ones. At one extreme are rules that actually save money as well as lives. Mandatory childhood immunization programs, for example, cost less than treating the diseases. At the other extreme are rules that probably save only a statistical fraction of a life, and at enormous cost. Strict controls on benzene emissions by tire makers run to an estimated $340 billion per life spared.
The most wasteful rules, however, are the ones that do save dozens of lives but at farcical cost. Draconian controls on toxic wastes from a variety of manufacturing plants, as well as cleanup standards for abandoned uranium mines and chemical waste sites, fit the category. Indeed, with cleanup obligations on the books that would cost government and industry several hundred billion dollars to meet over the next decade, risk researchers argue that the net impact of the programs on life expectancy may actually be perverse.
How so? The affluent live longer than the poor, at least in part because they have the will and the means to lead more secure lives. Not only are they more likely to visit a doctor before a cough turns into pneumonia, they can afford fresh vegetables, health clubs and bicycle helmets for their kids.
Hence the life-lengthening effects of requiring auto makers to install anti-skid brakes or preventing trace chemicals from ending up in drinking water must be weighed against the life-shortening effects of reducing living standards in order to pay the bill.
Mr. Viscusi estimates that the break-even point in what specialists have dubbed "risk-risk" calculations is around $10 million. Thus by his reckoning, regulations that reduce private spending by more than $10 million per statistical life saved are probably self-defeating.
Where does airline safety fit in this picture? When pressed to mandate life-preserving technology for commercial aircraft, the Federal Aviation Agency has generally acted with one eye on the economics. According to a 1984 study, smoke detectors required in airplane lavatories save lives for about a half-million dollars each. Emergency floor lighting runs to approximately $1 million per life saved -- well under the $3 million to $5 million benchmark for the value of life. Still, some of the most hotly debated proposals suggest just how seductive bad ideas can be.
Infants can't use ordinary seat belts, so they are more vulnerable than adults in survivable airplane accidents unless they are strapped into special child seats. But there is a big catch here: Airlines insist that parents buy tickets for children if kids are to be assured seats of their own. So if Washington had demanded child restraints in response to petitions from safety groups in the 1980's, an estimated one-fifth of the infants who now fly in relative safety would be priced out of the air and end up traveling at greater risk in autos. On balance, more lives would be lost in cars than saved in planes.
A parallel question -- one hardly ever asked -- is whether aircraft manufacturers voluntarily spend too much on safety. If free markets worked according to Hoyle, one might expect Boeing and Airbus to sell less-safe planes, were it profitable to do so. But since aircraft makers and airlines -- not to mention product liability lawyers -- are deeply reluctant to acknowledge that there is any acceptable trade-off between cost and safety, such calculations are apparently never made in any systematic way.
What is apparent, though, is that commercial aviation is now so safe and the system that keeps it safe is so complex that the rare fatal accident offers little insight into how flying could be made safer at reasonable cost. Take the case of USAir and its subsidiaries, which suffered seven deadly accidents in seven years -- a frequency of mishaps that Mr. Barnett of M.I.T. calculates had only a 2 percent probability of being purely coincidental. Add the fact that USAir was apparently guilty of an embarrassing number of safety and training miscues, including the failure to refuel a plane before take-off, and it is understandable why many travelers are looking for other ways to get to Pittsburgh.
But like the clusters of rare cancers that occasionally make headlines, clusters of airline accidents are harder to interpret than it might at first seem. Much depends on how the universe of possible coincidences is defined. For while the probability that chance alone generated USAir's unenviable safety record was just 1 in 50, there was a probability of 1 in 8 that some major airline that was no more dangerous than its competitors would crack up seven planes in seven years. One in 8 is still daunting odds, but not quite a smoking gun.
Even if one concedes that USAir must have been doing something disastrously wrong, it is hard to pinpoint what it was doing disastrously wrong. While it is gratifying to see that USAir pilots are now on notice to double-check fuel gauges before take-off, it is far from clear that the carrier's safety lapses were more serious than those of competitors with spotless accident records.
Safe air travel is worth some money and trouble, of course. And, no doubt, the tens of thousands of people who earn their paychecks keeping it safe will come up with some affordable ideas on how to make it safer. But the fact that many Americans who can't spot the difference between a wart and a melanoma know all about aircraft de-icing techniques and Doppler radar says more about their fears than about their knowledge of risk.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
With the Boom Ending, Will Stocks Suffer?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
IF you shoot a man enough times, he's sure to fall down. The tricky part is aiming the shots in a way that will knock him down without killing him.
Wall Street now believes that with six shots the Fed has succeeded in slowing the economy. Everyone knows the Fed will fire its seventh shot this week, although there is a debate over whether it will choose to fire even more shots and over the severity of the wounds that will be inflicted. 
 The stock market's belief in that has been shown by the way it has treated some truly impressive profit figures from such companies as Chrysler and UAL, the parent of United Airlines. As soon as the figures came out, the stocks sold off. "The theory is, it doesn't get any better than this," says David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. There is a general consensus that corporate earnings will peak this year, assuming they did not do so last year.
It is in the corporate inventory numbers that a significant part of the economy's story is told. They have been rising strongly for three quarters, and constitute a significant part of the economy's impressive 4 percent real growth last year. At the beginning, it was possible to say that inventories needed to rise. The just-in-time fad, in which inventories are to be delivered only as they are needed, had left companies vulnerable to the shortages that erupted with surprisingly strong economic growth. But now that has gone far enough, and inventories are starting to overhang the economy, presaging a slowdown. Consumers also have been buying a lot, particularly big-ticket items like cars and appliances. That trend too is nearing an end.
Just how soon the slowdown will be apparent is questionable. With winter so mild in much of the country, there has probably been more construction activity than anyone would have expected. Put those numbers through the seasonal adjustments, which assume normal weather, and you could get reports of stunningly strong growth for this quarter. If so, that factor will reverse in the second quarter.
The instinctive reaction to a peaking in corporate profits is to get out of stocks. After all, profits are the things that are supposed to drive stock prices. But the relationship between the two is often an uncertain thing, in large part because the market does look ahead. Last year was the first year since 1988 that most companies did better than the analysts had forecast. It was also a year that most stocks went down, and for more reasons than the rise in interest rates. "The market does smell a slowdown in earnings," says Chuck Clough, the Merrill Lynch strategist. "But an awful lot of that has been discounted already."
If so, then the twin issues that will determine the stock market outlook for the next few months will be investors' views of what the Fed will do, and of how well it will do it. "If the market begins to sniff that we are in the last throes of Fed tightening," then stocks could rally, Mr. Clough argues.
Assuming, of course, that it also thinks that the Fed's bullets have not inflicted mortal wounds on the economy. The bet here is that they have not done so, and that slower growth does not mean early recession. But a recession scare remains possible later in 1995. If such a scare does develop, it won't be fun to own stocks while the fear is spreading.

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Just Pass an Amendment and Call the Doctor in the Morning
 
Look at those three little words -- "balanced budget amendment." The first two are truly frightening ones, conjuring images of Social Security slashed in half, crippling taxes, a decimated national defense. But "amendment" -- what a breath of fresh air that one brings. "A change for the better," Webster's defines it, "a correction of errors." No wonder the House wants to tack such a soothing word onto the other two, as it did officially last week, passing the amendment by a hefty margin. (Next it goes to the Senate, where it's close, and to the states, where it'll take years.) President Clinton, in that endless State of the Union speech -- at 81 minutes, the longest ever -- did manage to challenge his foes on this one, saying, Yes, by all means balance it, but tell people how you'll do it. All one could hear, though, was talk of amending, not that brutal balancing.
 
1995's Tax-Cut Star
 
You'd think Christine Whitman's middle name was "Tax Cut," not "Todd." It's been her battle cry from the start, and last week the Governor proudly declared that she'd reach her goal of a 30 percent cut in New Jersey's income tax by next January, a year earlier than she'd promised. Never mind that critics say she's just shifting the burden to local property taxes -- her message was clear: local governments are on their own. "Property taxes," she said, "reflect local spending decisions." And the Republicans in Washington are clearly fans, for they chose her to beat up on President Clinton after his State of the Union speech -- only the day after her tax speech.
 
Mr. Greenspan Is Watching
 
You could never accuse the Federal Reserve of not being "vigilant." For the past year, it has kept on raising interest rates, each time sounding dire alarms about a too-bubbly economy, even as inflation snuggled in firmly below 3 percent. So when Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, actually used the word last week -- saying, in Senate testimony, that various inflation signals are forcing the Fed to stay "vigilant" -- you could bet he was at it again. And Friday's report of a strong final quarter of 1994 could add fuel to his fire, even amid signals of a slowing economy. So when the Fed meets this Tuesday, no one should be surprised if it tightens the screws further. Let's just hope it doesn't make the patient scream, "Recession!"
 
Super Ads? Well, Super Money

This is it. The Big Day. Anyone who has the strength to sit through that watching-paint-dry exercise called the Super Bowl will at last see the real show: the ads. What message, after all, could be so compelling that an advertiser would spend $ 1 million -- yes, $ 1 million -- to address those partying hordes for 30 fleeting seconds? The advertising, one executive said, has become "a show in and of itself." Why, even Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards (who lost big in November's Super Bowl) will be out there, pitching Doritos. Can this possibly pay? Look at Nike. It's in for 90 seconds. That's $ 3 million. Suppose it makes $ 10 on each pair of shoes. Are 300,000 inspired fans going to rush out and buy Nikes?
 
Chrysler Doesn't Want It to End
 
Can the auto boom keep rolling forever? Of course not. People will finally get rid of the old clunkers and won't buy as many new cars -- especially at those prices. It's been nice for Detroit, though, and Chrysler would love to have it last a bit longer. But last week it voiced its worry that if the Federal Reserve raises rates again, it could tip the balance and bring back the bad old days. But face it: things are already slowing down. Ford just shut a few assembly plants temporarily, and discounts, rebates and price wars are sneaking back into Detroit's vocabulary.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Hunting Terrorists' Cash
 
With Republicans in the spotlight, President Clinton, naturally, wants to take some decisive actions. That may have been on his mind last week when he ordered a freeze on the American assets of Mideast terrorist groups. On the surface, it makes sense. Like most things, terror isn't free -- so it's logical to "follow the money" (as the Watergate folks used to say). Trouble is, there probably isn't much terrorist money in American banks, at least not that the Treasury will find. Can you imagine walking into your bank and saying, "Hi. I'm with Amalgamated Terrorists. What's the minimum for free checking?" Said one Treasury official: "I don't anticipate seizing any large sums."
 
It Isn't About Mexico
 
"It is not just about Mexico," Alan Greenspan said last week, stressing the global impact that Mexico's crisis could have and urging the Senate to approve $ 40 billion in loan guarantees. And that global scale was underscored when the I.M.F. tentatively approved a $ 7.8 billion loan to Mexico, the group's biggest ever. And as Washington ponders those guarantees, one point became clear: there will be no linkage with any border crackdown on illegal immigrants. Mexican officials adamantly denied that this would be part of any deal, and American officials backed right away from the idea.
 
Health Care XXIX: The Merger
 
Yes, health care companies have seen the frugal future and have been preparing for it -- merging, merging, merging to cut costs. But last week this craze really hit the big time as Glaxo offered $ 14 billion for Wellcome. If these British companies join forces, they'll create the world's largest drug maker, even leaping past giant Merck. (Glaxo gets a big chunk of its sales from Zantac, its ulcer treatment, while Wellcome's stand-bys are Zovirax, for herpes, and AZT.) The deal would also be up there with the biggest mergers ever -- and half the level of the biggest, the $ 30 billion Nabisco merger. If, that is, it happens. Wellcome tried to say no, thanks, later in the week, but that might be tough, since its biggest shareholder -- with a 39.5 percent stake -- is all for it.
 
COMPANIES
 
Soft Drinks: Now There Are 3
 
Speaking of balancing the budget, here's an idea: since no one needs soft drinks, Americans could just take the staggering sum they spend on them -- $ 49 billion yearly, fully a third of the global soda market -- and send it to the Treasury. What a dent that would make! No, sadly, soft drinks are right up there with Social Security as American icons. And speaking of soft drinks, a third giant was born last week in that huge industry as Dr Pepper/Seven-Up agreed to be acquired by Cadbury Schweppes (Canada Dry, Crush, etc.) for $ 1.7 billion. The combined company would have 17 percent of the American market, nearly in a league with Coca-Cola (41 percent) and Pepsi (32 percent). And at $ 33 a share for Dr Pepper, that's quite a run-up from $ 15, which was the price when the stock was first offered to the public just two years ago.
 
Spectrum: Out of Its Misery?
 
In one short year, Spectrum Information Technologies went from being an obscure data-transmission company to being the talk of the technology town. For a brief spell, that talk was aglow with promise, for the mighty John Sculley had signed on -- it couldn't get better than that. But soon the talk turned sour, for an S.E.C. inquiry materialized, Mr. Sculley beat a hasty retreat, woe piled on woe. And last week came perhaps the final straw, as Spectrum and three of its four operating subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
 
Don't Forget the Oranges
 
Pretty soon you'll be able to live on orange juice -- it'll be loaded with so much good stuff that you'll be the picture of nutritional perfection if you consume nothing else all day. Just think: not long ago, orange juice was nothing but juice from oranges. How primitive! Marketers have since come to their senses, throwing in vitamins here, calcium there, to make you feel truly virtuous when you drink it. And last week Tropicana took the Battle of the Oranges to new heights, introducing juices fortified with vitamins A, C and E, calcium, and even fiber. Everything but a CD player and an alarm system.
 
Finding That Cloudy Lining
 
It's called the expectations game. You expect sleet, it's partly sunny, you're ecstatic; you expect a sparkling sky, a few clouds appear, you're in a funk. Compaq Computer is flying so high it just surged past Apple and I.B.M. in personal computer sales worldwide, and last week it came out with some sparkling numbers -- quarterly earnings up 61 percent. On this news, its stock proceeded to plunge $ 5, or 12 percent -- and slid even more the rest of the week, to end at $ 35.625. What happened? Analysts, it seems, expected 94 cents a share, so the reported 90 cents -- mighty as it was -- somehow became bad news. But it could well be broader than that -- market psychology has "turned on technology stocks," said one analyst, and that means that any whiff of gloom can send them down.

HEADLINE: A Hospital Copes With the New Order

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
G. AUBREY SERFLING doesn't sound like the chief executive of a hospital that hemorrhaged $500,000 a week through most of 1994; a hospital that since 1991 has laid off 1,500 of 4,300 employees, including 23 of 34 senior managers; a hospital that over the last two years saw its patient revenues plummet by $36 million, more than 10 percent, even as it kept the same one-fifth share of the city's admissions.
Mr. Serfling, the 50-year-old leader of the California Pacific Medical Center, one of the state's largest and most prestigious private hospitals, can hardly contain his exuberance as he runs through the dire facts, and the drastic changes they have triggered. 
 "Hey, it's an opportunity to build a whole new world," Mr. Serfling says, his green eyes flashing. He says the hospital will claw its way into the black in 1995, for the first time since 1990. And he proudly describes California Pacific as a national model for major hospitals that must conform to the new age of market competition.
Whether this place is more a model or, as the local press has often described it, a "troubled" institution that dove too recklessly into the financial shoals of managed care may be a matter of perspective. In a sense, both descriptions are true.
But there is little doubt that the tumult at California Pacific -- a nonprofit institution long dominated by medical specialists and known for Cadillac care -- will be replicated across the country as prepaid care through health maintenance organizations becomes dominant. Hospitals in New York and elsewhere are contemplating similar changes, if they have not started them already.
Beyond the drastic trimming of expenses, this hospital in an upscale part of San Francisco is engaged in a more basic and in some ways humbling transformation: from cathedral of no-holds-barred medicine, to partner with its doctors in a stringently run enterprise, stressing primary care outside hospital walls.
For decades, hospitals -- typified by acute-care beds closely tended by doctors and skilled nurses, machine-filled surgical bays and dazzling diagnostic tools -- have been the arch-symbols of medical progress, virtually synonymous with good care. Until recently, one often heard physicians say "if you're sick enough to need a doctor, you should be in a hospital," noted Charles E. Rosenberg, a medical historian at the University of Pennsylvania.
No more. Today, executives of H.M.O.'s and even many doctors who provide managed care refer to hospitals almost scornfully as "cost centers" -- financial drains where patients are sent only as a last resort and which they must leave as quickly as they can.
Last year, Congress rejected President Clinton's proposals for reining in health spending, which, at more than 14 percent of the gross domestic product, is far higher than in most other industrial nations. But the private employers who pay many medical bills are fighting back on their own, hiring H.M.O.'s to be financial attack dogs and force costs down.
Nowhere is the resulting competition fiercer than in California where, today, the assumptions that once guided hospital management have been turned upside down. At California Pacific now, only 4 percent of patients have traditional fee-for-service insurance, paying generous fees with little question. Under the spreading system of payment called capitation, in which doctors and hospitals receive preset sums to provide all care to groups of people, hospitals must not only slash costs but also redirect their goals.
The former path to solvency -- keeping beds filled and attracting more patients who need high-priced surgeries -- amounts to financial suicide. Instead, the goal must be to keep patients healthy and, when that fails, to treat them efficiently, avoiding the $1,000-a-day acute-care bed whenever feasible.
Top-notch, technological care is still essential to save the sickest patients, and hospitals will remain places of life-and-death dramas. But where in the past an expensive procedure like cardiac surgery also brought in large profits, each operation now is a drain on revenues.
 
The Quality Question
The Bottom Line On Patient Care
The new method of payment, with its incentives to doctors to hold down costs, has also triggered debate about whether patients will be better off, as H.M.O.'s assert, or shortchanged, as some doctors fear. For his part, the chairman of medicine at California Pacific, Dr. Martin Brotman, feels that patients will be protected by medical guidelines, peer review and other measures. "It's different -- a little less of the art of medicine and more of the science of medicine," he said.
California Pacific and an affiliated, for-profit group of 700 physicians have so far signed H.M.O. contracts that give them full responsibility, for a preset price, for care of 107,000 people, a number that nearly doubled in two years. These now account for 30 percent of the hospital's patients, and are projected to account for 80 percent of business as soon as 1998; their looming presence sets the tone for all decisions. Nearly all the rest are in looser managed-care arrangements involving discounted fees, or government programs.
Licensed for 1,067 beds, the hospital now maintains about 550, of which 460 are classic acute-care beds, the rest in a skilled-nursing wing where patients are monitored less. In a dramatic sign of changing medical practice, the average number of acute-care beds occupied each day here dropped to 280 in 1994, from 392 in 1991. This reflected both a reduced tendency to hospitalize people and shorter stays.
"I no longer think of myself as the C.E.O. of a hospital," said Mr. Serfling, who rose through the ranks at California Pacific over the last 20 years and seems to have transformed himself along with the fiscal environment. "Our business is providing a full range of benefits to health-care purchasers. I'm C.E.O. of an integrated health company."
In point of fact, Mr. Serfling is becoming C.E.O. of just one component of a health business. By all accounts, power is shifting toward the doctors, especially the primary-care doctors. They provide most care and are the ones who attract the customers -- the employers that buy insurance and the H.M.O.'s that are their middlemen.
In this case, a for-profit organization jointly owned by the doctor group and the hospital, called a medical services organization, is rapidly taking over many crucial tasks, both from the hospital and from the contracting H.M.O.'s. These include negotiation of the H.M.O. contracts, computerized monitoring of individual doctors' decisions in their scattered offices, approval of patient tests and surgery and the standardizing of care within the hospital.
The services organization's board of directors has six doctors and four hospital administrators. In two years the group has built a staff of about 180, filling three floors of a nearby building. Many people, including Mr. Serfling and Dr. Michael Abel, president of the doctor group, expect that eventually one chief executive will preside over a combined physician and hospital entity.
The doctor group itself includes about 250 primary care doctors and 440 specialists, said Dr. Abel, a surgeon when he is not wearing his new hat as an executive. That mix includes too many specialists, everyone agrees. The solution so far has been to let economic pressures do the winnowing; specialist incomes have declined by 10 percent to 40 percent, Dr. Abel said. "I see people retiring early, or moving out of state," he said.
 
Entrepreneurial Spirit
Big Decisions, Quickly Made
Among the doctors and within the hospital, people with an entrepreneurial bent are taking over. The combined enterprise has a corporate feel that is vastly different from the lumbering, almost medieval character of classic hospitals with their specialty-department fiefs.
Mr. Serfling said he identifies with his counterparts in nearby Silicon Valley, where rapid, high-stakes decisions amid frantic innovation are the norm. By way of example, he said on a recent afternoon, he was considering a take-it-or-leave-it offer from a leading insurer, for exclusive coverage of 40,000 people.
The offer: flat monthly fees per person in the mid-$30's range to the hospital and the $50 range to the doctors' group -- he would not divulge exact numbers -- for which they would together provide all care, from toddler checkups to heart transplants. The population to be covered includes workers and their families; rates for elderly people would be far higher.
Quite recently, such an offer would have been considered absurdly low; only a year or two back, H.M.O. payments for the hospital portion were $40 to $45 a person, Mr. Serfling said. In practice the proposed fee would amount to a 45 percent discount from the hospital's normal charges, he said. But he is also aware that H.M.O.'s have driven even stiffer bargains with other hospitals in California.
"We have this proposed revenue stream per patient," he said. "Management has to figure out how to deliver all care, run a hospital and still deliver a high-quality product."
"A lot of people think that's impossible," he said. "They're wrong, but we have to start with a clean piece of paper. That's what's so exciting."
The physicians would be accepting a sum to divide among themselves. They would also agree to keep the total number of hospital days used by those 40,000 patients below a target. If that is surpassed, then the extra expense would come out of the doctors' collective share. On the other side, if expenses are held below projections, the doctors and hospital would divide up the surplus.
Hospitals all over the country are groping their way as managed care increasingly takes hold. Some have closed or been bought by for-profit chains that aim to remold them into nodes of competitive networks. Larger hospitals are trying various strategies for building their own bottom-to-top health systems.
New York Hospital in Manhattan, for example, is buying up smaller hospitals that it hopes can feed the sickest patients to its advanced facility. The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania hopes to secure H.M.O. contracts by buying groups of primary-care doctors in the Philadelphia region.
 
Controlling Costs
Getting Patients Is the Easy Part
But as California Pacific discovered, getting patients is the easy part. Then the institution and its allied doctors have to take good care of those people at the prevailing price, bearing the risk of overruns.
"What a big network does is to assure volume over time," said Raymond J. Baxter, a consultant with Lewin VHI in Fairfax, Va. "But unless you also control your costs, I don't think you'll get all the way to the finish line."
While many hospitals are being dragged into managed care, California Pacific rushed into it, amassing as many H.M.O. contracts as it could in hopes of gaining a competitive advantage. But as the number of patients on fixed fees climbed, costs drifted down too slowly and the hospital took a bath.
Not so long ago, a hospital could make up for losses in managed care, and for low payments from Medicare and Medicaid, by charging its other insured patients more. But here, at least, the days of cost-shifting are over.
Complicating things, California Pacific has just completed a major merger, begun in 1991. Today's hospital results from the joining of the former Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, an eminent tertiary care and teaching hospital in posh Pacific Heights, and Children's Hospital, more primary-care oriented and located nearby in the middle-class, increasingly Chinese area of Richmond.
The merger will yield long-term economies but entailed short-term conflict and costs as two cultures were forced to meld. Already, there has been extensive retooling of buildings and staff. The former Children's Hospital continues to deliver babies, close to 5,000 a year, but much of it has been converted into a giant out-patient surgery center, with 10 operating rooms that now account for 60 percent of all the hospital's surgery.
The hospital announced that it was closing down the Children's emergency room, but in the face of community protests, it kept open something more akin to a walk-in clinic. The former Presbyterian facility has become the site of most acute care and in-patient surgery.
 
Sinking Morale
Paring the Staff, Top to Bottom
Last year, with losses mounting, the board took the extreme step of hiring the Hunter Group of St. Petersburg, Fla., consultants that specialize in scorched-earth hospital makeovers. Under their guidance, the board fired most of the top managers. Hunter has placed three of its own people temporarily in senior vice president jobs, running day-to-day operations.
As staff slots were cut from top to bottom, morale sank; one patient who had surgery at the hospital last year said she had felt as though she were lying in a union meeting.
Meanwhile, the hospital is doing everything it can to curb the use of costly services. Department by department, procedures are being standardized in "clinical pathways" -- detailing exactly when various tests should come before and after a given surgery and specifying which drugs and brands of devices to use.
Thus, when cardiac bypass patients are given the right pretesting, they can come in on the morning of surgery rather than staying a night or two as in the past. With the right post-surgery sequence, most can go home in 5 days, compared with 10 or 12 a few years back.
As patients are sent home more quickly, home visits by nurses are up. And inside the hospital, ever finer distinctions in patient condition are being made, all to reduce the need for costly monitoring.
A stroke patient might come in through the emergency room, then after a short stay in an acute-care bed move to a rehabilitation ward and then to a skilled nursing bed before returning home, each level staffed less intensively. The hospital's 90 skilled nursing beds have been close to 100 percent full, and are slated to increase as more acute-care beds are closed.
The intensive care unit, for the critically ill, has also been subdivided. The traditional unit has a registered nurse for every one or two patients. But some patients, such as those being weaned from a respirator, are moved to a "transitional care unit," with one nurse for every three patients.
With the hospital now involved in so many levels of care, the traditional focus of acute care "is just a blip on the screen," said Lisa Miller, director of quality management.
In a practice used by some H.M.O.'s that own hospitals, the medical staff is experimenting with special in-patient doctors, who take over from the primary doctor when a patient is admitted. The efficiency of having the attending physician on hand through the day, a specialist in the care of the seriously ill, is clear. On the other hand, this goes against the hallowed notion of continuity of care by a single physician in sickness and in health, and leaves some of the doctors uneasy.
 
Taking Some Hits
A Cutting Edge Gets a Bit Duller
Though the board says it wants to preserve a cutting-edge hospital, many doctors privately wonder about the role here of the most advanced and expensive treatments. Unsure of its future, with some members expressing feelings of betrayal, the liver transplant team recently moved to Stanford University Hospital, and some other specialists have left.
California Pacific is hardly becoming second-class; its spacious new birthing rooms have Jacuzzi's, though women sent home the day after delivery may have little opportunity to enjoy them. It remains a top center for heart and other organ transplants.
But a powerful sign of changing times is a large hole in the ground at the corner of Sacramento and Maple, near the former Children's Hospital. This was to be the site for a $50 million cancer center, the kind of showcase that hospitals used to build to attract paying customers. The project was canceled in 1993.
Quality cancer care will continue, but some state-of-the-art treatments including bone-marrow transplants -- now standard for some kinds of cancer, experimental for others -- are no longer offered at California Pacific, which will have to subcontract with other hospitals when patients need them.
The cancer center's demise reflects more than financial woes. For it has dawned on executives here that when you are being paid a flat fee, the last thing you need is to attract more cancer patients.
"This is a very difficult transition for the medical staff," said Dr. Neal Birnbaum, the chief of staff. "Patients who are sick seek us out," he said, referring to the hospital's reputation for specialized treatments, something that attracted many doctors too. "Now we pay a penalty for that."
The future of research and doctor training, things that helped give this hospital its cachet, is also uncertain. "The focus is on how we can maintain research and education as some aspect," Mr. Serfling said, "with a smaller, less grandiose vision."
The question at the back of everyone's mind is whether the quality of care is endangered by the penny pinching and the incentives to hold down referrals, tests and surgery.
As hospitals cut staff, nurses in particular have been outspoken in warning about a possible threat, not only from their reduced numbers but also from the downgrading of skill levels in some jobs.
While California Pacific has not yet cut back on highly trained nurses as much as some local hospitals have, the reductions "have definitely lowered the standard of care," said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association. "Staffing decisions are made by the financiers rather than the medical professionals."
Dr. Brotman, the medicine chairman, said he believed that care has not been compromised, though many nursing jobs are restructured.
Most doctors here seem to feel they have little choice but to join in the H.M.O. contracts, but some express apprehension about possible medical impacts.
Dr. J. Donald Hill, chief of cardiac surgery, said he had been pleasantly surprised by the economies his department had achieved. Overall, he said, the cost of bypass surgery had been reduced to close to $20,000, less than half of what it was a few years back (though still above the $15,000 fee that H.M.O.'s in Southern California pay when they subcontract for the procedure).
But he said he was uncomfortable with a system in which doctors bear financial risk for care. "You make more money by not giving care and this is frightening to surgeons," he said. He only hopes, he added, that other quality controls would prevent scrimping.
Dr. Brotman said that past practices had been wonderful for doctors and patients but were not economically realistic. "You could just provide whatever you felt was best for your patient, and someone would pay the bill," he said. He feels that more conservative care can often be better as well as cheaper.
One casualty of managed care may be the hospital's commitment to community services, including a seniors' day center and mental health services. "Unfortunately, current medical reimbursement structure eliminates any operating margin that could be diverted to community programs," said a planning document approved by the hospital board last September, and such programs will continue "in a more limited scope."
This hospital has never treated large numbers of uninsured people but here, as elsewhere, the newly harsh fiscal climate makes charity care all the less attractive. As Mr. Serfling himself emphasized, the spread of managed care may leave the uninsured even worse off unless the government acts to protect them.
Whether, despite all their efforts, this hospital and its doctors will be powerful enough to stay independent is another unanswered question. Will they be bought by a hospital chain like Columbia/HCA, or a giant insurance company like Aetna? The hospital is linked to three others but is largely autonomous for now.
Dr. Abel, head of the doctor group, said the group's first hope is to ally with other physician-led medical systems in, perhaps, purchasing and H.M.O. contracting. But no one knows how much growth and capital it will take to survive -- to remain competitive in the ever more demanding battle for patients.
"I don't want to work for an insurance company," Dr. Abel said. "But if the hospital cannot be a source of capital, where are we going to find it? It would be bad business not to explore what's out there."
None of these issues is enough to dampen the spirits of Mr. Serfling, whose survival in his position through the last three years of turmoil has astounded many hospital experts in the city.
"In the beginning we were depressed, but now a lot of people here are pretty excited about the changes," he said. As hospitals elsewhere enter the same treacherous waters, he said, "most groups will go through a period of major organizational depression."

Connecticut's Loss Is the Bronx's Gain
 A new fudge factory opened in the Bronx three weeks ago after the company's plans fell through in Connecticut. 
 The company, Norwalk Candies, Inc., had planned to do its manufacturing in Connecticut, and had even taken the name of the city in which it was to locate.
The owner, Joseph Lipton, said that under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s administration he was promised tax incentives, grants, utility assistance and training help. But he said that when Governor Weicker decided not to run for re-election, he was told that the grant part of the package, which totaled $200,000, would be rescinded.
So Mr. Lipton decided on the Port Morris neighborhood of the Bronx, on 145th Street off Southern Boulevard.
"Without all the incentives Connecticut had to offer, the Bronx made much more business sense," he said
Joseph M. Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Economic Development, said, "No firm offer was ever made, this is a start-up, there was a lot of risk involved in terms of whether the company could meet its projection and Joe Lipton believed he could put the company into production in the Bronx for several hundred thousand dollars less than Connecticut. We couldn't match that big of a gap."
The South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation has helped Mr. Lipton with recruitment, promotion and government paperwork.
The new company will make Joy's Favorite brand of fudge, in three flavors.
 
A German Designer Comes to Park Avenue
 One of Germany's most popular fashion designers is planning to open a boutique on Park Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, within the next two weeks.
Jil Sander, whose extremely simple, graceful designs have won legions of devotees among women accustomed to four-figure clothes, will open what the company calls a "shop in shop" in the Linda Dresner boutique, at 484 Park Avenue.
It will be the company's first store in New York City. The clothes are already sold at Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys New York and have seen on actresses like Winona Ryder and Uma Thurman.
Ms. Sander, the designer and owner, started 20 years ago with a small shop in Hamburg, Germany. The company now has 22 stores and annual worldwide sales of $200 million.
A Jil Sander suit can cost $1,700 for tropical wool to $5,000 for cashmere.
 
Columbia Plans to Honor Its First Black M.B.A.
 Columbia Business School will salute its first African-American M.B.A. graduate, Dr. George Owens, Class of 1950.
As part of Black History Month, Dr. Owens will receive an award for outstanding leadership and be honored at a reception of alumni, faculty, administrators and students at the business school on Feb. 10.
Dr. Owens, who at the time was one of the only black students in the school, is president emeritus of Tougaloo (Miss.) College.
"The problem is that the racial mix has not drastically changed," said Andrea Bradford, director of multicultural affairs at the business school.
Out of 1,200 M.B.A. students today, 60 are African-American, or one in 20.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
For Asia, Opportunity From Calamity

BYLINE: By Paul Lewis 

 BODY:
A POWERFUL new locomotive of economic growth will soon be getting up steam as a result of the savage earthquake that shattered Japan's Kobe province.
From the market's reaction last week, the disaster didn't seem to have much of a silver lining. Investors immediately dumped Japanese stocks although the market later recouped some losses. 
 They also continued their panicky exit from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America that the Mexican crisis had started, motivated by fresh uncertainties over the health of China's aging reformist leader, Deng Xiaoping, about the fate of the Clinton Administration's Mexican loan guarantee plan and about the prospect of an imminent American interest rate hike.
But before the earthquake struck, Japan was ready to start edging its way back up the world's growth league after three years of virtual economic stagnation.
Last December, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Japanese growth would more than double this year to 2.5 percent and reach 3.4 percent in 1996, comfortably above the 2.9 percent average for the industrial world as a whole. Now it should do even better.
The colossal damage inflicted by the quake may take the shine off this year's opening months. But thereafter the colossal cost of reconstruction -- with estimates running up to $70 billion and higher -- will give an additional boost to economic activity in Japan and other Asian countries.
"That is certainly how the Japanese business community sees it," says William H. Gleysteen, president of the Japan Society, who returned from Tokyo last week. "We'll see new investment force-fed by government spending" predicts Solomon Brothers chief economist, John Lipsky.
Such a boost will be welcome in Asia, where China's economy is already slowing and dwindling capital inflows following the Mexican debacle seem likely to reduce activity in other emerging economies as well.
The Nomura Research Institute expects quake damage to cut Japanese output 1 to 2.5 percent over the next three months. But "over the next two years or so" the Tokyo-based institute thinks, reconstruction will increase total demand by 1.5 to 2.9 percent. Shigeki Sakaki, a Nomura Research analyst, said this could raise Japanese growth to 3 percent this year and add another percentage point or so in 1996. J. P. Morgan also predicts reconstruction could add another 1.5 percent to Japan's growth.
With the United States economy likely to slow this year, Japan seems set to join Germany as one the two main economic locomotives, each with growth rates that should rise to 3.5 percent or more next year.
The last time Japan and Germany played this role was in 1979, when they turned in growth rates of 5.5 and 4.2 percent, respectively, after agreeing at the Group of Seven's conference in Bonn the previous summer on a concerted reflation plan to get the world's economic train moving again.
Unfortunately, this experiment with this "locomotive strategy" for reviving growth fizzled out the following year, the victim of OPEC's second oil price shock, and was never repeated.
Meanwhile, higher Japanese imports together with disrupted exports point to a lower trade surplus, a softer yen but a stronger dollar.
Foreign capital inflows, the lifeblood of the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, started slowing last year when the World Bank reports new portfolio investment fell to $39.5 billion from 1993's peak of $46.9 billion, although direct investment continued growing.
The slowdown may be sharper this year as investors recognize the riskiness of these markets while earthquake reconstruction gives Japanese an additional reason to repatriate capital.
"Japan will be less of a capital exporter to Asia in the wake of the earthquake but a stronger source of demand," says Robert D. Hormats of Goldman, Sachs International.
In addition, many Asian emerging markets still show substantial gains even though they are off their peaks, encouraging foreign investors to take profits. Figures compiled by Salomon Brothers show the Philippines market now twice as high as it was in early 1992, while Singapore is up a third and Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are also well ahead.
Some Asian emerging economies also betray signs of Mexican-type economic weakness. In the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, for instance, reserves are comparatively low as a ratio of payment deficits and foreign debt. "After Mexico, investors are less risk tolerant," notes Lisa S. Kaess of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York investment adviser.
Last year the World Bank warned emerging markets against addiction to speculative capital inflows, saying they can lead to overvalued currencies and stymie growth if reversed, as Mexico has found.
Less volatile portfolio investment but stronger Japanese demand is a healthier combination for Asia.

HEADLINE: Lowly Banana Has a High Profile in a Trade Dispute

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS

 BODY:
HAS GATT slipped on a banana?
Despite the signing last year of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the monumental world pact to reduce trade barriers and disputes, all it takes is a garden variety fight over a humble product like the banana to show how little things have changed. 
 Tensions have been high over the fruit for nearly two years, since the European Union proposed restrictions on big-selling bananas from Latin America -- as well as imports from the United States -- while continuing to wave through shipments from former British and French colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific. The beneficiaries also include European growers in tropical spots like Crete, the Canary Islands and the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira.
American growers with big interests in Latin America, particularly Chiquita Brands International, have been furious, and not just with the Europeans. They have also been angry with several Latin American governments, which cut side deals with the Europeans to get around the new rules at the expense of the Americans.
What's more, the restrictions have caused tensions within Europe, pitting the British and French against the Germans, the biggest consumers of bananas on the Continent, who favor the Latin fruit.
Now comes the latest shot across the bow in the Great Banana War. In a letter to the European Commission earlier this month, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said he might take retaliatory measures against a host of European exports if Europe did not ease up on the banana.
To be sure, the United States and Europe have continuing disputes in a number of trade areas, including broadcasting and computer technology. But nothing seems to push the hot button quite like the banana, which inspires deep nationalistic sentiments in Europe that go beyond the size of the fruit's $3.2 billion market there.
Chiquita and other American producers, including a growers' association in Hawaii, have complained that the import policy has cut their sales to Europe by half, causing losses of "hundreds of millions of dollars at a minimum," Mr. Kantor said. The policy was announced in February 1993 by the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union.
Many critics of the policy say it is just another example of how the European Union is still prone to a "Fortress Europe" approach to trade, agreeing only grudgingly to open markets.
"I have made a preliminary decision that the E.U. banana regime is adversely affecting U.S. economic interests," Mr. Kantor wrote in his letter to Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission's senior trade official in Brussels. Mr. Kantor added that he had requested public comment in the United States "on specific European goods and services against which retaliatory trade action might be taken."
European trade officials are clearly upset by the tone of Mr. Kantor's letter. They wonder to what extent the threats of retaliation were sparked by President Clinton's weakened political position, with Republicans now controlling Congress, and attempts by the trade office to get political mileage from an aggressive posture.
Indeed, some see Mr. Clinton's free trade global strategy -- including the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the pushing through of GATT in Congress and long-term plans to create a free trade zone in the Pacific -- as among the main political achievements that he will have to play up.
But the banana dispute also underscores what many analysts see as an inevitable tension between the two trading blocs over business in developing markets, including Latin America and Southeast Asia, where both are fighting for influence.
Many European countries are trying to move quickly into those areas, because they see them developing faster than many eastern European markets during the next five years. But in terms of new political initiatives to those areas, the European Union is far behind the United States.
In global trade terms, the losses to the banana growers cited by Mr. Kantor amount to small change, and American officials have tried to play down the threatening tone of his letter, saying there is room for negotiations and no impending trade sanctions. Moreover, they noted, under the provisions of Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the Government is obliged to carry out retaliatory trade measures if it finds that American industry is being discriminated against and harmed.
But the dispute has left a bitter taste in Europe and has taken on proportions that are larger than expected. For one thing, the letter was sent less than two weeks after the founding of the World Trade Organization, which will monitor the implementation of the new GATT accord. For another, Europe, having fought bitter battles over the banana restrictions two years ago, does not want to reopen the old wounds.
What seems to make officials here the angriest, however, is Mr. Kantor's threat to take unilateral action, rather than try to work things out within the context of GATT.
"I AM disturbed by your reference to 'possible trade retaliations' against European goods and services," Sir Leon said in a return letter to Mr. Kantor, adding that GATT called for the settlement of such disputes through the new trade organization. "Europe clearly cannot accept any unilateral action against our interest in breach of those obligations."
Trade officials from the United States say the number of items over which there are frictions with Europe has been greatly reduced by the GATT treaty. But judging by the early days of 1995, it seems the two giant trading blocs are heading into a period of more tension.
The two are battling over influence in the World Trade Organization, specifically about who heads the agency. The United States has backed the former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, though its support has waned a bit in the wake of the currency crisis in Mexico. The Europeans are backing the former Trade Minister of Italy, Renato Ruggiero.
The United States has told Brussels that it is concerned that exports of computer equipment and software will fall by $1 billion to Sweden, Austria and Finland -- which earlier this month became European Union members -- because they now must adopt certain trade restrictions on those products under the union's rules.
And the movie and broadcasting industry, with Washington's support, is trying to stop Europe from restricting even further the broadcasting of films not produced in Europe.
Then there is the business with bananas. Under the European Union rules that went into effect in July 1993, bananas could continue to be imported duty-free and without limit from former British and French colonies like Dominica, St. Lucia, Martinique and Guadaloupe.
But a quota was set on bananas grown in the United States and Latin America, called dollar bananas. The quota limited duty-free imports to two million tons a year, a level that has since been raised to 2.56 million tons. Beyond that amount, heavy duties are imposed.
The policy brought out the ire of the Germans, who consume almost a pound of bananas a person a week, twice as much as the British.
Germans say the fruit from the former European colonies is of lower quality than Latin American bananas. In a more extreme argument, they have said that the barriers to bananas could produce a large new inflow of cocaine into Europe, as some Latin farmers are forced to turn to raising coca leaves, the raw material of cocaine.
In any event, while the change in the import policy appears to be benefiting the small farmer in the former European colonies with increased sales, most of the added expense to the consumer is winding up in the pockets of European middlemen. A study by the World Bank found that European consumers are paying $700 million extra a year because of the new banana policy, and that $400 million goes to the middlemen, with only $300 million going to farmers.
MR. KANTOR's recent letter is the result of an investigation by the United States trade office that began last October, after Chiquita and the Hawaii Banana Industry Association filed a complaint under Section 301.
The office has also told four Latin American countries -- Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela -- that they could be subject to sanctions as well. After successfully complaining to GATT about the European restrictions, the four worked out individual agreements with the European Union about the control of their banana exports.
The agreement essentially allows their farmers unlimited duty-free exports to Europe, while controlling the amount that American producers in their countries can ship, an arrangement that hurts American interests, the trade office said.
With sentiments divided as much as they are in Europe, few bureaucrats in Brussels want to see the issue reopened and fan the flames of a trade battle.
"This is one of those things that can get out of hand," one commission official said. "So why is the U.S. threatening a trade war over what is not of major economic importance to them?"

HEADLINE: How I Survived Off Off Broadway: One Man's Tale

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
WHEN Aunt Chiche went for her checkbook, I thought I had it made.
There I was, a young playwright home for the holidays, watching my 86-year-old great aunt, my family's final link to old money, teetering toward her purse with a pen in her hand. I could barely contain my joy. I had just laid bare my ambitions and neediness and she'd bought it. I envisioned my actors getting paid, my four-colored posters plastered on the walls of SoHo and my production heading straight to -- 
 I saw a $50 bill. "For the taxi back from the airport, honey" said my dear old aunt.
Welcome to the sordid world of Off Off Broadway.
It is a world where actors and stagehands are more likely to be paid with brunch than cash; where day jobs and conflicting schedules make for midnight rehearsals, where investors want more letters home. Here, the constant groveling for help and money is considered an art form and legions of young unknowns hurl themselves into outrageous projects, desperate to avoid that most insidious of poison: anonymity.
Unfortunately, it has been my world. But after six years of storing up favors, building sets, raising money for others, sweeping up rubble backstage, this month, at age 24, I finally got my chance: My own play on stage.
In the process of getting it to its feet, I turned an art gallery into a parking lot, pushed good friendships to the limit and spent a good portion of my life savings. Why I and so many others go through and try to buck the odds is no mystery: We have no choice. In America's theater scene, all roads lead through New York. But beyond the professional necessity, there is something else. I left Kansas City when I was 18, and came to New York to go to acting school, fully expecting to be a star. It didn't work out that way. I became a clerk. I remember after I arrived, watching the speed and flow of the city's pedestrians, and now I feared becoming another piece of that mass. New York is oppressive that way. In my mind, the play was my chance to show the world that I was more than a paper pusher.
Every night, all over the city, you'll find an Off Off Broadway production, put on by the same people who serve your meals, deliver your messages by bicycle or sell you theater subscriptions over the phone. The creations from their minds include the stories of cannibalistic biker girls, pajama-clad post-apocalyptic wanderers, singing and dancing Lizzie Bordens and stagings of more traditional fare, like Brecht, Chekhov and Shakespeare.
I finished my play in August. The product of sporadic obsession, it had taken four years to write. It was a dark comedy based on Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" entitled "Quick Bright Things." I placed updated Midsummer's players in present day Nevada, and set the whole thing at a strip-bar bordering a nuclear test site. In the play, a rock 'n' roll cowboy returns after a decade, intent on reassembling the family he left behind. It was a stretch but that was the idea.
My first draft included 146 pages, 3 acts, 21 characters, and too many subplots. I gathered some friends for the first read-through, to hear the words that had sat on the page for so long. It took place on Oct. 17, lasted three-and-a-half hours and cost me a case of beer. By the end, the compliments were flowing. So were suggestions for cuts before the play went into production. Problem was, there was no production.
 
 
Getting the Space
 I had a play but nowhere to put it. There was one hope: I had been promoted in June to managing director of Teleotheater, a small three-year-old company. Teleotheater had just got its first break -- a residency at Here, a performance space in SoHo. For normally transient Off Off Broadway companies, residencies are golden, providing office space and a place to perform.
Being the managing director was a glorified way of saying I handled the business side of things. The position was unpaid and largely bureaucratic but I thought it would give me a chance to get my work produced. But by the time I had finished the play Teleo had booked its two slots for the season and the schedule at Here was full. Rental fees for another theater would be prohibitive.
But then, the god of bankruptcy stepped in. $3 Bill, another resident company at Here, hit hard times and forfeited its three- week slot in January in the main theater at Here. I asked whether the slot might be available. Randy Rollison, co-artistic director of Here and a mentor of mine, warned me that eight weeks wasn't a lot of time to prepare a new play. I didn't care. He warned me of problems getting rehearsal time. I still didn't care. He warned that very loud shows might go on in the other theater. I wanted my show up. Barbara Busachino, another artistic director, said, "If you've got the gumption, it's yours."
I had the gumption. And then, I had the space.
 
 
Getting the Money
 I decided to act as producer of my own play for two reasons: one, I had produced before, and two, I was so much of an egotist that I felt only I would get it just right. And everything needed to be just right.
The deal was this: in return for the space I was to do 100 hours of clerical work for Here, plus turn over money from the first 15 tickets sold each night -- about $180 per performance. This kind of arrangement is common in Off Off Broadway, where deals often include barter and work agreements, kind of like the economy of medieval Europe. I felt lucky I didn't have to throw in a bushel of winter wheat.
Producers in Off Off Broadway are different from Broadway types. Broadway producers raise the money, usually a few million, and hope to reap the rewards. Off Off producers have no hope of making money, scrape to raise even a few thousand dollars, almost always fail, feel guilty, end up spending their own money, and then hope to work overtime to make rent. And even at this level, productions are always over budget. The budget for "QBT" was about $6,000, which left us only about seven grand short.
Small companies use all kinds of schemes to raise money: benefits at bars, bake sales, raffles. We'd thrown a benefit in August featuring a naked poet and a band called O.J.'s Last Request. That netted Teleo a grand total of $281 and a reputation for lousy parties. So benefits were out. Bake sales required skill and raffles required possessions, so I was forced to retreat to the most basic of fund-raisers: begging.
I began writing cloying letters to family friends, talking about the worthiness of the show and true meaning of the holiday season. And, if worst came to worst, I knew I had my savings ($4,000), and about a third of the money would come from the box office -- if there was a box office.
Because of the time it would take to cast and the holidays, eight weeks of real time would be cut down to about five weeks of rehearsal time. I would pay actors $100 for a two-month commitment.
 
Cuts and Casting
 I had eight weeks from the time I got the space (Nov. 12) to opening night (Jan. 7). I chose my friend Michael Laurence to direct and he immediately suggested cuts. Big cuts. Larger cuts than I had imagined. For the first time, I felt a twinge of self-doubt. I felt, suddenly, like he was saying that I didn't get it right the first time. Logically, I recognized that a three-and-a-half-hour play is torture unless you're really good, and after the suggestions for cuts, I didn't think I was any good. So I began cutting. Gone was the character that most resembled me.
Most of the casting was easy. Michael, the director, would play a lead. Several of my former N.Y.U. classmates were signed up. Auditions, limited to actors we invited, filled in other gaps. Other auditions were held simply to soothe the egos of friends we liked but knew weren't right for parts.
What was left were the parts of a 10-year-old boy (Robbie) and a 50-year-old man (State). I didn't think the boy would be too tough to find. The older actor would be more difficult because we didn't know many, let alone one willing to trade two months of his life for $100. Michael and I knew auditioning them would be a delicate task. There we were, kids with an untested script, shaking hands with men twice our age, and then telling them that they weren't good enough. By the time of the second draft, we still hadn't cast either of the parts.
 
 
A Sense of Dread
 I finished the second draft (now 115 pages, 2 acts, 15 characters) on Nov. 29, an hour before the first read-through with the cast. The cast, minus an older man or young boy, stumbled through. The words, fresh in the first read, had lost their newness. Again, I felt the twinge of dread. Other things were different. Michael, as director, was now the man responsible for describing the play. The actors sat in a circle. I sat outside and read stage directions.
After, my closest friends dissected the play in front of me and proposed more cuts and reworkings. I resisted quietly, partly out of honest objection, partly out of anger and hurt. Finally Michael pulls out the big guns, "It's the difference between a good play and a great one," he said.
I did the rewrite.
 
I Am Asked to Leave
 Rehearsals began the next day, five-and-a-half weeks before opening night. I sat with a fresh copy of the second draft and a pair of new pens. One actor arrived early and gently suggested that a lot of my writing was "confused." Another was late and accused me of using pedophilic references. (Her reasoning: The final scene had a man saving a child from a nuclear wasteland. . .go figure.) I didn't understand. Michael turned to me and quietly asked me to leave so he could work all this out. I smiled, grabbed my coat, my pens, and my new script and left. Door shuts. Thrown out of my own rehearsal. I wrote a note on the script: "Tears." I don't remember whether I was talking about cuts or crying. I just remember a blinding panic: my cast hated my confusing, pedophilic script.
Two days later, we lost our first actor. George Demas, a close friend who was meant to play a key comic role that I had written with him in mind, dropped out after hearing that he has got a role in a big production of Henry VI Off Broadway. The role would allow him to work on an Equity show, an important step in the career of a young actor. Though I knew my anger was unjustified, I still felt betrayed. "It's just what I feel I have to do, at this point, professionally," he said. He felt terrible, too. Friends do your shows because they love you, but the career's the thing.
Two days later, two actors just didn't show up for rehearsal. I began to feel cursed. And still no checks.
 
 
More Rewriting
 Michael recast George's part and recruited another friend, Edgar Oliver, as our older man. He laid the responsibility of finding a boy on me.
The next day Michael called me at work, before I was supposed to go down to rehearsal. Michael says don't bother, rehearsal ended early. "The actors kept asking me questions I couldn't answer because I don't get it," he said, "Rehearsal was just a total wash." Total wash. The words chilled me. After pushing so hard to put the show together, I began to worry that I was forcing people to do something they don't like, or worse, that they were doing it out of pity. I felt like a emotional tyrant, which was hard to explain since I hardly spoke to the actors anymore. They were always in rehearsal. And I wasn't. I rewrite three scenes, and fall asleep during the fourth at 5 A.M.
 
 
Help Wanted: A Boy
 Producing began to take up a lot of my time. I call the mother of a child for whom a friend baby-sits. He's 6 years old (but can play 10, his stage mother assures) and taking classes at the Lee Strasberg Institute. The child is excited. The mother believes she has a "young" Macaulay Culkin. "I told him that if he does this play, then he has to do another year of Strasberg," she said.
I decided to hire a publicist, saving myself from having to pitch critics. The publicist needed a description of the play and $750. (It was telling of my worry that it took me two days to write a 50-word blurb on what the play was now about.) The production needed a stage manager. Posters, palmcards and promotion were all behind schedule. And the stage mother wasn't calling back.
At the end of the week, we do the first run-through. It was only the fourth full rehearsal I'd been in. Still lacking a little boy and scripts still in hand, my play staggered to its feet. Kind of. One actor had taken a character I envisioned as a quiet, nervous young man and turned him into a young Clint Eastwood ripoff. I couldn't tell whether it was mockery or flattery, but I feared the worst. Another actress had completely rewritten her scene. I watched and listened, heard words I hadn't written and characters I hadn't imagined. But then, slowly but surely, I realized that it was alive.
It was in that moment, that first happy glow, that Michael asked me about the car.
Michael Laurence is a sane man with a lot of strong ideas. But he wanted a car, my car, in the theater -- to stress the little boy's near suffocation in the back of a car.
The plan was this: drive the car through the front doors of Here, through their gallery, turn the corner and park it right in the corner of the theater. To avoid the panicked eyes of the Here staff, we decided to try the elaborate parking job one night when no one was around -- three days before we opened.
 
 
Nearing the End
 Some things began to pull together. Money started to trickle in: 100 from a friend in London, $500 from my parents, $132.43 from friends in Kansas City from a hat they passed around a party.
But minor disasters followed. The stage mother said her little boy couldn't do the show because her ex-husband had seen the script and thought it too "raunchy." And the replacement for George Demas dropped out. Other actors, worried about the show, began to complain about each other. With 10 days left, I am short two actors and face a near-mutiny. Desperate for a boy, I called a casting agent and offered $100 a week, money I didn't have, for a child actor.
Then, when all seemed lost, two miracles occurred.
George Demas returned to play the part that he'd had to quit, freed up by a delay in the Henry VI performance schedule. And Stephanie Tardiff, a 4-foot tall actress, auditioned for the role of the little boy and agreed to perform at a regular, meager rate. True, she was 24 years old but she had plenty of acting experience. By the New Year's Eve, a week before opening, we'd finally cast the show.
 Saturday was opening night. Building the set, a 72-hour ordeal, began the Monday before, attended to by the lighting designer, Jason Boyd, the set designer, Derek Stenborg, the production manager, John Lewis, and an old friend who appeared out of nowhere, Timothy Reynolds. By the time we got to sneaking the car at 4 A.M. Thursday, none had slept more than four hours, or changed clothes, in the previous three days.
For the record, a 1984 Nissan Sentra is 53 1/2 inches wide and the front door at Here is 55 inches wide. And Here's gallery is plenty big enough for a drive. That last corner, though, into the mainstage, just isn't made for auto-transport. The lowest moment came when the car got stuck between the theater door and a collection of erotic sketches in the gallery. The high point was getting it back out before the paintings melted from the carbon monoxide.
 
 
Opening night
 People I didn't know came. They paid money. The actors said most of my words. I sat in the back. I sweated a lot. Every silence in the audience brought on a panic. That's about all I can remember. There were lights, I think, and music. Finally, it got real dark and people started slamming their hands together.
 
 
Epilogue
 When the lights went down, the party began, I felt strange. It wasn't what I had expected. The play, the thing I had invested so much in, now had less to do with my work than with the cast's. This moment, this play was theirs. I felt removed.
But I realized that for me, the experience was not about exploring myself or big ideas through characters. It was about defining myself -- as a playwright and a member of the world that I want to belong to, the world of late nights, low budgets and good friends. And if theater is about creating characters and stories, I had been a success. The strange feeling I felt was of myself in a new role. Suddenly I was a playwright.
Now, I won't tell you about the night the cast tripled the audience, or the reviews ("When a writer uses Shakespeare as a model, sometimes the results can be amusing or enlightening. And sometimes not."), or the clerical work I still have to do. (My bank account is a mess.) That's all another story. Or perhaps, another play.

GRAPHIC: Photos: THE FIRST RUN-THROUGH -- Three weeks before we opened, things looked dicey. Here we tested a dance number. It failed.; THE CAR AND THE EROTIC SKETCHES -- Three days before we opened, at 4:30 A.M., we tried to drive a 1984 Nissan Sentra into the theater. We failed.; OPENING NIGHT -- I don't remember much at all. Here, backstage, Bill Migliore, one of the leads, struggles to get into a corset. He succeeded. (pg. 1); THE CURTAIN CALL -- Putting together the cast was rough. Particularly difficult was finding a young boy and an older man. Actors came and went and came back again. Miracles occurred, though, and the cast came together not long before opening night.; THE CAST PARTY -- Afterward, the cast went to Bill Migliore's apartment in the East Village to celebrate. But there was time to consider the money side. The set cost $1,050; the costumes $750; the props $582. Over all, it came to $6,925 -- about a thousand over budget.

Burned Strip Plans to Rebuild

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
Since a fire burned down the coffee shop he has owned for the last 15 years, Peter Katsihtis has been surprised to learn just how important Crown Donuts was to the neighborhood.
"I get people coming up to me, literally crying -- I'm not exaggerating," Mr. Katsihtis said. "There was one little guy in his 60's, retired. He's been coming here for 15 years, seven days a week, every morning and every afternoon. He seemed like a lost puppy. He goes, 'Peter, what am I going to do?' I told him to go across the street. But he said it wouldn't be the same." 
 Mr. Katsihtis, like other restaurant and store owners next to Yankee Stadium, have survived over the years despite slipping attendance at games and the vagaries of the team's performance. Now, the seven businesses on Mr. Katsihtis's strip are facing their toughest test ever, since a fire destroyed most of their block early this month.
The Yankees' future in the South Bronx remains uncertain despite the city's most recent proposal to create a theme park around the stadium, with new stores, restaurants and roads. But the owners of the businesses that burned are committed to reopening quickly, and borough officials are helping them do so.
The fire gutted all of the businesses on 161st Street between River and Gerard Avenues, except for a McDonald's at the western end of the block. Once a vibrant strip near the Yankee Stadium subway stop and Borough Hall, the site is now occupied by scorched walls and exposed steel beams surrounded by eight-foot-high boards.
Shortly after the fire on Jan. 5, borough officials began plans to rebuild the strip. Because the stores fall in the recently established Federal urban empowerment zone, it will be easier for the buildings' owners and the merchants to obtain permits and qualify for loans, said Kevin Nunn, president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, which is coordinating the rebuilding effort.
At a meeting with the merchants, the borough also offered to help with temporary relocation for some of the businesses, including a group medical practice. The fire destroyed a branch of H & R Block accountants, a grocery, a newspaper store, a clothing store, a pizzeria and Mr. Katsihtis's coffee shop.
"All the merchants expressed interest in reopening there," Mr. Nunn said.
Clint Roswell, a spokesman for the borough president's office, said the rebuilding effort should not face delays, because fire marshals determined that the fire had started with a heater and they ruled it accidental.
No timetable has been set, but merchants said it would take at least half a year to reopen their stores.
For the last seven years, Anastasios Kostarelos had owned Quality Pizza, a restaurant with six tables and 16 stools. Business had fallen in the last five years, he said, because of declining attendance at Yankee Stadium. Most of his customers lived in the neighborhood or worked at Borough Hall, but he had counted on baseball fans for extra revenues.
"You're not making a killing in the area," Mr. Kostarelos said, "you're just surviving. But if we can afford the new lease, we would love to go back." NORIMITSU ONISHI

How Foreigners Invest, And Lose Their Shirts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
FOREIGN investors have lost billions of dollars in Mexico, and the recriminations are flying. American investors want to know why their Government didn't warn them that the Mexican economy was sicker than it looked. The Mexican finance minister says things would not have gotten this bad if investors on Wall Street hadn't been so eager to send money. And as the United States Congress began balking at the Clinton Administration's proposal to bail out Mexico with $40 billion in loan guarantees, the Mexican stock market and the peso took another plunge.
So what else is new?
The history of foreign investing is littered with disaster stories. Governments fall, and their successors renege on their debts. Currencies are devalued. Bull markets collapse and in the rubble evidence of fraud emerges. The supposed experts who should have been on the lookout for problems were in fact too busy selling securities to pay attention. 
 It has long been a truism of investing that foreigners tend to buy at the top of almost any market. That is probably because they are not paying attention when a foreign market is cheap, only noticing it after prices have doubled and tripled and then rushing in. At first the waves of foreign buying push prices up even more, bringing in even more foreign money. But no boom lasts forever. And when rumors of problems begin to spread, foreigners are unlikely to be among the first to hear them.
Time after time in the late 19th century, British investors bought American securities, only to lose much of their money in a panic or in a bankruptcy that seemed to leave insiders unscathed. J. P. Morgan became the dominant banker in America in part because he was trusted by British investors to try to protect their interests. They needed protection from the likes of Jay Gould, who once kept control of the Katy Railroad (the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad), despite the opposition of most shareholders, by printing the announcement of the annual meeting in an obscure Kansas newspaper. By the time the shareholders, most of them British, found out about the meeting, it was too late.
"A lot of money was lost by foreigners investing in the United States," said James B. Rogers, Jr., a former Wall Street money manager known for his investing in risky foreign markets. "But those who got it right made a great deal of money investing in this debt-ridden underdeveloped country."
In fact, the Mexican debacle is, in many ways, tame by historical standards, even by Mexican historical standards. As recently as 1982, the Mexicans defaulted on promises to pay high interest rates on American dollars deposited in their banks, instead paying off the deposits in sharply devalued pesos. But this year, similar promises made by the Mexican Government have been honored, greatly reducing the losses for investors. And so far, the drop in Mexican stocks has not been tinged by scandal.
That is not always the case. Two decades ago, during a wild bull market in Hong Kong that drew in a lot of foreign money, some enterprising people took advantage of the swell by printing and selling counterfeit share certificates. Brokerage back offices were so overwhelmed by heavy trading that it was some time before they noticed the counterfeits. Soon after, the market crashed, and everyone lost money, whether or not they had been snookered into buying a phony certificate.
Just three years ago, a boom in India's stock market was fueled by phony bank certificates, which were traded like money. Profits vanished when the fraud was uncovered.
"There is always the risk of unexpected developments in any kind of investing," notes Barton Biggs, the chief international strategist for Morgan Stanley. "In international markets, the risks are compounded" because markets are not as open as the American market.
Foreign markets are also complicated by differences in accounting standards around the world. Standards can be surprisingly lax even in some major countries like Britain, where Robert Maxwell carried out a massive fraud without his auditors noticing. And in some countries, there are no real audits at all. China had a brief stock market boom in 1993 despite a lack of reliable profit figures. And last year the Bank of China, a government-owned bank, sold $500 million of bonds to American investors. Although the bank's balance sheet looked good, it was not audited by any other accounting firm. Instead, the figures were certified by the bank's very own in-house accountants.
So far, that loan has not been a disaster for the lenders. But the willingness of investors to overlook the lack of an outside accountant is a sign that greed has gotten the better of them. "There are," says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, "cycles of financial credulity just as sure as there are business cycles."
In the 1920's, Mr. Grant recalls in "Money of the Mind," his book on financial history, Ivan Krueger, a Swedish financier who dominated the world's match industry -- that's right, the things you light candles with -- borrowed huge sums of money at extraordinarily high interest rates. Although he used the best investment bankers, no one noticed that his auditing firm, a predecessor of today's Ernst & Young, had not certified his accounts. (In fact, they refused to do so because they could not confirm the figures.)
When Krueger's fraud was eventually exposed, the American investment bankers were blamed, even by Swedish investors. The investors said they had relied on the bankers to investigate Krueger. Max Winkler, a financial commentator of the time whose own warnings had been ignored, responded to those pleas by quoting, "Mundus vult decipi -- ergo decipiatur." The world wants to be deceived -- let it therefore be deceived.
Before the current Mexican crisis, there were in fact some warnings sounded. Last spring, Gert von der Linde, the retired chief economist of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, predicted the devaluation of Mexican currency. But his words were all but ignored. Indeed, most big Wall Street firms were eagerly recommending, and selling, Mexican investments right up until the peso fell.
Now American government officials say they saw the risks in Mexico and began warning Mexican officials as early as late summer. But they decided not to sound a warning here because they believed that it was important to support the Mexican Government and economy, particularly in the wake of the bruising ratification battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
There is plenty of precedent here, as well. In the 1920's American investors were persuaded to lend huge sums of money to Germany to help with its reconstruction and with reparations payments after World War I. The bankers who arranged the loans by selling bonds feared that Germany would default, and so did the American Government, but they kept quiet and emphasized how America would benefit from the loans, through increased trade. The fears, of course, were prescient.
Historically, the excesses of international markets have produced big profits and big losses, with the losses killing investors' enthusiasm for years or even decades. Now, President Clinton appears to be trying to avoid discouraging Americans from investing in Mexico.
Many Wall Street strategists argue that if Congress fails to approve the loan guarantees to Mexico, it will be playing Russian roulette with the hemisphere's economy. They say that America's responsibility to the economy far outweighs any concern about unjustly enriching foolish investors, whose bad bets on Mexico will prove much less costly to them if the bailout is approved.
That is an argument that grates on Mr. Grant, who thinks that the loan guarantees would be a bailout not of Mexico but of reckless investors. "This scheme has shown that Wall Street is not in favor of free markets," he said last week. "It is in favor of free bull markets. It is so much opposed to bear markets that it would like the Government to intervene to stop them."

HEADLINE: The World;
A Language Divided Against Itself

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
THE calls for holy war that adorn the walls in slums throughout the Middle East, and fill the speech of Islamic militants, are written in a special brand of Arabic. This is not the classic language of 1,500 years of science, poetry and philosophy. It is a far simpler argot, of cliches, religious verses and slogans. Expressed in the cruder rhythms and pronunciations of street language, they become almost incomprehensible to educated Arabs, only widening a dangerous gulf between an elite that looks to the West and an enraged underclass from which suicide bombers and murderers of tourists can be recruited. The cliches and slogans are made to burst with emotion, leaving them ill suited for reflection or debate.
How, for example, is an outsider to answer a shout of "Islam is the solution"? Where does "There is no god but God" fit into the political discourse? And how can those with a different point of view communicate with sloganeers like those in Gaza who last week applauded a curbside massacre in central Israel as "the killing of 20 pigs and the injuring of 60 monkeys?" 
 The point is that they can't. Americans can't. Israelis can't. And neither can the educated Arab elite, now the West's tacit allies in the Middle East.
In one sense, the problem is obvious and familiar: Demagogues everywhere exhort supporters with chants, shouts and epithets, to unify and isolate them.
Here in the Middle East the problem goes deeper. For the ways in which both the Arabic language and Arab societies have evolved make the language of the poor an exquisite tool with which to corrupt the Koran into an instrument of class hatred and tribal warfare.
The poor man's Arabic is not the same as that of the elite, who speak an idiom that the illiterate, and semi-literate, underclass often does not understand.
The forms of Arabic range from classical to colloquial; speaking one or another quickly identifies an Arab by class and by level of education. And, since enormous social and economic gulfs have been allowed to grow, language itself has become a barrier to understanding. The poor often cannot grasp the subtle rationalizations put forward by the educated. And the elite, isolated and besieged, are perplexed by the string of slogans and rote scriptural quotations, which they dismiss as an incoherent babble even as they fail to comprehend the anger beneath.
It is not easy to find parallels for this in the highly educated and more egalitarian societies of the West, but consider this: What if 80 or 90 percent of Americans spoke every day in the brutal and angry cadences of gangsta rap, while the members of a feudal upper class mused over their own demise in Elizabethan English?
That is an exaggeration, of course. While the Arabic of the Koran is as poetic as the full theology of Islam -- nuanced and difficult to master -- everywhere the language has undergone some adaptation for modern usage, even among the highly educated.
But it occurs in its most degraded form in the slums and poor villages across the Middle East -- in Cairo and Algiers and in Gaza. This is the language that has been adopted by political Islam, and this is where it is gaining ground.
At the same time, the militant clerics, in their calls for fire and blood, cling only to select passages of their holy book, in the manner of zealots elsewhere. So corruptions of Islamic terms and passages are numerous in the militants' ideology. None is as gross as the use of the word "jihad." For the militants it conveys carte blanche to kill, kidnap, hijack and bomb anyone they see as an infidel, including children and other Muslims. More temperate Muslims point out how often the prophet Mohammed denounced bloodthirstiness.
In fact, jihad does not always mean "holy war," or even "war," in the Koran. According to Islamic tradition, the "great jihad" is the battle within one's self to live in accord with God's will. A jihad, for Mohammed, is often the struggle to achieve inner-worldly asceticism, in accord with his call "to command the good and forbid evil with the heart, the tongue and the hand." And the Koran is even more blunt about using violence to propagate the faith. "There is no compulsion in religion," it states; it condemns forced piety and conversion as insincere. Calls to martyrdom, presented by militants as a direct path toward eternal life, conveniently eschew the Koranic ban on suicide.
But theological nuance is beside the point for the zealots. It is enough for unexamined quotations to be injected into the everyday flow of street Arabic, which often uses cliches or slogans in every third or fourth sentence anyway.
"These slogans are valued by the poor as much as their television sets, or other electronic devices, that they own but do not understand and cannot devise or manufacture themselves," said Dr. el-Said M. Badawi, the Director of the Arabic Language Institute at the American University in Cairo and one of the Middle East's leading linguists. "The slogans satisfy a real need. Because the poor lack the educational tools to dissect a cliche, or a slogan, they accept it whole and do not question it."
 
A Legacy of Ruin
 That the average Arab has such a poor grasp of political language is largely the fault of the fiery Arab nationalists, such as Gamal Abdel Nasser, who two generations ago mobilized the dispossessed with impassioned slogans of their own. These directed hatred at colonialists and Israelis while promising wealth and an Arab resurgence. Once in power, however, the Arab nationalists proved corrupt, brutal and inept. They ruined educational systems that could have helped the masses develop a more sophisticated vocabulary. Now the clerics are taking advantage of the social and intellectual wreckage left behind.
The great mistake opponents of the militant movements often make is to assume that the skeletal nature of the language used, and the intellectual shallowness of the slogans, mean that the message won't be effective. The Egyptian, Tunisian and Algerian Governments use a lot of air time and newspaper space to criticize the militants' ideology (but often in the highbrow Arabic that the masses have trouble understanding).
Judge Sayid al-Ashmaway, who lives with bodyguards and rarely leaves home, is Egypt's most prominent intellectual critic of the movement. His books are required reading in many schools inside and outside Egypt. "Either Islam is reformed or we are finished," he said in an interview. "The Islamic mind is confused. People do not understand the proper definitions of Islamic terms, but believe the distorted definitions. Religion has become mixed up with politics and out of this has come an ideology. This militant doctrine must be replaced by a liberal Islamic doctrine."
But just as secular Arab regimes and movements like Algeria's socialist government and Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization squandered the chance to educate the masses to a more sophisticated level of political participation, so the intellectuals like Judge Ashmaway, who attack the Islamic militants in the state-controlled press, have squandered their credibility by siding with these dying political systems.
W. B. Yeats once observed, in "Meditations in Times of Civil War": "We had fed the heart on fantasies. The heart's grown brutal from the fare." Such is the real tragedy of the Middle East, in the end: that the brutalization of political conversation has left so few Arabs able to talk to one another.

HEADLINE: CHINA TRADE RIFT WITH U.S. DEEPENS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The latest round of trade negotiations between the United States and China broke down in Beijing today, and the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, threatened to impose steep tariffs on Chinese goods if an agreement was not reached by next Saturday.
The United States is demanding that China crack down immediately on the pirating of copyrighted American computer software, movies and music, and that it stop Chinese businesses from putting phony American labels on consumer products. 
 In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Kantor said he had invited Chinese trade officials to come to Washington next week to resume the talks but had not received a response.
In Beijing, the official New China News Agency maintained that Chinese negotiators "made ultimate efforts and showed considerable flexibility" during the latest talks but that the United States had made new demands that made an agreement impossible.
The talks over the last nine days were the latest in negotiations that have gone on for years as the Chinese Government has refused to close down 29 factories in southern China that turn out 70 million compact disks and other illegally copied products every year.
Many of these products are sold elsewhere in Asia, and officials here estimate that American businesses lose $1 billion a year because of the thievery.
"We want a detailed agreement that's going to address the problem," Mr. Kantor said.
If such an agreement is not reached by Saturday, the deadline for imposing sanctions under an American law called Special 301, 100 percent tariffs will be imposed within days on some Chinese exports, Mr. Kantor said. That would double the price that American consumers pay for these items. In theory, that would cause sales of Chinese-made products to fall.
Mr. Kantor did not identify today the exports that would be affected, but a list of potential products published late last year included consumer electronics, toys and clothing.
Asked whether he was serious about imposing the stiff new tariffs or was just seeking to strengthen the United States' hand in the negotiations, Mr. Kantor responded, "Watch our actions."
He added, "With this Administration, it's been quite clear that we're willing to impose trade sanctions."
Chinese negotiators have often waited until the last moment to present concessions, as was the case during textile talks last year. So an agreement by the deadline Saturday is not impossible.
Two years ago, the United States threatened similar measures but backed off after China agreed to new laws to prevent the illegal copying of foreign products. The laws were never enforced.
Then, last May, President Clinton reversed a promise he made during his election campaign and agreed to renew trade benefits to China, called "most favored nation" treatment, without regard to the way China dealt with its political dissidents.
The President maintained that continuing the trade benefits would be good for American business and good for the dissidents. But since then, crackdowns on dissidents have worsened, and China has not followed through on commitments to let the Red Cross visit dissidents in prison to check on their conditions.
With American markets open to the Chinese and markets in China largely closed to American products, the United States' trade deficit with that country has mushroomed. The trade imbalance last year was about $30 billion, second in size only to the $60 billion deficit with Japan.
Mr. Kantor said that on the street in Beijing, American negotiators were able to buy a package of illegally copied American computer software worth $10,000 for only $100. He said he found it "somewhat stunning" that even Government ministries in China used pirated American software "on a daily basis."

Beijing Blames U.S. Negotiators
 BEIJING, Jan. 28 (AP) -- China blamed the United States today for the failure of the two nations' talks aimed at ending patent, trademark and copyright piracy in China.
The New China News Agency said American negotiators had made new demands as the talks were about to end that went "beyond the scope of intellectual property." American negotiators here were not immediately available for comment.
"We don't want to see a trade war," the official news agency quoted an unidentified spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation as saying.
The official said China believed it important to protect intellectual property rights. But he repeated China's warning that it would retaliate with trade sanctions of its own if Washington made good on its threat.
China contends that it has made significant progress in protecting intellectual property rights. American negotiators say China's enforcement of laws to protect these rights has been inadequate.

HEADLINE: 2 Californias Face Off; This Time It's a Game

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
At kickoff time in Sunday's all-California Super Bowl, Mary Schafer's household will be gathered around the television set with their San Diego Chargers sweat shirts and their "Southern California quiche": a stack of pizzas.
Five hundred miles north, in Sacramento, her twin sister, Sue Whitehead, will be rooting for the San Francisco 49ers with the finely honed disdain that Northern Californians reserve for their sisters to the south. "Of course we're superior," she says. "I keep telling my sister she better behave or we'll turn the water off." 
 This longstanding rivalry, and the San Andreas fault, are among the few things that the north and the south of this huge state have in common. With as many people as the combined population of 22 other states -- and even bigger portions of brawn and glitter -- California has been likened to two Arnold Schwarzeneggers trying to squeeze into one body.
The rivalry has its serious side: Southern California has made its deserts bloom with water siphoned from the north and has used its economic and electoral muscle to sway state policies -- but much of it is a contrast in style.
Two weeks ago, when the 49ers qualified for their fifth Super Bowl, a headline in The San Francisco Chronicle neatly captured the mood of that city, which is sometimes compared to a Victorian dowager. "Low-Key Jubilation," it announced.
Here in the home of the San Diego Chargers -- underdog team, underdog city -- joy and disbelief have risen to near-hysteria, with people shaving the Chargers' lightning bolt onto their hair and repainting their cars in Chargers blue and yellow.
Priests are sewing yellow lightning bolts into their robes and saying special Masses for the team. On Friday thousands of fans formed a human lighting bolt in a parking lot and sent a photograph to San Francisco to be printed as a full-page advertisement in local newspapers.
Whether the reaction is studied calm or wild delight, this first all-California Super Bowl, in which the 49ers face the Chargers in Miami, is most certainly more than just a game. It is the latest clash in a rivalry that can be traced almost to the founding of the state a century and a half ago.
There is an undergirding of truth to the California stereotypes: the lush and laid-back north with its redwoods and rainfall, its beatniks and its free-speech movement; the arid, glitzy south, an oversized bully that fills its swimming pools with water from the north and sends its smog drifting out over the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
What better way to compare the north and the south than by contrasting the character of their surfers.
"In parts of Southern California there is definitely enormous peer pressure to be very cool and wear the right clothes," said Nick Carroll, editor-in-chief of Surfing magazine. "In San Francisco you're under pressure to avoid being cool as much as possible."
In Northern California, he said, where the waves are cold and wild, "Surfers like to think of themselves as a hard-bitten, hardy breed who will brave anything in order to go surfing. They look down on Southern California surfers as namby-pamby little warm-weather guys who don't have the guts."
On the other hand, he said, "Southern California surf style is one of high performance and extremely high skill."
"They tend to mock the San Francisco guys for being old, stiff, geriatric types who wouldn't know how to do an aerial turn on a wave if it hit them in the face."
Since the 1850's, there have been 27 legislative attempts to wrench the state apart: into two sections, into three; left to right, top to bottom. With all their differences, it sometimes seems the only thing the north and the south have in common is the San Andreas fault and the earthquakes it spawns.
"The San Andreas provides a backbone for the state," said Allan G. Lindh, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey who, as a typical northerner, prefers to characterize himself as a "carpenter-philosopher."
But it is the San Andreas that will eventually succeed where legislators have failed, he said, splitting the state from the Gulf of California north past San Francisco, at a rate of 60 miles every one million years.
"I don't think Los Angeles will ever reach San Francisco," he said, waving aside a common prediction of geologists. "That's a false rumor being spread by people in L.A. who are trying to stake a future claim on our water."
With an eye always on impending disaster, as they bask in the state's riches, some Californians note that the last time two California teams met in a national championship -- the 1989 World Series -- parts of San Francisco crashed to the ground in the Loma Prieta earthquake.
If that were to happen in San Diego, the people here might be too frenzied to notice. Though their team will be playing a continent away, Chargers fans are expected to fill Jack Murphy Stadium here on Sunday to watch the game on two giant television monitors.
"Respect" is the assertive new slogan here, in yellow block letters on a blue field, on banners and baseball caps everywhere, and Mayor Susan Golding has announced a parade of celebration on Monday, win or lose. The nation's sixth largest city, everyone here agrees, is finally on the map. It is honor almost too much to absorb that San Diego will play host next year to the Republican National Convention and two years later to the Super Bowl.
In San Francisco, by contrast, said the newspaper columnist Herb Caen of The Chronicle, "We're getting so blase about winning Super Bowls that there probably won't even be a victory parade; just the Mayor going down the street by himself."
This may not be the moment to say it, but for all their rivalry and their apparent differences, the city of fog and the city of sunshine could be soul mates. Both are turn-of-the-century towns, with San Francisco clinging to the elegance and culture of the last one and San Diego emerging at the cutting edge of the next. Both are compact, livable, expensive bay-side communities that prize science and the arts.
But more than anything, both are cities that have defined themselves by not being Los Angeles.
That sprawling, disorderly giant, with its congestion and smog and crime, its energy and ferment, its conflicts and its creativity, is the gaping absence at this Sunday's game, the biggest man on campus without a date to the prom.
It is a tough moment for Los Angeles. At the start of the football season, many people predicted an all-California Super Bowl, but they predicted that the 49ers would be facing the Los Angeles Raiders. Instead, with the Raiders finishing out of the running, the city has had to absorb as well the defection of its other professional football team, the Rams, to St. Louis.
"No one was sorry to see the Rams go," said Dawn Setzer, a football fan who works in the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art. "They were so bad for so long. I get the feeling that everyone here expects to see San Francisco win but wants San Diego to do well; the Chargers are so likable."
David L. Ulin, a writer and editor who lives in Los Angeles and is backing the 49ers, said, "The final irony is that an all-California Super Bowl is being played in Miami. I think it's karmic justice."
As Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan has had many a disaster to deal with, but being left out is a new one. In an interview, he was quick to remind the world of the city's importance.
"I feel that we in Los Angeles have more serious pursuits than chasing an oval ball around a field," he said. "We've got the Grammies. We've got the Academy Awards. We've got beach volleyball."

HEADLINE: Residents of a Brooklyn Enclave Create Their Own Renewal Plan

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
In a city of skyscrapers and shadows, people have always talked about the natural light that drenches Red Hook. The Brooklyn neighborhood has almost no tall buildings and sits squarely on New York Harbor, and so residents, artists and visitors have long regarded the abundance of available light to be one of Red Hook's greatest physical gifts.
But for all the light, it has for decades been hard for anyone to see much of a future for the neighborhood. Isolated, abandoned, damaged by poverty and decay, Red Hook has long been in decline. Its 1950 population of 21,000 has shrunk to 11,000. The old rough-and-tumble waterfront, once bustling with factory workers and stevedores, is not only inactive, but inaccessible. Half the people live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter of the neighborhood's 343 acres stand vacant. 
 Now, however, the residents of Red Hook believe they have a vision to go with all of their cherished light. Thirteen volunteers -- including a foster care worker, a schoolteacher and a statistician -- have produced an ambitious urban renewal plan, formally released at Brooklyn's Borough Hall last week, that aims to all but reinvent their historic neighborhood.
It is a plan that city officials call the most sophisticated and practical effort at city planning since the 1989 revision of the City Charter granted community boards the authority to map their own futures. Even though city officials agree it offers a realistic blueprint for remaking Red Hook into a thriving community, the plan could face a decade of bureaucratic challenges before it has hope of becoming reality -- an indication of the barriers residents face in trying to plan the future of their neighborhoods.
Red Hook's plan, laid out in 88 pages of graphs and charts, history and imagination, essentially calls for a working-class maritime village on the peninsula that lies south of Brooklyn Heights. It would have hundreds of units of new housing, a new 500-student high school, and a revitalized waterfront. Now isolated because no subway or major bus line runs through it, the new Red Hook would have direct public bus service to lower Manhattan. And major zoning changes would allow for a mix of residential and commercial development so that the community could be more integrated.
"Look, it's easy to talk a grand, bold line about urban design, and then watch as plans collect dust on office shelves somewhere," said Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
"But this plan, simply put, is one of the best we've seen. It's not an advocacy plan, not an ideological plan. It's not a wish list, but based in reality. The process behind the plan and the product itself should be a model for how neighborhoods plan for themselves in the future."
The future offered by the plan registers in a more human and less academic way with Wally Bazemore, a father who lives in one of Red Hook's housing projects.
"I have seen the neighborhood go from the sublime to the ridiculous, but I have chosen to raise my son here," Mr. Bazemore said of Red Hook. "I have a lot of faith in the plan, otherwise I'd be scurrying out of there with everybody else. I hope the politicians do justice to the plan with those mighty pens of theirs."
 
A Case Study In Urban Design
 Created over three years, the plan reflects the input of the neighborhood's poorest residents as well as its most eager property owners. Urban planners consider it singularly likely to succeed because its proposals for new housing do not call for a lot of construction, its requests for zoning changes are close to gaining final city approval, and its plans for economic development will depend mostly on private enterprise. And, finally, because there is so much that is physically appealing about Red Hook: its piers, its views, its unmatched array of vacant land.
"Because of its actual and perceived isolation, it's easy to deal with Red Hook as a kind of separate village," said Tom Angotti, a professor of city planning at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn who served as the residents' consultant. "This is not just a land-use plan, but more like a traditional urban design master plan. It might be an ideal case study for the future of planning in the city."
No one in Red Hook or in city government harbors illusions about vast subsidies or instant transformations. No one has even started to estimate eventual costs.
Indeed, the colossus of bureaucracy the neighborhood faces as it fights for final approval of its plan is captured by one of the final pages of the document: Page 81 lists 23 separate government agencies or institutions, from the City Council to the Department of Environmental Protection, whose help or approval will be required to carry it off.
To date, the plan has received initial approval by the City Planning Commission, and is expected to be given the official blessing of the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, by the end of February. It would then have to be given final approval by the Planning Commission as well as the City Council. In a measure of the optimism surrounding the plan, Mr. Golden has taken the unusual step of forming a task force to begin implementing the plan.
"It feels challenging, but it doesn't feel intimidating," Maria Favuzzi, a Brooklyn resident who headed Community Board 6's urban renewal committee, said of the task ahead. Community Board 6 covers Red Hook and parts of Park Slope and Cobble Hill.
"The people of Red Hook don't want any more trauma, and they didn't wait around for their political leaders to lead them," Mrs. Favuzzi continued. "One could assume there isn't a lot of political clout in Red Hook, but the people have started something I don't think the government can fail to respond to."
 
A Failed History In Reversing Decline
 Red Hook's decline began with the demise of the post-war maritime industry. Its physical and psychic isolation was cemented by Robert Moses' plans for the Gowanus Expressway. Mr. Moses' Brooklyn highway network, developed in the 1940's, bypassed and effectively severed Red Hook from the rest of Brooklyn.
The city's first effort to rescue Red Hook failed fantastically in the 1970's, abandoned before it was meaningfully started. What was left was a shambles of condemned houses, abandoned construction and manufacturing projects and a vanishing population.
The sense of ruin and regret still haunts the peninsula that looks out on the Statue of Liberty. The area is cursed by some of the city's most intractable problems, poverty and violence.
More than 70 percent of Red Hook's residents live in the Red Hook Houses, a public housing project.
According to the 1990 census, the average annual household income was $9,500. More than 78 percent of the children lived in households lacking both natural parents. Only 6 percent of the people over age 25 had college degrees.
And a whole range of the neighborhood's social service programs have been diminished or eliminated by recent budget cuts.
"It's not a neighborhood that is a great political risk to ignore," said Fran York, an official with Good Shepherd Services and the director of a number of social service programs in Red Hook. "Even if people in Red Hook are in favor of the plan, how will they get the political backing for all the funding that will be needed?"
The plan's promoters are not troubled by that kind of time frame, and estimate that it may take 25 years for all of its ambitions to be realized. That is why, they say, it is called a plan.
"If your aim is for what is accomplishable at the moment, then you don't plan," said Ron Shiffman, a member of the City Planning Commission who also served as an adviser to the residents of Red Hook.
 
The Modest And the Grand
 The specifics of the plan range from the modest to the audacious.
The first phase of its housing aims will revolve around 250 units of "in-fill housing" to be built on vacant land or salvaged from rehabilitated structures already in place around what the plan calls Conover Square, a two-block-by-two-block chunk of central Red Hook. Improvements in security and service at the Red Hook Houses would take place. And additional housing could result from the renovation of a city-owned five-story industrial building on the waterfront as well as the mixed-use development of the waterfront property currently zoned only for manufacturing.
What the plan envisions as "Education Plaza" would also be built, including a 500-student school for grades 7 to 12, centers for teen-agers and job-training centers. Satellite branches of the Red Hook Public Library would be established, plans already under way for a recreational pier at the end of Coffey Street would be completed and a corridor of streets to be known as "Ecology Way" would be refurbished and ultimately link Red Hook's pool and sports fields with the waterfront.
The designated truck route in Red Hook, which is now Van Brunt Street, would instead run along Conover Street under the plan. Van Brunt Street, now the only real commercial strip in Red Hook, would then be rezoned to allow for residential and commercial development. A bus route would be devised to carry residents of Red Hook to Manhattan through the nearby Brooklyn Battery Tunnel.
The closed Revere Sugar factory could be converted to a maritime museum, the underused New York Shipyards could be home to an imagined New York flower market, the abandoned grain terminal could be rebuilt to serve as a terminal for the storage of animal feed products to be exported overseas.
"Red Hook was very nicely zoned for the Civil War," said Greg O'Connell, a Red Hook developer who now has 20 small businesses operating on his converted pier. "But Red Hook is definable enough, appealing enough to developers and industry that you can really get a handle on what's possible."
The plan's sponsors worked hard to prevent overwhelming gentrification of the neighborhood. Two-thirds or more of all the new housing must be affordably priced, no new housing can be built that exceeds the four-story height of most of the neighborhood's current stock, no houses can be condemned for reconstruction without the consent of both owners and tenants.
Bea Byrd likes to think she and the other residents of the Red Hook Houses had much to do with both the plan's most ambitious and protective aspects. A leader of the tenants association, Ms. Byrd fought to be included on the community board's planning committee before it had opened the process to Red Hook's full population, and she made a point of taking the microphone at the committee's final meeting on Tuesday.
"When I think of this plan, I think of Martin Luther King Jr. and the notion of why we as a people can't wait," Ms. Byrd said. "We have children, and so we have hope. When the plan was done, I wanted to speak publicly. I wanted the privilege of saying I supported the document."

HEADLINE: Book, Citing Hanoi Files, Finds M.I.A. Data Withheld

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
A new book based on Vietnamese military archives asserts that Hanoi withheld considerable information on American prisoners of war for decades, and began releasing it only after the cold war, when Soviet-bloc support evaporated and Vietnam urgently sought to end an American-led economic embargo.
"Perhaps hundreds" of Americans who survived crashes and ambushes were killed by their captors in the 1960's and 1970's, Vietnamese officers are quoted as saying in the book, "Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the M.I.A. Mystery." 
 The book was written by Malcolm McConnell of Reader's Digest, a former Foreign Service officer, using material provided by an American researcher, Theodore G. Schweitzer 3d. It is a summary of the pieces of information that have been put together so far about those missing at the end of the Vietnam War, and suggests that the number of Americans killed in captivity was higher than previously believed.
Mr. Schweitzer, who has often been in the public eye but rarely speaks to the press, describes himself as a former librarian. He was a field officer in Thailand for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. After the war he was involved in private relief efforts to aid the Vietnamese.
Colleagues from his United Nations days remember him as an adventurer, and he was known around Southeast Asia for his tales of derring-do. He told the Vietnamese that he was an independent author, although when most of his archival work was done he was a covert agent of American defense intelligence. Mr. Schweitzer did the bulk of his research in Hanoi in 1992, armed with a scanner provided by American agents and a good supply of dollars to reward the Vietnamese army archivists assigned to help him.
Soon after his project became public, the United States military was able to set up its own research teams in Vietnam, where work continues.
The author and researcher believe that the Vietnamese understood and accepted the ruse because Hanoi wanted to use an indirect conduit to Washington to test American reaction to material it had previously withheld.
Some officials who have been close to the issue say that the fact that the Vietnamese withheld information in cases where there were serious questions helped to fuel a militant P.O.W.-M.I.A. movement in the United States.
 "We know the Vietnamese had a lot of information they had not given us," Roger Shields, a former Pentagon official who was in charge of the prisoner release when the United States withdrew its troops from Indochina in 1973, said in an interview this week. "We were not surmising. We absolutely knew, and they knew we knew."
The book, published on Jan. 25 by Simon and Schuster, quotes a Vietnamese officer identified as Lieut. Col. Nguyen Van Thi as saying, "Our Government does not want America to know that our darkest secret is that we killed many American prisoners in cold blood."
Officials in Hanoi say this is fiction.
Former Pentagon officials say that they have always known of some cases of murder or death by torture, some of them incidents disclosed by Vietnam during the war and others described by American prisoners released in 1973.
At the time, however, President Richard M. Nixon, beginning to come under pressure from the Watergate scandal, overrode Defense Department apprehensions and declared on March 27, 1973, that "all of our American P.O.W.'s are on the way home."
Yesterday, Hanoi and Washington signed an agreement to exchange diplomats with Vietnam for the first time in two decades. The action came just a few weeks before Defense Secretary William J. Perry is to give Congress the latest information on Americans missing in Indochina. Officials said that the United States is holding out full diplomatic relations as an incentive for cooperation from Vietnam.
 Officials at the Pentagon would not discuss the book, but Beverly Baker, a spokeswoman for the Prisoner of War-Missing in Action Office at the Defense Department, said that Mr. Schweitzer's work to confirm that records were available in Hanoi allowed the Pentagon to establish the research there on an official footing.
Hanoi, eager to see the embargo lifted before President Bush left office, quickly complied with the request to permit the research. It was another two years before the Clinton Administration lifted trade barriers, and since then dozens of cases of missing Americans have been solved.
The book appears to corroborate the belief that Hanoi did not make a full accounting of missing Americans, despite its insistence to the contrary.
But the book returns to some cases and demolishes some of the more extreme claims, that Americans were knowingly left behind in Vietnam and that Washington has covered up the fact.
The McConnell-Schweitzer account also discounts reports that Americans were turned over to the Soviet military by the Vietnamese, as prisoners were by Communist forces in Korea in the 1950's. It was in that context that Colonel Thiwas reportedly told Mr. Schweitzer that "giving American prisoners to the Russians was not our darkest secret" and then proceeded to talk about executions and deaths under torture.
Mr. Schweitzer told the author that Hanoi held files that might shed light on the deaths. These included the so-called Blue Files, which Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and co-chairman of a now-disbanded Senate Select Committee on P.O.W-M.I.A. Affairs, tried unsuccessfully to pry loose in 1992.
In the 22 years since United States forces were withdrawn, the debate over those missing in Indochina has polarized into a confrontation between those who believed that Vietnam did all it could to account for prisoners, and those who not only think that Hanoi withheld information but also often believe that some Americans remain alive in captivity.
In between has been a small, often silent but experienced group of officials and veterans who have argued that it is inconceivable that American prisoners could still be alive but it is also certain that Hanoi knew far more than it acknowledged about many cases.
Today, the United States lists 2,211 Americans still officially missing in action in Southeast Asia. About half are known to have died, but remains have not been recovered. Only a few dozen cases are considered genuine puzzles that the Vietnamese are likely to have the power to solve.
A spokeswoman at the Foreign Ministry in Hanoi dismissed the book as a "fabrication," adding that the timing of its publication was intended to derail improved relations.

HEADLINE: James P. Grant, 72, Director of Unicef

BYLINE: By By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
James P. Grant, the American foreign aid expert who in 1980 became executive director of Unicef and made it into a major force for helping children, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N. Y. He was 72 and lived in Croton, N.Y.
The cause of death was cancer, Unicef officials said. Mr. Grant resigned from the United Nations Children's Fund last week. 
 The direction and urgency he gave to Unicef have widely been credited with helping to save millions of children's lives. Mr. Grant, who had also been an Under Secretary General of the United Nations, was still traveling and promoting what he called his "child survival revolution" until late last year.
His message was simple: low-cost, practical methods for saving young lives and curtailing the spread of easily preventible diseases can quickly make a difference. He advocated treating diarrhea, a leading killer of children, using doses of water, sugar, and salt that village people could make themselves.
To measure the successes and sometimes the failures of Unicef and the countries it assisted, Mr. Grant introduced an annual report, The State of the World's Children, now in its 15th year. In 1990, he organized a World Summit for Children, which he considered a highlight of his career.
In a statement after Mr. Grant's death, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: "Very few men or women ever have the opportunity to do as much good in the world as James Grant. And very few have ever grasped that opportunity with such complete and dedicated commitment."
In 1994, Mr. Grant received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Clinton, who cited him for his "compassion and courage in his crusade for the world's children."
Mr. Grant was born in Beijing on May 12, 1922, the son of a public health expert working in Asia. He received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a law degree from Harvard.
He began a lifelong career in international service in the 1940's, working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China.
In 1962 he became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs and a deputy director of the International Cooperation Administration, a precursor of the United States Agency for International Development. In 1964, he moved to Turkey to head the American aid mission there.
Three years later, Mr. Grant was appointed an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, serving until 1969, when he helped found the Overseas Development Council and became its president and chief executive officer. He remained there until moving to Unicef in 1980.
In 1943, Mr. Grant married Ethel Henck. The couple had three sons, John, James, and William. His wife died of a heart attack in 1988 on a trip in India. In 1989 he married Ellan W. Young, a photographer. He is survived by his wife, his sons and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Uganda Strongman a Favorite of World Lenders

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda

 BODY:
He does not believe that multiparty democracy is right for Uganda today. His critics call him authoritarian and at times dictatorial. But Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, an articulate and charismatic leader, is still very much a favorite of the World Bank and international powers.
Diplomats here call Mr. Museveni, a former guerrilla commander, "America's darling" and "Africa's new man." Nine years ago he took power in a country battered by decades of civil war and killings that eclipse even the Rwandan massacres. In that period, his focus on building and liberalizing the economy has brought new life to Uganda, though the country is still not an economic power. 
 In part because of his liberal economic policies, and in part because of a straightforward style so different from that of his neighbors, President Museveni has for many years succeeded in defying international pressure that makes aid contingent on democratization efforts.
But lately international donors have been restive about Mr. Museveni's pronouncement that for at least the next five years, Uganda will remain a nation with a single political movement. And Uganda cannot survive without the roughly $800 million of foreign aid it gets annually.
A Western diplomat in Kampala said: "Democratization will be a big nut to crack. This is the critical period. This is 1995, Uganda's year of decision. He's popular and he's good, but he's not opening up, and it will cause him problems. He's so good in so many ways. He's the exact kind of man an African state needs at this point. But if he stops the clock, then in five years his own system will get hardened arteries. To me Museveni lives in a glass house."
Mr. Museveni's army swept into Kampala after a five-year guerrilla war, and in 1986 he formed a broad-based Government under the National Resistance Movement. Though the Government does not allow political parties, opposition figures have been allowed to run for office as individuals. Mr. Museveni argues that multiparty systems aggravate tribal divisions.
Last year the elections for the Constituent Assembly were deemed by diplomats and human rights officials to be one of the freest and fairest elections in Africa. There are many independent newspapers in Kampala and two independent radio stations, the only ones in the region.
Mr. Museveni says he believes that his economic program is crucial to the country's stability. He has freed markets, stabilized the currency, cut inflation, sold off state-owned companies and trimmed the civil service and the army. None of it was easy. Landlocked Uganda is mostly agricultural and very poor, its fabric torn apart first by the civil war and now by the AIDS epidemic.
He has a very personal style that contrasts most with the unsmiling rigidness of Daniel arap Moi, President of Kenya, Uganda's main trading partner. While the Kenyan President, the longest-governing leader in the region, is not approachable and always flanked by heavy security, Mr. Museveni is constantly on the move both in Uganda and abroad, "holding court," as the Ugandans describe him. He prefers a khaki safari suit and floppy hat to a suit and tie, delivers his riveting speeches from such unlikely podiums as the roof of his car, and rarely misses a chance to crack a joke, although his travels this month made it impossible to get an interview with him.
But the same man's Government has arrested and harassed opponents and been accused of authoritarian tactics. In November he shuffled his Cabinet to get more of his supporters in it, diplomats say.
In Africa, where governments are all too often defined by regions and tribes, Uganda is one of the most stable, yet it remains polarized along ethnic lines.
The most powerful ethnic group, the Baganda -- the wealthy educated urban elite -- are pushing for a federal state with more power for their titular king.
In the last year, there has been increasing instability in parts of the north as rag-tag guerrillas of the Lord's Resistance Army, armed by the Sudanese Government, have fought with Ugandan soldiers and planted land mines, making roads impassable. They adhere to no particular religion, despite their name, and their leader embraces an eclectic collection of beliefs including living by the Ten Commandments and eschewing riding bicycles and eating the meat of white chickens.
The opposition is weak and without a clear platform. The strongest are supporters of the Ugandan People's Congress, the party of former President Milton Obote. Mr. Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during his rule. Unapologetic about its own history, the party views Mr. Museveni as just another despot.
"As a person, Museveni is highly ambitious," said Cecelia Ogwal, the assistant secretary general of the People's Congress. "The man cannot tolerate debate. He wants to solve problems by military ways. The U.P.C. of today is not the same one as the U.P.C. of yesterday. Let us not be judged by the childish behavior of our youth."
"Sincerely speaking and knowing democracy the way I do, we have reached a deadlock," she said, adding in reference to Mr. Museveni's party: "The N.R.M. is anti-democratic. In effect it is a military government."
Publicly, Ugandan officials say they have cordial relations with all their neighbors except the Sudan. In reality, relations are tense with Kenya and Zaire, while Uganda remains very close to Rwanda, whose rebels -- now the new Government -- fought alongside Mr. Museveni in the Ugandan civil war. Ugandan territory is the conduit for military equipment to the Sudanese rebels.
Mr. Museveni's main theme, echoed by his ministers and in almost every one of his speeches, is that Africans are "backward."
"We know Africa is backward," said Amama Mbabazi, the minister of state for defense. "We need to resolve the differences. We have to focus on other development issues. If we don't resolve our petty differences, then we shall perpetually remain backward."
Although Kenya and Uganda rely on each other, tensions between them constantly simmer.
Kenya, wary that its neighbor may have expansionist goals, has accused Uganda of arming Kenya's dissenters and believes that Uganda was responsible for helping the Rwandan rebels take over Rwanda last year. In the last month, scores of Ugandans have been arrested in Kenya. Ugandan officials and diplomats say Kenyan officials have accepted bribes from the Sudanese Government to stall ongoing regional Sudanese peace talks.
"Museveni views the other leaders as bad guys with dismal records, and he's right," a Western diplomat said. "This guy is formidable. He's very engaging, very charming. He reads a lot; he's very broad-minded. He has very strong views, but he doesn't mind testing them."

HEADLINE: Behind Tax Pledge: How the Numbers Came Up for Whitman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The news came on Jan. 4 in a low-key way, just the State Treasurer wrapping up another tedious budget briefing with the words, "So, Governor, if you want to do it, my feeling is that the revenue is going to be there to cover the whole fifteen."
No one seated around the conference table in Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's murky, wood-paneled office needed to be told what the full fifteen was, nor its political significance. 
 Even some in her own party had scoffed during her run for office 16 months ago when she had pledged to cut state income taxes 30 percent in three years, and now, with the Jan. 4 numbers, it was looking as if they might be able to deliver the promise in two years.
State Treasurer Brian W. Clymer had been churning out computerized budget projections for nearly three months by the time of that Jan. 4 meeting. He was tracking the course of New Jersey's tax receipts like an astronomer following a rogue comet. He kept factoring in income tax cuts of 5 percent, 10 percent and the full 15, the cut that would complete Governor Whitman's 30 percent tax-cut pledge a year early.
Peter Verniero, Mrs. Whitman's chief counsel, sat at the table, along with Judith L. Shaw, the chief of staff, and Jane M. Kenny, director of policy and planning, along with several aides to this inner circle. Mrs. Whitman had taken her seat in the middle of the conference table, closest to her desk, and the only question the Governor asked at Mr. Clymer's news was, "Well, what would it take?"
Last Monday, Governor Whitman answered that question to the state: cutting the state income tax 15 percent would take severe cuts in several departments, the loss of 3,400 state jobs, a virtual freeze on municipal and school aid for all but the poorest school systems. It would mean a flurry of small taxes and fees, on computer software, on grocery store coupons. It would take a few strange twists: a visit to a state motor vehicle agency in person, instead of sending that renewal in by mail, would cost $5 extra under Mrs. Whitman's budget.
But delivering on her tax-cutting promise early, the officials at that meeting knew, would also be a sensation in the state and cement Mrs. Whitman's reputation as a comer in a Republican Party that is leading an anti-tax revolution and looking to the states to prove that Washington no longer has the answers.
In October, the Governor had seemed to be moving the other way. She conceded in a radio interview that the cuts might take four years to complete instead of three, setting off a flurry of I-told-you-so's among state Democrats and from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who was fighting for a fourth term and used the admission against his rival, George E. Pataki.
Governor Whitman now maintains that she intended only to say that she would put prudence over politics in setting the tax-cut schedule, yet the dynamics of budget-writing may also have played a role in the October warning.
That is the jittery month when commissioners and bureaucrats begin to focus on their coming year's spending plans, and the Governor and her staff began bearing the brunt of intense lobbying from people interested in protecting their share of the pie. With so many dire warnings being made against this cut or in favor of that financing increase, and so little firm information about the prospects for tax revenues, the Governor's staff began making worried noises about the three-year timetable.
All that changed on Jan. 4, however, before the regular budget briefing. Ms. Kenny recalled Mr. Clymer's beckoning excitedly from a door in the Governor's outer office.
"Brian is very even, very steady," Ms. Kenny recalled, "but before the meeting that day he was gesturing at me, like he's really excited, to come over. He said, 'Jane, I want to show you something. If we do this and this and that, I think we can do the whole fifteen.' "
Mr. Clymer is a certified public accountant by training, but his background was in public transportation management, a tax-spending way of life that is far from the tax-saving, program-cutting purview of a state treasurer. He had spent the four years ending in 1992 running the Urban Mass Transit Administration in the Bush Administration, doling out Federal subsidies to city transit agencies.
Even now, two years later, Mr. Clymer's ground-floor office fronting West State Street in Trenton is festooned with models of commuter rail cars and with the kind of commemorative plaques that ranking public officials collect, like the testimonial from the city of Los Angeles to Brian W. Clymer for his help in restoring the Los Angeles Red Car Line, signed by Mayor Tom Bradley.
But it did not take a fiscal genius to see the importance of what Mr. Clymer had in his hand that day. Sales tax receipts, which grew by only $3 million from 1993 to 1994, were running $300 million above the 1994 figure, and income-tax collections were reflecting similar increases. The opening for a tax cut, a big tax cut, was growing wider.
Mr. Clymer had started his budget-making months earlier, in the heat of July and days after the current fiscal year's budget took effect. He began with three ground rules laid down by Mrs. Whitman:
"Any increase in spending had to be kept at or under the rate of inflation," the Treasurer recalled. "That was No. 1. No. 2, there had to be some extra money in it for Abbott versus Burke," the shorthand name for a State Supreme Court order to increase state aid to New Jersey's 30 poorest school districts.
"And three," Mr. Clymer said, "there had to be a tax cut in there."
In fact, early on, Mr. Clymer had picked an arbitrary figure out of the air, $300 million, 2 percent of the total 1995 state budget, as the goal for the cut, but first the state's 17 departments, the state colleges and universities, the state-owned New Jersey Transit system and dozens of other constituent groups were assigned the task of finding places to cut their budgets.
Those agencies use about a third of the state budget, with the other two-thirds devoted to school and municipal aid and to social services. A proposal was made -- no one will admit to it now, "but it was always out there," said Mr. Vernerio, the chief counsel -- to make an arbitrary across-the-board cut of state agencies, say, 10 percent, which would produce about $400 million in savings. The idea had appeal because it was easy, Mr. Verniero said, and it would be easier to defend than a line-by-line review of the 550-page spending plan. The Governor said no.
At another time, it looked as if extra savings would be gained by raising the number of state job cuts above 5,000. That figure, too, was trimmed, to the final 3,400 figure.
Meanwhile, rumors about state money grabs began to circulate, like the story that the Treasurer had his eye on a dormant $130 million fund held by the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission to maintain its huge, now-closed landfills in the future. The Meadowlands agency quickly issued defensive press releases against the potential grab, and nothing came of it. But Mr. Clymer is not saying never.
"Do you keep public money sitting in an account when there's not an immediate need for it?" he asked, the Treasurer offended by idle cash. "Well, there are a lot of symbolic reasons and aggravation reasons" why he decided it was too much trouble to fight for the money now, "and you end up selling a marina or something for $7 million because it becomes unavoidable."
Conflict also arose within the administration as the budget cutters from the Office of Management and Budget took after numerous small programs, like the $430,000 for the State Commission on Science and Technology, and Ms. Kenny, as keeper of the Governor's agenda, fought to put them back in.
"It's understandable," Ms. Kenny said. "They see a lot of money there. But the Governor is also committed to developing these economic incubator programs."
By mid-November, the once-a-month budget meetings in the Governor's office had increased to two a week, with the Governor combing the print and instructing her staff to separate programs into three categories: a "cut" list of programs that could be reduced, a "look" list of programs that needed more study, and a a "booked" or untouchable list, like the $10 million she wanted for a new juvenile justice program.

HEADLINE: Plan to Spread Pain of Medicaid Cuts Draws Wide but Tempered Criticism

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey's proposal to cut Medicaid embraces a simple strategy: make deep cuts, but share the pain.
Ms. McCaughey has proposed cutting $1.2 billion, or 13 percent, from a Medicaid budget that has doubled since 1989. Advocates for patients say the reductions would force many older people who now receive care at home to move to costly nursing homes. Union officials say the plan would mean layoffs of hospital employees and low-wage nursing home attendants. And hospitals and nursing homes say it might force hospital closings and a decline in patient care, especially at poor institutions that depend heavily on Medicaid payments. 
 The loudest protests came last week from New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which serves mostly Medicaid patients and which estimated that the cuts, along with corresponding reductions it could expect from Federal and city governments, would cost the agency $820 million.
Yet much of the criticism, especially from patient groups, seems tempered because Ms. McCaughey would spread the pain between the institutions that provide care through Medicaid and the people who receive it -- the poor, disabled and elderly. Hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers, which have donated heavily to Republican candidates, including Gov. George E. Pataki, would absorb at least half the cuts.
Certainly, in selling any Medicaid cuts to the public and the Legislature, it could help Mr. Pataki to make the case that the state was trying to be even-handed.
"We understand this is a difficult situation," said Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki. "But given the fact that medical costs have skyrocketed over the last couple of years, it is imperative that we get this under control. Balance is necessary in order to maintain adequate services, and also it's necessary that the burden be shared by the provider."
Mr. Pataki has not said how much of Ms. McCaughey's proposal he will include in his budget, which is due on Wednesday, but hospital executives fear that cuts to health care providers may be even more than she has advocated. All of which raises the question of whether New York will continue its historically high level of health care for the poor.
"Over all, the whole thing is too deep and too drastic," said Anne Erickson, the legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project, an advocacy group that helps Medicaid patients. "Should the providers have been brought to the table? Absolutely. Should we be looking at nursing home profits? Absolutely.
"But you cannot take this much out and still call it a health care system."
Advocates also specifically question whether the state can realistically force 1.5 million more people into managed care by next year, which is what the McCaughey plan calls for, without compromising quality. They argue that the proposal unfairly penalizes hospitals that take on the greatest number of Medicaid patients, like those in New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation. And they criticize a proposed limit on care at home, saying it would send thousands more into nursing homes.
Then there is the question of whether a plan like Ms. McCaughey's can pass the Legislature. She concedes readily that many of the ideas -- for example, some of the provider cuts and the limit on personal care -- had been proposed or developed by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo only to be crushed by lawmakers. (One hospital executive dismissed the proposed cuts to providers as a collection "of old Cuomo chestnuts.")
So far, it remains unclear whether legislative leaders will do for Mr. Pataki what they would not do Mr. Cuomo. Sheldon Silver, the Speaker in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, has already questioned many of the cuts in services for elderly people.
"I don't know why we want to bash the elderly of this state," said Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan.
 
Managed Care
A Big Change, A Modest Savings
 Though the amount of money saved would be relatively small, no aspect of Ms. McCaughey's report would affect the delivery of services more than requiring managed care for most Medicaid recipients. This change is projected to save $76 million in state money next year, out of total state Medicaid spending of $6.4 billion (the total cost of Medicaid in the state next year, including the Federal and local shares, is estimated at more than $20 billion).
The proposal would shift care away from the emergency rooms and hospital clinics that now serve most poor Medicaid recipients to some form of managed care, which seeks to save money by limiting patients' access to doctors and services. Most patients would enroll in health maintenance organizations.
Nearly every other state has some plan for Medicaid managed care, and New York has enrolled more than 400,000 in its own voluntary and more gradual plan, which was created in 1991. But Ms. McCaughey would rapidly pick up the pace, requiring that nearly all poor and some disabled recipients be enrolled by the summer of 1996.
That has prompted the question: Does New York have enough primary-care doctors in practice outside of hospitals to achieve such a rapid changeover, especially in poor inner-city areas or rural areas upstate?
A report prepared last year for Mr. Cuomo questioned whether there were enough doctors and services to accomplish his administration's more modest goal of placing 50 percent of eligible Medicaid recipients in managed care by 1996. And estimates issued under Mr. Cuomo said health maintenance organizations could enroll only 600,000 new patients, which is far fewer than the 1.5 million that would enroll under Ms. McCaughey's plan.
But Ms. McCaughey said health maintenance organizations had assured her that they could meet her goal. The state Departments of Social Services and Health are working on a survey to determine exactly how many doctors and other services would be needed.
 
 
Hospitals and Clinics
At What Cost To the Big Picture?
 About $604 million, or half the cuts in Ms. McCaughey's report, would come from cuts in payments to health care providers. Hospitals would be cut $238 million, nursing homes $234 million and home-care providers $67 million. Beyond that, $42 million would be cut from providers of personal care, which includes nonmedical services like cooking, shopping and housecleaning.
But the cuts to the providers -- which are the state's second-largest employer, after the government itself -- would actually be much larger, because for every $1 the state spends, the Federal Government and the local governments pitch in roughly $3. That would mean the total cut to providers would be $2 billion or more.
Though some health care analysts say the hospital system in New York State should be smaller, hospital and nursing home executives say the impact of the cuts would go beyond expected layoffs and possible closings: They say it could hurt patient care, as well as a state economy that depends heavily on heath care.
But the administration has so far shown only a little sympathy for providers. Despite all the cuts, the report includes $70 million in increased subsidies to the poorest hospitals. Meantime, some hospital executives say they doubt they will be as successful as they have in the past in fending off cuts.
"I think there has been a significant sea change that would make the prognosis here very likely that most, if not all, of these cuts will take place and the health care economy in New York will really go into a tailspin," said Kenneth E. Raske, the director of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
 
Care for the Elderly
Sharp Limits On Home Services
 The part of the proposal that may take the most political heat is Ms. McCaughey's plan for sharp limits on care at home, mostly for the elderly. These programs, put in place in the late 1970's to avoid more expensive nursing home care, have grown so much that personal care now runs at more than $2 billion alone.
Ms. McCaughey's plan would eliminate services like housecleaning and cooking for people who do not need more intensive services like feeding or help going to the toilet. But it would also limit, to 100 hours a month, personal care services for those who need the most help; under a new system, one attendant would travel between several homes during a shift rather than stay with one patient.
The proposal could send to nursing homes an estimated 2,000 people who need so much care at home that it costs more than nursing home care.
Critics say that the cuts could force into nursing homes some people who are almost self-sufficient; for example, a blind person who needed help shopping or cleaning and could quickly become helpless without an aide.
"There can be savings," said Bonnie Stone, the executive director of Selfhelp Community Services, a home care and housing organization based in New York City. "But how you do it is critical. And what we saw in the specific proposals were cruel, they were mean and they are easy targets."
The proposal also calls for a moratorium on building new nursing homes, on the theory that, like jail cells, they will be filled to capacity no matter how many are built. Some critics wonder how the system will take care of those who can no longer stay at home because of the cuts.
"I don't get it," said Cynthia Rudder, the director of the Nursing Home Coalition of New York State. "Where are they going to go?"

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Energy Aid Plan Helps Older Couple Survive a Hard Winter

BYLINE: By ROBERT WADDELL 

 BODY:
When B. Johnson thinks of how cold it was last winter, he shudders from more than the memory of frigid air. Last year, he and his wife faced a financial crisis that could have taken his home and left him penniless.
"My story is not unusual for senior citizens," Mr. Johnson, 72, said recently. "It's a hard thing after working all your life to find yourself in this kind of predicament." The Johnsons live on $1,100 a month, from his Social Security benefits and a small pension. 
 The Johnsons fell behind on their Brooklyn Union Gas bill because of high heating costs. Mr. Johnson kept the house heated warmly for fear that the pipes would freeze and burst. Despite a deferred-payment plan from the gas company, all of the Johnsons' bills seemed to arrive at the same time.
"We had the gas bill, car insurance, insurance on ourselves," said Mr. Johnson. "You get into a position where you start dipping into your retirement savings, borrowing, getting on the credit cards, then you get into a rut where you borrow from Peter to pay Paul."
Making matters worse, Mrs. Johnson was injured in a fall from a ladder, and Mr. Johnson had to undergo prostate surgery. Their health insurance ended with Mr. Johnson's retirement in 1986, and Medicaid would grant benefits only for Mr. Johnson. Forced to use their retirement savings to pay medical bills, the Johnsons had to cut back on necessities.
It wasn't until he applied to the Home Energy Assistance Program, which was established to help people heat their homes, that Mr. Johnson heard of emergency aid he could receive from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The fund's 83d annual appeal began on Thanksgiving Day and will continue through next month. Neediest Cases has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled since 1912, when it was founded by Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times. So far this season, the fund has received more than $3.6 million from thousands of individuals and foundations. All the contributions go directly to the seven charities, which use them to help people like Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.
"They were able to help immensely,' Mr. Johnson said. "The federation helped us get back on our feet."
The emergency aid the Johnsons received helped them stabilize their debt to the gas company. The federation paid the $600 the Johnsons owed, which to them was like the first rays of springtime warmth after a bleak winter.
The Johnsons took out a second mortgage on their Bedford-Stuyvesant home to consolidate their debts. And with their health and financial problems slowly improving, Mr. Johnson breathes a sigh of relief. "I have a clear head when I don't owe anyone," he said. "I have my wife, my house and my health. What else could I ask for?"
But Mr. Johnson still fears the rising cost of living and the possibilities of failing health. "What we need in this country is national health coverage for older people," he said. "If the illness doesn't kill you, the doctor bills and the pharmaceutical bills will."
Mr. Johnson said he would like to work, but thinks no one will hire him because of his age.
"This past year," he said, "I nearly lost everything: my house, my wife, my health. I'm very greatful I didn't cash it all in."

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXIX: Sports of The Times;
When the Pageantry Obscures the Poverty And Social Action

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
THE MOST amazing aspect of extravaganzas like the Super Bowl is the extent to which the pageantry numbs, often obliterates, reality. So many private parties. Dances. Mountains of food. After a week of watching the wealthy and the near-wealthy, the notion of poverty becomes an abstract concept. The subject rarely comes up.
Today's game marks the seventh Super Bowl in Miami, the first since 1989, when a Miami police officer fatally shot a black motorcyclist. Three days of rioting followed during the week leading up to the game. 
 The National Football League was shaken in 1989, but didn't immediately grasp the implication. In 1993, unrest in Los Angeles before Super Bowl XXVII finally got the league's attention. Suddenly it registered with league officials that many of the players came from areas like South Central Los Angeles and the Overtown and Liberty City sections of Miami. They saw the relationship -- if only in a business sense -- between the survival of their product and the urgency of social action.
The N.F.L. returns to Miami with a more realistic, if not expanded, social consciousness. The league recently reached an agreement with the players association that would put $6 million into youth-oriented programs.
On Wednesday, the league announced a commitment of $2 million for its third Youth Education Training facility. The center provides organized athletic activities and also provides computer training as well as tutoring in basic academic skills.
The first center was built three years ago in Los Angeles, the second was committed to last year in Atlanta, although construction has not begun. The newest center will be in Gwen Cherry Park in Liberty City.
Paul Tagliabue, the league's commissioner, said the N.F.L. wants to identify the most effective means of contributing to communities that play host to Super Bowls.
Asked about the N.F.L.'s social responsibility, Tagliabue said: "Having a unique impact with something like Y.E.T centers rather than doling out funds is a key part of our philosophy. We see young people, the mix of education and athletes, as a focal area. The other piece is the concept of partnership -- with the private sector, the public sector and the players."
Should the N.F.L. do more?
Drive through areas in Miami, in Atlanta, in Los Angeles. The answer becomes apparent: There's never enough. The question is how much can you afford to give?
Rather than focusing on the league, the players should step forward and give more, not individually but in a collective sense. At a time when black athletes in professional baseball, football and basketball are rewarded so richly, you'd think they would have a vested interest in a assuming greater social responsibility.
In many cases, the willingness does exist. Individual players say they are interested in doing more. Those who come from places like Overtown know that the difference between making it and not making it is a helping hand and a firm nudge forward.
But the magnitude of the challenge is greater than one individual's ability to solve it. It's amazing that black professional athletes, given all the issues of image and responsibility, have failed to form an association that crosses the boundaries of their sports.
Players' unions act in the best interest of the majority of their members, although much time is taken up with labor issues. Issues specific to African-American and other minority athletes are not a priority.
Minority-group lawyers, doctors, architects and journalists belong not only to professional organizations but also to subgroups that address specialized needs. Minority-group athletes are the only professionals with no such association. Whenever they organize, they will be a powerful group.
H. T. Smith, an attorney in Miami plans to initiate a series of meetings with Heat, Panthers, Dolphins and Marlins players to do just that.
Smith organized the so-called quiet riot, an economic boycott, that began here in July 1990 after the city refused to honor Nelson Mandela, now the South African president, on his release from prison.
The boycott lasted three years, cost the city tens of millions of dollars and ended with a series of economic concessions by the city: $2 million deposited in a black-owned bank, an agreement to pave the way for a black-owned hotel and a commitment to bring blacks into the economic mainstream.
Smith wants to bring black professional athletes into the mainstream, too. Not in piecemeal fashion, but as part of a collective.
The N.F.L. can hold increasingly elaborate functions and no one will be offended. The issue is not the banquet, but the bank.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXIX;
Huizenga's Field, but Minus Dolphins

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a career built on dramatically altering how garbage is hauled and videos are rented, the Miami Dolphins' owner, Wayne Huizenga, had no way to change the course of the field-goal attempt by Pete Stoyanovich with 6 seconds left in Miami's 22-21 divisional playoff loss to San Diego Jan. 8. Huizenga walked from a luxury box to field level at Jack Murphy Stadium, and watched from behind the goal posts as the 48-yard kick faded right.
"It was a big, big disappointment, to be up, 21-6, at halftime and not score another point in the second half," Huizenga said on Thursday. "We didn't deserve to win. Now, we just have to put on our happy face." 
 In a dispiriting irony, Huizenga has had to prepare Joe Robbie Stadium, which he owns, to play host to Sunday's Super Bowl between San Diego and San Francisco.
Two other teams, not Huizenga's Dolphins, had their names painted in the end zones. Two Miami icons, Dan Marino and Don Shula, were better known for their restaurants this week. The Dolphins, in fact, will cease to exist for three and a half hours on Sunday.
"In a split second, it was gone," said Huizenga, the sports world's only three-team owner: the Dolphins, baseball's Florida Marlins and hockey's Florida Panthers.
The end of the Dolphins' season precedes Huizenga's exit in March from Blockbuster Entertainment, which he steered from a chain of 19 video stores to a leviathan of 4,500. His departure is the last major step in Blockbuster's $7.6 billion acquisition by Viacom last September.
No one expected Huizenga to stay, working for Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman. "I said to him, 'If I acquired you, would you expect me to keep you?' " the bald-headed Huizenga said as he sat at a conference-room table in Blockbuster's 11-story headquarters.
Huizenga, who previously built Waste Management into a garbage behemoth, did not want his almost eight-year Blockbuster reign to end. Not when he was shifting into TV and film production. Or as he planned a $1.5 billion theme park near the Everglades that was opposed by environmentalists. Or as the chain had defied marketplace and Wall Street skeptics who suggested that its stores were headed to obsolescence, replaced by home video-on-demand.
Before the deal with Viacom, Forbes estimated his wealth at $700 million; it may be closer to $1 billion because his Blockbuster-turned-Viacom stock is worth about $200 million more.
But in December, Viacom scotched Huizenga's Blockbuster Park, with its planned baseball stadium, hockey arena, golf courses, interactive amusement park, film and TV studios, an office park, hotels and time-share units.
"The handwriting was on the wall," said Huizenga, 57, standing beside an illuminated scale model of the project. "I wanted it. But Viacom has theme parks and film and TV production with Paramount. And $10 billion in debt."
Huizenga still has his teams -- all of them personal investments -- which will be his primary focus until he finds a new industry to enter. He declined to buy the Heat last year. His brother-in-law's attempt to buy a $60 million stake in the team landed in court but the suit was dropped Friday when the majority partners, Lewis Schaffel and Billy Cunningham, were bought out by the Arison family.
Huizenga's ownership of the Marlins and Panthers put him in the middle of hockey and baseball's labor woes. He voted against settling the hockey lockout, arguing for a salary cap or payroll tax.
Losing the theme park hasn't diminished his desire to build a new home for the unprofitable Panthers, who play in the undersized Miami Arena. The Panthers, subtenants to the Heat, get nothing from parking, concessions and souvenirs, Huizenga said. "Maybe the worst lease in sports," he said.
In baseball, he is not about to buck his brethren's plan to field teams with replacement players, as the Orioles' Peter Angelos has. He alternates between conciliation and tough talk. "You don't want to go head to head with your players," he said, but added: "The players struck, we didn't lock them out. And they've gotten nothing out of it."
He cites surveys showing that baseball fans will return to Joe Robbie Stadium, where baseball ticket prices have been cut in half for now. "Sure it's painful to put replacement players out there," he said. "But think of the thousands of other people out of jobs. We have a responsibility to them and our fans."
Huizenga faces uncertainty as the Dolphins' owner. The National Football League prohibits cross-ownership in other sports. His Dolphins shares are in a trust, awaiting league review of its ownership policy. If the league doesn't change its rules or give Huizenga a waiver by June 1996, he'd have to sell.
"That would be a very big blow," he said.
Huizenga has much to admire about N.F.L. ownership, which cost him $138 million. Two-thirds of average team revenues come from television. Recent team sales of the Eagles and the Buccaneers have been for $185 million or more, exceeding the $140 million expansion fees for Jacksonville and Charlotte.
But in baseball, sales of the Padres, the Pirates and the A's have fallen below the $95 million Huizenga paid for the expansion Marlins. "Baseball's economics are so bad," he said. "That alone says something has to be changed."
Huizenga does not admire his Super Bowl economics. Huizenga will get no game revenues, which are all collected by the league. Meanwhile, Huizenga has made $4 million in improvements to his stadium, including planting 750 palm trees. "I had to pay for my tickets in my suite," he said. "No freebies."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
THIS ABSOLUTELY FREE* ARTICLE WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WORLD OF ADVERTISING!**

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Specifically, it is about how asterisks and fine print have become fixtures in advertising, and about the efforts by some to rein them in.
Last week, for example, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena announced that his staff would spend more time scrutinizing airline ads for deceptive or misleading claims. Candidates for tougher regulation, he said, include promotions of one-way fares that require travelers to buy a return ticket, and sales that make only a few seats available at the discounted price. 
 New York State legislators also passed a law last year requiring car-leasing companies to more fully disclose terms that add to the total cost of leases, like high charges for excessive wear and tear.
But asterisks and their accompanying restrictions remain popular gimmicks. In fact . . .
* Special offer available only to qualified readers who have already paid for the paper.
** Due to space constraints, this article actually has a more narrow focus.
 
EVER ADVERTISER IN THE WORLD IS USING THEM!***
 A recent Amtrak ad lists five fares to cities from New York. Four of them are simple one-way fares, but the fifth -- follow that asterisk -- is based on a round-trip purchase. "Other restrictions may apply," the fine print adds.
Car companies trumpet low monthly leases with no down payments, as in a recent ad for Infiniti. But the small type noted twice that dealers set actual prices.
Cellular phones are sometimes advertised for $1 or even less, but require a hefty fee to activate the phone number. Long-distance phone companies serve up a baffling array of discount calling plans while they raise base rates for customers too time-starved to wade through the Byzantine terms of the special deals.
Fine print is also no longer only the domain of disclaimers written in legalese, like this passage buried in a recent Hotel Intercontinental ad: "Number of attendees cannot exceed 120 percent of group room block."
Now, advertising copy writers have seized the space. Along the bottom of a recent Tower Air ad in tiny letters: "Hello. You're reading the part of the ad where you usually see all the restrictions you have to meet to get the low fare. But this is Tower Air. There are no restrictions. So, congratulations on your good vision and your eagle-eyed appraisal of all the ads you read for the small print."
Jack Trout, a marketing consultant in Greenwich, Conn., said companies began following the airlines' lead during the last recession. Marketers began enlisting the help of their colleagues in finance to structure clever deals.
"It's what I call marketing slipping and sliding," Mr. Trout said. "Businesses want to attract people to buy their products, but they also want to find a way to not exactly give it to them at those prices."
*** Well, not quite. But a quick skim of the ads in just about any newspaper yields plenty of examples.
 
THERE IS A TIDAL WAVE OF OPPOSITION AGAINST THE TREND!****
 Continental Airlines, for example, has blared the bold-print phrase "NO RESTRICTIONS" in ads for its Continental Lite service. And Saturn, the car company, has played up its no-haggle, no fine-print pricing policy.
Even so, Mr. Trout said that restrictions on prices as a marketing tool are probably here to stay.
"It's hard to stamp out the fine print," he said. "Somebody is always going to try to put a deal together."
**** Maybe a ripple is more accurate. State and federal regulators aside, some marketers have touted simplified prices as a way to separate themselves from the pack.

HEADLINE: States of Mind;
You Say You Want a Devolution

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FOR Newt Gingrich and the band around him, his words are words to live by: "We are committed to getting power back to the states, we are committed to breaking out of the logjam of Federal bureaucrats controlling how we try to help the poor, and we believe you can trust the 50 states and the 50 state legislatures to work together on behalf of the citizens of their states."
It is not government itself that is the enemy, the Speaker and his friends believe; it is central government, national government, Federal Government; if most power devolved back to the states, our problems would end. 
 Their favorite piece of the Constitution is the 10th Amendment, which provides that "The powers not delegated to the states by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." Classic small-government, Jeffersonian stuff, quite at odds with the Hamiltonian dictum that Congress should provide for "the general welfare."
So on Friday the new ruling class on Capitol Hill pushed through a bill that would make it much harder for Congress to issue instructions to state and local governments without providing the money to pay for them. The Republicans would like to give the states much more responsibility for welfare, hoping that other governors will emulate Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and come up with fresh ideas.
Representative Scott Klug, a Wisconsin Republican, would do away with the kind of Federal regulations that condition Federal funds on the states' pushing the legal drinking age to 21, setting speed limits no higher than 65 and requiring the wearing of seat belts in cars and helmets on motorcycles. And his party would also like to import ideas from the state capitols to Washington, such as balanced budget laws.
 
Democracy's Labs?
 But what, one feels compelled to ask, gives the states a special connection to the people, in an era when airlines and interstate highways mean that most Americans cross state borders without thinking about it, whether to pursue their careers or to take a vacation? Are states necessarily wiser? More efficient? More frugal?
"The states," said Gov. Christine Whitman of New Jersey in response to the State of the Union message last week, "are the laboratories of democracy."
In the early days of the nation, states made some kind of geopolitical sense. Virginia was different from Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania was different from Rhode Island. There were obvious regional similarities (South Carolina and Georgia, for example), and there were intrastate tensions (western North Carolina decided to call itself the State of Franklin for awhile), but by and large, each state did represent a kind of community, with shared interests and values.
That is much less true today. Brooklyn and rural Western New York share little beyond the Government, a currency and (up to a point) a language. The suburbs of Atlanta and the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are more similar than downtown Atlanta and suburban Cobb County. Surely it is difficult to say how California clings together, culturally or economically.
States are undeniably smaller than the nation as a whole, and therefore more flexible. Changing policy in Indiana is easier, at least theoretically, than changing it in D.C. There are innovative states (New York, California) and stick-in-the-muds (Texas, Ohio). Some state governments are close to the people, such as Vermont's where there are almost enough legislative seats for everyone, and others are not, such as Arkansas's, about whose traditions of cronyism the nation has learned so much.
But talk shows, faxes, C-Span and CNN mean that most people know a lot more about what goes on in Washington than they used to, and Washington knows more about what they think. What happens in Albany or in Jefferson City, Mo., is still more hidden from public view.
Heretical as it may sound, the Federal Government, for all its failings, attracts far more talented people than most state governments, in both elective and appointive offices. There are obvious exceptions, but most are in the big states -- people like Willie L. Brown Jr., the once and future Assembly Speaker in California, and William Weld, the brainy Republican Governor of Massachusetts.
States don't run deficits, it's true. But many would if they could. They are prevented from doing so by their constitutions, a fact that says more about the drafters of those documents than about the wisdom of modern officialdom.
Americans have always been nervous about lodging too much faith in the central government; the colonists' experiences with the English Crown set a pattern. However, the failure of the Articles of Confederation convinced them that they needed something stronger, and in the Constitution they gave the central government substantial if carefully delineated powers, such as the right to raise money.
For the Republic's first 150 years, state government maintained the predominant role, except in time of war, but the onset of the Great Depression and the New Deal that was designed to combat it, radically altered the balance. For three decades, Washington ran things, largely unchallenged by state capitals.
Largely, but not wholly. In the South, states' rights were put forward as justification for a system of apartheid that denied basic rights to black people. Strom Thurmond, now a Republican Senator, then a Democratic Governor, ran for President in 1948 as the candidate of the States Rights Party. Memories of segregation -- and of Ross Barnett in Mississippi or George Wallace in Alabama confronting the Federal Government over it -- are one reason most liberals cock a wary eye at the idea of devolving power to the states. "States' rights," for them, is encoded racism.
Since the high-water mark of Federal activism, which might be dated to the Voting Rights Act of 1964, the tide has been flowing the other way, slowly at first and now with a rush.
Richard M. Nixon's revenue-sharing program was one early effort. Increasingly, the states became regional franchises of the Federal Government. While ministering to their usual concerns like roads and insurance, and inheriting some, like education, from local governments, state governments had to play mid-level manager for programs like Medicaid.
"The current era," wrote Alice M. Rivlin, now head of the Office of Management and Budget, in her 1992 book, "Reviving the American Dream," "has been called a period of 'competitive Federalism,' meaning the Federal Government and states are competing with each other for leadership in domestic policy."
 
Clinton's Boast
 President Clinton has joined the states' cheerleaders, even though it was his party that beefed up the Federal Government in the first place. He boasted in his State of the Union speech Tuesday that "our Administration gave two dozen states the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems."
Yet the truth is that for all of the talk of decentralization, neither the liberals nor the conservatives wholly trust the states at least not all of them. Welfare reform is a perfect example. Conservatives are worried about giving all the responsibility to the states because they are afraid some won't reform at all. Liberals are worried that some states will reform the system out of existence.
There are other problems, too. In unbridled competition between the states, for example, what would prevent some states from cutting services and taxes to the bone to lure businesses, forcing others to do likewise and creating a downward spiral?
Which takes us right back to colonial days. The Founding Fathers were a committee, after all, and they could never quite resolve the question of how much had to be mandated from the center and how much could safely, from the perspective of the commonweal, be left to the tender mercies of the Federal States. A tough call then, a tough call now.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 1995, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about efforts to put more power in the hands of states, rather than the Federal Government, rendered the 10th Amendment to the Constitution incorrectly. It states: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." The article also misstated the date of the passage of the Voting Rights Act. It was 1965, not 1964.

NATURE THURSDAYS 
A Young Explorers program for children 4 through 6 will begin on Thursday from 1:30 to 2:30 P.M. and continue for two subsequent Thursdays at the Trailside Nature Museum in Cross River.
 Brenda Freeman-Bates, a naturalist at the museum, will take her charges on nature walks, tell stories and supervise craft sessions and games, all keyed to the theme of wildlife. Animal bones, rocks and fossils will be examined, and the children will have an opportunity to tap maple trees and boil the sap into syrup.
 The fee is $ 15 for the three days, and the program will vary each day. To obtain more information or to register, call 763-3993. The museum is operated by the Westchester County Parks, Recreation and Conservation Department.
ART OF 3 BOWENS
 Three members of the Bowen family will exhibit their art at the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack beginning Saturday and continuing on weekends only through Feb. 26. A reception will be held next Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.
 Eric Bowen's abstract paintings have been shown in 35 solo shows in the United States, Italy, Scandinavia and India, where he was born.
 Indian mysticism permeates his work, softening his abstractions with personalized color and texture and intensifying his preoccupation with the cause of world peace. Working in rectangles within rectangles, his paintings have sometimes been likened to shrines. He will give a gallery talk on Feb. 12 at 2 P.M.
 His wife, Mette, is a native of Norway, where she was a textile designer before turning to clay sculpture, the medium that she will be exhibiting in Nyack. His sister, Dr. Mavis Bowen, was educated in Delhi and at Columbia University. She became an artist after an auto accident in 1975, which precluded continuing her work as a traveling community health specialist and social psychiatrist. Her work in that field earned her a listing in the World Who's Who of Women. She will be showing still lifes.
 The center, at 82 North Broadway, is open on Fridays from 5 to 8 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. Call 358-0774 for more information.
INDUSTRIAL SKILLS
 The days when artists were confined to painting at easels, or on walls and ceilings, and sculptors worked in studios, have long been over, and Mary Ann Lomonaco, artist in residence at the Rye Art Center, is a prime example of the new breed. She knows no bounds when seeking ways to express herself.
 In learning how to work with steel, aluminum, kitchen mops and other materials, she has spent many days in the company of auto mechanics, furniture makers, hardware store owners, pizza-oven manufacturers, recycling center employees and dealers in electrical wiring, among others. The results are eminently original, smooth, sophisticated and frequently amusing.
An exhibition of her work opens tomorrow and will remain through March 25, with a reception scheduled next Sunday from 4 to 6 P.M. The center is at 51 Milton Road, and visiting hours are Mondays through Fridays from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 1:30 to 5 P.M., Saturdays from 1 to 4 P.M. For more information, call 967-0700.
MORNING POLITICS
 Reservations must be made by Wednesday for the yearly New York State Legislators Breakfast organized by the Westchester County Association on Friday at 8 A.M. at the Tarrytown Hilton Inn on Route 9.
 All five Senators and eight Members of the Assembly for Westchester County will attend and talk about the state's $ 5 billion budget gap for 1995-96, Medicaid reform, state aid, the Clean Air Act, Gross Receipts Tax, economic prospects and incentives for the county and the restructuring of state government under the new administration.
 Some of the issues raised by Gov. George E. Pataki that will draw criticism from some and approbation from others are restoration of the death penalty, reduction of income taxes, welfare reform, privatization of some government services and term limits for elected officials.
 Seating is on a first-come-first-served basis, and the fee is $ 45 for nonmembers of the association. Questions for the legislators will be accepted with breakfast reservations. Call 948-6444.
TOMMY DORSEY'S BAND
 Tommy Dorsey's Orchestra keeps going, and going, and going -- testimony to the bandleader's posthumous popularity. A rigorous set of rules has been laid down for purchasing tickets to the orchestra's concert and dance scheduled March 25 in the Willcox Hall Gymnasium of Pace University in White Plains.
 They go on sale Wednesday and must be purchased by check or in person. No credit cards and no reserved seating. Checks for $ 14a person, $ 12 for students and people 62 and older may be mailed to Pace University, Elm Road, Dow Hall, Briarcliff, N.Y., 10510. They must be payable to Pace University's Performing Arts Series.
 To purchase tickets in person, an appointment must be made at the Performing Arts Department Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Call 923-2653 during those hours.
MORE PEEKSKILL ART
 The newest addition to Peekskill's growing list of downtown art emporiums is the Westchester Art Workshop's Peekskill Gallery at 27 North Division Street, the first and only branch of the original venue at the County Center in White Plains. A continuation of last fall's County Center exhibition may be seen in Peekskill through Feb. 17. A closing reception will be held on Feb. 16 from 6:30 to 8:30 P.M.
 Titled "Take Three: Digital Cannibals II," it features the work of Steve Bradley, Dale Leifeste and D. Dominick Lombardi, artists who work separately and jointly on computers.
 The exhibition explores art-cum-communication on a personal-to-global scale, using video, sound, digital photography, painting, mixed media, sculpture and interconnecting with other cultures by means of a fax component.
 Hours at the workshop are Mondays through Thursdays from 10 A.M. to 8:30 P.M., Fridays from 9:30 A.M. to 3:45 P.M., and Saturdays from 9:30 A.M. to 12:45 P.M. The gallery phone number is 734-4682.
LOBS AND LIFE
 There are people who have attended Bob Litwin's "Focused Game Method" seminars who will never lob a fuzzy white ball over a net but who consider tennis "a metaphor for life" and so find Mr. Litwin's talks uplifting.
 The two-time United States professional Tennis Association Player of the Year and National Champion will conduct one of his seminars on Saturday at 7 P.M. at the Armonk Tennis Club. A $ 45 advance registration fee is required and may be obtained, along with special group, team and family rates, by calling 273-8124.
 Mr. Litwin's premise is that working on any game, not only tennis, improves basic skills, technique and strategy and develops the ability to focus mind and emotions on the matter at hand. His five-step approach to upgrading performance is said by fans to be of great value in business and life as well as in sports.
LOFT'S WINTER DANCE
 The Loft's yearly winter dance will be held Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Jewish Community Center of White Plains at 255 Soundview Avenue. There will be a traditional room for dancing to the tunes spun by the disk jockey John Martin and a second room with a piano bar featuring Jim Allen. Beer and wine will be served, and free nonalcoholic beverages will be supplied to designated drivers. Admission will be $ 15, or $ 10 for members.
 The Loft, in White Plains, is a nonprofit lesbian and gay community services center, serving the Lower Hudson Valley. For more information, call 948-4922. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Travel Agencies Try the Personal Touch

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
BUYING travel today is a cinch. "In a matter of minutes, anyone plugged into the information superhighway can find the lowest air fare to anywhere and buy a ticket," said Norman S. Sherman, vice president of the Hudson Valley chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents, an industry group made up of 124 agencies. "And this has caused vast changes in the industry."
Especially among travel agencies, he emphasized, adding that only those agencies that are well-equipped to give clients personal, professional service are likely to thrive. 
 "In the new electronic world the travel agent today has to be a truly knowledgeable expert in order to survive," Mr. Sherman said. "For example, 60 new agencies in the Westchester-Mid-Hudson region were started last year, and that includes those who have new owners and those that were started from scratch, but half of them went under in less than a year mainly because their owners were people with no expertise who were attracted by what they perceived to be a glamorous business."
Mr. Sherman has first-hand knowledge. "Two years ago, after 40 successful years in the industry, my wife, Vera, and I sold our agency, Suburban Travel Center in Larchmont," he said. "One year later, what had been a $3 million business was closed. But thankfully, as part of our pre-sale agreement, we were able to take back our name, our telephone number and our accounts. Our commercial accounts are now with Rich Worldwide Travel in Harrison, a specialist in corporate accounts. And Mrs. Sherman is handling leisure travel for our old clients, who are coming back."
The new Suburban Travel office, on the second floor of a building next to their former street-level office in a small Larchmont shopping center, illustrates what Mr. Sherman says is a trend in the industry.
"Being removed from street level, we are not seeking walk-in trade," he said. "Unfortunately, it is not economically feasible to spend an hour or so discussing travel options with someone who may or may not be serious. We decided to spend the time giving more service to the good clients we already have."
And service was foremost in the minds of Patricia and Robert Watson when they established their travel agency, Watson & Watson in Scarsdale, 10 years ago.
"Our philosophy was that as in real estate, where the word for success is location, location, location, in the travel industry the word should be service, service and more service," said Mr. Watson, who formerly headed a commercial real estate concern in Manhattan.
"In defining our market, we decided to take the rifle approach, not going after the walk-in trade, but well-traveled and knowledgeable clients," Mr. Watson said. "That was because we were motivated to fill what we as consumers believed was a void in the industry. We had traveled extensively, and we thought there was a need for an agency devoted to providing custom travel services for people like us."
Financing this start-up agency with their own capital, the Watsons opened a small second-floor office in Scarsdale. "We soon learned that the travel business is not easy," Mr. Watson said. "What it was was the two of us doing everything, including hand writing all the tickets. But we worked assiduously to establish good relationships with vendors, the airlines, hotels and cruise lines. Coming from real estate, where the dollar volume of a transaction is normally in the five- or six-figure range, the commissions in the travel agency seemed minuscule. I remember thinking, I have never worked harder in my life for so little. And the first year we had a negative cash flow, but by the end of the third year, we were in the black and able to take salaries for the first time."
Two years ago, the Watsons moved into a larger office and increased their staff to eight in response to the increase in business. Their client list grew primarily through word-of-mouth recommendations, Mr. Watson said. "People appreciated the type of service we deliver," he explained. "It's extremely personal. And in order to give personal service you have to be a good listener. My wife, Pat, is especially good at hearing people correctly. And that way we get to know our clients, their likes and dislikes. And because we travel constantly ourselves, we can give them updated, on-the-spot information."
The Watsons, he said, deliberately choose destinations they believe their clients are interested in.
"Our clients are well-traveled people who like the offbeat and the exotic," he said. "We have been down the Amazon, and this month we went to Antarctica. When we are on trips, we don't announce that we are travel agents because in that way we see things as they really are."
The majority of the Watsons' clients, more than 1,000 of them, are leisure travelers. But Mr. Watson said the agency had acquired a number of corporate accounts that came to it as the result of arranging a vacation for the company's chairman or president.
"We are also getting some second-generation clients, for instance, honeymooners who are sons and daughters of clients," he said. "Repeat business is the lifeblood of this industry."
Mr. Sherman added, however, that the cost of giving clients service comes high. He said that for years the industry has been debating the question of whether or not to charge customers for service.
"It's a very sensitive subject," he said. "For good customers, I know that we will never impose a service charge nor would most agencies. But when people come in and take a lot of time asking for information, a service fee may be a future option."
And despite an increase in leisure travel this season, Mr. Sherman said, the average travel agent is not earning any more money.
"There is a lot of wasted motion in the business today," he said. "An agent, for example, will issue a ticket to a client going to Florida, and the next day the airline drops the price. What happens is the agent is obliged to rewrite the ticket. Fares have become a nightmare."
Fares on cruise ships, though, are an exception, Mr. Sherman said, adding: "Cruises are a best buy in travel. What happened is that so many cruise ships came on line at the end of the 80's, which coincided with the height of the recession, that there is an oversupply. Even the best ships are offering heavy discounts."
An agency that specializes in charter and theme cruises is Custom Cruises of Mamaroneck. Angela Sculti, the president, said: "Our business is very good. Values are terrific. There is literally a cruise for everyone."
As people become more sophisticated about travel, Ms. Sculti said, cruise lines have begun to provide a variety of special-interest cruises. "By offering the right product to the right client, they have carved out a big new niche in the travel industry," she said. "There are literary cruises with discussion groups and lecturers, historical cruises with college professors, health and fitness cruises, and we designed a 'Fun and Fitness at Sea' three-day Bahamas cruise aboard Carnival Cruise Line's Ecstasy in conjunction with Prevention magazine that features spa, cuisine and a package of health and fitness programs. Two hundred and fifty people signed up for it."
Among future theme cruises, Ms. Sculti said, are a country-western cruise in April on Norweigan Cruise Lines' Norway and a cigar-lovers cruise on Holland America Line's Ryndam. "That is scheduled for November and already interest is high," Ms. Sculti said. "It includes a very interesting land itinerary."

HEADLINE: Catastrophe? It Can't Possibly Happen Here

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
YOU would think that with the horrific rash of catastrophes -- devastating earthquakes in Kobe, Japan, and in Los Angeles, just to name two -- most companies would be signing up for disaster contingency plans.
But despite recent scenes of devastation straight out of a World War II newsreel, the big temblor in Kobe is expected to add only 5 percent to the growth of the disaster recovery business. 
 Management remains cavalier about emergency plans, says Wilson Haddow, an industry analyst for Input, a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif., the same way some homeowners don't buy property insurance. "It's human nature to think it won't happen to me."
"There are a lot of risk takers out there," contends John E. Nevola, manager of the International Business Machines' disaster recovery service, an industry leader. Fewer than 10 percent of an estimated 300,000 companies in North America that rely on computers for manufacturing or customer services buy this type of business insurance. "The rest are in some stage of denial."
In fact, disaster recovery planning amounts to less than 1 percent of the $152 billion spent last year on software and services, says Mr. Haddow.
About 60 percent of the companies that do have contingency plans are financial services companies, which are required by law to carry such insurance. Federal regulators began requiring banks to assess their vulnerability to disruptions in 1984, and only since 1986 have Federally insured institutions been required to develop and test disaster recovery plans. The same rules were applied the next year to companies making money transfers electronically. Today, medical-support companies -- which provide such data as patient records and billing to hospitals -- are the disaster-recovery industry's second-fastest-growing sector.
Disaster recovery specialists generally help banks and other businesses cope with man-made mishaps like an ammonia spill or a fire. More than 80 percent of business disasters are man-made.
The industry's three leaders -- Comdisco, Sungard Recovery Services and I.B.M. -- account for 65 percent of the $850 million domestic disaster recovery business, says Mr. Haddow. Hardware makers like the Hewlett Packard Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation account for most of the rest. It is, of course, not surprising that major computer companies are big players in this industry. I.B.M. has been offering disaster recovery services to its customers since the late 1960's.
The cost for a small business with a network of 25 computer stations can be as little as $1,000 a month, which will, in the event of a calamity, pay for desk space and the use of a mid-range computer and 25 terminals and a phone system at a recovery site. Fees can exceed $100,000 a month for a big computer user that needs its data continuously mirrored at a remote location; in the event of an emergency the company can shift to a backup computer source at the flip of a switch. The service is becoming cheaper as prices for computers continue to fall, says Michael Tobin, Comdisco's vice president for marketing development.

ONCE upon a time, a disaster recovery service would provide a client whose facilities have been destroyed with backup mainframe computers and tape storage at a secure "hot site." Nowadays, disaster-proofing services will provide construction crews and employee relocation strategies.
Driving the change is the proliferation of computer technology, which puts even the smallest business -- from an equipment leasing company to a law office -- at risk because of its reliance on information that cannot be reproduced by hand.
"A stricken business lacking contingency planning has an excellent chance of dying," says Frederick B. Joy, a research analyst for META Group, a market research company in Stamford, Conn.
Although many companies seem unwilling to adopt disaster recovery protection, the recovery industry's growth is being fueled by the fall in computer prices. During the recent recession, many large companies shrank their global computing centers to fewer sites. They also distributed networks of desk-top machines in far-flung locations.
Computer networks make disaster recovery planning more complex, says Michael F. Mulholland, president of Sungard. Companies with critical networks -- like a catalogue company's order-fulfillment line -- need multiple contingency plans, he adds.
Computer minitiaturization has also added a new twist. Previously, recovery centers fell into two categories. "Cold sites" were empty rooms where computers can be shipped when the need arises. "Hot sites" are equipped with an array of powerful mainframe computers and telecommunications equipment. These days, a powerful mid-range system, which does not require the controlled environment of a mainframe, can be rolled to the doorstep of a destroyed business.
Sungard, for example, has a fleet of a dozen 18-wheel trucks. After the Northridge quake, it dispatched a rolling computer center to its client, the North Los Angeles County Regional Center, situated four miles east of the quake's epicenter. The agency provides job and welfare assistance to 7,200 developmentally disabled people, but cracked support beams made the building unsafe for agency staff.
Four days after the quake, from a data center in a parking lot, the agency turned out 2,800 checks worth $1.3 million to local caregivers. They were one day late.
"I wouldn't have had the same cooperation from employees if I had told them they had to go to Santa Ana," says Robert J. Michael, the center's information systems manager, referring to the location of Sungard's nearest hot site.
Some companies devise internal recovery plans that relocate workers to unaffected satellite offices or set up reciprocal arrangements with other companies. There could be drawbacks to such plans, says William Buscaglia, whose New York Design Collaborative has mapped corporate emergency strategies for more than a decade.
THE alternate site might not have enough parking space or, in a high rise, enough fresh air. Air flow in sealed high rises is set for a specific occupancy level. Without a secondary air source, overheating can create health problems for doubled-up workers, he says.

downs. First in Chicago in 1992 after an underground tunnel flood and then in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1993. Harrison T. Tempest, the company's chairman, then realized that his 9,000 employees needed a backup plan every bit as much as the company's data center.
Last year, A.B.N. Amro began a thorough risk analysis, says John H. Collins, the executive vice president. It placed a price tag on each department, with the tally reflecting the cost of its going dark for three days, and also devised a relocation strategy for emergencies.
A typical recovery plan calls for a business to ship its computer data to a center distant enough to keep clear of whatever regional mayhem has affected its offices. "The flaw is that the information is not instantaneous or always up to date," says Mr. Nevola of I.B.M.
At I.B.M.'s hot site in Gaithersburg, Md. -- I.B.M. has 17 such sites worldwide -- there is enough horsepower to allow real time backup for some of the largest computer users. Among the clients, says Mr. Nevola, is a utility company that has an emergency system for dispatching crews, monitoring repairs and power sources.
I.B.M. entered the disaster recovery business in 1989 at the urging of its customers. Big Blue's vast resources have helped redefine the industry's boundaries. For Synergistics Systems -- a hospital billing company and an I.B.M. disaster recovery client near Northridge -- Big Blue rebuilt its data center as well as its ceiling, roof and walls.
"Customers who need that service are afraid of unscrupulous contractors," says Mr. Nevola. "Business recovery is more than just providing equipment. It demands consulting, education, risk management, anti-virus and network management."
For its part, Texas Instruments, the Dallas-based company, discovered how disaster planning and a little luck averted millions of dollars in lost sales after the Kobe quake.
In a masterful display of high-tech hot-wiring, a team of Texas Instruments' technical experts restored one of the company's primary sources of computer memory chips only a week after the quake struck. The 400 employees of Texas Instruments' Kobe plant -- a joint venture with Kobe Steel -- resumed production last Tuesday.
The seven-member rescue team was drawn from Dallas and a manufacturing site in Taipei. Their target, the stilled plant controlled by Kobe Steel's damaged computer center, had no disaster backup. Fortunately, Texas Instrument does. It relies on I.B.M. to provide hot site backup for its four global computer centers, one of which is in Mijo, 300 miles from Kobe. The rescue team drew on a computer recovery script for Texas Instruments own computer centers, one that had taken months to refine.
Working from 2,500 backup computer tapes retrieved from the ruined Kobe Steel data center, the team rewrote the script and restored the plant's manufacturing specifications on a spare Mijo mainframe. The Mijo mainframe, in good working order, had been unplugged only four weeks before when a newer model had been installed.

HEADLINE: Nordstrom Looking for 800 to Fill Jobs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
EIGHT HUNDRED jobs, available to Westchester residents, have become available. The employer is Nordstrom, which plans to fill the 800 positions locally for its new store in the Westchester Mall in White Plains. The store is to open on March 17.
"At Nordstrom we feel it is important to support the communities in which our stores are located by recruiting locally as much as possible," said Cody Kondo, Nordstrom vice president and general manager for the Northeast region. "We are looking for goal-oriented people with a 'can do' attitude to be part of the Nordstrom team." 
 The company, Mr. Kondo said, believes strongly in a "promote from within" philosophy and plans to fill management positions from the ranks of its stores in the Northeast.
Nordstrom, one of the country's leading fashion-specialty retailers, has 77 stores in 14 states, 3 in the Northeast. The Westchester store of 225,000 square feet will be the company's first in New York State.
Mayor Sy Schulman of White Plains, said: "I think Nordstrom will give the local economy a welcome shot in the arm. They are a very service-oriented company who believe personal contact is important. They encourage their employees to be entrepreneurial and move ahead and give them the opportunity to do so. What's more, they will be paying taxes, buying supplies and goods here, which will benefit even a larger part of the county."
The Nordstrom Westchester store is holding a series of employment fairs. An informational seminar and interviews for sales positions will be held from Feb. 6 through Feb. 11 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, 66 Hale Avenue in White Plains. The employment fair is open to the public. For information, prospective applicants can call Nordstrom's employment service line, (800) 899-8966.
"Those attending will have an opportunity to learn about career paths, company benefits and policies and position openings," Mr. Kondo said. "Representatives from our personnel and human resources offices will be on hand to give out applications, meet applicants and answer questions."
Nordstrom, he reported, was named in the book "The 100 Best Companies to Work For in America in 1993" by Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz. PENNY SINGER

HEADLINE: Once-Booming Horse-Breeding Industry Falls on Hard Times

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
NEW tax laws and tougher breeding restrictions have forced many horse breeders out of the business in the last decade, leaving few horse farms on the Island.
In recent years, a difficult economy, along with rising property taxes and increased farm expenses, have added to the gloom. 
 Today, with looser requirements on what is classified as a New York-bred horse, the New York thoroughbred breeders are trying to take charge of their destiny.
By showcasing New York horses and obtaining money to encourage New York breeding, they hope to revitalize the industry, which on Long Island dates from more than 100 years ago.
The Long Island representative for the New York State Breeding and Development Fund, George Carey, said the focus of the business had changed from quantity to quality. Today most people are looking for horses with either proven records or proven bloodlines, he said.
Since the 1980's, when horse farms thrived on the Island, most of the larger farms have slimmed down. The Entenmann family, which sold its bakery business in 1980, owned two of the largest, the Big E in Jamesport and Timber Bay in Old Westbury. But the family has sold much of the land from each farm.
Although the two farms remain active, they operate on a much smaller scale than a decade ago.
"The horse industry has coincided with the economy," Mr. Carey said. "Coming off the highs of the 80's, it backed off in the early 90's. And now we're seeing a stabilization."
Many breeders have left Long Island because of high property taxes and increasing labor costs, according to the president of the New York Thoroughbred Breeders, Dr. Douglas Koch.
"Breeding is an expensive business," said Dr. Koch, a veterinarian. "But a horse is a fixed cost. It doesn't cost any more in New York than in Kentucky. It's property taxes and labor that are the two factors making it so difficult to have breeding operations on Long Island. That's why most breeding is done in the Hudson Valley, the Genesee Valley and the Saratoga region, where the cost of land is much lower."
The Big E, on 130 acres in Jamesport, has scaled down, from 150 to 200 horses in the mid-80's to an average of 35 to 40, the manager, Jeffrey Raine, said. The farm, once a public breeding and boarding business, is now private, breeding horses exclusively for the Entenmann stable.
At the Manor, a 50-acre farm in Manorville, the number of horses has also decreased significantly, to 40 horses, said the farm veterinarian, Dr. Jud Butler.
"It's a tough business," Dr. Butler said. "When the economy is down one of the first things to suffer is the horse business, because it's a luxury, and it can be very expensive to breed horses. People used to be able to deduct their expenses. But they can't do that anymore, which makes it an even tougher business. Over the last few years I've seen many horse farms go out of business."
In Nassau County, Penmor Farm, on 88 acres in Muttontown, had 140 horses at its peak in the early 80's, the manager, Sharon McCaig, said. Today the farm has 20. Ms. McCaig saidthat the owner, Moreton Binn, had moved most of the horses to Kentucky, Florida and France.
"There are few good stallions left in New York," she said. "Most breeders have gone to Kentucky, where there are the best stallions, the best grass, and where it's more economical to farm them because land and labor are less expensive."
On 28 acres in Upper Brookville, the Pinebournefarm is one of the few horse farms remaining active in Nassau. It has 31 horses, including 6 mares in foal.
Frank Nastasi, who owns the farm with his wife, Denise, said many people had left the business because land values had risen so much that selling the farms for subdivision and development was more profitable than raising horses.
Horse farms require about two acres a horse, to rotate paddocks and prevent grass from dying, Mr. Nastasi said. Raising a horse cost $15,000 to $20,000 a year, he said. After a horse goes to a trainer, he said, the sum soars, to $30,000 or $40,000.
"When they named horse racing the Sport of Kings, they were right," he said. "Unfortunately, too many people who got into the industry were more interested in making money than in careful breeding, and they turned the industry into a disaster."
Traditionally, one-year-old thoroughbreds, known as yearlings, are broken and start training in the fall. They remain on the farm until the spring of their second year when they go to the track.
Long Island horses usually start racing at the tracks of the New York Racing Association, which are Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga. Among the best-known Long Island horses are Bold Reason from the Gold Mills Farm, now known as Samantha Farm, and Twixt, who was farmed at Timber Bay.
Troubles in the horse-breeding industry also affected the polo-horse farms, said Allyn Ehrlich, president of Polo International Farms, which has 10 polo horses on a farm in Glen Head. Horses raised for polo are often thoroughbreds that have been rejected for racing, he said, adding:
"We're dependent on the horse breeders. When the horse-breeding industry suffers, there is a smaller field for us to choose from. And at the same time this raises our prices."
The decline of the industry stems from changes in tax laws. According to Andrew Tarquinio, senior tax manager in the Grant Thornton office in Melville, the Federal Government in 1977 said a breeder had to show a profit for two out of seven years to deduct any losses. Any less frequent profit would be a hobby loss.
The tax law of 1986 included other provisions that also hurt investors, Mr. Tarquinio added. Passive Loss Rules suspended deductions on any losses for an investor who was a passive member of a partnership, until the horse or the interest in the partnership was sold.
Another provision eliminated the deduction of preproductive expenses, or breeding expenses before a horse could provide income. The tax law of 1988 reversed that, but it still hurt the horse business, Mr. Tarquinio said.
Restrictions on breeders also hurt, said Dr. Koch. In the late 70's, New York started a statewide program to encourage the use of undeveloped land for horse farming. The state offered incentives to breeders.
The Breeding and Development Fund, created in 1973, sponsored state-registered races at Belmont and Aqueduct with larger purses for New York-bred horses. It also started a subsidy program for breeders who raced and won at local tracks.
But a mandatory breed-back law required breeders to use just New York sires in order to qualify. Dr. Koch said that was a drawback, because the best stallions were in Kentucky.
The state reversed the law in July, qualifying horses as New York bred based on breeding back or the residency of the mare. That allows horses to leave the state to be bred, as long as their residence remains here, adding flexibility for the breeder, Dr. Koch said.
"People are hoping that this relaxation of restrictions will bring breeding back to New York," he said. "This is the first breeding season that will be affected by the reversal. So it's too early to tell what the impact will be. But we've already seen signs of more mares' coming to New York and this is renewed hope for New York breeders."
Dr. Koch added that to stimulate the industry, the New York Thoroughbred Breeders created a New York Showcase Day at Belmont State Park and showcases New York bred horses. The breeders also are working to increase financing for the Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund, to make it more attractive to breed New York thoroughbreds, and working with the New York Racing Association to increase attendance.
"If we can get New York racing on the right track," he said, "that will help the breeding program."
There has been recent evidence of a turnaround in the market, Mr. Raine said, adding:
"Prices are up on the sales of horses, which is a good sign. Allowing New York breeders to breed with stallions in Kentucky and raise the horses here will improve the quality of New York breeding, and hopefully, will revitalize the industry. But it will probably be two to three years before we'll see the fruits of the labor."
"Getting Kentucky blood means a lot to the New York breeding program," Ms. McCaig added. "It won't happen overnight, but we horse people are diehards. For us this is a labor of love, and it will be very hard to kill us."

FACING FACTS
Realism in American Thought
and Culture, 1850-1920.
By David E. Shi.
Illustrated. 394 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $35. 
THE word "reality," Vladimir Nabokov once wrote, is "one of the few words which means nothing without quotes." Surely the same is true of "realism" -- a word that seems to exist mainly to give writers and critics something to squabble about. At first, when pioneers like William Dean Howells and Stephen Crane (under the influence of European novelists like Balzac and Zola) set out to banish sentiment and prudishness from the American novel, the realist agenda seemed clear: it was "the business of the novel," as Howells put it in a 1894 interview with Crane, "to picture the daily life in the most exact terms possible." But anyone who spends a little time with these writers, or with Henry James and Theodore Dreiser, or with lesser-known figures like John W. De Forest and E. W. Howe, quickly discovers that there was little agreement about what constituted daily life, or about what kind of representation met the standard of exactness.
In "Facing Facts: Realism in American Thought and Culture, 1850-1920," David E. Shi takes up the problem of what the realists meant by the real. Mr. Shi, the president of Furman University in Greenville, S.C., recognizes that whatever realism meant to its practitioners, the term was highly elastic. For Ambrose Bierce, realism was "the art of depicting nature as it is seen by toads." For Henry James, it was fiction that is "bravely and richly, and continuously psychological." Mark Twain -- arguably the first major American writer to try to catch accurately a regional dialect -- never used the label "realism." And most writers, then as now, showed little interest in their putative membership in any school: the New England story writer Mary Wilkins Freeman remarked in the 1890's that "I didn't even know I was a realist" until critics "wrote and told me."
Yet Mr. Shi is determined to find common ground. Surveying not just writers and critics but also painters, photographers and furniture makers, he brings shared commitments into view: a broadening of the issues (divorce, poverty, prostitution) and social classes (factory workers, the unemployed) that could be legitimately addressed by respectable novelists, and an antipathy to ornament (in the architecture of John W. Root and Louis Sullivan) and decoration (in the furniture of Gustav Stickley) as distractions from the plain truth of functional form.
In his zeal for inclusion, Mr. Shi even counts certain poets among the progenitors of the realist school -- such as Walt Whitman, who, having witnessed the lopping off of gangrenous limbs in the Civil War hospitals, lamented that the "real war will never get into the books." Mr. Shi declares that the publication of "Leaves of Grass" (1855) -- in which Whitman proclaimed "the scent of these arm-pits" to be an "aroma finer than prayer" -- had "monumental results for American literary history." Whitman, he says, was "the ferry linking antebellum romanticism to late 19th-century realism."
But what exactly did Whitman carry and to whom? Whitman was certainly a pioneer in introducing sexual candor into American writing. Yet there is precious little body odor in the work of Howells or of Sarah Orne Jewett (one of the leading "local color" realists) or of Henry James, who was perhaps the greatest realist in our history in the sense of having perfected the capacities of the novel to transcribe the intricate modulations of consciousness.
It is certainly true that in these years the quotidian rather than the exceptional became the stuff of literature. (One writer complained that Howells had turned fiction into "the drama of a broken teacup, the tragedy of a walk down the block.") And it is also true that changing social conditions -- the influx of immigrants and the migration from farms to factories -- seemed to make obsolete the old literary picture of a hardy, rural American stock. But it is also true that any adequate concept of realism has to cut deeper than surface changes in American life. It has to acknowledge that realism was more than new topics, new idioms and new candor.
At the heart of the new temperament -- as Mr. Shi suggests in a key section of his book, entitled "Pragmatic Realism" -- was the proposition (encouraged by science generally and Darwinism in particular) that there lay beneath appearances no transcendent meaning, no meaning that exists independently from acts of perception and interpretation. It is, for instance, one of the paradoxes of realism that the invention of photography -- a medium that seemed intrinsically realistic -- appeared at first to be a kind of miracle of objectivity, a way to capture truth on metal or glass or paper where light itself inscribed reality without any human tampering. (Mr. Shi quotes one visitor to an early picture gallery exclaiming that "it is impossible for photography to lie.") But in time, it became clear that photographs themselves -- no more or less than other media -- were interpretable, and that the photographer, even more than practitioners of words or paint, was compelled to regard the world from a fixed point of view.
So realism was less about objectivity than about the inevitability of perspective. In a typically brilliant exposition, the philosopher William James explained the attraction of what he called the "fallacy" that reality, or truth, has an existence independent of the human perceiver. In making the point, James employs Nabokovian quotation marks:
"In the case of 'wealth,' we all see the fallacy. We know that wealth is but a name for concrete processes that certain men's lives play a part in, and not a natural excellence found in Messrs. Rockefeller and Carnegie, but not in the rest of us.
"Like wealth, health also lives in rebus. It is a name for processes, as digestion, circulation, sleep, etc., that go on happily, tho in this instance we are more inclined to think of it as a principle and to say the man digests and sleeps so well because he is so healthy."
But, James explains, "all these words" -- health, wealth, truth -- "in th are exactly similar. Truth exists ante rem as much and as little as the other things do."
Truth, or reality, in other words, is to be found in what James called "the relations perceived" between facts -- not in the facts themselves. Meanings are to be made, not found. They are imposed on concrete facts; they do not inhere in them.
According to this kind of pragmatic realism, the mind "engenders truth upon reality.""Our minds are not here," James insisted, "simply to copy a reality that is already complete. They are here to complete it, to add to its importance by their own remodeling of it." This was the principle (though it was rarely raised to this level of philosophical articulation) that lay at the heart of the realist movement.
AND it was this conviction that accounts for the reformist impulse evident in most of the significant works of American realism, from John W. De Forest's novel of the Civil War, "Miss Ravenel's Conversion From Secession to Loyalty" (1867), to Norman Mailer's novel of World War II, "The Naked and the Dead" (1948). Although these realists held a range of political commitments, and included some whose world remained very much circumscribed, they were, by and large, writers who broke open literary conventions in order to bring into view aspects of life with which most American readers and viewers had previously had no relation at all.
By representing the poor or the disfranchised or the exploited, writers like Howells and Dreiser and, later, James T. Farrell and Richard Wright, created a relation that had not previously existed: a relation between middle-class readers and the world beyond their immediate experience. "Nothing is so hard," Howells's character Basil March says in "Their Wedding Journey" (1872) -- a genteel novel about a couple on honeymoon that critics tend to dismiss today as tame and provincial -- "as to understand that there are human beings in this world besides one's self and one's set."
One could do worse than choose this statement as the motto of the whole realist movement. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Mr. Shi's timely reminder of this pragmatist faith in the transforming power of representation is how alien it feels in our own day, when relations between distinct groups within American society are weakening, and when the hope of changing the world by reimagining it is diminishing. One closes Mr. Shi's book with a sense of gratitude for writers who once tried to restore and sustain these relations and that hope.

Brooklyn's Shrub
 Q. I recently stumbled across the fact that the forsythia is the official botanic emblem of Brooklyn. How did it come to be that it's not a tree? 
 A. True, forsythia is a shrub, not a tree. And one might expect Brooklyn's borough-sanctioned arbor to be the ailanthus of "A Tree Grows in" fame. But files from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden tell a different story. In 1940, Florence Abraham Blum, the wife of the president of the Abraham & Straus department store and a member of the garden's ladies auxiliary, led an effort to beautify the borough. She persuaded the Borough President, John Cashmore, to anoint the forsythia as Brooklyn's official bloom. Borough residents were urged to plant the shrub in their frontyards from the Heights to Coney Island to inspire brotherhood, unity and understanding.
Mrs. Blum also began a Forsythia Day (still celebrated each April) and crowned a Forsythia Queen. The Hotel Granada, which opened in 1946 at Ashland Place and Lafayette Avenue in Fort Greene, named its dining room the Forsythia Room.
Starting in 1954, the garden bestowed a Forsythia Award for civic leadership, in honor of Mrs. Blum, who died in 1959. The award is still given annually to someone selected by borough officials and Botanic Garden members.
 
 
Books on the Move
 Q. How does the New York Public Library move books from one branch to another? Does a fleet of anonymous vans shuttle books around the city?
 A. "Yes, basically," said a spokeswoman for the New York Public Library, which serves Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. The system has five unmarked trucks that carry books, interoffice mail, videotapes and internal publications among its 82 branches. It also has four nonlending research libraries.
The city has two other library systems, and both use plainly marked vans to carry books. The Brooklyn Public Library uses an "interchange system" of four trucks that travel four routes among the central depository at Grand Army Plaza, 58 branches and the city's only bookmobile. Three vans make their way among the Queensborough Public Library's Central Library on Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica and 62 branches.
 
 
Orphan Building
 Q. There is a building on the northeast corner of West 57th Street and 10th Avenue that has never been completed. It is approximately 35 stories tall, and it has been about three years since any work was done on it. Is it on the market?
 A. Vahe Tiryakian, director of public affairs at the Department of Buildings, used the building, whose address is 475 West 57th Street, to explain that the city does not set a deadline for completion of construction on any building. To do so, he said, would be impossible "because of the complexity of the city."
"It would not encourage a healthy economy," Mr. Tiryakian said. "Besides the industry is not dilatory. After all, time is money."
But the good news is that the building is about to be reactivated. In a deal not yet completed, plans call for it to be used to house low-income residents, mainly from the entertainment industry, starting early next year.
It is a project of the Actors Fund of America, a national nonprofit social services organization that has hired a management company, Housing and Services Inc. of Manhattan, to manage the property. Housing and Services records show that the deed is currently in escrow, and the negotiations are still delicate, said Joseph P. Benincasa, the fund's general manager. He said the previous developer had "run out of money." He would not disclose the developer's name. ERIN ST. JOHN KELLY

HEADLINE: Germany's Telephone Pie Is Just Too Big to Pass Up

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 25

 BODY:
With Germany's telephone service scheduled for deregulation by 1998, almost everyone who is anyone in telecommunications wants a piece of the German information superhighway these days.
So far this month, the BellSouth Corporation said it was forming a partnership with Thyssen, the German steel company, to compete against Deutsche Telekom, the state monopoly. Northern Telecom has teamed up with Daimler-Benz Aerospace. British Telecommunications P.L.C. announced a joint venture with the German utility Viag A.G. to provide voice and data transmission to corporations. And Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain is joining forces with Veba A.G., another German electric utility, on a telephone joint venture. 
 [Veba announced Thursday that it would acquire up to 10.5 percent of Cable and Wireless for about $1.5 billion as part of the deal.]
The basic strategy is for foreign telecommunications companies to ally themselves with big German partners who can offer assets plus access to customers in Germany, while the foreign partner provides the technology and operating skill.
"All the major players are looking at Germany now," said Hans Peter Peters, managing director of Morgan Stanley's office in Frankfurt. "The rush is on to see who will get a joint venture going first and then hope that the German Government will give them a license to set up a telephone system."
The race in Germany reflects growing competition throughout the Continent, where European Union rules have mandated that all telephone business will be deregulated as of the beginning of 1998. This will also open more big markets in France, Italy and Spain to outside competition.
Indeed, analysts say telecommunications is the most profitable industrial area in Europe, generating profit estimated as high as $30 a telephone line each year.
There are good reasons for the rush of interest in Germany, which offers the world's third-largest market for telecommunications, after those in the United States and Japan. What is now a $40 billion annual business will grow to almost $70 billion in eight years, according to industry and analysts' projections. And while the overall German market is growing by 7 percent a year, annual growth in what was East Germany has reached 26 percent.
As a telecommunications market, Germany can be seen as underdeveloped. Deutsche Telekom has lagged behind its free-market counterparts in Britain and the United States by as much as eight years, according to some analysts. This has left a big technology gap waiting to be filled in the largest economy in Western Europe.
The German Government has announced it will award licenses for a number of mobile telephone systems, in addition to four that now exist. And beginning in 1998, or possibly sooner, the Government will lift Deutsche Telekom's monopoly on consumer telephone service, throwing the field open to competition.
More than a dozen joint ventures have been formed in Germany, with planned investment of more than $12 billion over the next few years.
The American giants include MCI Communications, Sprint and some regional telephone companies. AT&T and GTE, two of the largest American telephone giants, have been silent so far, but appear certain to enter the market. AT&T is said by industry officials to be negotiating with Veba.
The most actively sought partners have been Germany's giant utilities. This is because companies like Veba, Viag and RWE, which own the country's three largest electric utilities, have installed vast electrical-distribution grids that can be used to carry fiber optic cable into millions of German homes.
"Basically, the utilities will be the big beneficiaries over the next few years," said Bernd Janssen, an analyst with the Union Bank of Switzerland here. "They have all the cables currently in place, so their cost is greatly reduced. Moreover, they have experience dealing with consumers and big businesses, and they are used to the investing dynamics of telecommunications, spending large amounts of money and waiting a long time for the return."
Veba, through its Vebacom subsidiary, has formed seven separate telecommunications ventures. It owns 28 percent of the E-plus mobile phone system in Germany with BellSouth, Thyssen and Vodafone of Britain. It also owns Meganet, a private networking and data system and is part of the Teleport Europe satellite system. Veba has 10 percent of Iridium's world satellite system set up by Motorola, cable television interests and a 15 percent stake in another company that will offer a mobile phone system in France. Finally, it has started a project with Deutsche Bundesbahn, the German national railroad, to lay fiber optic cable using the railway system.
RWE has the largest corporate client base because it operates in the heavily industrialized Ruhr and Rhine Valley regions. It has teamed up with Mannesmann and Deutsche Bank with the aim of providing corporate network communications. It also owns 40 percent of Teleport Europe and has a license to operate a mobile phone system.
Viag, a latecomer that announced plans to team up with British Telecom last week, will use not only its Bavarian customer base, but also more than 2,400 miles of high-power transmission lines around the country.
These upstarts in telecommunications will be facing Deutsche Telekom, which has teamed up with France Telecom and Sprint in a venture that could create one of the world's largest telecommunications networks.
While much of the interest has focused on the end of 1997, when Deutsche Telekom loses its monopoly on consumer voice service, the more immediate prize is the license to offer corporate network telecommunications, which are not under monopoly control, through a cellular phone system. Once businesses are operating a corporate network, analysts say, they may find a legal way to get around the existing ban on offering consumer service.
But the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which has generally embraced privatization and open markets, has hinted that it might end Deutsche Telekom's monopoly sooner.
Analysts predict that Deutsche Telekom will be preoccupied with trimming as many as 30,000 employees, improving its technology and preparing for its own privatization. Next year, the Government plans to sell as much as $10 billion in Deutsche Telekom stock, with another sale of an equal amount in 1997 or 1998.
All this should give competitors breathing space in the market.
"Prices to consumers are quite high in Germany," said a telecommunications analyst in London, who asked not to be identified. He added: "And Deutsche Telekom's costs from investments and excessive employment are so high that it has little room for bringing them down. That means any entrants will find they will not get in big price wars and their return on investment will be faster."
Still the race may be won by the leanest contender, and if the telecommunications market opens early, Deutsche Telekom might not be ready to compete. Its rotary dialing technology is a source of German jokes, and the company still cannot itemize long-distance charges.
But the Government, while moving toward faster deregulation, has also sent conflicting signals about how much it will stay involved in Deutsche Telekom.
Of 10 new directors recently named to the company's board by the Government, half were political appointees. The resignation of Deutsche Telekom's chief executive, Helmut Ricke, three days later caused rumors that he was fed up with political meddling, particularly by the Minister of Postal Services and Telecommunications, Wolfgang Botsch. The new directors appointed to the Deutsche Telekom board included Gerhard O. Pfeffermann, the Government bureaucrat in charge of awarding new mobile telephone licenses to Deutsche Telekom's competitors.
Yet, would-be investors have not been deterred.
"This is a market you have to be involved with," Mr. Peters said. "It's too big to stay away."

HEADLINE: Aid for Mexico Loses Backing In Both Parties

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
When President Clinton decided earlier this month that the United States urgently needed to bail out Mexico from a deepening financial crisis, he argued that his primary purpose was to save the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Americans who labor to produce exports to America's third-largest trading partner.
But after two weeks of public hearings and behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, leaders of both parties are declaring Mr. Clinton's proposal all but dead in its present form, even though estimates of the number of American jobs at risk are growing. [Page D4.] 
 It is not that they doubt the seriousness of the problem, they insist, or question that the American economy will suffer if Mexico's problems are ignored. Instead, Democrats and Republicans alike say they are unconvinced that the $40 billion package of loan guarantees will actually save many jobs on Main Street. And they are more certain than ever, they say, that the package will bail out Wall Street investors who staked billions on the certainty that Mexico was a sure thing.
This is hardly the first time a President has been caught in the maw of a Main Street-Wall Street argument, or forced to argue that the only way to help out workers making $7 an hour was to first help out bondholders who measure their monthly winnings or losings by the millions. But it is the first time in the post-cold war era that the White House has made a case that failure to intervene in the financial markets would result in an imminent national security threat only to be met with a bipartisan wall of resistance.
The underlying concern was articulated most clearly last week by Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who under ordinary circumstances might be expected to support her party's President, especially on a plan ostensibly intended to keep Mexico prosperous enough that its workers would not seek better pay across the border.
"I know no one in the financial community who is against this," Senator Feinstein, her voice rising in anger, said to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a Senate hearing last week. "I know no one in my constituency who is for it. There is no support."
That theme resounded all last week in Washington, leading the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, to backpedal from their earlier pledges to help President Clinton push the package through.
Today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, expressed doubts about whether failure to help Mexico would be as big a disaster as Mr. Clinton had argued.
"The other thing that is a big question is who gets bailed out," he said. "Are we bailing out Wall Street bankers, or are we bailing out pension funds that affect the American workers? Who's getting saved here, and are they taking their part of the loss because they have gone into high-yield, high-risk investments? That's a big question."
No one really knows the answer to Mr. Nunn's questions. But it is assumed that the $15 billion or so of Mexican short-term bonds in American hands are held by everyone from millionaires to pension funds to the mutual funds that invested heavily in Mexico and Latin America. Perhaps with that in mind, Mr. Nunn did not dismiss the possibility that Congress would eventually come to Mexico's aid in some form.
Appearing on the same program, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, one of the states with the most to lose from a deepened crisis in Mexico, joined a growing number of Republicans who have parted with their own leaders and dismissed the President's plan outright.
"Any country banker would laugh at the proposal the President has made to guarantee that we get our money back, that we get the interest back, and that we have viable collateral," he said. "There is a crisis, but losing $40 billion of money we don't have is not going to make me feel better about it."
Mexican leaders helped create the crisis by issuing far too many short-term bonds, known as tesobonos, to cover the country's long-term debts. The strategy worked as long as there was a ready supply of foreign capital flowing in to buy new notes when the old ones came due, allowing Mexico to roll over its debts. In 1992 and 1993, Mexico's financial reports show, so much money poured into Mexico that the country had to buy dollars on the foreign exchange market to keep the peso from becoming too strong. By early last year, it had $25 billion in the bank.
But investors grew wary last year, and overseas investment began to slow. With a presidential election coming, the Mexican Government could not stop borrowing, lest it destroy the illusion of an ever-growing economy. So it drew down its huge dollar accounts to keep the peso -- and with it Mexico's self-image -- strong.
"Mexican authorities evidently believed or fervently hoped that the reduction in foreign investor interest was temporary," Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said last week. "If so, they were tragically mistaken." When the truth could no longer be hidden, they devalued the peso and then were forced to let it float, touching off the international equivalent of a bank run.
The Administration's plan to issue loan guarantees is an effort to stop that run by assuring the world that Mexico's debts are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. That should enable Mexico to borrow at an interest rate of 6 or 7 percent, rather than the 35 percent it was forced to offer last week in a failed effort to float some new bonds. The loan guarantee would also keep the Mexican Government from being forced into default on its tesobonos.
If all goes well, American taxpayers could even profit from the strategy, because Mexico is paying hefty fees for the loan guarantees. The United States is also insisting on first rights to Mexico's oil export earnings in case of default, an annual income flow of roughly $7 billion.
Many people say, however, that it would be impossible for the United States to demand those oil profits if Mexico falls into deeper crisis and its unemployment rate soars. With so many in Congress skeptical that the plan is workable, the White House seems almost certain to rethink its package this week and find a way to make it more palatable on Capitol Hill.
And as it tries that feat, it will face a fundamental conundrum: There is no way to bail out Mexico without also bailing out those who invested there.
The reason is that President Clinton's foreign policy goal -- insuring social and political stability in Mexico -- is entirely dependent on convincing investors that they are bearing little risk by returning to the Mexican market.
As Secretary Rubin, a former co-chairman at Goldman, Sachs & Company, discovered last week, that is a hard argument to make out in the heartland.
"I couldn't care less about bailing out those investors," he told the House Banking Committee. "If they lost every cent of their investment I couldn't care one whit." He then proceeded to describe how failing to bail them out could begin a financial panic around the world, slowing economic growth and desperately hurting American jobs dependent on exports.
His conclusion: The United States can find an inexpensive solution to the problem now, or an expensive one later. No one can estimate how far the contagion might spread, or how many jobs might be lost.
To economists, said Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, this may all make sense. But back home, he concluded, "it's not a very neat answer."

HEADLINE: Big Companies in Mexico Among the Peso's Worst Victims

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The first reports detailing the impact of the peso devaluation on businesses in Mexico paint a brutal picture of huge foreign-exchange losses, steep declines in sales and an erosion of confidence so great that even the most ambitious expansion plans are being scuttled.
Wal-Mart, which was gung-ho on Mexico before the devaluation on Dec. 20, announced last week that it had shelved plans to open 24 new stores in Mexico in 1995. "They are temporarily on hold," a Wal-Mart spokesman, Gerardo Ruiz, said. "We are monitoring the situation daily." 
 Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have temporarily shut down their Mexican assembly lines to clear inventories that have ballooned since the peso was devalued last month, and sales dropped about 40 percent. In that time, the peso has lost 39.65 percent of its value against the dollar.
Mexico's largest banks reported foreign exchange losses during the last two weeks of 1994 that were big enough to drag down balance sheets for the entire year. Banamex, the nation's biggest bank, lost $234 million in the fourth quarter and reduced its total net income to about 17 percent of what it had been in 1993.
Mexico's biggest companies have also reported enormous losses. Cemex, one of the world's largest cement companies, reported $127 million in foreign-exchange losses. The devaluation cost Televisa, the powerful media company, $142 million.
And the biggest Mexican company of all, Telefonos de Mexico, was hit with a fourth-quarter foreign-exchange loss of $862 million.
Analysts say that despite such losses, many companies will soften the effect of the devaluation by taking the huge losses on their 1994 taxes. Still, investor concern about company performance, and worries over the prospects for a $40 billion package of loan guarantees from the United States, has depressed the Mexican stock market. Last week, the market dropped more than 5 percent and closed at 1,957.65, its lowest level in nine months.
Inflation is the Government's big fear, and the first glimpse of the devaluation's effect shows why. During the first half of January, prices on average rose 2.3 percent, which may not sound like much. But if prices kept increasing at that rate throughout the year, the final compounded figure for 1995 would exceed 70 percent.
The Government hopes, and economists generally agree, that 2.3 percent should represent the inflationary peak, as businesses responded directly to the devaluation by giving their prices one big boost. If the Government can maintain control in subsequent weeks the rate should decline, although many private economists still think that the official estimate of 19 percent annual inflation is optimistic.
One way the Government controls inflation is an agreement with labor and business to limit wage and price increases. Minimum wages, which are set by the Government, were allowed to rise 7 percent, plus a tax rebate of 3 percent for workers with the lowest incomes.
The Government, however, cannot control union wages, which companies negotiate with the workers at each plant. The 7 percent minimum-wage increase is only used as a guideline. Many analysts fear that as prices soar, pressure will build to raise contract wages just as much.
But one of the first big contracts to be renegotiated after the devaluation left Government officials smiling. The several thousand union workers at the Nissan Motor Company plant in Aguascalientes, 260 miles northwest of Mexico City, agreed to a wage increase of 11.19 percent, after originally seeking 18 percent. "With that, the recovery plan will work," said Santiago Onate Laborde, Mexico's Labor Secretary.
Official unemployment figures showing the effect of the devaluation will probably not be available for a month. But the Confederation of Mexican Workers says that at least two small businesses have been closing each day since the peso was devalued. Volkswagen is reported ready to lay off 1,400 administrative workers, and the nation's oil monopoly, Pemex, said it might have to lay off 3,000 people.
Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City, said the biggest effect on businesses has been the deep uncertainty left by the collapse of the economic strategy that the Mexican Government relied on for six years. For example, since the decision was made to let the value of the peso float freely, executives have not known what index to use to set prices.
"Nobody really knows what to expect," he said.
A business assessment by Lehman Brothers uses each company's foreign-exchange exposure and level of debt as measures of vulnerability. Companies like the food retailer Cifra, which has few assets or liabilities in foreign currency, are expected to weather the storm. At Tamsa, an international steel-pipe producer, exports amount to 68 percent of sales, but 95 percent of its liabilities are in foreign currency.
For some companies, the devaluation presents a bittersweet opportunity. Mauricio Brener is director general of an industrial group that makes and also imports rubber products. Fierce competition from the United States and East Asia since Mexico lowered tariffs had severely cut into one of his primary businesses, automobile gaskets and seals.
However, since December, those foreign-made parts have become at least a third more expensive than those he produces, and the auto makers have come to him for help.
Mr. Brener finds it striking that by replacing imports with locally made products, Mexican companies like his will survive. Import substitution had been Mexico's basic economic strategy for many years until the mid-1980's.
"Even though it sounds crazy, in the medium term, this is going to be beneficial for Mexico," he said. "It will set our minds straight about where we are, where we want to go and how we are going to get there."

HEADLINE: Peso's Plunge May Cost Thousands of U.S. Jobs

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
The plunge of the peso and the sharp drop in Mexicans' purchasing power will cost tens of thousands of American jobs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has estimated, and private economists say the damage to the United States economy will be even greater.
The peso's drop is expected to slash about $10 billion, or more than 20 percent, from American exports to Mexico this year, business and Government economists say -- turning a healthy trade surplus with Mexico into a large deficit. 
 The Dallas Fed puts the resulting job losses at 20,000 to 30,000, but private economists expect the losses to run into the hundreds of thousands. The regional bank's research, completed last week, will go to top Federal Reserve officials as they meet in Washington this week to consider a rise in interest rates.
Opponents of free trade with Mexico have focused on how many jobs might be lost in the United States as manufacturers relocate south of the border to take advantage of lower labor costs there. But some economists now foresee an even greater toll from a slump in American exports to Mexico. Demand in Mexico, they reason, will be choked off both by the loss in the peso's purchasing power and by a likely slowdown in that country's economy.
The new, unmapped territory of free cross-border commerce resists ready analysis, economists caution. Uncertainties include the chances for approval of the $40 billion American rescue package, the peso's exchange rate and the fortunes of both nations' economies.
Opponents of the Administration's plan to provide $40 billion in loan guarantees call it a bailout for investors. They say the peso's drop has raised the costs of free trade and borne out Mexico's risks.
The Administration says the number of American jobs at stake leaves the United States no choice but to become a co-signer.
But no one expects the peso or the Mexican economy to rebound sharply any time soon. Economists say that even with loan guarantees, American exports will fall sharply and Mexican exports will increase.
The Dallas Fed's estimate of job losses in 1995, after the peso's plunge of nearly 40 percent since Dec. 20, includes jobs lost to increased imports and as a result of illegal immigration. That estimate is higher than the 17,320 jobs the Labor Department said were lost to Mexican imports or job shifts last year, the first under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In 1994, the Administration said, those losses were more than offset by a gain of about 140,000 jobs as the total value of American shipments to Mexico rose in excess of 20 percent.
Several private economists said the peso's plunge would more than erase these gains. The WEFA Group, a Philadelphia-area forecasting firm, is among the most pessimistic, seeing the evaporation of $21 billion in exports and 500,000 jobs. Daniel Bachman, a senior economist there, said electronics, automobiles and other consumer goods would show the sharpest declines.
"When consumers are hit with lower incomes, they put off discretionary purchases," he said, "and autos are discretionary purchases."
According to unpublished research by the Dallas Fed, exports to Mexico will fall from an estimated $49 billion last year to $38 billion this year, a figure roughly in the middle of estimates by several leading private economists.
"Clearly, there will be some big losers," said Carlos E. Zarazaga, executive director of the Center for Latin American Economics at the Dallas Fed. Mr. Zarazaga noted that Wal-Mart, the largest American retailer, has already halted its Mexican expansion plans. Job losses, he said, would remain below 30,000, including the damage from higher imports and illegal immigration, as companies found domestic and other foreign buyers.
Many United States companies, including auto makers, have already asked the Mexican authorities to let them raise prices in pesos to reflect the currency's weaker purchasing power. Mexico, in most cases, has agreed, acknowledging the higher costs that American manufacturers face.
Mexico pulled virtually even with Japan late last year as the United States' second-largest export market after Canada, affording Washington an estimated $5 billion trade surplus.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in an interview earlier this month that the surplus might well vanish this year. But most economists predict a deficit.
Jose Barrionuevo, a senior economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank's securities unit, expects a gap of about $5 billion. He figures a $5.6 billion increase in Mexican shipments to the United States and a $4.5 billion drop in the other direction.
Mexico cannot increase its trade with the United States any more than that because last year's 20 percent-plus jump pushed its exporters near capacity, Mr. Barrionuevo said. Other economists say that Mexican exporters are more likely to crowd out goods from low-wage nations than from the United States.
But some leading forecasters are taken aback by their own estimates of how many jobs Mexican imports will cost. DRI/McGraw Hill's economic model forecasts the loss of $10 billion in sales this year and a total of 350,000 jobs over two years, compared with the outlook if there were no Mexican crisis.
"Larger than my intuition thought," said Christopher Probyn, the firm's director of forecasting. But he added that the loss of imports and of American jobs could be even greater if Mexico slid into recession. As it stands, the firm forecasts 6.1 percent unemployment in the United States early in 1997, compared with 5.9 percent had the peso maintained its value.

HEADLINE: Data Change May Distort Auto Sales

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Just as investors and auto companies are straining to see signs of the strength or weakness of the auto market, one of the clearest signals -- monthly sales reports -- is vanishing in a statistical fog.
Changes that most companies are making in how they report sales mean that the January results, to be reported this week, are likely to look even limper than they actually are. The changes seem arcane, but their effects may well panic investors, already edgy over signs that the market may be weakening as interest rates climb. 
 "Our primary concern is that people don't overreact to these numbers," said Paul D. Ballew, an economist with the Detroit branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. "January's going to be particularly ugly."
Auto stocks have been falling since mid-January on fears that the upstroke of the industry's cycle is over and the downstroke is about to commence. Some companies have cut production and sweetened rebates, signs that their vehicles are not selling as swiftly as they hoped.
Many auto analysts, including some at the auto makers, already expect this month's sales to be soft compared with January last year, when sales were remarkably robust. But when the sales are tallied this week, the billion-dollar question will be: How much of the softness is because of too few customers and how much because of methodological tinkering?
"The temptation will be to say, 'My God! Recession's around the corner,' " said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto industry analyst for Salomon Brothers. Like most analysts, however, Mr. Kirnan argues that the industry is entering a period of slower but steady growth through 1996.
Most auto makers, with notable exceptions that include the Ford Motor Company, plan to switch from reporting each month's sales on the third business day of the following month to the first business day. That means January car and light-truck sales for most makes will be reported on Wednesday rather than on Friday this week.
The companies that are switching say that virtually instantaneous computer communication allows them to gather and compile sales reports much faster than they once did; the three-day lag, they say, is a holdover from when reports trickled in by mail.
Only a few sales late on the last day of the month may not make the new deadline, the companies say. "It's not as if these sales are stacking up on the sales manager's desk," said Jim Crawford, a spokesman for the Chrysler Corporation. "We're not too concerned about it." There is simply no reason, he said, to preserve the lag in the reporting system.
But some dealers say the reporting time varies widely, from as few as 8 hours to more than 48. "We do the reports the following day," said Pat Cameron, sales manager at Ed Voyles Chrysler-Plymouth in Marietta, Ga. "The manufacturer will know about it within 24 hours after the sale." He added that some dealers could take up to three days if "paper flow isn't as good."
Ford, Nissan, Volkswagen and a handful of other companies still plan to report on the third business day. That alone will skew the numbers, making accurate market shares impossible to determine on the first day of the month. Thereafter, analysts will face an apples-and-oranges quandary in trying to calculate market shares, since the companies that report later will probably include more January sales, and some early-February sales as well.
Further, a mathematical formula developed by the Commerce Department to determine a seasonally adjusted selling rate for vehicles, widely used as the index of market strength, does not reflect this change in format. The January rate is likely to look particularly lackluster, and the rates for the rest of the year will not be comparable to 1993's. Wall Street analysts are bracing for peculiar results, and developing back-of-the-envelope methods for adjusting the numbers to try to make them comparable to last year's.
Ford dismisses other companies' assertions that reporting is instantaneous. More than half of sales are reported in the two days after the day they are made, according to a study of Ford dealers. And Ford asserts that its reporting system is as good as anyone's. "We're not getting our reports by Pony Express," said Joel Pitcoff, Ford's market analysis manager. "Our computers are probably better."
Ford says that as a result of reporting earlier, its competitors will not tally most sales they make in the month's final days.
And those days tend to witness a flurry of selling, as dealers lean on their sales staffs to reach monthly goals. This is particularly true for September and December, as auto makers try to win sales contests at the end of the model and calendar years. Over the last five years, Ford says that the last two days of January account, on average, for 14.7 percent of the entire month's sales of Ford cars.
Auto makers reported sales in December under the old system, meaning sales from the final days of December were counted as usual. If Ford is correct about the two-day lag in reporting, the final sales of January under the new system will actually be counted as February sales, on the first business day of March; that will compensate, fuzzily, for the fact that the final sales of February will be counted as March sales. But January, as the pivotal month in switching from the old reporting system to the new one, will simply lose its final sales days, and its sales will seem low as a result.

HEADLINE: LEADERS IN STATES PLEDGE TO REDUCE TAXES THIS YEAR

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Taking a cue from the new Republican-controlled Congress in Washington, political leaders in more than half the nation's state capitals have pledged to cut taxes this year. And the rancorous debate is less about whether to cut taxes than about which taxes to cut -- and by how much.
Paradoxically, though, many fiscal experts are warning that such cuts could prove perilous precisely because Congress itself is thinking of making major cuts in Federal aid to the states. 
 Moreover, a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, approved by the House of Representatives last week, could prove even more onerous. One state lawmaker referred to the amendment as a "neutron bomb" aimed at state budgets even as he said he was likely to support the amendment since his constituents seemed to be demanding it.
Another possible risk of state tax cuts is that many are based on optimistic economic assumptions. In California, for instance, Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed 15 percent cut in personal and income taxes assumes 5.9 percent annual economic growth in the state and a victory in California's lawsuit against the Federal Government to recover costs related to illegal immigration.
At a meeting in Washington of the National Governors' Association, some governors voiced concern that Congress would balance its budget by cutting state aid, although governors of both parties said they welcomed the prospect of more autonomy in spending Federal money. [Page A14.]
Republicans swept to power in last fall's elections, taking control of 17 state legislative chambers that had been in Democratic hands or split between the two parties, and becoming the majority party in more legislatures than the Democrats for the first time in nearly 40 years. And with new legislatures being sworn in across the country this month, tax cuts are clearly on the horizon.
In Mississippi, for instance, the State Senate recently passed, by 36 to 16, a measure to cut state income taxes by 10 percent. A similar bill failed in the chamber last year.
"I think many legislators saw the national mood as of Nov. 8 and are translating that into Mississippi policy," said John Arledge, a spokesman for the state's Republican Governor, Kirk Fordice, the chief proponent of the tax cut. "I know it's an overused phrase, but 'they got the message.' " The bill, amounting to a $200 tax break for the average family, is pending in the House.
In many states, even as there is broad agreement that there will be tax cuts, there is considerable partisan squabbling over just how to structure the measures.
Perhaps the best example is in New York, where Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders have basically agreed that there will be roughly $1 billion in tax cuts enacted this year. But the Speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan's Lower East Side, has offered a plan that he says would offer more relief for low- and middle-income New Yorkers than plans backed by Mr. Pataki, a Republican, or by the Republican-controlled State Senate.
In other states, the fighting is less over the mechanics of a tax cut than over who deserves the credit for suggesting it.
In North Carolina, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., a Democrat who will be up for re-election in 1996, has proposed a $483 million tax cut. His announcement came just a few weeks after last fall's election, in which Republicans had campaigned on their own pledge of a tax cut. The Republicans won the House of Representatives, thus controlling a branch of the legislature for the first time in 125 years, and nearly took the Senate.
These Republicans have been receptive to Mr. Hunt's plan but scoff at the notion that he deserves any praise for offering it.
"Governor Hunt is a great tester of the winds," said Don Follmer, a spokesman for the House majority. "The Republicans have loudly and frequently welcomed him to the dance. He can see what is happening in North Carolina and the nation."
But J. Clay Johnson, an aide to Mr. Hunt, said: "Republicans have cried this is a bidding war, one-upmanship. This is not some kind of knee-jerk reaction. Because of the state's tremendous economic growth, we were in a position to give some back."
Indeed, strong economic growth has provided a rationale for tax cuts in many states. In New Jersey, for example, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, announced last week that she wanted to speed up a 30 percent income tax cut, saying that better-than-expected revenues and a new round of spending cuts would make the measure affordable.
State tax collections soared an average of 6 percent last year, well above inflation, according to Steven D. Gold, director of state fiscal studies at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany.
But tax cuts based on the assumption that the economy will remain strong could prove dangerous, Mr. Gold said. "If the economy is about to slow down, the slowdown is probably going to come too late to influence state decisions about cutting taxes," he said. "States are going to be looking in the rear-view mirror to decide how much money they have."
Twenty-one states cut taxes last year by a total of $1.6 billion, according to a recent report by Mr. Gold. But in most cases the reductions were small, averaging only about one-half of one percent of all state tax revenues.
This year's cuts are expected to be larger. In a December 1994 annual survey of legislative leaders, the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures identified 22 states where tax cuts were considered likely. Since that survey was conducted, leaders in at least eight other states have announced tax-cut plans.
"We haven't seen a list like this in a long time," Arturo Perez, a fiscal policy specialist at the organization, said. Indeed, just a few years ago, tax cuts would have been unthinkable in most states, which were struggling to fill huge budget gaps.
"They say, 'O.K., money's coming in, let's give it away,' " Mr. Perez said. "Of course, they regret it when the recession comes back to haunt them."
The battle over tax cuts is perhaps most pitched in the handful of states that have elections this fall. In Louisiana, for instance, where Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, a Democrat, is retiring, prospective candidates are already tripping over each other with tax-cut plans.
Quentin Dastugue, a State Representative from the New Orleans area, and a Republican, has proposed cutting sales taxes on food, drugs and utility bills, for an estimated annual savings of $400 per family. Buddy Roemer, who became a Republican when he was Governor four years ago and is vying for a political comeback, has said he wants to eliminate state income taxes for people 66 years and older to help make Louisiana a major retirement haven like Florida.
In a few states, partisan maneuvering has bordered on the comical.
Earlier this month in Virginia, the Democrats who control the Legislature actually adjourned just before the state's Republican Governor, George F. Allen, was to come to their chamber and deliver his annual State of the Commonwealth address, renewing his call for a five-year $2.1 billion tax cut.
But Mr. Allen summoned the news cameras to his office. "I'd rather talk to you all anyway," he told Virginians in his address. "I reckon these folks in the Legislature will get things straightened out one of these days."
There are cautionary voices about tax cuts. In Virginia, for instance, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Donald S. Beyer Jr., has led the opposition to Mr. Allen's tax-reduction plans.
"No one has called for us to blow up the basic trust between citizens and government," he said in a recent speech. "We must be lean but not cruel, smart and not reckless. Are we now promising a rose garden, but also congested roads, poor health, eroding schools and jobs that have fled the state?"
And Mr. Gold, at the Rockefeller Institute, said states might be much wiser to plan for tax cuts by bolstering their reserve funds. "The possibility of Federal aid cuts, both in the short term and in the long run from the balanced budget amendment, ought to instill some caution here," he said.
Still, tax cuts can provide an enormously popular platform to run on, and those who stand in their way can expect plenty of verbal abuse. In Maryland, the newly sworn-in Democratic Governor, Parris N. Glendening, has said the state should wait on any decision about cutting taxes for a few years, partly to see what happens in Washington. But even the Democratic-controlled legislature is widely expected to hand him tax-cut legislation this spring, putting enormous pressure on him. Republicans are already pouncing on the issue.
"I don't agree with the Governor's idea of keeping the money in a sock until it's close to his re-election time," Robert H. Kittleman, minority leader in the House of Delegates, said. "Our high personal income tax is the biggest reason we are having such a terrible time attracting business. Virginia, which has much lower taxes, is just eating our lunch."

HEADLINE: Clinton Tests Cooler Congressional Waters on Raising the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL with LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
After a month of trial balloons and uncertainty within the Administration over how best to push for a higher minimum wage, this much has become clear: the White House is still grappling with the question of how best to act in a new political world dominated by a Republican Congress.
Just last Tuesday night, President Clinton promised that he would fight for an increase in the minimum wage, now $4.25 an hour, only to have his aides disclose the next morning that he had no immediate plans to submit legislation calling for that step. 
 Since November, there has been almost total agreement within the Administration about a need to increase the minimum wage -- a move the White House is convinced will help the plight of struggling workers while resulting in few jobs lost. With Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich playing a leading role, the President's advisers agreed to seek an increase in the minimum, the preference being 75 cents an hour, to $5, over two years. And by early this month, advocates of the plan were saying Mr. Clinton would unveil the proposal no later than his State of the Union Message.
But those disclosures clashed with the strategy of Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, and other political advisers. Wary of setting public targets that the Republicans could shoot down, they embraced an unorthodox view that the wisest course for Mr. Clinton in the last two years of his term would be to test Congressional waters before adopting a rigid public line.
"What the President is doing -- correctly in my opinion -- is consulting with us on what is doable in this Congress," Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is the chief deputy whip, said in an interview at week's end. "He did not do enough of that on health care. This is an indication that he has certainly learned."
Yet the mixture of policy making and commitment to consensus-building resulted in muddiness when the White House said on Wednesday that the President was not yet ready to spell out what terms he favored, despite his call for action the previous night.
That apparent edging away from a plan, many of whose details were already widely known, generated so much adverse publicity that Mr. Clinton and his aides had to spend much of the rest of the week arguing that the President truly intended to fight.
White House officials acknowledged that the experience had underscored the notion that too much consultation could also give the impression that Mr. Clinton is irresolute.
Nevertheless, White House aides pointed to the strategy of consulting first as the model that Mr. Clinton intends to embrace. On issues ranging from immigration to welfare to Mexican loan guarantees, they say, it is the best way for him to try to maintain some sway over a Congress whose new Republican majority could quickly strike down everything he proposes.
"We're in an environment now where our efforts will have to be aimed less at legislation and more at a legislative strategy," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.
If he is careful about picking his fights, aides to Mr. Clinton say, the President firmly believes that he can achieve more in the next two years than commentators have predicted. And on issues like the minimum wage, the aides say, he regards even a victory in which he must share credit with Republicans as far preferable to principled defeat.
It was not until last weekend, after Mr. Clinton sought advice from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, that the White House strategy was finally set, Administration officials said. Mr. Kennedy, who had already introduced a bill that would increase the minimum wage by $1.50 in three annual steps, to $5.75 an hour, convinced Mr. Clinton that the more modest White House plan would have a better chance of winning support if the President withheld its specifics for now and left the Senator's plan as the Republicans' chief target.
"I have to create the conditions in which we can raise the minimum wage if I possibly can," Mr. Clinton said in an NBC interview last week in explaining why he had accepted that counsel. "I don't want to waste a lot of time making strong posturing and undermining the chance that we can raise it."
But the strategy of consulting with Democrats in Congress to develop a consensus on the minimum wage is not an easy one, and has been plagued by leaks from within the Administration. This limited Mr. Clinton's room to maneuver, some Administration officials said.
"There was some sense here that the President was being boxed in, and that was not appreciated," Mr. McCurry said. He declined to say exactly whom the White House blamed.
Despite the disclosures, the President's senior advisers have agreed that 1995 should be the year for him to press for the increase. Indeed, inflation has eroded the minimum wage to a 40-year low in terms of buying power.
Until the election, the Administration had been unwilling to push for both a health care plan and a higher minimum wage, both opposed by business groups. But with the Republican victory and the roadblock it erected to the health care initiative, the President and his aides saw a fresh opportunity on the wage issue.
At the same time, the proposal to raise the minimum wage seemed to Mr. Clinton's aides to be consistent with his strategy of turning more attention to the plight of ordinary Americans. Even Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the most conservative among Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, told fellow Cabinet members at a meeting before he left office last month that he favored a prudent increase in the minimum wage.
Varying degrees of enthusiasm remained for the plan among Mr. Clinton's economic team, with Mr. Reich described by participants in the meetings as the most enthusiastic. Alan Krueger, the President's current chief economist at the Labor Department, and Lawrence Katz, Mr. Krueger's predecessor, had done considerable academic work suggesting that an increase in the minimum wage would result in only modest job loss, or none at all.
At several meetings beginning in December, Mr. Reich advocated a $1 increase in the wage. But others, including Robert E. Rubin, the incoming Treasury Secretary, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, were less enthusiastic about so big a step. There was broad support instead for the 75-cent increase over two years -- 50 cents the first year and 25 cents the second -- an increment that Administration officials described as unlikely to result in noticeable job loss and therefore "very safe."
The final recommendation of the President's advisers did not reach Mr. Clinton's desk until late last week in the form of a memorandum signed by Gene Sperling, the economic aide who shepherded the process. Much of the discussion in the last two weeks dealt not with the merits of a 75-cent increase, but with the politics.
As discussions proceeded with Congressional leaders, the word that Mr. Clinton was preparing to put forward a proposal to increase the minimum wage appeared in newspaper accounts on Jan. 5. That propelled the issue onto a public plane far sooner than the White House had intended, with Mr. Panetta and Vice President Al Gore forced to concede in television appearances three days later that Mr. Clinton favored such a step.
A senior Administration official, who said the disclosure carried political benefits, noted that it had allowed Mr. Reich and others to speak publicly about recent research by economists suggesting that the potential loss in jobs would be negligible. But the official also noted that the leak could lead to the early mobilization of small businessmen, restaurant owners and Republicans in a campaign to oppose an increase in the minimum wage.
What was most harmful, White House officials now say, was that the disclosure and the resulting public discussion about an increase had raised widespread expectations that Mr. Clinton would soon be specific about his plans. And then, in the face of accusations that the President was not showing backbone, Mr. Clinton and his aides contended that their cautious new strategy of seeking consensus with Congress was the only workable one.
"This 'walk the walk business' is a bogus charge," Mr. Clinton protested in an interview with the NBC News broadcaster Tom Brokaw, who cited the shying away from a specific minimum-wage plan as evidence that the President was not being true to his convictions.
"I'm going to push very hard for it," Mr. Clinton said. "I want to raise it. I want to get it done."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
It's Almost Jury's Turn in Zion Trial

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
On Friday, after 11 weeks of trial, testimony in the lawsuit against New York Hospital and four doctors in the death of 18-year-old Libby Zion concluded at last, leaving many questions unanswered.
Forty-five, and counting. 
 After summations, which are to begin today, the jury will work through one of the longest verdict questionnaires ever in a New York State civil trial. The questions address the judgment calls made by the doctors during that long March night in 1984 when Ms. Zion went to the hospital with fever and chills. She died about eight hours later, after her fever spiked to 108 degrees and she went into cardiac arrest.
A typical question goes something like this: Did Dr. X depart from accepted medical practice by failing to order Test Y for Ms. Zion?
And each question is followed by: If the answer to the first is yes, did that action contribute to Ms. Zion's pain and suffering and to her death?
Only if both answers are yes can a defendant be found negligent.
Now for that indelicate question: How much is the case worth?
Not very much, say many medical malpractice lawyers. Under New York law, damages for wrongful death are limited to the economic worth of the deceased to the next of kin. Ms. Zion was not, for example, a working parent with two dependent children. She was a college freshman, supported by her parents.
Her father, the journalist Sidney Zion, who is bringing the lawsuit, stands a better chance of collecting for his daughter's pain and suffering. Her lawyers have argued throughout the trial that her discomfort worsened because doctors gave her the wrong drug and, when she started thrashing around, ordered nurses to tie her down.
While Thomas A. Moore, the Zions' lawyer, may ask for a whopping amount, lawyers in the field predict that an appellate court will reduce it to about $300,000.
This assumes, of course, that the jury comes down entirely against the defendants. Jurors could buy outright the defense's argument -- that the doctors' care was appropriate and that Ms. Zion contributed to her death by failing to disclose that she had taken cocaine -- and award nothing. Or jurors could find only some of the doctors negligent.
They could also split the award, saying, for example, that Ms. Zion was 30 percent responsible and the doctors and the hospital 70 percent. Defendants would then pay 70 percent of the total damages amount.
But Friday evening, Judge Elliott Wilk of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, gave Mr. Moore his dearest wish: the right to ask for punitive damages.
To make such an award, a jury also has to find that the defendants were grossly negligent -- that they acted with reckless disregard for Ms. Zion's condition. It is a very high hurdle: New York appellate courts have virtually never upheld punitive damages, in part because medical malpractice cases are usually settled before a plaintiff's lawyer gets to pose such a question to a jury.
If jurors vote to send a deterrent message with punitive damages, the amount is limited only by the defendants' net worth. Small wonder, then, that this case has been so hard fought. For Mr. Zion, punitive damages would underscore his decade-long struggle to correct what he says were flaws in the supervision of young doctors. For the defendants, there is an institutional stake in turning away such a verdict.
There is also a powerful pecuniary one: the money would come out of their pockets. Insurance covers awards for malpractice, but not punitive damages.
 
Stuffing a Cat Back in a Bag
 In the 10th week of testimony, the Zion lawyers' worst nightmare was realized.
Before the trial started, Judge Wilk had blocked any testimony about possible cocaine use other than Ms. Zion's inconclusive autopsy results. Such information would be prejudicial, he said, because no one had witnessed her using the drug just before she went to the hospital.
But the defense's psycho-pharmacologist, Dr. George Simpson, broke that rule during cross-examination by Mr. Moore.
Dr. Simpson had testified that a factor in Ms. Zion's death had been the interaction between cocaine and Nardil, the potent anti-depressant she had been taking.
Mr. Moore pressed Dr. Simpson to concede that his opinion that Ms. Zion had been using cocaine was based on unreliable tests. Unless the doctor had other information -- meaning about the tests. Mr. Moore assumed Dr. Simpson had none.
"It was the information that she had used cocaine in the past, with her boyfriend's testimony," Dr. Simpson said, alluding to pretrial statements.
The remark was a deadly blow to the Zions' case. In a rapid attempt to recover, Mr. Moore ignored those statements and instead tried to discredit the expert.
Are you saying, doctor, that you relied on information from a "jilted boyfriend?" asked the lawyer, looking aghast.
"Do you pride yourself on your professionalism?" he thundered.
Later, Judge Wilk instructed jurors to disregard most of Dr. Simpson's testimony. But as a Court TV commentator said, that was like telling them to forget they had seen a pink elephant.
 
An Alarming False Alarm
 Under the gaze of the Court TV camera, tension built steadily during a trial that was fought ferociously by lawyers whose ill will toward one another exploded regularly.
After the jury had left for lunch on Friday, Judge Wilk appeared to have finally reached his limit.
"Miss Karas!" he shouted to the Court TV reporter. "I've just learned something disquieting. Turn off those cameras! We'll do this off the record."
Elizabeth J. Karas, who had joined Court TV only six months ago, dashed into the well, pale and trembling. Memories of the mishap from the O. J. Simpson trial, in which a Court TV camera inadvertently showed an alternate juror for nearly a second, sprang to mind.
Then Judge Wilk jettisoned his wrath-of-justice mask. "I just heard it was your birthday," he said, with a grin. Then he handed her a piece of cake with a lit candle and led the entire courtroom in singing "Happy Birthday" to a stunned, blushing and abundantly relieved Ms. Karas.

HEADLINE: Attention Is Turning Governors' Heads

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
For governors, this is in many ways the best of times.
Congress is soliciting their advice as never before. A major goal of the Republicans controlling Congress is to give power to the states. 
 The Republican Party chose a governor to respond to President Clinton's State of the Union address. The Senate is voting on a bill long sought by governors to curb the imposition of costly Federal requirements on the states. And the new Congress is continually citing the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which emphasizes the powers "reserved to the states."
But as the National Governors' Association opened its winter meeting here today, many of the states' chief executives expressed uncertainty and apprehension. They worry that Congress will balance the Federal budget by cutting aid to the states for education, health care and assistance to poor people.
Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, a Republican, rejoiced at the changes sweeping through Washington. In the next decade, he said, "You will see a radical transformation -- what the Founding Fathers intended -- with more responsibility going back to the state and local level." Another Republican, Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, said, "This is a pivotal change, a sea change in our history."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat who is chairman of the governors' association, said that in recent years, when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives, "they didn't pay any attention to governors whatsoever."
In an interview, Mr. Dean observed that the new Republican leaders of the House were listening to Republican governors, at least. "That's a significant improvement," he said.
On the other hand, some Democratic governors, including Mr. Dean, said the Republicans would shift so much power to the states that there would no longer be Federal standards guaranteeing a safety net for poor children.
"I believe there is a national interest in making sure that children don't starve," said Governor Dean.
Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, said he feared that the Republicans in Congress would impose new requirements on the states to achieve conservative policy goals.
"We're not any more interested in conservative mandates than in liberal mandates," Mr. Carnahan said.
He also said he was worried that if Congress gave states a lump sum of cash to run their own welfare and nutrition programs, as some Republican governors have proposed, states would run out of money in the next recession.
"At the state level," Mr. Carnahan said, "we will have to cut people off the welfare rolls in their time of need."
At their meeting today, the governors considered the proposal to replace dozens of Federal programs with a lump-sum payment, or block grant, but reached no conclusion. Republicans said 5 percent of the money could be set aside to help states experiencing high unemployment or other economic difficulties.
Gov. Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat, said: "There is a great opportunity here, but also a great risk. There will be a great temptation for Congress, in a politically cynical way, to shift the burdens to state and local taxpayers. I use the analogy of the Trojan horse. It looks pretty good right now, but what's waiting inside that could be potentially harmful?"
In addition, Mr. Carnahan said, it is mainly the Republican governors that Congress is listening to these days.
One of those Republicans, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, said the new leaders of Congress seemed to believe that "they can learn something from governors."
Governors of both parties welcomed the prospect of new autonomy and flexibility, promised by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republicans. "I like it," said Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat. "I want more flexibility. I want to run these programs without Federal strings."
Thirty of the 50 governors are Republicans -- as compared with 20 before November's election -- and some have played a large role in helping the new Republican Congress shape its agenda. Their negotiations with the Republican leaders of Congress, on issues like welfare, have caused severe strains in the governors' association, which has a history of bipartisan cooperation.
James L. Martin, a lobbyist at the association for 28 years, said the governors' influence soared after November's election. "The Republican Party is state oriented," he said. "At least, it has been for three or four decades."
Of the nine most populous states, only Florida does not have a Republican governor.
Mr. Martin said that the Republican leaders of Congress and the national Republican Party were fascinated, in particular, with the political success of three Republican Governors just re-elected in the Midwest: John Engler of Michigan, who won more than 61 percent of the vote in November; Mr. Thompson in Wisconsin, who carried 67 percent of the vote, and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, who won 72 percent.
Mr. Thompson carried Milwaukee and says he won nearly 40 percent of the black vote statewide. John Truscott, press secretary for Mr. Engler, described the Michigan Governor as "very activist" and estimated that he won half the union vote.
The success of the Congressional Republicans' domestic program, embodied in the Contract With America, depends on governors like Mr. Engler, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Voinovich. "The Republicans who run Congress have to listen to the Republican governors," Mr. Martin said. If the contract works in big states, he said, Republicans have reason to hope it will work elsewhere.
The ambivalence of many state officials was captured in a statement issued today by the Democratic Governors' Association. The Democratic governors said they supported a constitutional amendment to require that the Federal budget be balanced. But they said that the version of the amendment approved last week by the House would shift costs to the states and might force some states to raise taxes.
The theme of the new Federal-state relationship is trust. Republicans in Congress say they are willing to place more trust in state officials than the Democrats did.
Over the last 50 years, Congress has set detailed Federal standards for welfare, food assistance, Medicaid, civil rights and protection of the environment. State officials contend that they are entitled to more discretion and a larger degree of trust.

HEADLINE: Slopping the Hogs, the Assembly-Line Way

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROSE HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
Barney Rhodes gave up his father's poultry and corn farm in 1983, trading the risks of working on the land for a construction business.
But about two years ago, he started getting other ideas when farmer after farmer asked him to build long, low cinder-block buildings for a mechanized, assembly-line system of hog rearing. 
 "There was something big going on here," Mr. Rhodes said, "and so I got into the hog-contracting business myself a little over a year ago."
Now, Mr. Rhodes and his wife, Joy, own four long buildings packed with more than 5,000 grunting, snorting hogs that they feed for about 20 weeks, starting when the animals are about three months old and until they reach a market weight of 250 to 260 pounds. The couple run a finishing farm, one of 400 in North Carolina that tend hogs under contract with Murphy Family Farms, a local company that recently became the country's largest producer of hogs.
The "something big" that Mr. Rhodes spotted could be considered a revolution in livestock farming. It takes a method that had been spottily used -- keeping the hogs inside, away from the elements -- and raises it to a new level. The buildings are standardized, and the feeding, watering and cleaning up after the animals are done by automated equipment.
The hogs are bred in farrowing farms, where they stay for 17 to 20 days, until they are weaned; then, they are moved to the nurseries, where they stay for 10 weeks until they weigh about 50 pounds; finally, they go to finishing farms like the Rhodes's.
The mechanization has meant that one farmer can do the work of what used to take dozens of laborers. And thousands of hogs can be raised on one farm, many times the number on traditional farms.
The new methods are based on the contract-farming system developed in the chicken industry. They have enabled some hog farmers to stay afloat in a pork market that has been dropping sharply.
On the other hand, some experts trace the lower prices to the increase in the number of hogs on the market, which is partly attributable to contract farming. There are also widespread complaints about the stench from the large farms.
The operations have also reduced, or perhaps elevated, to a science the quaint arts of animal husbandry that once made 4-H Club members beam with pride.
In the process, North Carolina has become the nation's second-largest hog producer, pushing its annual production to seven million hogs in 1993, up from two million a decade ago. (In 1993, total United States hog production was 50.7 million.)
But the hog industry has about hit its limits in North Carolina because of slaughterhouse capacity and the prohibitive cost of shipping feed from the Midwest's corn farms. Large contract growers like Murphy Family Farms are preparing to expand contract farming techniques into Iowa, the No. 1 hog-producing state, with 13 million hogs in 1993.
Barbara Grabner, assistant director of Prairie Fire, a farm advocacy group based in Des Moines, said the coming of the contract farms is "the hottest issue now" among Iowa hog farmers who take pride in their image as independent entrepreneurs but are looking for ways to become more efficient as market prices fall.
Ms. Grabner raised some of the same concerns that have been debated in North Carolina. "It's the scale of these operations and some of the environmental problems they may bring which makes people here nervous, even with our wide open spaces," she said. "They even smell different and worse than our traditional hog farms."
Because of the large concentration of animals, the area around a hog farm is saturated by a nose-wrinkling, ammonia-tinged smell of the animals even on crisp, windy days.
Most of North Carolina's 8,000 hog farms are in the eastern part of the state stretching between the Virginia and South Carolina borders. While the number of farms is down from 21,000 in 1984, production is up. Last year, hog operations in the state brought in $1 billion, making pork as valuable to the state as tobacco and chickens. And while many hog farms have shut down, some farmers say the contracting system has allowed their operations to stay alive.
"The company tells us everything we need to do for the pigs to perform properly," Mr. Rhodes said. He is guaranteed a flat fee regardless of the day's market price. "There's absolutely no risk here for me," he said.
Indeed, it is the company, not the farm, that owns the hogs. The farmers, however, buy the equipment and own the buildings.
Company-employed experts provide the farmers with stock that is genetically manipulated for leanness and rapid growth, and with custom-mixed feed in specific amounts needed from one week to the next.
By shifting risks away from the farmer, the contract concept has kept farmers like Jimmie and JoAnn Stroud in the farming business. They were barely staying afloat five years ago growing corn and tobacco on their 150-acre farm in Duplin County. Now, they run a 2,500-hog nursery under contract to Murphy Family Farms, tending the animals from the time they are 17 days old until they are about 10 weeks old.
"We tried to be independent with tobacco, corn and soybeans, but sometime you can just independent yourself into a hole," Mrs. Stroud said. "There are some out there who just want to be independent, but I don't mind taking the direction of the company. I'd rather have part of something than all of nothing."
Not everyone feels so kindly. Environmental groups say the quantum leap in the number of hogs on the farms is matched by an increase in environmental problems, including the constant odor, which some fear may be harmful. In fact, the state has created a Hog Odor Task Force to study whether there is any risk to farm workers or neighbors.
The potential hazards are much clearer when it comes to the large, odoriferous, man-made lagoons into which large farms pump the hog waste and allow it to sit and decompose. The nitrogen-rich waste water is then sprayed on fields as a fertilizer. The lagoons attract swarms of flies, and if the water is not handled properly in dry weather, heavy concentrations of waste in the water can get into ground water and contaminate the aquifers, and, when used in fertilizers, can kill crops and grass.
Dr. Leon Chesnin, a former University of Nebraska professor and an expert in waste management on hog farms, said small hog farms posed few risks to the environment because of the low concentration of waste. "It is entirely different with the large contract farms," he said. Lagoons are not leak-proof, and something the size of a municipal waste-treatment plant would be needed to render the waste totally safe, he said.
In Wilson, N.C., Ann Joyner, 58, told of what it was like to live within a mile of a 24,000-hog farm just outside town.
"The smell of hog manure, urine and ammonia and dust would just float all over and it made me so depressed and so angry," she said, noting that damp and rainy days were the worst. Last June, she said, she moved to town "to get away from it."
Wendell Murphy, the founder of Murphy Family Farms, a privately held company that started in the early 1960's as a feed and grain business, says he merely picked up on something that the chicken industry had been doing efficiently for years. "There's a stigma attached to it in some places," he said, "but it makes sense economically."
Last fall, Successful Farming magazine rated the company as the largest pork producer in the United States, with 180,000 breeding sows producing an estimated 3.6 million marketable hogs a year.
John Morrison, president of the National Contract Poultry Growers Association, agrees that the contract farms are the wave of the future in the hog and other livestock businesses, but he fears that hog farmers will find themselves with problems that chicken farmers have endured. The contract system has turned many chicken producers into little more than low-paid employees of the large broiler companies, he said, totally dependent on a single company for a stream of birds to sell and pay their bills and subject to being squeezed by the company whenever necessary.
So far there have been few complaints from contract hog farmers of bad treatment. But, Mr. Morrison said, it is just a matter of time.
Mr. Morrison's organization recently started a new nonprofit foundation. "It's called the National Contract Growers Institute," Mr. Morrison said. "We named it that way because, like with chickens, we know the honeymoon will be over soon with hogs."

Diagram: "HOW IT WORKS: No Straw, No Sticks, No Bricks: Concrete . . . and Automated"
 Large hog finishing farms, contracted by companies to fatten a big number of hogs ina short time, are proliferating in North Carolina, while small hog farms are dying. Pigs generally arrive at a finishing farm weighing 50 pounds; four or five months later they leave, at about 250 pounds. This is how the farms work.
 
AUTOMATIC SPRINKLERS
 Turned on at intervals to clean the pen and its grating, washing away wates.
 
FEEDING TUBES
 Deliver feed at intervals to the troughs. A mechanical pipe and auger system moves the feed from silos outside.
 
WASTE REMOVAL
 The pigs' wastes fall through the grating into a concrete channel running the length of the building. The channel is automatically flushed by a high-pressure water system, carrying the waste away for processing and later use as fertilizer.
 
STAFF
 Mechanization allows a few people to maintain the entire farm.
 
PENS
 Each pen is about 8 feet wide and 24 feet long, holding about 32 pigs. There are 36 pens per building.
 
WATER
 Delivered through pressure-sensitive nozzles. Medication can be added, if needed.

HEADLINE: Arizona Moves Up Its Primary To Catch Political Limelight

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 29

 BODY:
"I'm tired of Arizona being ignored by the rest of the country!" declared Gov. Fife Symington, setting off one of the noisiest skirmishes between states since Long Island tried to send its garbage by barge to North Carolina. "The West is rising!"
Indeed, in past years Arizona has been little more than a whistle stop for national candidates on their way to California. The only attention it got was over the peculiarities of its governors, like Rose Mofford and her platinum beehive hair-do and Evan Mecham, a former Pontiac dealer who was removed from office for misuse of state money. 
 So in a brazen bid for influence, Arizona passed a law in 1992 moving up its Presidential primary to the same day in February as New Hampshire, which for about the last 70 years has gained stature beyond its size by having a lock on the nation's first primary.
In New Hampshire, where the threats from Arizona have made headlines on the front pages day after day, Gov. Stephen Merrill responded by vowing to do battle with his fellow Republican, Mr. Symington. He accused Arizona of engaging in "a clear attack on the people of New Hampshire and the tradition of the political primary system in this nation."
A few days ago, the warring parties struck a compromise. Mr. Symington agreed to schedule the Arizona primary a week after New Hampshire. "We will not be the aggressor," he said. But other states are itching to challenge New Hampshire's pre-eminence. "Now I can concentrate on getting Delaware officials to back off," said Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican Party in New Hampshire.
As House Speaker Newt Gingrich observed, "This gets to be sort of a stupid game." If states keep trying to leapfrog over one another, he said, "then we'll have the first primary this June."
The arm-wrestling over the calendar is the latest manifestation of states trying to cash in on Presidential politics. Just like the Republican contenders who are maneuvering for attention, the states want the recognition, power and economic boost that can come from being a big player.
For those same reasons, several cities mounted costly and intense lobbying drives to woo the national political conventions in 1996. The Democrats, after being enticed by deep-dish pizza flown from Chicago, as well as the persuasive powers of Mayor Richard M. Daley, picked that city; the Republicans, drawn by California's huge harvest of electoral votes, settled on San Diego, rather than other cities, like New York, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani backed the wrong horse.
Trying another increasingly popular scheme for attention, the Arizona Republican Party held its first Presidential straw poll here on Saturday, even though such nonbinding tallies have never been reliable indicators of who will be the next nominee. "It's better to finish first than last," said Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, "but it doesn't have anything to do with the nomination."
Such dismissive remarks did not prevent Senator Phil Gramm of Texas from trumpeting his 54 percent victory, saying it would "lay the foundations to carry Arizona in February of next year."
For the Arizona boosters, catching some national limelight is also a matter of civic pride. Several Republicans here said they could not fathom why Presidential candidates would prefer chilly New Hampshire next winter over the warmer vistas of the Grand Canyon state.
"I don't mind stealing the thunder from New Hampshire," said Jean McGrath, a Republican state legislator. "They don't have nearly as many things going for them as we do. We like to think we're one hot state."
Despite the compromise, Arizona, which in the past has held party caucuses in the late spring, has already benefited from the fracas. Several Presidential prospects have trooped to the state, many of them more than once.
Mr. Symington said, approvingly, that the feud with New Hampshire led to publicity "which talked about the clear skies, the sun, the 80-mile vistas and contrasted it with the snow and ice in New England."
"I thought, 'Gosh, that's pretty good advertising for my state,' " Mr. Symington said.
But an unanticipated consequence of Arizona's effort to get noticed is that it risks getting ignored a year from now. Motivated by the knowledge that Arizona would hold an earlier primary, Mr. Gramm began building support here so early that other candidates may bypass Arizona next year, accusing the Senator of having the state wired. Already, Mr. Gramm's opponents are blaming him for staging a power play to get Arizona to hold an early primary as a way to make the most of his support, something he denies.
Mr. Gramm's popularity has much to do with the aggressive backing of Mr. Symington and Senator John McCain, whose home he stayed at this weekend. "I was watching McCain, following him around like a little puppy dog," said Larry Krieger, a delegate to the state convention who backs former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
Seeking to tweak Mr. Gramm, Senator Bob Dole, who is also vying for the Republican nomination, commissioned a poll showing that he was the favorite candidate of Republican voters in Arizona -- and released it at the convention here.
Arizona Republicans are taking delight in all this extraordinarily early maneuvering. Senator Jon Kyl, one of the few leading Arizona Republicans who has not endorsed Mr. Gramm, said it would be best for his state if Mr. Gramm does not have an easy victory here. He has visions of Arizona as a Sun Belt battleground.
"Phil Gramm's interest is to nail down so much political support early that he can carry Arizona," Mr. Kyl said. "But the Governor and the Legislature would probably prefer to have a very hot contest."

HEADLINE: New Focus on Cable Competition;
Latest Technologies Giving Communities Greater Leverage

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CEDARHURST, L.I., Jan. 27

 BODY:
One day, Harry Taubenfeld turned on the television in his daughter's house in Westchester County and discovered something that really ticked him off.
"I looked over her channels," Mr. Taubenfeld recalled. "She's got the Comedy Channel, this channel, that channel. Two C-Spans! She shows me the bill -- and she was paying one dollar less than me. For 60 channels! And I've got only 27!" 
 Soon, Mr. Taubenfeld, a lawyer and a trustee of this village, was organizing a committee of the Nassau County Village Officials Association to look into the costs of programming supplied by Cablevision, the hometown company that has long had a monopoly on cable television in Nassau.
Now, two years later, the committee is negotiating with a Manhattan-based cable company, Liberty Cable, hoping to offer subscribers here a gift that many have dreamed of: a choice.
Frustrated by their inability to force local cable operators to improve service and reduce rates, a growing number of officials and subscribers in New York State are using the threat of competition as a new weapon in their battles against their cable companies.
Because the cost of wiring a community for cable has traditionally been so high, virtually every municipality in the metropolitan region, and in the nation, is served by only one cable operator. But with new technologies making it easier to bring cable into the home in novel ways, such as over phone lines, communities are finding new upstart companies like Liberty eager to establish beachheads.
And local officials are embracing any opportunity to shake up their cable operators.
"The only time they listen is when the threat of competition is real," said Paul Feiner, the Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh, in Westchester County. The town has been negotiating for more than a year with Liberty, which has 30,000 subscribers in Manhattan apartment buildings, as an alternative to the town's sole provider, Tele-Communications Inc.
Hy Fishoff, a retired clothing salesman who lives in Greenburgh, said he helped organize a committee to bring in a cable competitor after becoming fed up with what he called T.C.I.'s lack of responsiveness whenever the cable went out.
"They just felt they had a monopoly, that they could do what they wanted whenever they wanted," he said. "That catapulted me to want to do something about it."
Liberty has found no shortage of potential takers since it began putting out feelers in the suburbs in 1993. Not only is the company negotiating with representatives of Nassau's 64 villages, but it is also talking to officials in Oyster Bay, a sprawling town of 290,000 people that also happens to be the home of Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision.
"When you don't have a choice, you feel that things are being foisted on you and you really don't have any options," said Louis Savinetti, a member of the Oyster Bay Town Board. "My bottom line is, hey, I'm looking at price, and people should have a choice."
If the relationship between a cable company and a community sometimes resembles a loveless marriage, that may be as much a result of viewers' high expectations as it is the performance of the cable company.
Michael J. Dolan, who once worked in the cable industry and now acts as a consultant to communities negotiating renewals of their franchise agreements, says it is rare to find a subscriber with a kind word for the local cable company.
"No matter who you talk to, their cable operator stinks and they want any other one," said Mr. Dolan, who is based in Sloatsburg, N.Y., and is not related to the Cablevision chairman.
Steven A. Shaye, director of the Municipal Assistance Division of the State Commission on Cable Television, said his agency receives 20,000 calls a month on its toll-free complaint lines. When Huntington, L.I., was involved in renewing a franchise agreement with Cablevision a couple of years ago, he said, 700 people showed up at a meeting to vent their ire at the cable company.
Officials on Long Island, where cable was introduced more than two decades ago, have been among the most active in looking for alternatives. Last year, for example, a Federal judge blocked an effort by the Town of East Hampton to cancel its contract with Cablevision after the company raised rates and reduced the number of channels in its lowest-priced service. The decision not only upheld the company's right to alter service, but also showed how difficult it is for a community to divorce its cable operator.
By Federal law, cable companies have a presumptive right to renew their municipal franchise agreements, which normally expire every 10 or 15 years. And though communities may enter into franchise agreements with more than one company, it almost never occurs. "A municipal government has the right to grant a second franchise," said Mr. Shaye. "It just hasn't happened in New York State because of the economics of the industry."
Cable company officials say the lack of competition is not their fault. "The monopoly hasn't been our doing," said Norm Fein, vice president of press relations for Cablevision, a cable giant that deals with 750 franchising authorities in 19 states.
He and others point to the variety of services, from free cable hookups in schools to an all-news channel for Long Island, as evidence that the companies are mindful of their responsibilities to the community.
Mr. Fein said Cablevision was upgrading its channel capacities and giving subscribers more flexibility in buying the channels they want. "We assume there will be competition; we think it's a good thing," he said.
In some localities, however, there is a feeling that cable companies have grown arrogant. Some Connecticut customers of Cablevision, for instance, were angered in 1993 when the company announced plans to drop virtually all Connecticut stations, a proposal it later abandoned. And strained relations in some places became even testier after legislation passed by Congress in 1992 to reregulate the industry and reduce cable rates did not have the desired effect.
"After the Federal regulations came into effect, Cablevision made the grandiose announcement that they were reducing the rates by two cents -- two cents!" said J. Leonard Samansky, the Mayor of Saddle Rock and president of the Nassau County Village Officials Association.
That is why spirits soared at the news that Liberty might come to town. Peter O. Price, Liberty's president, says he will provide 60 channels as a basic service for about $18 a month. According to an analysis prepared by Cablevision for the Nassau village officials, Cablevision charges $22 for a "family service" package of 36 channels.
In Manhattan, Liberty has used microwave antennas to transmit cable from building to building. In the suburbs, Mr. Price is considering a plan to send programming over fiber-optic telephone lines. Nynex is testing the system in three apartment buildings in Manhattan, with a goal of carrying 300 digital channels for cable providers like Liberty, said Walter Silvia, vice president of broad-band marketing for Nynex.
Mr. Price said he could begin offering service in Greenburgh as soon as Nynex provides the fiber-optic link from his transmitters in New York City. But even before Liberty arrives, he said, he may be doing a service for municipalities renegotiating their franchise agreements.
"I think it's a win-win situation for them," Mr. Price said. "They all feel that no matter what we provide, it will put some competition into the marketplace and make the current cable operator more responsive, and hopefully provide more choice."
But not everyone is waiting for television to arrive by phone.
In Flower Hill, a village of 4,500 people on Nassau's North Shore, Mayor John W. Walter decided the community would do better by building its own cable system.
No sooner did a small electronics company place satellite dishes at Village Hall as a demonstration than the Mayor received a call from Cablevision. The company wanted to see if it could provide some of the services Mr. Walter was seeking, like more channels, elimination of the charges for extra television sets and a village-run public access channel.
After winning the concessions from Cablevision, Mr. Walter is rewriting the village's franchise agreement. In fact, Mr. Walter said, residents broke the tradition of a three-term limit for mayors just so he could finish the agreement.
"They said to me, 'O.K., you got our attention,' " Mr. Walter said, referring to the cable company. " 'Any time you suggest that you are going to overbuild our system, you get our attention.' "

Chart: "PRIMER: Television Transmission Technologies"
 
TRADITIONAL CABLE: TV transmissions are carried overhead or underground into homes by fiber optic and coaxial cables. In many places, cable companies are replacing much of their coaxial cable with fiber optic to, among other things, increase channel capacity.
 
MICROWAVE: A transmitter on the tallest building in an area sends signals on microwaves to individual dishes or antennas on homes. Apartment buildings with the technology often have a microwave antenna on the roof that picks up transmission and sends it down wires to each apartment.
 
SATELLITE DISHES: TV programming is beamed to dishes mounted on the exterior of homes from satellites orbiting around the Equator 22,300 miles in space. Signal is transferred to a receiver hooked up to the television set.
 
DIGITAL SATELLITE SYSTEM: Uses the satellite dish technology, with an 18-inch dish that is connected to receiver hooked up both to a TV and a telephone line. Customer buys the dish from an electronics dealer, and then can buy packages of digital channels from program suppliers. Monthly costs could range from about $6 to $65.
 
VIDEO DIAL TONE: Technology being developed by telephone companies, in which TV transmissions are carried by fiber optic cable along telephone lines, and would allow subscribers to "dial up" much of their programming any time they want.

HEADLINE: For Homeless, Free Voice Mail Can Be a Key to a Normal Life

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Carl Hygrant encountered no shortage of indignities as a homeless person in New York, but one of the worst was not having a phone number. In his persistent hunt for work, he put on resumes the number of the Bronx shelter that was his temporary home. Repeatedly, when a prospective employer called and learned it was a shelter, interest in him would evaporate in a matter of nanoseconds.
Then he got voice mail. 
 Within weeks, Mr. Hygrant found a temporary maintenance job at the Fashion Institute of Technology -- a place outside of whose doors he had sometimes slept -- that lasted until the end of December. He got his own apartment. His ultimate goal is to embark on fashion design; on the side, he already makes custom clothes for people who learn of him by word of mouth. Voice mail strengthened that business. A call came in for a navy-blue pin-striped suit. A call came in for a shirt, in an extra-large size.
"Voice mail has been fabulous," said Mr. Hygrant, who is 30 and out actively looking again for a permanent position. "People could never get in touch with me. Friends kept saying, 'Carl, get yourself a phone already.' I'd say, 'Yeah, right, first I've got to get someplace to sleep.' Voice mail has made me a new man."
Mr. Hygrant is one of 50 homeless people in New York who were enlisted in a pilot program last June sponsored by MFS Intelenet, a telephone company based in Parsippany, N.J. Carolyn LoGalbo, the chief marketing officer for MFS, said the company had been searching for a community service project and settled on the notion of giving a gift of technology to those who have the least. The program is administered by the Partnership for the Homeless, the nonprofit advocacy group.
MFS donated the mailboxes, for which it normally charges $10.50 a month, and is also paying for a toll-free "800" number to make it easier for homeless clients to retrieve their messages.
The partnership said that of the initial group of 50 clients, 14 have found full-time jobs and another five have found temporary work; nine have found housing. Seven others have had promising job interviews, and three have enrolled in college. Five people gave up their boxes after deriving little benefit.
Officials at the partnership caution that the sample thus far is thin. But they say that successful voice-mail clients are finding jobs or housing in about three months, about one-third the time that those without it tend to take. They point out that this time saved can translate into meaningful savings in money spent supporting the homeless. Among other things, case managers can reach clients more speedily.
Distinct psychic benefits have also accrued. "It has really made a lot of people feel that they have an identity again," said Linda Nelson, who oversees the program at the Coalition for the Homeless. "A lot of homeless people talk about a house and a phone. That's what mainstream society has that they don't have. Well, this gives them the phone."
Buoyed by these results, MFS Intelenet is furnishing an additional 250 voice mailboxes, all of which are expected to be distributed by the summer. And the Coalition for the Homeless, another New York advocacy group, says it is on the brink of inaugurating its own program, which will initially include 400 voice mailboxes and might expand to 4,000 within three years.
The notion of matching the homeless with voice mailboxes was apparently spawned in Seattle in 1991, when Community Voice Mail began there. Initially, 50 boxes were assigned.
Seattle Community Voice Mail, a nonprofit group, said that roughly 80 percent of those using the boxes found jobs and 60 percent were able to find housing. Now Seattle has 700 homeless people in the program.
The progress in Seattle, along with a Ford Foundation grant, encouraged Community Technology Institute, a Seattle nonprofit group that conceived the idea, to promote replications elsewhere. Patricia Barry, the group's executive director, says that 10 more cities have established programs, with another four to start soon. The biggest system is in Minneapolis-St. Paul, which boasts 1,200 boxes.
MFS Intelenet itself says it intends to begin programs, perhaps later this year, in Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, Dallas and Atlanta.
Community Technology is assisting the Coalition for the Homeless with the start-up of its voice-mail operation and has helped it get a discounted price for a voice-mail system that will operate out of the coalition's offices. From various private sources, the coalition has raised a total of $80,000 to pay for the first year of the program.
In mid-February, training will begin and homeless clients will be assigned their boxes. Most of the voice mailboxes, the coalition says, will be distributed through an assortment of New York agencies. It estimates it will take about six months for the first 400 boxes to be assigned.
In doling out the MFS mailboxes, the partnership says it is careful to give them to people who will use them responsibly, and excludes those with drug or alcohol problems, or mental illness. It says it does not want voice mailboxes being used to sell drugs and studies usage reports monthly for suspicious activity.
So far, only two cases have caused alarm. One person had 52 messages in one month and had checked them 800 times; another had checked his more than 400 times. In both cases, nothing untoward was going on: the people were just a little giddy about the technology.
"It's been a lifesaver for me," said Vincent Richardson, 32, who was unemployed and living in a shelter in the Bronx with his wife and baby when he received a voice mailbox last summer. Shortly afterward, he found temporary work as a security guard and in December he found a full-time security position at a Bronx methadone clinic.
His true interest is in being a computer operator, so he continues to send out resumes with his voice-mail number. Just weeks ago, he also found an apartment in Brooklyn.
"Without the voice mail, I probably wouldn't have the job I have now and I wouldn't have the apartment," he said. "Now I've become a productive member of society."
Another mailbox-holder, a 40-year-old woman, said was living at a shelter on West 30th Street last summer when she went onto voice mail. She had lost her job as a home attendant almost a year before.
"I was temping as a secretary out of the shelter," she said. "But that didn't work out too well because I didn't get my messages and I'd miss jobs. A lot of places didn't want me when they heard I lived in a shelter. Society is cruel that way. When I got my voice box, that opened doors."
Last August, she was hired to work three days a week as a receptionist at an office in Long Island City, Queens. The job enabled her to get an apartment several weeks ago.
The other day, a woman in her late 50's was being trained on voice mail by Linda Nelson at the offices of the Partnership for the Homeless, in midtown.
Ms. Nelson got the session underway. She told her, "It will sound just like a home answering machine, so you should think about what message you'd like to leave."
The client, who became homeless last October when she lost her job as a home attendant, dictated a message that Ms. Nelson scribbled down. The woman said she was battling bronchitis and was embarrassed to record her own message. Ms. Nelson offered to be a pinch-voice.
"Now, you've got a great phone number -- 376-1000," Ms. Nelson said. "Really easy to remember."
The woman said, "Well, that sounds like a business number. They'll know it's not my home."
"Good point," Ms. Nelson said. She gave her another number.
After recording the message, Ms. Nelson had the client pick a numerical password and then left a message in her box so she could practice retrieving it. The woman did it once, but said she was still uncomfortable, so she retrieved it a second time and then felt all right.
"I can't thank you enough for this," she said. "It feels so stupid making calls and saying I don't have a number to leave you. Now I have a number."

HEADLINE: James P. Grant, Unicef Chief And Aid Expert, Is Dead at 72

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
James P. Grant, the American foreign aid expert who in 1980 became executive director of Unicef and made it into a major force for helping children, died on Saturday in Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N. Y. He was 72 and lived in Croton, N. Y.
The cause of death was cancer, Unicef officials said. Mr. Grant resigned from the United Nations Children's Fund last week. 
 The direction and urgency he gave to Unicef have widely been credited with helping to save millions of children's lives. Mr. Grant, who had also been an Under Secretary General of the United Nations, was still traveling and promoting his "child survival revolution" until late last year.
His message was simple: low-cost, practical methods for saving young lives and curtailing the spread of easily preventible diseases can quickly make a difference. He advocated treating diarrhea, a leading killer of children, with doses of water, sugar and salt that village people could make themselves.
To measure the successes and sometimes the failures of Unicef and the countries it assisted, Mr. Grant introduced an annual report, "The State of the World's Children," now in its 15th year. In 1990, he organized the World Summit for Children, which he considered a highlight of his career. The conference, held in New York, established 27 child health and welfare goals that were later incorporated into national planning in more than 100 countries.
In a statement after Mr. Grant's death, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: "Very few men or women ever have the opportunity to do as much good in the world as James Grant. And very few have ever grasped that opportunity with such complete and dedicated commitment."
In 1994, Mr. Grant received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Clinton, who cited him for his "compassion and courage in his crusade for the world's children."
Mr. Grant was born in Beijing on May 12, 1922, the son of a public health expert working in Asia. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and earned a law degree at Harvard.
He began a lifelong career in international service in the 1940's, working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China.
In 1962 he became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs and a deputy director of the International Cooperation Administration, a precursor of the United States Agency for International Development. In 1964, he moved to Turkey to head the American aid mission there.
Three years later, Mr. Grant was appointed an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, serving until 1969, when he helped found the Overseas Development Council and became its president and chief executive officer. He remained there until moving to Unicef in 1980.
In 1943, Mr. Grant married Ethel Henck. The couple had three sons, John, James and William. His wife died of a heart attack in 1988 on a trip in India. In 1989 he married Ellan W. Young, a photographer. He is survived by his wife, his sons and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Big Leap in Pursuit of Smallness

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
When Satish Kumar first set foot in New York City half a lifetime ago on an 8,000-mile peace walk around the world, his only American acquaintance was a man from Philadelphia who had offered him a lift in the Khyber Pass.
Now Mr. Kumar, a former monk and a kind of international catalyst for unorthodox thinking, is back in the New York area. This time, his itinerary maps out dozens of meetings with Americans who consider him a friend. 
 For Mr. Kumar has become the world's greatest promoter of the ideas of E. F. Schumacher, the economist whose 1973 book, "Small Is Beautiful," changed the way many people think about bigness and its human costs.
And Mr. Schumacher's ideas -- about the importance of a human scale, of strong communities and of respect for the land -- have brought together in this country a loose network of supporters trying to make those ideas real.
Some have set up local currencies in places like Ithaca, N.Y., to try to keep economic power in local hands, and community land trusts in places like the Berkshire Mountains to encourage common ownership of land.
Others are trying to promote worker management and ownership of corporations, or are developing natural systems for purifying waste water -- based, for example, on the principles of swamps.
The movement's philosophers now include writers like Wendell Berry and Kirkpatrick Sale; David Ehrenfeld, a biologist at Rutgers University, and Hazel Henderson, the futurist and economist.
All of those, and many others, will be meeting with Mr. Kumar during his five-week nationwide tour, which began in Virginia late last week and includes appearances in New Jersey this week and in New York City next week.
There will be talks sponsored by environmental organizations like the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, by professors and New Age thinkers, and by the Utne Reader, the Minneapolis-based magazine often described as the Reader's Digest of the alternative press.
"What we're talking about here is a body of true dissenters," said Mr. Sale, who is holding a dinner for Mr. Kumar in Manhattan next week. "These are the most critical critics of contemporary society."
In little ways, too, many are living their dissent.
Mr. Sale has what may be the only compost pile on Eleventh Street. He writes by typewriter instead of computer -- "the instrument that allows the international system that we oppose to work as effectively as it does."
Susan Witt, the executive director of the E. F. Schumacher Society in the United States, who grew up moving 20 times before she was 20, has now lived in the same house in Great Barrington, Mass., for 14 years. She burns wood for heat, grows her own vegetables and plants perennials instead of annuals. "I'm connected with my community in a way I never was," she said.
Their movement encompasses both ends of the political spectrum -- from John McClaughry, a libertarian and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan now living in rural Vermont, to Mr. Sale, who describes himself as not an anarchist but an "anarcho-communalist." They find common ground in Mr. Schumacher's ideas about decentralization, local control and community strength.
While Mr. Schumacher's ideas became widely popular in the 1970's and were taken up by such politicians as Gov. Jerry Brown of California, they seemed to recede from view after Mr. Schumacher's death in 1977.
But Mr. Kumar, who lives in England and edits the magazine Resurgence, in which many of Mr. Schumacher's ideas were first published, has pieced together a kind of international infrastructure for realizing Mr. Schumacher's goals.
He helped start Schumacher societies in England and the United States for perpetuating Mr. Schumacher's ideas, and he has opened a secondary school and a college in Devonshire, England, based on Mr. Schumacher's principles.
In this country, the E. F. Schumacher Society, based in Great Barrington, has helped set up community land trusts and a lending program for small businesses with "ecologically sound and socially useful products and services."
The society, which claims 500 dues-paying members and some 1,500 supporters, has also sponsored several experiments using local currencies to, among other things, stimulate local self-reliance and community spirit.
In the tiny town of Monterey, Mass., the general store each year issues its own scrip to borrow $5,000 to $8,000 from its own customers rather than take out a bank loan to cover operating costs during long, cold winters.
Each fall, local residents buy Monterey store money at a discount -- say, $10 worth of currency for $9. They then use it to buy goods the following summer when seasonal tourism leaves the store feeling more flush.
"People love it," said Maynard Forbes, the store manager, who said the experiment has not only made old customers more loyal, but has also brought in new ones. "It kind of makes them feel like they're part of the community."
One of the biggest local-currency projects is in Ithaca, N.Y. There, a group inspired by an early Schumacher Society experiment has issued more than $49,000 worth of a currency called Ithaca Hours over the last three years.
According to Paul Glover, who started the project, the money can now buy more than 300 different services such as carpentry and child care. Some grocery stores, delis, movie theaters, a bowling alley and a bank also accept it.
Eventually, Mr. Glover hopes the currency will support more ambitious community projects -- for example, the cultivation of new, environmentally sensitive local industries and the mounting of a home-insulation program to reduce the amount of money lost to the local economy through utility payments.
Elsewhere, admirers of the ideas of Mr. Schumacher and Mr. Kumar are teaching subjects like "Environment and Ethics" to aspiring engineers at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, and are experimenting with using everything from microorganisms to snails to purify contaminated water.
"It has become an important strand of thinking in the environmental community," said Lester Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, who described Mr. Kumar as "the principal embodiment of the Schumacher school of thought."
Mr. Kumar said he had so many invitations to speak during this tour that he could have filled every day for three months. In a telephone interview last week, he suggested that the country is ripe for "spiritual renewal."
The evidence, he said, is "the kind of discontentment you see around" -- the alienation, crime, loneliness and breakdown of families and communities. "People are deeply unhappy," he said.
"We are realizing, after 200 years of industrial revolution, that we have gone too far in one direction," he said. "We need to bring some kind of balance between the spiritual and material."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
On Madison's Grave

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
"Miracle at Philadelphia," Catherine Drinker Bowen called her book on the Constitutional Convention of 1787. And it was a political miracle. The delegates produced a document that has ordered a huge country for 200 years, balancing state and nation, government power and individual rights.
The Constitution has been amended 27 times. Some of the changes have been profound: the Bill of Rights, the end of slavery. But none has altered the fundamental structure, the republican system designed by James Madison and the others. Until now. 
 Now the House of Representatives has approved an amendment that would make a revolutionary change in the Madisonian system. It is called the Balanced Budget Amendment. A more honest name would be the Minority Rule Amendment.
The amendment does not prohibit unbalanced budgets. It requires, rather, that a decision to spend more in any fiscal year than anticipated receipts be made by a vote of three-fifths of the whole House and Senate. The same vote would be required to increase the debt limit.
The result would be to transfer to minorities effective control over many, perhaps most, significant legislative decisions. For the impact would not be limited to the overall budget resolution. Most legislation that comes before Congress bears a price tag. If a bill would unbalance a budget, a three-fifths vote would be required to fund it.
In short, a minority of just over 40 percent -- 175 of the 435 representatives, 41 of the 100 senators -- could block action. It takes no great imagination to understand what is likely to happen. Members of the blocking minority will have enormous power to extract concessions for their votes: a local pork project, a judgeship for a friend . . .
Just think about the debt-ceiling provision. Even with the best of intentions to stay in balance, the Government may find itself in deficit at any moment because tax receipts are lagging. Then it will have to do some short-term borrowing or be unable to meet its obligations. Instead of a routine vote for a temporary increase in the debt ceiling, there will be a session of painful bargaining for favors.
The amendment is also a full-employment measure for lawyers. Suppose the figures that produce a balanced budget are suspect, or suppose the demand for balance is ignored. How would the amendment be enforced? Sponsors say it would be up to the courts. So this proposal, labeled conservative, would turn intensely political issues over to judges!
It is in fact a radical idea, one that would subvert majority rule and turn the fiscal debates that are the business of democratic legislatures into constitutional and legal arguments. How did a conservative polity like ours ever get near the point of taking such a step?
The answer is plain. The enormous Federal budget deficits that began in the Reagan years have frightened us -- all of us, conservative and liberal. We do not want our children and grandchildren to have to pay for our profligacy. We are not strong-minded enough to resist deficit temptation, so we are going to bind ourselves as Ulysses did to resist the lure of the Sirens.
The binding would introduce dangerous economic rigidities into our system. In times of recession government should run a deficit, to stimulate the economy. But the amendment would force spending cuts because of declining tax receipts, digging us deeper into the recession.
The rigidities of the amendment would also inflict pain on millions of Americans. The target year for balancing the budget, 2002, could not be met without savage cuts in middle-class entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.
"It's a bad idea whose time has come," Senator Nancy L. Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, said. "It's like Prohibition; we may have to do it to get it out of our system."
If someone as sensible as Nancy Kassebaum can succumb to such counsels of despair, we have truly lost Madison's faith in representative government. Madison knew that majorities can go wrong; that is why he and his colleagues put so many protections against tyranny in their Constitution. But they also left government the flexibility to govern.
Their design, the miracle that has sustained us for 200 years, is now at risk.

HEADLINE: Peru: On the Very Fast Track

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Which country recorded the world's highest growth rate last year? If you thought it was China, Malaysia or Brazil, guess again. It was Peru, which had been written off a few years ago as a bomb-scarred basket case. In 1994, though, the Peruvian economy expanded 12 percent.
Foreign investors are suddenly big players in this $32 billion economy, more than doubling their holdings last year, to $5.8 billion from $2.3 billion. Even Peru's current border skirmishes with Ecuador look unlikely to tarnish the nation's luster for investors. 
 Peru started to become desirable after President Alberto K. Fujimori declared war on his nation's twin enemies: inflation, which had reached 7,650 percent a year when he took office in 1990, and terrorism by the Maoist guerrillas of the Shining Path.
Mr. Fujimori liberalized the climate for foreign investment and began an extensive program of selling Government-owned companies.
A strategy of police offensives and tough military courts has reduced the Shining Path rebellion to its lowest level of activity since 1980, when the revolt erupted. In the process, the group's leader, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, was captured by the authorities in September 1992.
Last year, Peru recorded 15 percent inflation, the lowest in 23 years. This year, it looks likely to join the exclusive club of Latin American nations with single-digit inflation.
"In short, Peru keeps getting better and better," said Robert J. Pelosky Jr., an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company.
The change is apparent from the American business visitors packing into Lima hotels and tourists returning to the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu. To accommodate such traffic, United Airlines this month inaugurated flights five times a week between Miami and Lima.
Two dozen United States companies have started drilling for oil or digging for minerals in Peru, attracted by one of Latin America's most liberal foreign-investment codes. Other American companies have taken advantage of the most radical privatization drive in Latin America and purchased the four biggest copper mines in the country.
Foreign mining companies expect to quadruple annual gold production to 100 tons by the end of the decade, pushing Peru past Brazil to become the continent's largest gold producer.
Other foreign businesses have benefited, too. Peru has become the fastest-growing market in the Americas for DHL Worldwide Express. The company has shifted its routes and aircraft, sending cargo by Boeing 737 daily to Peru and using a smaller plane to Venezuela. "We are experiencing incredible growth in Peru, 130 percent in the last two years," Andres Borrero, DHL's Andean region manager, said.
Ace Home Center Peru S.A., a local affiliate of Ace Home Center of Chicago, opened here last April in a shopping center once damaged by terrorists' car bombs. "One year ago, all the windows around here were broken and this was an empty warehouse," Rafael Treistman, its general manager, recalled.
Today, all the windows in surrounding buildings have been repaired and an office tower is being constructed. Business is so strong that Mr. Treistman plans to open three more home centers over the next year. Other chains considering Peru include Inter-Continental Hotels, Hilton Hotels, Blockbuster Video and Domino's Pizza.
To cope with a record 500,000 tourists and business visitors expected this year, four luxury hotels are under construction in Lima. To draw investment capital to tourism, 19 state-owned hotels were auctioned last week for a total of $25 million.
"We opened in December 1991 and jumped straight into an empty swimming pool," David Griffith, general manager of the Hotel Las Americas, recalled of the business hotel's initially low occupancy rates. "This year, we expect to run at 85 percent occupancy."
Some economic analysts say Peru is essentially climbing back to where it had been a decade ago, before guerrilla violence and the Government's mismanagement drove the country into economic depression. From 1988 to 1992, the economy shrank by 25 percent -- more than the 21 percent growth it has recorded during the last two years.
But economists predict that Peru will grow 7 percent this year, which could again be the highest level in the Americas. For the rest of the decade, economists are forecasting 5 percent annual growth.
The traumatic peso crisis in Mexico has cast only a slight shadow over Peru's economic revival. Its currency, the sol, has a free-floating exchange rate. Peru has $5.7 billion in hard-currency reserves, more now than those of Mexico, whose economy is 10 times as big.
President Fujimori has made clear his determination to change what was once Latin America's Lebanon into Latin America's Taiwan.
"Just as Japan and Germany arose from the ruins of war, Peru has the enormous possibility to become within a short period of time the leading country in the region," Mr. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, said in July on his fourth anniversary in office.
To attract investment, Mr. Fujimori's administration has created one of Latin America's most permissive investment codes. Peruvians can hold dollar accounts in local banks and send money abroad whenever they want to, unlike in some other Latin American nations.
"Peru is now the most liberal in Latin America," Michael Donovan, general manager of the American Chamber of Commerce of Peru, said of the foreign-investment climate.
Investors' enthusiasm has glossed over some of Peru's drawbacks -- including a history of nationalizing American enterprises in the 1960's, and unresolved economic inequalities and regional and racial differences, which gave rise to the Shining Path insurgency. And Peru, with 22 million people, offers a relatively small emerging market.
Still, Mr. Fujimori, an enthusiastic free-market advocate, has moved to radically reduce the state's share of the economy, to 5 percent this year from 35 percent in 1992. The Government's plan is to sell 75 state-owned companies, of which 49 have already been sold for $3.2 billion in cash. The buyers committed themselves to invest a further $3.2 billion. The Government calculates that foreign companies will put $5 billion into Peru through the end of the decade.
"You have a stream of investment money locked in through the privatization process," said an American economist who asked not to be identified. "The real issue is, given Peru's history, how long is this going to last?"
In the past, Peru zigzagged between a nationalistic socialism and monopoly capitalism. But today, foreigners believe that its free market and privatization are protected by the diversity of investors, by the broad Latin American trend to open markets, and by Mr. Fujimori's expected re-election in June.
With nationalization now virtually absent from Peru's political vocabulary, Royal Dutch/Shell plans to negotiate a contract this year to exploit a huge gas field called Cami-seas, which the company discovered almost a decade ago. The field is estimated to hold 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and could require more than $1 billion to develop -- the largest energy project in Peruvian history.
Though privatizations netted Peru $2.6 billion last year, a bigger selloff may only be starting. Assuming Mr. Fujimori is re-elected, he plans later this year to sell the state oil company, the state water company, the state steel company, the state electricity company, the state railroad and the state mining conglomerate. These companies represent 60 percent of the state's initial stake in the economy.
"We are not privatizing dogs, we are privatizing opportunities that the private sector can take advantage of," said Carlos Montoya, an economist trained at Stanford University who directs the privatization program.
Groundwork for sustained growth is also being laid in Peru's own capital markets and in its basic facilities and services.
Since the program began in 1993, a million Peruvians have joined six private pension funds, which are now worth $300 million and are growing. Pension funds are entering the Lima Stock Exchange, where only 250 companies are listed and trading takes place for three hours a day. Last year's surge of foreign investment -- largely American -- pushed the exchange index up 50 percent in dollar terms, third after the Chilean market's 52 percent and the Brazilian market's 59 percent.
Today, though, stocks on the Lima exchange fell an average of 8 percent, apparently reflecting concern about Peru's border dispute with Ecuador. The drop surpassed those in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
Two Peruvian companies, Banco Wiese and Cementos Lima, started selling American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange last year. Southern Peru Copper is now offering 16 million shares. To raise other capital, Peruvian companies also sold $243 million in bond issues in 1994.
Foreign governments and international lending agencies are expected to funnel $1 billion in low-interest loans to Peru this year. In the largest such project, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are helping finance a three-year, $1 billion project to rebuild the country's dilapidated highways. These and other construction projects caused a sharp increase in Peru's cement production last year.
With new roads and new money, Peruvians have increased the number of cars in the country by one-third since 1992. During the same time, Goodyear of Peru increased tire sales by 60 percent.

HEADLINE: Rate Rise Is Widely Expected

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Some of the players will be new but the result, most analysts say, will be more of the same -- higher interest rates -- when the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Fed's chief policy-making arm, the Open Market Committee, is expected to raise short-term interest rates for the seventh time in a year. Many analysts expect an increase of half a percentage point in the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight. Such a move would lift the Fed's target for short-term interest rates to 6 percent, exactly double the level from which the increases started last February. 
 The Fed's goal is to keep inflation subdued as the surprisingly strong economy, despite some recent signs of slackening, nears the fourth anniversary of its current expansion. Commodity prices have already climbed sharply and, with the unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent, signs of upward pressure on wages have also begun to emerge, although consumer prices rose less than 3 percent last year.
"We're growing too strongly," said Robert T. Falconer, senior vice president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a specialist in Treasury securities and one of the many analysts who believe the Fed panel will raise rates half a point.
Mr. Falconer said that "we have passed through the natural rate of unemployment," the point, wherever precisely it is, below which the competition for workers pushes up wages and, in turn, inflation. In addition, American industry is operating at the fastest pace in 16 years.
To be sure, the economy is exhibiting clear signs of slowing from the robust pace of 1994, a year that in its final three months was showing an economic growth rate of 4.5 percent. That rate is nearly twice what economists consider to be sustainable over the long term without higher inflation.
But that was last year, and the signs of a slackening have been coming from several areas recently, like the automobile industry, which has had such a severe sales plunge in recent weeks that it is idling some factories, and home construction, where builders report a steep drop in potential customers visiting model homes.
Also, though matched so far by higher sales, inventories in general have soared since last spring, inspiring predictions of cutbacks in production that will act as a drag on the 1995 economy.
The Federal Reserve, however, remains extremely wary, not knowing yet the full effect of last year's rate increases and determined to head off inflation before it can gain a foothold.
"I think we're in the danger zone with respect to inflation," Janet L. Yellen, a Fed governor, said in mid-January just before the so-called blackout period on policy comments that surrounds meetings of the Open Market Committee. "The economy has had considerable momentum and the extent of the momentum has been a surprise."
As the committee meeting convenes Tuesday morning, the Labor Department is scheduled to publish its quarterly tabulation of the employment-cost index, the broadest gauge of wage and benefit costs.
The Fed's caution is justified, said Marina Whitman, an aide in the Nixon Administration who is now a professor at the University of Michigan Business School. "Once inflation shows up in the Consumer Price Index, it is late in the game and then the Fed would be forced to take draconian measures," she said.
Nor is it likely, analysts said, that the results of this week's meeting will be much affected by Mexico's economic crisis or by the annual rotation of voting committee members that takes effect this month.
Active though he has been in creating and promoting the loan-guarantee plan for Mexico, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is not expected to shy away from raising rates in the United States for fear of further weakening the peso. Last week he told Congress that sound American policy is in the best long-term interest of Mexico.
The 12-member panel that votes on policy has 4 seats that are rotated at the start of each year among the presidents of 11 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks (the president of the New York Fed is vice chairman of the committee and has a permanent voting seat).
One or two of the four new voting members may be a bit less hawkish on inflation than their immediate predecessors, but analysts said they did not expect the personnel change to have much effect on policy. Two of the new voters, Cathy E. Minehan of the Boston Fed and Michael H. Moskow of the Chicago Fed, are serving their first terms as voting members and might have a newcomer's reluctance to take a strong position, analysts say. The other two, Thomas C. Melzer of the St. Louis Fed and Thomas M. Hoenig of Kansas City Fed, have served before and are known to have staunch anti-inflation views.
The other voters are the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, which is expected to take a separate vote to raise the discount rate by half a point. The discount rate, currently at 4.75 percent, is what the Fed charges member banks for loans.
Although the dominant private view is that the committee will raise rates half a point and then defer further action until perhaps early summer -- by which time the need for further tightening may have vanished -- some analysts still believe this week's decision will be to repeat the jump of three-quarters of a point made at the Nov. 15 meeting.
John M. Godfrey, chief economist at Barnett Banks, based in Jacksonville, Fla., contended that the Fed should make a decisive move that would reassure the markets that the rate increases were near an end. Holding this week's increase to half a point, he said, "begs the question of when's the next one."

Sharp Earnings Shown For 2 Divisions of G.M.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation reported today that profits at its finance and computer service units rose at double-digit paces in the fourth quarter, but its military electronics division had lower earnings.
Together the three nonautomotive subsidiaries -- the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation and the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation -- earned $734.1 million in the last three months of 1994, up 7 percent from a year earlier. For the full year, they had combined profits of nearly $2.8 billion, up 7.7 percent from $2.6 billion in 1993. 
 G.M.A.C., which provides wholesale and retail financing for G.M. vehicles, reported the biggest gain in quarterly income, with profits jumping 17 percent, to $242 million.
"We're encouraged by the continued strong performance of our financing operations and are optimistic that this earnings trend will continue," John Rines, president of G.M.A.C., said.
For the entire year, however, G.M.A.C.'s profits slipped 6.2 percent, to $920 million, as higher interest rates combined with a less favorable credit rating to put pressure on margins.
G.M.A.C. said it lost some automotive finance business to banks and other finance companies last year, adding it could not offer competitive rates because its cost of funds had risen as a result of lower credit ratings at its parent, General Motors. A spokeswoman for G.M.A.C. said, "They're buying a G.M. car but not with us."
G.M.A.C. said it financed or leased 1.24 million cars and trucks in the United States last year, down from 1.3 million a year earlier.
G.M. is scheduled to report consolidated financial results today. Its stock slipped 12.5 cents today, closing at $37.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Industry analysts estimate G.M. earned about $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $1.2 billion a year ago. For the full year, G.M. is expected to post a profit of about $5.4 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 1993.
G.M.'s computer services division, E.D.S., earned $236.5 million in the last three months of 1994, up 16.6 percent from a year ago. For the full year, E.D.S. earned $821.9 million, up 13.5 percent. The unit's stock rose $1 to $39.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"We are delighted to report another record year at E.D.S. and to say that we expect continued strong performance in 1995," Les Alberthal, chairman of E.D.S., said. E.D.S., based in Plano, Tex., has been a key source of revenue as the company tries to turn around its core automotive operations.
In May, G.M. said it would like to spin off E.D.S. as part of a plan to contribute more than $6 billion to G.M.'s underfunded pension plans and allow E.D.S. to pursue a possible partner with a telecommunications company.
G.M. is expected to receive approval from the Labor Department shortly to deposit the E.D.S. stock in its pension plan, but G.M. said the spinoff would be completed only if the transaction could be tax-free.
GM Hughes Electronics earned $255.6 million in the fourth quarter, down 7.5 percent. For all of 1994, Hughes earned $1.05 billion, up 14 percent. The unit's stock lost 87.5 cents, closing at $34.375 on the Big Board.
GM Hughes's chairman, Michael Armstrong, attributed the fourth-quarter profit drop to expansion costs related to the company's introduction of DirecTV and a provision for traffic control contracts.
G.M. said it had 350,000 DirecTV subscribers by the end of 1994. The satellite-delivered system allows consumers to watch a variety of sports and entertainment programs.

HEADLINE: Plunge by Mexican Peso Jars U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The markets opened with a shudder yesterday. Another headlong plunge by the Mexican peso sent American stock and bond prices tumbling, with the dollar falling to a three-month low against the German mark.
The peso dropped to its lowest value yet in the current crisis, closing at 6.35 to the dollar, down nearly 10 percent from Friday's close of 5.735. It has lost 45 percent of its value since Dec. 19, when its malaise began. 
 Meanwhile, the normal market anxiety before a Federal Reserve policy meeting further reinforced traders' hesitation to buy stocks, bonds or dollars. The two-day meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee begins today.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.91 points, to 3,832.08; the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.88 points, to 468.51. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index slid 7.08 points, to 751.83.
Mexico and Congress were on the minds of traders. Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said yesterday that the Clinton Administration's $40 billion aid package for Mexico, if put to a vote this week, would not pass the Senate.
Senator Gramm has been especially adamant that detailed safeguards from Mexico should be a condition of the package. But financial markets worry that overly strict American conditions would lead to a lengthy review by the Mexican parliament, during which the peso would deteriorate further, necessitating an even larger rescue package.
"The markets want decisive action," said Paul Hennessey, senior vice president for the Boston Company, which manages $16 billion worth of stocks. "A delay of weeks or months -- that's when you start having problems."
The market worries started yesterday with currency traders abandoning North American currencies. The peso's fall was the biggest in a single day since December. The Canadian dollar slid four-tenths of 1 percent, and the dollar lost seven-tenths of 1 percent against the mark.
A declining dollar makes stocks and bonds less valuable. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.75 percent from 7.73 percent to coax buyers.
"It wasn't hard to figure out today," said David De Rosa, a director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. "From the North Pole to Tierra del Fuego, people are selling Canadian dollars, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. And if you sell something, you have to buy something, and they're buying Deutsche marks."
The worries in the financial markets will make for an even more closely watched Fed meeting today.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, is "caught between a rock and a hard place," said Gary Evans, senior vice president for Baring Securities, which specializes in emerging-market securities. "If he raises rates, then he drains liquidity from emerging markets. But if he doesn't raise rates, he might weaken the dollar."
Some stocks rose. Mitsubishi Bank, the Tokyo bank, rose 3 1/8, to 24 3/8, on bargain-hunting, after falling 3 points in the last nine sessions on earthquake-induced anxiety. Baby Superstore, a retailer of baby products, hit a 52-week high of 53 3/4, before closing at 53 1/8, up 1 7/8. The company said sales for its fourth quarter jumped 74 percent.
Declining stocks included the American depository receipts of Telefonica de Argentina, which fell 2 7/8, to 46, probably because of the worries over the Mexico crisis.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 318.6 million shares, below this year's daily average of 325 million shares.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.99 point, to 254.90, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 835 to 1,402. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 3.21 points, to 433.54.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pushes Harder for Aid Plan

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Scrambling to rally support for his proposed $40 billion in loan guarantees for Mexico, President Clinton asked the nation's governors to endorse the package today, and in a stepped-up publicity campaign released a bi-partisan list of past Presidents and Treasury Secretaries who supported it.
But while the President worked to get a bill introduced in Congress as soon as possible, the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, said he was not sure when the $40 billion package would be introduced. Though he still favors the plan, which is intended to stabilize the Mexican economy, Mr. Gingrich said it had "almost no support in the country at large," and added that Mr. Clinton "has not adequately explained it to the country." 
 Each day of delay risks more loss of Congressional support and more turmoil in Mexican financial markets, so the Administration is seeking new ways to bolster its case. Treasury officials said today that the United States and Mexican Governments had approached the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, about serving as Mexico's financial adviser in an effort to allay Congressional anxiety.
Mr. Volcker, who administered bitter fiscal medicine to curb inflation in the early 1980's, confirmed that he had been approached by both sides 10 days ago or so, but said he had heard nothing further as of tonight.
The White House had hoped a bill could be ready by tonight, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin stood ready to go to Capitol Hill for negotiations. But House Republicans canceled a late afternoon meeting with Democrats to discuss the issue among themselves, and by early evening both sides said they did not expect an agreement tonight.
Mr. Clinton has spoken out about the problem almost every day for 10 days and spent much of Sunday talking with Congressional leaders. But in remarks to the National Governors' Association at the White House this morning, he acknowledged that he was having difficulty being heard.
"I realize that it's not politically popular back home," Mr. Clinton said in urging the group to support the plan, as its executive committee recommended during the weekend. "It's a rather complex issue, but it is clearly in the interest of American workers, American businesses and the United States as a whole."
Later, asked about criticism that the plan amounted to a bailout of international investors, the President said: "It isn't a bailout for Wall Street. First of all, helping the economy stay strong down there is more important than anything else for our working people and our businesses on Main Street that are doing such business in Mexico. If they want to continue to grow and to have that as a market, we can't let the financial markets, in effect, collapse the Mexican political and economic structure."
"Secondly," he added, "there are a lot of pension plans and ordinary Americans that have their investments tied up there." Many Americans hold shares of mutual funds that have investments in Mexico.
The White House said Mr. Clinton was striving to get agreement on the specifics of a legislative proposal so he could undertake a more aggressive lobbying campaign with members and the public. But the President said today that "time is not a friendly factor."
On Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee has a hearing scheduled on the proposal at which prominent skeptics, including Ross Perot, are to testify.
The White House said Mr. Clinton sought to re-emphasize that the plan was not direct aid. The Mexican Government would pay a fee in exchange for the guarantees, and would grant the United States first call on its oil export earnings in case of default. Critics contend that the collateral would be inadequate if the Mexican economy worsened.
"I think the President will look for every opportunity he can find to make it clear that this is not a bailout," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry. "It is not, you know, welfare for Mexico, that this is in a sense an insurance policy that helps protect our interests as well as the fundamental strength of the Mexican economy."
The nature of the remaining sticking points on a bill remained unclear.
In the latest of a series of rallies, Mr. Rubin held a briefing at the Treasury Department, announcing that former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford had joined George Bush in urging passage of the guarantees. He also announced the bipartisan backing of six former Secretaries of State, five former Secretaries of the Treasury and six former Secretaries of Commerce.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Mixed In Advance of Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury notes and bills rose yesterday as traders speculated that a string of short-term interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve might be nearing an end.
A weaker dollar, meantime, prompted some traders and investors to sell bonds after a three-day rally that drove yields on the benchmark 30-year bond down 20 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. 
 The prices of the 30-year bond fell 8/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose 2 basis points, to 7.75 percent. That remains about 40 basis points below the three-year high of 8.16 percent in November.
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday amid doubts that Congress will pass a $40 billion loan guarantee package to help stabilize the battered Mexican financial markets. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds less attractive.
But Treasury notes and bills with a maturity of three years or less, a sensitive barometer of interest-rate expectations, rose as traders and investors wagered that an increase of 50 basis points this week in the Federal funds rate for overnight loans will be the last for months to come. The Fed begins a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee today.
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, rates fell to their lowest levels in two weeks. The Treasury sold $13.5 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.79 percent, down from 5.80 percent last week. Another $13.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.12 percent, down from 6.24 percent.
Prices of notes and bills rose because "there's a perception that the Fed is slowing up a little bit," leaving a profitable cushion for investors between their yield and the Federal funds rate, according to David Duerson, head trader at BA Securities in San Francisco. As prices of bills rose, yields were driven down as much as 4 basis points.
The Fed has raised the Federal funds rate six times since last Feb. 4, pushing it to 5.5 percent from 3 percent. Even so, the central bank can afford to slow the pace of its rate increases because inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities, "really hasn't stuck its head up yet," Mr. Duerson said.
The Mexican crisis could provide a reason for the Fed to delay raising rates this week, some money managers said. The Fed will "try not to add gasoline to the fire by raising rates," said Kenneth Lynch, the head of fixed income at the Pitcairn Trust Company, which has about $200 million in bonds.
Other investors said the situation in Mexico would not be enough to stay the Fed's hand.
Fifty basis points "is pretty much in the bag," said Jonathan Francis, head of global fixed income at Putnam Investments in Boston, which has about $60 billion in bonds.
In other trading, municipal bonds were little changed even though fewer bonds are scheduled to be sold this week than last week, traders said. There are $416 million in bonds scheduled to be sold, down from $3.3 billion last week.
In the corporate market, Merrill Lynch & Company sold $150 million of five-year notes.
Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, sold $150 million of five-year notes at par to yield 8.375 percent, or 82 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note. The issue is noncallable.
Following are yesterday's results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.536	96.906	Discounted Rate	5.79%	6.12%	Coupon Yield	5.96%	6.40%	High Price	98.544	96.911	Discounted Rate	5.76%	6.11%	Coupon Yield	5.93%	6.39%	Low Price	98.534	96.906	Discounted Rate	5.80%	6.12%	Coupon Yield	5.97%	6.39%	Accepted at low price	19%	84%	Total applied for	$48,351,336	$49,563,010	Accepted	$13,459,197	$13,490,880	Noncompetitive	$1,409,668	$1,387,660	
Both issues are dated Feb. 2, 1995. The three-month bills mature on May 4, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 3, 1995.

HEADLINE: Spending and Incomes Both Up in December

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Consumer spending picked up in December, but a surge in incomes allowed them to save more, as well, the Commerce Department reported today, and the economy headed into 1995 with strong momentum and only scattered signs of slowing.
Incomes jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent in December after a one-tenth of 1 percent dip in November and registered the biggest gain in four years for all of 1994, the Commerce Department said. 
 While spending kept rising last month, it was by a modest three-tenths of 1 percent after increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in November and seven-tenths of 1 percent in October. The spending increase for all of 1994 was the lowest since 1991.
Personal savings climbed in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $245 billion from $219.5 billion in November. The savings rate, a figure widely watched by economists that shows savings as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 4.8 percent in December from 4.3 percent in November.
Analysts said the report offered scant evidence of an expected economic slowdown early in 1995 and was not likely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates this week for a seventh time in a year.
"Based on what I see, I'm not sure there's any convincing evidence of the economy slowing," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
"I would want to see a slowdown in income and spending first," Mr. Sohn added. He said that he expected the Labor Department to announce on Friday that 250,000 jobs were created on January on top of 256,000 in December.
If so, that would add to the impression that the Fed's bid to slow economic growth down to a pace less likely to fan inflation is taking much longer than anticipated.
Mr. Sohn and other analysts say that eventually costlier credit will cut the economy's growth by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow or to finance purchases.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that the nation's output of goods and services, or gross domestic product, expanded at a 4.5 percent annual rate in the final three months of 1994 -- the fastest quarterly growth in a year.
Mr. Sohn said he estimated the G.D.P. would ease to a growth rate around 3 1/2 percent a year in the first quarter, still higher than the 2 1/2 percent rate the Fed has indicated it sought to achieve through six interest-rate rises in 1994.
The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday to consider interest rate policy and is widely expected to announce on Wednesday a seventh rate increase to cool the expansion.
The president of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jerry Jasinowski, said he thought the economy was "on a glide path" -- a gradual slowdown over 1995.
"The slowdown in consumption in December is the first sign that the Federal Reserve's aggressive increases in interest rates are slowing demand," he said, predicting the trend would become more pronounced as adjustable-rate mortgages are renewed at higher rates.
Income from all sources, including wages and salaries as well as interest, rents and dividends, increased 6.1 percent for all of 1994 to $5.70 trillion. That was up from a 4.3 percent rise in 1993 and was the largest annual rise since 6.7 percent in 1990, department officials said.
Spending, by contrast, grew more slowly than in 1993.
Personal spending in 1994 was up 5.7 percent from 1993, when it grew by 5.8 percent. That was the smallest rise in annual spending since 1991, when it rose 3.8 percent, the department said.

HEADLINE: Fleet Offer Is Opposed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The outside directors of Fleet Mortgage Group are opposing a $191 million bid from Fleet Financial Group to purchase the mortgage unit's publicly held stock.
Thomas Hollowell and W. Whitley Hawkins, the only unaffiliated directors on the eight-member board at the Charleston, S.C., unit, rejected the $20-a-share offer as too low, according to a filing today by Fleet Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Fleet Financial, based in Providence, R.I., originally sold 19 percent of Fleet Mortgage's stock to the public in February 1992 at a price of $23 a share. Morgan Stanley & Company, as financial adviser to Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Hollowell, provided preliminary estimates stating that the publicly held stock should be worth $24 to $26 in a buyout, according to the S.E.C. filing.
But the Federal Reserve's effort to raise interest rates has cut mortgage demand, leading to a decline in the price of companies like Fleet Mortgage that originate and service such loans.
Fleet Financial's adviser, Salomon Brothers, valued the Fleet Mortgage stock at only $16.50 to $19.50 a share, the filing said.
Fleet Financial, which already owns 40 million Fleet Mortgage common shares, officially opened its offer today to purchase the 9.54 million shares held by the public at $20 each.

U.S. Steel Operating Profits Were Strong in 4th Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The U.S. Steel Group reported strong fourth-quarter operating earnings today, helped by the best steel market in two decades.
The results from U.S. Steel, a subsidiary of the USX Corporation, surpassed Wall Street expectations. But mild weather limited earnings at its sister companies, USX-Marathon Group, an oil company, and Delhi Group, a marketer of natural gas. 
 USX, based here, said U.S. Steel earned $90 million, or $1.11 a share, in the quarter as profits from operations nearly tripled. While the earnings were down from $124 million, or $1.67 a share, in the quarter a year earlier, the 1993 quarter included gains totaling $87 million from asset sales and other items. The most recent results exceeded Wall Street's estimate of 92 cents a share, based on a survey of 13 analysts by Zacks Investment Research.
"It was a great quarter and above everybody's expectations," said Chuck Bradford, analyst with UBS Securities Inc.
Still, shares of U.S. Steel fell $1.50, to $32, reflecting concerns about the effect of rising interest rates on economically sensitive companies.
The company said its steel shipments rose to 2.9 million tons in the quarter -- the highest level since the second quarter of 1989, when U.S. Steel had six primary plants, compared with three today.
U.S. Steel and other steelmakers also benefited from higher prices and increased efficiency at their mills.
But USX did not fare as well in oil. Marathon said higher oil prices and production helped increase profits in the fourth quarter but gains were limited by warm weather, which cut into heating oil demand, and the cost of introducing new, cleaner-burning gasoline as required by Federal regulators.
Marathon earned $37 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $88 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.4 billion from $2.9 billion.
Marathon stock fell 50 cents, to $16.
USX said fourth-quarter earnings at the Delhi Group fell to $1.3 million, or 9 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said profits were hurt by lower gas prices.
Delhi's stock was unchanged at $9.50.

HEADLINE: Thousands of Peruvians Flee Border Fighting

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TUMBES, Peru, Jan. 30

 BODY:
With bicycles, house fans and other household goods stacked in their pickup trucks, Peruvian civilians fled south from the Ecuadorean border to this city today as convoys of military trucks rumbled steadily north.
Fighting over a disputed section of the border is taking place in remote jungle 125 miles east of here, but there has been a heavy military buildup in this region, the most heavily populated stretch of the border. 
 By nightfall, an estimated 3,000 people evacuated from border villages had arrived, as well as hundreds of Peruvians forcibly deported from southern Ecuador. In a city that is only 15 miles south of the border, residents displayed their loyalties to Peru by flying the red and white colors of its flag.
"They gave us 24 hours to leave," said Dubelio Castillo, a Peruvian who fled here from Ecuador on Sunday. "There were threats of arrest if we did not obey. There is a lot of fear in the border towns, and that is why Peruvians are leaving Ecuador."
With troopships steaming up the Pacific Coast from Lima, residents on both sides of the border are bracing for an escalation in skirmishes that have killed nine soldiers and wounded at least 13 since Friday.
The border dispute dates back to the early 19th century, when the countries were left with vague maps as the Spanish empire broke up. In 1941, Peru won a 10-day war over the disputed area against Ecuador, its smaller neighbor. On Jan. 29, 1942, a peace treaty granted Peru 70,000 square miles of Amazon jungle. In recent years, tension has heightened around the anniversary date each year.
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States signed the treaty as guarantors, and today both sides agreed to attend talks on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro sponsored by those nations.
Ecuador renounced the treaty in 1960, and since then Ecuadoreans have grown up using maps showing the country's territory as extending about 200 miles east of the current border to the Amazon River port of Iquitos. In addition, Ecuador has flatly refused to recognize a 48-mile stretch of border that has been demarcated by international arbiters.
Ecuadorean officials said today that fighting had spread beyond that contested border area to other points on the border, which runs for 1,000 miles through Amazon rain forest and over Andean mountain ranges to the Pacific Ocean.
Peruvian forces hit Ecuadorean border posts with mortar fire and rockets fired from helicopters, and they said today that they had captured an Ecuadorean position on Sunday.
The Ecuadoreans said, though, that their forces had repelled the attack by five Peruvian military helicopters. In retaliation, the Ecuadoreans said, their planes bombed Pachacutec, a Peruvian border post named after an Inca king.
Peru's military acknowledged today that Ecuadorean forces shot down a helicopter Sunday, killing the five crew members.
"While an MI-8 helicopter was on a supply mission for our troops, and in our territory, it was attacked and shot down by an Ecuadorean missile," said the armed forces joint command.
With the war news, a wave of patriotism has swept Peru, which only recently emerged from 15 years of divisive guerrilla revolt. Ecuador has also been swept with patriotic fervor.
Today a Lima newspaper reported that former guerrillas of the Shining Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement had offered to fight alongside Peru's army. The guerrillas are reportedly battle-hardened veterans of jungle warfare in Peru's Amazon region.
Air-raid blackouts are being conducted nightly in Talara, a port city 100 miles south of here where one of Peru's most important fighter wings is based. To prevent spying, all commercial planes flying to northern Peruvian cities keep their passenger window shades drawn.
In Ecuador, teachers in schools across the nation conducted special flag-raising ceremonies today and lectured pupils on Ecuador's "Amazon rights."
With an economy half the size of Peru's, Ecuador announced today a series of war taxes, largely on vehicles and on banking transactions.
President Sixto Duran Ballen told a cheering crowd of 10,000 in Quito on Sunday, "Ecuador is united in front of the world, and in front of those who want to offend us."
"I said no to retreat because that has always been the road taken in the 164 years of our history as a republic," he continued. "Each time something like this happened, people asked Ecuador to retreat. This time we will not retreat."
A few hours later, Peru's Foreign Ministry reacted sharply, saying, "This assertion unmasks Ecuador's aggressive face."
In Washington today, delegates to the Organization of American States met to try to devise a way to stop the fighting here, the first time blood has been spilled in a Latin American sovereignty dispute since the Falkland war of 1982.
