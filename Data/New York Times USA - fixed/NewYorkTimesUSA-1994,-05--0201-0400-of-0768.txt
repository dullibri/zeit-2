HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
A Return to Amherst and the Pioneer Valley

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO

 BODY:
SPRING in the Pioneer Valley of central Massachusetts is a glorious affair; almost all the trees bear lacy pink and white flowers, and you cannot step out of doors without smelling their perfumes. Or so I recalled, having spent my student years at Mount Holyoke, one of the colleges - Amherst, Smith, Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts are the others - situated around the town of Amherst, a veritable New England Oxford. I had often contemplated returning is the valley to sample the season's pleasures, but had been deferred by the price. Renting a car from New York for three days costs almost $200, and even if you take the train to Springfield for a mere $51 round trip, you need to rent a car to reach the Five College Area. Amtrak offers service to Amherst as well, but the train, on its way to Montreal, stops in town at 2:40 A.M., and leaves for New York at 1:15 A.M.
 
 Last month, though, I called the Peter Pan bus company and learned that the round-trip fare between New York and Amherst is $37.95, with about 10 departures a day. The Amherst Chamber of Commerce helped me find a small local concern called North Amherst Motors where I reserved a car for $29.95 a day, and provided me with a list of lodging options, including the venerable Lord Jeffery Inn right on the town common, with 50 handsomely appointed rooms that rent for $80 to $120. As I was looking for something less expensive, I called several bed and breakfasts in the area and booked three nights in three different private homes for $40 to $65. Then I packed jeans, turtlenecks and clogs - if I could no longer be mistaken for a student, I could at least try to blend in - and boarded the bus at the Port Authority Terminal.
 It was pouring rain, and the trip north via New Haven, Hartford and Springfield was a boring four and a half hours long; but the bus driver treated his passengers like a brood of dizzy chicks, making sure everyone made the right connections. I spent much of the trip remembering how, as a very green freshman, I approached the area for the first time, also on a Peter Pan bus. As we neared Northampton (our first stop in the Five College Area), I saw fingers of dingy snow on the flanks of Mount Tom, crocuses in the mud at the bus stop and yellow-green coronas around the budding trees. Clearly, high spring was several weeks away; still, the interseasonal sogginess seemed a sign of life and raised another memory from my freshman year, that star of English Lit !, Cheucer, and a professor who delighted in reading aloud from "The Canterbury Tales."
 I was trying to remember what comes after "When that April with his shoures soote" as the bus stopped alongside Amherst Common. The gently sloping greensward is bordered by the gracious edifices of Amherst College, which was founded in 1821 by, among others, Noah Webster and Samuel Fowler Dickinson, grandfather of Emily.
 Both the town and the college were named for Lord Jeffrey Amherst, as his first name is usually spelled in reference books.
 A British Army general, he is said by some accounts to have devised a plan to decimate the Indian tribes of New England by infecting them with smallpox.
 Lord Amherst never visited the town and is hardly dearly beloved.
 Standing in a puddle, gazing at the mist-shrouded campus on the hill, I felt gratified to see that little had changed since the days when, with a heart full of trepidation, I used to come to Amherst for mixers. After a 10-minute walk through a neighborhood of lovely turn-of-the-century homes northwest of the campus where the poets Eugene Field and Robert Frost once lived, I arrived at the door of the Lincoln Avenue Bed and Breakfast, a capacious yellow Victorian with a broad front porch. There was no sign out front, and no one at home except a cat, though I had been told the owner would be there. The door, however, was unlocked, so I entered, a little like Goldilocks. Inside I found spotless polished wood floors, two front rooms almost completely devoid of furniture and a stack of business cards indicating that besides running a B & B, the mistress of the house taught yoga and practiced acupressure, presumably in the empty rooms.
 Hoping that there was more furniture in a bedroom upstairs, I left my bag and ventured back into the rain.
 I had a cappuccino and a slice of pumpkin bread for about $2.50 at a college hangout on the common called Bonducci's Cafe, noting that the students still favored the Lands' End look with holes. Then I cut a damp swath across the common, stopping at the Robert Frost Library, 750,000 volumes strong and one of the few modern buildings on campus, where I collected a Five College Calendar of Events and studied it. It was never too late to avail myself of the valley's cultural riches, I decided.
The Mead Art Museum, 200 paces beyond the library, came at the right price - free. It lies beside mighty Stearns Steeple, bereft of the church it pinnacked when it was built in 1873 (the church was demolished to make way for the museum); at intervals no one seems to be able to predict, chimes still resound from the steeple in memory of the college's Civil War dead. The museum is notable for its early American painting, for a protrait of a rather wan Lord Jeffery Amherst, by Sir Joshua Reynolds and the gorgeously paneled Rotherwas Room, built in 1611 in Herefordshire, England, and carted across the Atlantic for the Long Island Jacbean-style mansion of Herbert Lee Pratt, an Amherst benefactor.
 THE college's Museum of Natural History just to the south of the gallery (admission free) also bears the Pratt name, and is a pleasantly old-fashioned place, with glass-topped wooden display cases, two aquariums humming in the background and not a soul around when I visited. There I found three petrified dinosaur eggs and a topographical model of the valley, showing the low Holyoke Range to the south of Amherst, the great oxbow of the Connecticut River near Northampton, and a bit of the hill country stetching up toward New Hampshire and Vermont.
 As darkness fell, I returned to my B & B and met the people who lived there, Bonnie Novakov-Lawlor, barefoot and wearing a floor-length dress, her husband, Larry, a set designer and painter, and their young son, Josh. Bonnie showed me to my pretty room at the front of the house on the third floor, with a single sleigh bed, rocking chair, small desk and lace-curtained window. The large, immaculate bathroom, which I shared with two other guests, was several steps away, and had a clawfoot tub (with shower) and skylight: a terrycloth robe was provided to ease my passage down the hall. The place was homey - I could smell dinner cooking and hear the family at the table - and made me feel ike a grad student who had rented a room for the semester.
 I had dinner at Boltwood's Tavern in the Lord Jeffery Inn, less expensive than the hotel's formal dining room. A nicely presented grilled tuna steak and glass of California Merlot cost $19 with tip. However, I found better and more economical fare later at several of Amherst's cafes and ethnic restaurant, like Paradise of India on Main Street, where a heaping lunchtime portion of chicken biryani cost $5.25. Several doors down is the Black Sheep Cafe, a casual, woody place, with old Joni Mitchell songs piped in, delicious hazelnut coffee and a begulling pastry case. And at Bell's Pizza, near the University of Massachusetts, I was happy to learn that the tuna grinders (submarine sandwiches) are just as good as they used to be, not to mention just as cheap (about $3).
 That night I attended a concert called Women's Singing Traditions of New England in Buckley Recital Hall at Amherst for $12. It was nicely done, and the product of considerable ethnographic research, as the program explained, with female singers performing traditional music brought to this country by immigrants from French Canada, Bulgaria, Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Africa. But during the concert my eyelids drooped, and later I wished I had caught the "Five by Scorsese" film program across campus instead.
 The next day was devoted to touring, beginning with a job past Emily Dickinson's handsome brick homestead on Main Street (open by appointment), where I peeped in the window sacrilegiously, but caught no sight of the reclusive poet's ghost. After a nondescript breakfast at my B & B, Larry was kind enough to give me a lift to North Amherst. Motors, where I collected my ear, drove back to campus and took a tour of the college, led by an exuberant sophomore named Amanda, with wire-rimmed spectacles. The rest of the group consisted of a serious-looking young woman who had just been accepted by Amherst and her parents. As we traipsed across campus, I noted the new computer center and the bike path that leads all the way to Northampton, and learned that Amherst, which went coed in 1976, has a student body of 1,600, now about equality divided between the sexes.
 After the tour I browsed through the shops in the center of town, including the Jeffrey Amherst Bookstore, with a whole floor-to-ceiling shelf of volumes on Emily Dickinson, and stopped in at the Allen House Victorian Bed and Breakfast on Main Street, a B & B in a Stick-style Victorian home built in 1886. The Allen House, which has five bedrooms, all with private baths, was full when I called earlier in search of a room, which I really regretted once I saw the inn's hand silk-screened wallpaper, cherrywood maniels and glorious late 18th-century antiques, among them an Eastlake bed in which I yeared to sleep.
 And I ended the day with a visit to my alma mater, Mount Holyoke, in the hamlet of South Hadley, about 10 miles south of Amherst. Founded in 1837, it is the oldest women's college in the country, with a handsome campus designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted. There I paused by the grave of the founder, Mary Lyon, and thought about tender scenes from my past.
 I spent the night at the Northfield Country House, about 20 miles north of Amherst along Route 63, an idyllic country road perfect for biking. The B & B is a fieldstone and brown-shingle manor house secluded on a hilltop above the peaceful little town of Northfield. It has seven bedrooms that share four baths, a yawning stone fireplace in the living room and massive chestnut beams. My room had a double bed with a quilt spread and white wicker furniture, and the proprietor was graciousness itself, serving me a full breakfast the next morning and telling me about the hill towns' love affair with contra dancing, traditional line dances.
 After leaving, I toured two of the 13 restored Colonial-era homes in Old Deerfield Village, bought a pair of shoes in Northampton, took in the Monets, Picassos and Seurats at the Smith College Museum of Art, and strolled among the luxuriant greenery at Smith's Lyman Plant house. Exhausted, I bedded down in another B & B, called The Knoll, in the little town of Florence, just west of Northampton. Surrounded by 16 acres of farmland and forest, it was a peaceful spot, and my doubled-bedded room was comfortable, but I liked the tub in the bathroom down the hall best - it was so long I could stretch out in it fully. During my 13 hours at the Knoll, I took two baths.
 Really, though, I should have stayed in Amherst all three days of my visit, preferably at the Allen House; that way, I could have avoided renting a car by taking the free Five College bus that runs around the valley during the academic year. My lodging bill would have been roughly the same, about $175 for three nights, as would meals and entertainment, which cost me under $100 for three very full days; but my transportation expenses would have been $37.95 rather than $113. And I should have gone in May, just to smell that thickly perfumed air.
 But I'm not complaining: I still have my memories.

HEADLINE: Tyson Foods Behaved Properly With Clintons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With regard to "Mrs. Clinton Steps Forward" (editorial, April 24):
(1) The poultry industry is heavily regulated, but it is regulated primarily by the Federal Government, not by individual states. 
 (2) The tax credits you refer to were earned, not given, to Tyson Foods by Bill Clinton or the State of Arkansas. A few important points:
* These credits were received pursuant to legislation passed by the Arkansas General Assembly to foster economic development in the state.
* None of these programs targeted the poultry industry. They were, and are, available to any industry that spends money in the state to build new or improve old facilities or create jobs. One of the pieces of legislation passed in 1985 was enacted primarily to benefit the timber industry and International Paper Company specifically.
* Tyson Foods is only the fourth largest user of these credits, behind International Paper, Georgia Pacific and Nucor Steel.
* In Arkansas since 1985, Tyson has invested more than $300 million and created approximately 4,000 jobs to earn the credits.
* These programs are not substantially different from similar programs available in all the 49 other states. We are seeking sites for three new poultry complexes, and have received proposals from 150 communities in 25 states, all of them offering some form of economic development incentive. Many of them offer much more than Arkansas does. Yesterday, we announced a new plant to be constructed in Portland, Ind.
The relationship of Jim Blair, a Tyson lawyer, with Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Mrs. Clinton's commodities trading, had absolutely nothing to do with Tyson Foods.
The tax credits that we received were earned by the company's commitment to doing business in Arkansas, and they were certainly not the result of some sort of insidious activity or "Arkansas mores," as you imply.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT NAMES BLACK DEMOCRAT ADVISER ON HAITI

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
After a six-week review of an Administration policy that he said is no longer "sustainable," President Clinton appointed a well-known black Democrat today as his new special adviser on Haiti. The President also announced plans to allow Haitian refugees hearings at sea to determine whether they should be granted asylum.
Mr. Clinton said that the evidence of mounting political violence in Haiti made the new asylum policy necessary and asserted that the United States also considered it necessary for domestic and foreign policy reasons to use sanctions to force a return to democracy. 
 "The United States has clear interests at stake in ending this crisis," he said.
The new adviser on Haiti is William H. Gray 3d, the president of the United Negro College Fund and a former Congressman who served 12 years in the House of Representatives. Mr. Gray will replace Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the veteran diplomat and former Ambassador to Nicaragua who was forced to leave his post after efforts to oust the Haitian military Government failed.
By enlisting a prominent black political figure, the Administration hopes to ease domestic pressure and position itself to combat charges raised by Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that United States policy toward Haiti has been racist in outcome, if not intent.
Much of the detail for implementing the policy changes will now fall to Mr. Gray. It is unclear what his specific duties will be, or how he will work with Ambassador William L. Swing in Port-au-Prince.
Father Aristide pronounced the change in refugee policy "a step in the right direction." And Randall Robinson, the executive director of the TransAfrica Forum, whose 27-day fast to force a policy change had become a focal point for critics, ended the fast in response. [Page A7.]
Under current policy, Haitians are able to apply for asylum only in Port-au-Prince. Haitians caught on the high seas are returned to Haiti by Coast Guard vessels.
But today's action also highlighted the continuing problems with United States policy toward Haiti. Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader who led the coup that ousted Father Aristide in 1991, signaled in a televised interview that he would not resign to prevent the imposition of new United Nations sanctions set to take effect on May 21.
"The superior interests of the nation order me to favor always dialogue to reach a solution to this crisis," General Cedras said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
"Of course, he's going to say that," Mr. Clinton responded later in the day. "That's what he told us when he abrogated the Governors Island accord." Under the accord, reached last summer, the military agreed to hand over power to Father Aristide.
 
Using Larger Ships
 The United States has attempted shipboard processing of Haitians seeking asylum before, but officials rescinded that policy after the small Coast Guard cutters quickly became overrun with dehydrated passengers who spoke no English and were unprepared for the interviews.
Mr. Clinton said the new policy would address those logistical concerns by providing larger ships for the processing and seeking cooperation from friendly countries who would allow processing to be conducted on shore.
"We think we can do them fairly quickly, in a matter of a few days," Mr. Clinton said, "and then return those who should be returned and take those who should be taken into the United States."
Mr. Clinton appealed to a domestic and an international audience today as he declared that the United States had clear interests at stake in ending the Haitian crisis.
"We have an interest in bolstering the cause of democracy in the Americas," Mr. Clinton said. "We have an interest in insuring the security of our citizens living and working in Haiti. We have an interest in stopping the gross human rights violations and abuses of the military and their accomplices. And we clearly have a humanitarian interest in preventing a massive and dangerous exodus of Haitians by sea."
Father Aristide said the revised immigration policy did not go far enough. "It will not protect the millions of Haitian citizens who continue to face increased violence in Haiti," he said in a statement.
Mr. Clinton said today that the policy of returning refugees to Haiti, which he continued after initially denouncing it during the 1992 campaign, had worked well last year but had been outpaced by events. "I do not believe that is a sustainable policy, either practically or morally, given the level of indiscriminate violence," he said.
A White House official said the United States was still searching for countries to take part in the new plan. Putting it into effect will take at least two weeks, the official said.
Until then, Mr. Clinton said, all Haitians retrieved from boats by United States Coast Guard cutters would be returned to Haiti.
Mr. Clinton defended the United Nations decision to impose a full embargo on trade with Haiti, even though his advisers conceded that it would also create considerable hardship for many ordinary Haitians.
"While these stronger sanctions will cause more hardships for innocent Haitians, we must be clear," Mr. Clinton said. "The military leaders bear full responsibility for this action. They can stop the suffering of their people by giving up power, as they themselves agreed to do, and allowing the restoration of democracy and the return of President Aristide."
White House officials said that Mr. Gray, who will continue as president of the United Negro College Fund, would serve for 130 days as a unpaid temporary Government employee.
The 52-year-old Mr. Gray earned a reputation as a coalition-builder before he left Congress in 1991 to head the United Negro College Fund.
Mr. Gray left for South Africa today as part of the official United States delegation to the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President.

HEADLINE: Pressure Grows On Fed to Raise Rate Yet Again

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
For the fourth time in four months, the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise short-term interest rates. But its orderly plan to contain inflation might be disrupted by turbulence in the bond and currency markets, which is putting great pressure on the central bank to act more quickly and raise rates more sharply this time, economists said this weekend.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has signaled for a year, in appearances before Congress, an intention to raise interest rates before inflation begins to creep up again. But a spectacular rise in long-term interest rates on Friday and the sagging value of the dollar in international trading have shown a broad lack of confidence by many investors in the Fed's ability to control inflation, economists said. 
 As a result, they see the issue before the central bank as no longer whether to increase the short-term rates that banks pay to borrow money, but how early and how high.
Raising these short-term rates would dampen the potentially inflationary growth this spring of bank loans, and of the overall economy, since banks tend to make fewer loans and charge higher interest when they have to pay more to borrow money. Without low-interest loans, many companies could no longer afford to build factories and fewer individuals could afford to buy cars, slowing economic growth and inflation.
Higher rates could reassure bond investors, who worry that inflation will make their fixed, semiannual interest payments worth less over the years. Yet higher short-term rates are also likely to mean that consumers pay more interest on adjustable-rate mortgages, car loans and credit cards. While the Clinton Administration has reluctantly come to accept the need for some further increase in rates, Democratic members of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress warned on Tuesday that higher rates might not just restrain economic growth but stop it.
Higher rates for short-term loans, like the overnight borrowing by banks that the Federal Reserve most closely controls, also tend to produce temporary increases in long-term interest rates for mortgages and 30-year Treasury bonds. But in the longer run, which may mean months or years, higher short-term rates tend to hold down long-term rates by preventing banks from making so many loans that they fuel inflation.
The most common view among economists and former governors of the Federal Reserve who were interviewed this weekend was that the central bank would wait until the regularly scheduled meeting of its interest-rate policy committee on May 17 to raise rates again, partly because new figures on inflation in producer and consumer prices will be available by then.
"If they were going to raise rates on the basis of Friday's news, they would have done so on Friday," Lyle E. Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve, said today.
 
Larger Rate Rise Expected
 Mr. Gramley and other economists said the next increase in short-term rates was likely to be half a percentage point, compared with just a quarter-percentage point in each of the previous three moves.
An increase could come in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other, or in the key discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for overnight loans and which has remained at 3 percent, or in both rates.
The economists said that a further slump in the value of the dollar against other currencies could force the Federal Reserve to act sooner.
Some traders have suggested that investors could panic if the Federal Reserve does not move immediately to raise rates, but Wall Street economists tend to play down this worry. "If the Fed doesn't raise rates, there might be a few apoplectic analysts but the market will only erode a little bit," said Robert Giordano, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Steep rises in long-term interest rates clearly worry top Federal Reserve officials. J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and one of the 10 current members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said in an interview on April 29 that the level and stability of long-term interest rates were good measures of the central bank's effectiveness and credibility.
Mr. Broaddus and other members of the Open Market Committee have declined to comment in the last few days on financial markets.
The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds soared on Friday to 7.54 percent from 7.33 percent, the biggest one-day rise since just after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Rates rose after the Labor Department said the economy created 267,000 more jobs in April, a sign of strength economists had not expected.
 
Predicting Impact on Dollar
 If the Open Market Committee raises short-term interest rates, this might prop up the sagging dollar by encouraging foreign investors to buy dollars so as to invest in American bonds. If the committee waits and the dollar drops through key psychological barriers, like trading at less than 100 Japanese yen for the first time since World War II, then subsequent increases in rates might not succeed in pushing the dollar back up again.
A collapse of the dollar would feed inflation by making foreign goods more expensive in the United States. A lower dollar would also make it easier for American manufacturers to raise prices for goods that they sell in competition with imports.
But this analysis, which relies heavily on economic theory, has its critics. Some analysts have suggested that the anticipated effect on the dollar may be outweighed by the extent to which potential investors in the dollar have borrowed huge sums to bet on low interest rates. Another rise in rates could hurt these investors and leave them unable to continue to buy dollars, these analysts contend, causing the American currency to fall farther.
Federal Reserve officials generally pay less attention to the dollar's strength against other currencies than to long-term interest rates. The dollar can sometimes fall not because investors dislike the United States as a place to invest but because other countries may have made themselves temporarily more attractive through high interest rates or shrinking government budget deficits.
When it comes to monetary policy, "you ought to set your policy for what is right for you," leaving aside other countries' policies, Robert D. Laurent, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said.
Three times this year, the Federal Reserve has raised its target for the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. The first two increases, each of a quarter-percentage point, came at the last two meetings, on Feb. 4 and March 22. The most recent increase, another quarter-point, raising the rate to 3.75 percent, came halfway between meetings, on April 18.
 
Possibly, a Slow Period
 Financial markets may do the Federal Reserve a favor by quieting down in the next several days simply for lack of economic news. No Government agencies have scheduled the release of any economic indicators for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. According to a calendar prepared by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, no other such lulls of equal length have occurred or will occur this year.
If the Federal Reserve does raise rates, the odds seem excellent that the Fed will announce it, because of strong support for the idea among the Fed's top officials. Breaking with 80 years of tradition, the Fed has announced all three of its rate increases so far this year and is considering a permanent policy of doing so.
Mr. Broaddus said in Richmond that the announcements had not roiled financial markets excessively and showed that the Fed is more open than its critics have suggested. "There seems to me to be advantages to announcing our decisions more promptly," he said.
Alan S. Blinder, President Clinton's nominee to become the Fed's next vice chairman, said at his Senate confirmation hearing on Friday that he also favored prompt disclosure.

HEADLINE: Casinos Became Big Players In the Overhaul of Welfare

SERIES: Special Pleaders: A periodic look at lobbying.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Earlier this spring, Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, stood on the White House lawn and issued a threat. If President Clinton went forward with part of his contemplated welfare plan, he said, "I will become the most negative, the most irresponsible, the most obnoxious person of anyone in the Senate."
Nevada politicians are not known for being passionate about welfare. But Mr. Reid was incensed that the Administration was considering a gambling tax to pay for part of the plan, and he and other allies of the gambling industry around the country set out to do something about it. 
 Viewing the idea as an economic death threat, Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada, also a Democrat, flew to Washington in a panic; the Nevada delegation implored Congressional colleagues, and casinos hired prominent lobbyists at fees of up to $70,000 a month.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton put the Governor's mind to rest with a call to say he had abandoned the idea of the tax. The move was a turning point in the Administration's yearlong attempt to craft a welfare bill: officials said it meant that Mr. Clinton had decided to propose a smaller plan than some of his aides wanted, with about $3 billion less for new child-care programs.
White House aides play down the importance of the lobbying campaign, saying Mr. Clinton based his decision less on the merits of a gambling tax than on a desire to avoid any tax. "He ultimately made the decisions because he did not want a tax proposal of any kind," said Marcia Hale, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs.
Still, the potential alienation of four Senate Democrats, from Nevada and New Jersey, on this and other issues could not have been absent from the calculations. And the underlying story, at once quirky and commonplace, illustrates the way the capital is patrolled by vigilant, organized interests.
This may be the first time that casinos have helped shape welfare policy, but virtually every Government attempt to raise money or cut spending sets into motion similar campaigns from business or advocacy groups eager to protect their stakes. Often, as in the gambling debate, the efforts are led by former government officials, now earning lucrative livings as lobbyists. Just in the last few weeks, the White House has also been worked over by groups representing insurance companies and a coalition of nonprofit groups seeking to protect the rights of immigrants. The groups fear the welfare plan may be financed at their expense.
In the case of gambling, word leaked in March that the White House was seriously considering a possible 4 percent tax on gross gambling receipts. That is the amount casinos or horse tracks take in after paying winners but before paying other expenses, like salaries, rent or utilities. The Administration estimated the tax would raise about $3 billion over five years.
"I immediately flew back to D.C.," said Governor Miller in a telephone interview last week. As one of the first governors to endorse Mr. Clinton and the chairman of his Nevada campaign, Mr. Miller had a few political cards to play.
At a March 24 meeting, Mr. Miller and the state's two Democratic senators told Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, that the tax would devastate Nevada's most important industry.
They said the move could close 57 of the state's 189 gaming operations at a cost of 30,000 jobs -- with small gambling houses the most imperiled.
They followed up with a similar letter the following day, also signed by Democratic Senators Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, all of whom count race tracks or casinos among their constituents.
But the Nevada group also made a broader argument, intended to appeal to other states and to Mr. Clinton's sensibility as a former governor. They told Mr. McLarty that the taxation of gambling had traditionally been a state prerogative and that a Federal tax might bring similar encroachments into other state areas.
 
Lobbyists Join Fight
 The officials' efforts were followed by those of private lobbyists. At Senator Reid's suggestion, the Nevada Resort Association hired Paul Laxalt, a former Republican Senator. The group is paying Mr. Laxalt $40,000 a month to lobby Senate Republicans.
The association also hired Lloyd Hand, a former aide in the Johnson White House, for about $70,000 a month to lobby Senate Democrats.
Mr. Miller said that when he had returned to Nevada, he had called all 49 other governors, urging them to sign a letter to Mr. Clinton opposing the tax. Thirty-three of them did.
On April 25, before the letter was officially delivered, Mr. Clinton called Governor Miller and said the tax was dead.
"He said, 'You've made a very persuasive argument,' " Mr. Miller said of his talk with the President.
The Governor, who is up for re-election this year, convened a news conference within 15 minutes to share what most Nevadans regard as extremely good news.
Other lobbies embroiled in similar battles are hoping for similar results. Richard S. Schweiker, the president of the American Council of Life Insurance, has issued a statement threatening "a firestorm of protest" if the White House pursues a contemplated change in the tax on annuities. Mr. Schweiker is a former Republican Senator from Pennsylvania.
A coalition of nonprofit groups is fighting a possible White House proposal that would cut the amount of aid available to indigent immigrants.
The coalition has been highlighting the proposal's effect on Jewish immigrants from Russia, rather than Hispanics immigrants, who are thought to have less political power.
"It lets them go directly at Jewish members of Congress," said someone who has been lobbied.
For the casinos, the immediate threat is over, but the lobbying campaign is not. A publicist for Mr. Hand said this week that the coalition has hired Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, to do a state-by-state analysis of the impact of a tax, in case anyone else proposes one.
Asked how long he thinks this lobbying effort will last, Mr. Laxalt laughed and said, "We could be doing this for 15 or 20 years."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Policy Point Man Is a Quiet No. 2

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
In the days after he was elected, Rudolph W. Giuliani scratched the title of First Deputy Mayor out of the government organization chart. But he clearly has not eliminated the job.
To the contrary, Peter J. Powers, the shy, self-effacing Deputy Mayor for operations, has emerged over the last four months as the strongest second-in-command seen at City Hall in years, despite a profile so low that a police officer recently asked him for identification when he tried to enter the building. 
 He is the point man for Mr. Giuliani on both policy execution and on politics, roles that were traditionally split up in the Koch and Dinkins administrations, sometimes creating warring fiefs. And his 35-year friendship with Mr. Giuliani, dating back to their days in Catholic school, gives him an unrivaled authority rare in politics.
"He's not officially the First Deputy Mayor, but because of the nature of his relationship with the Mayor, in fact he is the first friend," said John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. "And we all treat him with greater deference than anyone else."
It is as if the two men are alter egos, Mr. Giuliani the public persona, Mr. Powers the private one; one man setting policy the other carrying it out; one man constantly storming the talk-show circuit, the other so contained that he can seem to be rationing words. And the symbiosis has won praise from such unexpected quarters as Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat, who said he knows that a message delivered to Mr. Powers gets directly to Mr. Giuliani, without a separate agenda or ego interfering.
It was not what the insiders had predicted.
On the December day when Mr. Powers was named to office, his hands clutching a prepared statement to read before a bank of television cameras, political savants predicted that the tax lawyer would be a rank amateur in the rough-and-tumble politics of City Hall. They also said the job would strain the relationship between him and the Mayor as surely as the Clintons have become estranged from the Arkansas friends who followed them to Washington.
But Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Powers both say Mr. Giuliani's two pressure-filled campaigns for Mayor, with Mr. Powers as his campaign manager, had already taught them that their friendship would not wane. "In '89 that was my biggest concern -- would it affect our personal relationship?" Mr. Powers said. "We both felt it had not."
And so far, though Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Powers share a level of combativeness jarring to other civic leaders accustomed to more civility and compromise in governance, their missteps have not been grave. And it is too early to tell whether the style, over time, will cow potential adversaries into submission to Mr. Giuliani's policies or leave enough political wounds and quiet enemies to come back and haunt the Mayor.
 
Dodging the Limelight
 There is nothing flamboyant about Mr. Powers, a lifelong Republican whom Mr. Giuliani describes as an "old-fashioned conservative" who believes in fiscal constraint. Though he is usually watching nearby whenever the Mayor is publicly coping with crisis or stage-managing success, he stays out of the limelight, standing as if he would simply prefer to blend into the wall.
He has City Hall's premier power office and a commanding view down the building's main corridor, where one can watch the milling of lobbyists, journalists, City Council members and all the seekers of government's special favors. But he keeps his door closed and unlike Norman Steisel, his predecessor in the Dinkins administration, rarely stands surveying his kingdom.
Inside the office, his computer is programmed to carry a large rotating message in blue, like a personal Times Square electronic billboard, endlessly blinking "Power on Loan," to remind him, he says, that his power and position are temporary, subject to the voters' approval.
His voice is low and his style is discreet to the point of being secretive when he is questioned about the inner councils of the Giuliani administration. Press him for an example of a moment when he has disagreed with the Mayor and he will demur that there are "a few examples but I just never like to talk about them publicly." Ask him what is the most wrenching budget cut the administration has decided on to close the city's $2.3 billion deficit, and he declines again to answer. Ask him if it is true that he is more conservative than Mr. Giuliani and he laughs and replies: "I don't know. I can't answer that."
 
'I Would Not Deny That'
 Even when he does give away information, he does so with phrases like "I would not deny that," as if he cannot quite bring himself to confirm a detail of the inner workings of government.
But inside the administration, he is such a force that the one recurring criticism of him is that he is too controlling. He is the adviser the Mayor counts on as a sounding board in times of crisis, relying on his instincts on matters like the recent unrest on Staten Island after the death of 22-year-old Ernest Sayon in police custody.
"When I was figuring out what to do about Staten Island, I made sure to talk to him four or five times," Mr. Giuliani said. "And when we went out there, I made sure he was there. He gave me an independent assessment of who are the people you can rely on, and who are the people you couldn't rely on." Mr. Giuliani is a hands-on Mayor, intimately involved in decision-making and setting his administration's policies. But much of the Mayor's job is to meet the public, stopping at schools and ribbon cuttings, giving luncheon addresses, and making the rounds of political dinners. And Mr. Giuliani trusts Mr. Powers to be the one left behind at City Hall to see his policies are being carried out.
 
Court of First and Last Resort
 And so it was Mr. Powers who was the first and last level of appeal for many of the commissioners seeking relief from the job reduction targets imposed on them by Mr. Giuliani's budget director, aides said. Only highly sensitive debates, like those concerning the Human Resources Administration, went on to the Mayor, though Mr. Powers said he also brought each one of his decisions to Mr. Giuliani "so he could bless it."
Mr. Powers was the Mayor's chief negotiator the weekend a feud with Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines was patched up, with Mr. Powers almost turning up late that Saturday for his own 50th birthday party. He personally lobbied City Council members recently in a futile effort to stop a bill that would give the Council the right to hold hearings on the administration's privatization initiatives. And he is the one the state's Republican and Liberal Party leaders reach out to when they want Mr. Giuliani to appear at a political event like the state Republican convention later this month in New York City.
Administration officials say Mr. Powers has also emerged as a troubleshooter, the one to carry problems to Mr. Giuliani, the one to try to argue him out of a position the staff feels is wrong, and the one to lighten meetings with humor when they become too intense. "Peter can be blunt with the Mayor," said Cristyne F. Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary. "He's the closest person to him other than Donna," she said, referring to Mr. Giuliani's wife.
For his part, Mr. Powers said simply: "I'm not afraid of losing my job if I give him bad news. I don't know if anybody else is, but I know that I'm not."
 
A Zealot to Some
 Though some City Council members and their aides see Mr. Powers as a zealot, unable to handle dissent, Giuliani advisers describe him as flexible, open to ideas, and sometimes more willing than the Mayor to reach out to a rival.
Aides say Mr. Powers recently tried to get Mr. Giuliani to invite Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President and a potential mayoral challenger, to a news conference on domestic-violence initiatives that borrowed heavily from a report by Ms. Messinger and another Democrat, City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge. Three times Mr. Powers went back at the Mayor, finally smiling and saying "At the risk of offending you, I'd really urge you to reconsider."
"Anyone else in the Cabinet might have tried two times," said one aide, explaining Mr. Powers's self-assurance in dealing with Mr. Giuliani. "Peter tried three times." The Mayor, however, refused.
Mr. Powers has also moved to shield administration members from blame, when he thinks it is unwarranted, as he did last month when Mr. Dyson came under siege by editorial writers who criticized a $50 million offer the city made to prod the Metropolitan Transportation Authority into completing the deal to sell the New York Coliseum to the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman.
Since Mr. Zuckerman also owns The Daily News, which endorsed Mr. Giuliani in his campaign last November, the critics suggested that his administration was providing special favors for the developer.
Although Mr. Giuliani scuttled the offer and told reporters it was Mr. Dyson's idea, Mr. Powers quickly told the Mayor that the idea was his.
"I didn't want anybody taking heat for my mistakes," Mr. Powers explained. "I went and said, 'Look, this was mine. John and I were kind of batting ideas around. I came up with this idea and we both liked it, but this was mine.' "
 
'Laying Down the Law'
 But he is not always magnanimous. Mr. Powers can be tough when needed, said administration officials and aides who worked with him as campaign manager, adding that to cross him is to risk losing access to Mr. Giuliani. "I've heard him laying down the law to commissioners -- you will do this -- with the clearly implicit tone that there are other people available," said one Giuliani administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
When Mr. Powers wanted balky Council Republicans to defy the Speaker and vote against the City Council's operations budget as too high, he sent Jack Lynn, the administration's lobbyist, to the lawmakers with a crude anatomical suggestion, according to one Republican who was there. The gentle Mr. Lynn has since been told he is being shifted to another position, and Council members say he told them that he and Mr. Powers had a stylistic difference.
Though an outsider to government until now, Mr. Powers already sounds much like one of the policy wonks who held his job in administrations past, as he speaks of the intricacies of government and the management challenges. Asked to tell of the greatest risk he had taken, he points not to any of the administration's bruising battles over budget or policy, but to a decision to move a prison cooking operation from Rockland County back to New York City. He volunteers that what he is most proud of is his work immediately after a plane ran off a runway at LaGuardia Airport to get the Parks Department to drop its opposition to a long-planned runway extension.
"If I had any doubts, it is very governable, the city of New York," Mr. Powers said recently, his first four months behind him. "I'm convinced of that. It's very governable."

HEADLINE: Businessman Appears to Oust 'Old Guard' in Panama Election

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PANAMA, May 8

 BODY:
A left-of-center businessman who remade the image of his party after its disgrace under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has won Panama's first democratic elections in more than a quarter of a century, according to exit polls and early official results this evening.
The expected victor, Ernesto Perez Balladares, 48, an American-educated banker and former Government minister, overcame the stigma attached to General Noriega by recalling the image of another former dictator, Gen. Omar Torrijos. 
 With nearly half of the vote counted by midnight Eastern time, Mr. Balladares had more than 33 percent and declared victory. "The elections are over now, the campaign is over now," he said in a brief declaration, adding that he would seek to assure that Panama is "a free country, an independent country, a sovereign country."
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the widow of the former President, Arnulfo Arias, who was elected in the last open election in 1968 before being overthrown by the military, was projected to come in second with 28 percent.
Placing a distant third was Ruben Blades, a salsa singer and Hollywood star.
The election comes just five years after General Noriega's ouster in a United States military invasion and is a stinging defeat for Panama's traditional elite, which was handed power after the invasion.
Mr. Balladares has promised a growing economy with more jobs and a greater role in public life for Panama's middle and lower classes.
Most of the early returns were from rural areas, where Miss Moscoso was strongest, and exit polls indicated that nationwide, Mr. Blades and his party, Papa Egoro, or Mother Earth Party, would win nearly a quarter of the vote.
Mr. Blades offered many Panamanians the promise of an end to racial and economic elitism in a country that is ethnically diverse but starkly stratified.
In helping to rebuild General Noriega's political base, the Revolutionary Democratic Party, Mr. Balladares carefully distanced himself from the former dictator, recently calling him the worst leader since Panama's independence from Colombia in 1903. General Noriega is serving a 40-year prison sentence in Florida for drug trafficking.
Mr. Balladares achieved success by taking up the mantle of the late General Torrijos, the party's founder and a former military ruler, who remains a national hero.
Among those voicing hope in Mr. Balladares was Pedro Garcia, a 38-year-old voter in San Miguelito, a hilly neighborhood that was the scene of intense strafing by United States forces in the 1989 invasion.
"There is runaway unemployment and runaway corruption here, and Toro is the only one who can stop that," Mr. Garcia said, referring to Mr. Balladares by his nickname, Bull, for his imposing build. "Toro bore no responsibility for the Noriega era."
After decades of deep involvement in Panamanian affairs, the United States seemed to have no clear favorite in the vote.
"For 150 years, for the United States, the result was more important than the process here," said Richard Millet, an expert in Panamanian history at the University of Southern Illinois, who came to Panama as an election observer. "Now it is the process that matters, because if the process works right, it gives results we can live with."
With recent elections marred by wholesale fraud or by bitter and tense campaigning, today's vote seemed remarkably settled. Panamanians turned out in large numbers early in the day and the process was widely reported to have been orderly.
Among 1,200 international and Panamanian observers was a team of about 30 led by former President Jimmy Carter. "Reports from the various observers and officials all suggest that everything is going well," Mr. Carter said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Lower in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, May 9

 BODY:
Japanese stock prices were modestly lower here today. Well into the afternoon trading session, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 71.31 points, or 0.36 percent, to stand at 19,791.16. On Friday, the index rose 1.49 percent. Today, stocks fell at the opening, propelled by Friday's news, according to traders, of stronger than expected job growth in the United States and fear of inflation. But the traders cited optimism that the dollar had stopped falling against the yen, as the result of support from many nations' central banks, saying they expected this to help stabilize stock prices.

HEADLINE: Freshman Withstands Volley of Calls on Guns

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif., May 7

 BODY:
Connie Szeibl was having fun. The threats from opponents of gun control, the invective, the words she had to lower her voice to repeat: she typed them up faithfully -- "you jackass" and all -- and passed them on to her boss, Representative Steve Horn.
"You don't know the threats we received," said Mrs. Szeibl, who is the the Congressman's district director and who rarely hears such colorful language in the normal course of business. "For four days we did nothing but answer phone calls, one after another after another." 
 The House's vote on Thursday to join the Senate in banning 19 assault weapons was a baptism in political hysteria for the freshman Republican, who remained uncommitted on the ban until the last day.
In the end, Mr. Horn was one of 2 of the state's 22 Republican representatives to vote for the ban. He said his decision reflected the views of a constituency deeply worried about guns in the hands of criminals.
 
Gun Lobby Seemed Far Away
 A vote for the bill risked the retribution of the gun lobby, but in fielding all the phone calls, his staff drew the conclusion that the muscle of the National Rifle Association often seemed far removed from the concerns of his constituents.
Calls did pour in from other parts of the state. Mrs. Szeibl's office here in the 38th District received 781 of them in three days, most of them heatedly against the ban.
"Most of the threats are, 'Go find another job, dear,' " Mrs. Szeibl said."They say: 'He'd better watch out when he comes into the district. We're all coming down and make sure that he doesn't get re-elected. He's not going to get any money from the Republican Party.' "
The Congressman recounted in an interview today: "One person said, 'I'm 83 years old and I'm going to go into every precinct in your constituency and campaign against you.' That's what a lot of my colleagues are afraid of."
What makes the National Rifle Association threats more frightening, he said, is that the group may attack a candidate not simply on gun control issues, but also on issues of more immediate concern to most voters.
But the callers from within this ethnically and economically diverse, mostly Democratic district, where rising crime has become an obsession, were 80 percent in support of the ban, Mrs. Szeibl said.
And when Mr. Horn returned home for the weekend for informal meetings with constituents, the issue was hardly raised.
At the home of John Simons, a Hungarian immigrant who is a retired machinist, the Congressman stood by the fireplace and fielded questions from about 20 people on health care, the deficit, budgetary controls, crime, the recession, military base conversion and illegal aliens.
Mr. Horn, who was president of California State University at Long Beach for 18 years before entering politics, answered with the careful precision of a professor.
 
No One Asked About Vote
 Afterward, Marsha Moode, a guest who has a political affairs program on a local cable television channel, said: "I think it's fascinating that they just took the vote on guns and no one in this room has asked about it.
"Anyone who says a word against the vote almost seems to be advocating violence in the streets. We are talking California politics here. Californians feel such a terrible sense of crime. Everyone's putting a double lock on their doors. When I parked my car outside here, I looked around to see that everything was all right."
Another guest, Bob Collins, a retired machinist, said he owned several rifles and shotguns and enjoyed trap shooting.
"I believe in the right to keep 'em and bear 'em and this and that, but not the assault weapons," said Mr. Collins, who said that as a retiree he could no longer afford his membership in the National Rifle Association.
The only guest who approached the Congressman on the issue was Harry Kemmerer, a retired engineer. "I thanked him for his vote," he said later.
Mr. Horn's second visit was to the home of Patrick G. O'Healy, a commercial real estate developer, in an affluent, gated community where guests could wander between the swimming pool and the table of hors d'oeuvres.
None of the people here, mostly Republicans, seemed unduly concerned over the Congressman's vote on assault weapons.
The host, Mr. O'Healy, was a case in point.
"Right after the riot I bought a little teeny gun, a Beretta 22-caliber pistol, kind of like a self-protection gun," he said. "I've never used it. I've never even carried it. It's still in its original grease. I'm not sure I would have the ability to shoot somebody. It's the Rambo fantasy."
Then, he led a reporter up the carpeted stairs to his comfortable bedroom, where he took from their hiding place two other loaded pistols, a .357 magnum and a Glock nine-millimeter. "I'm not sure why I really bought them," he said, feeling their heft in his hand and laying them gently on his four-poster bed.
"Quite frankly, I think this country would do well to eliminate all handguns," he said. "If it weren't for the fear of someone coming in with a handgun, if it weren't for the protection, I would never have bought a pistol."
Looking back at the week, Mrs. Szeibl talked of her strategy for handling the passionate phone calls.
"It is so emotional for these individuals," Mrs. Szeibl said, "that if we contradict them in any way it only inflames them. We let them vent their emotion and their anger.
"Many from out of the area were upset that they would not have their guns to shoot in the desert and in the woods. I asked them, 'But what do you shoot at?' They said, 'We shoot at trees.' I said, 'Why?' "

GRAPHIC: Photo: The offices of Representative Steve Horn, Republican of California, received hundreds of calls, pro and con, before last week's House vote to ban some assault weapons. But when he returned to his district to meet with constituents, as he did in a home in Downey, the subject hardly came up. (Ed Carreon for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Embassy in Haiti Doubts Aristide's Rights Reports

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Although President Clinton reaffirmed his support of Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide today, the United States Embassy in Haiti asserted in a cablegram in April that the exiled Haitian President and his supporters were exaggerating and even fabricating reports of human rights abuses.
The cablegram, signed by Ambassador William L. Swing and sent to Secretary of State Warren Christopher on April 12, acknowledges that violence by criminal elements in the Haitian police has sharply increased in recent months. But it suggests that the situation is not as bad as reported by Father Aristide, his followers, non-governmental organizations, an international monitoring mission in Haiti and the news media. 
 "The Haitian left, including President Aristide and his supporters in Washington and here, consistently manipulate or even fabricate human rights abuses as a propaganda tool," says the cablegram, which consisted of 11 pages and was drafted by Ellen Cosgrove, the human rights official at the embassy.
 
Undermining U.S. Credibility
 It adds that they are "wittingly or unwittingly assisted in this effort" by non-governmental human rights organizations and by international civilian monitors with a joint mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
At the same time, the embassy expressed deep frustration with the Administration's handling of the effort to restore Father Aristide to power, complaining that the decision to pull back a United States troop ship last fall emboldened the military and undermined Washington's credibility.
"Opting for an easier ride early on has led to a very rough ride in the here and now," the cablegram said.
The cablegram, which was made available by people who believe that the embassy has played down the extent of human rights violations, also reflects the deeply held view in the Administration that most of those seeking political asylum are economic migrants posing as victims of persecution.
 
Distrust of Aristide
 Since the cablegram was sent, the Administration has moved toward a tougher position against the Haitian military and criticized its human rights record more strongly. But the cablegram reflects a dislike and distrust of Father Aristide that has been widely felt in the Administration -- though voiced only privately -- and has complicated efforts to formulate a new Haiti policy.
Asked whether the cablegram reflects the Administration's policy, Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, said it represented one in a series of cablegrams "intended to give a balanced treatment of a complex human rights situation."
"As in some documents," she said "certain portions taken out of context could be read by some as biased or misinterpreted."
But to Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, "it shows that at least in the embassy there is an extreme antipathy for Aristide and a willingness to play down human rights abuses to prevent a political momentum to build for his return."

HEADLINE: Texas Capital Ends Benefits For Partners

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., May 8

 BODY:
By nearly 2 to 1, voters here have repealed a policy providing health insurance benefits to the live-in partners of homosexual and other unmarried city employees. With the vote on Saturday, Austin, one of roughly 20 cities with such benefits, became the first to repeal its policy.
The passage of Proposition 22, an amendment to the city charter, means that health insurance will again be offered only to employees' legal family members. Christian groups that backed the measure said they would push repeal efforts in other cities with similar policies. 
 The chief group that sponsored the proposition here, Concerned Texans, said the benefits represented a perversion of traditional family values. Spokesmen for homosexual rights groups called the repeal vivid proof of anti-gay bias in a city known as the most liberal in Texas.
Austin provided the benefits for 98 unmarried companions of city workers after the City Council approved the policy in September. The benefits will be canceled as of Monday.
Many voters said support of the measure did not mean that they were condemning homosexuals. With a recent property-tax increase on their minds, they said the vote was simply a way to save $104,000, the city's estimate of the annual cost of providing the extra insurance.
"I don't believe it's gay bashing at all," said Marty Guarino, a retired printer. "I don't care how some people want to live, but I just don't want to pay for it."
 
Dispute With Apple Computer
 The vote in Austin comes on the heels of a controversy late last year in neighboring Williamson County, where commissioners initially voted to deny tax breaks to Apple Computer because the company had extended benefits to unmarried partners of its employees. The decision was reversed after Gov. Ann W. Richards pressured the commissioners to reconsider.
A slowly growing number of cities and companies have been providing domestic partner benefits.
But the Rev. Charles Bullock, pastor of the Christ Memorial Baptist Church and the founder and president of Concerned Texans, said the Austin vote demonstrated a strong if not always vocal majority opposed to what he called irresponsible spending and morals.
"The grass roots are bypassing their leaders and saying we're going to vote and we're going to vote conservative," he said.
Just how much of a push Austin's vote will give to other groups remains to be seen. Repeal efforts for such policies in Seattle and San Francisco have failed in recent years. New York City's program, which was negotiated by the Dinkins administration and municipal unions and took effect in January, has never been put to the voters.
In Austin, some voters said they were less concerned about benefits going to homosexuals than they were about heterosexuals who were nothing more than friends taking advantage of the program: of the 98 employees who have registered their partners, 29 have listed same-sex partners, according to the city's Human Resources Department.
 
'Let Them Get Married'
 "Why should I have to pay for them to live like that?" said Rebecca Kunz, a 29-year-old homemaker who voted for Proposition 22. "Let them pay for it or else let them get married."
But Hugh Strange, a spokesman for the Mainstream Austin Coalition, which opposed Proposition 22, said that arguments that casual friends of city employees had been taking advantage of the benefits were false.
"It takes more information to register as a domestic partner than it does to apply for a marriage license," he said. People could be prosecuted for perjury or lose their city jobs if they lied about their partners.
Still, the final margin on Proposition 22 certainly seemed definitive: 51,475, or 62 percent, in favor, to 31,082 votes, or 38 percent, against.
In the bitter fight before the vote, each side accused the other of getting large amounts of money from out-of-state organizations.
In an interview today, Mr. Bullock played down any assistance his group might have received from the Christian Coalition or the American Family Association, two national Christian groups that Mr. Strange said had been active in the battle.
While proponents of the measure said the benefits program was an unnecessary expense for taxpayers, others cited the controversy in Williamson County and said the local economy might be threatened if Austin acquired an aura as a place unfriendly to homosexuals.
"Austin is known as an open city and it should stay that way," said Bruce Salzer, director of finance for the State Land Commissioner's Office. "Companies like Apple Computer won't do business here if we try to dictate to their employees how to live."

HEADLINE: Can Both Wealth and Justice Flourish in a New South Africa? Two Old Foes Think So.

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, South Africa, May 8

 BODY:
A fiery-eyed union leader with a Trotsky beard, Jay Naidoo is the chief proponent of Nelson Mandela's plan to ease the misery of South Africa's black majority by transforming the apartheid bureaucracy into an engine of houses, jobs and decent schools.
Derek Keys, a heavy-lidded boardroom wizard who has spent the last two years as President F. W. de Klerk's Finance Minister, is the country's ranking apostle of low-spending, business-friendly Government. 
 At a glance, the two men hardly seem meant for the same planet. But in a few days they will be members of the same Cabinet, sharing the new Government's trickiest assignment: to lift the lives of the newly enfranchised electorate without bringing down Africa's richest economy.
 
Housing, Jobs and Education
 In interviews as Mr. Mandela prepared to assume the presidency in a celebrity-studded inauguration on Tuesday, the two men agreed on the general goals of the "reconstruction and development program" that Mr. Mandela says is his minimum promise to the poor.
The program, scaled down after wide consultation with the business establishment but still ambitious, calls for building 1 million homes and creating 2.5 million public service jobs before the next elections, in 1999, and for providing 10 years of decent, free education for all children.
The men agreed, too, on the danger of bleeding the affluent whites who run the economy and of scaring away investors.
But as they talked, it was possible to hear the first strains of a debate that may soon test the unity of this unity Government.
"I have no difficulty with the program insofar as it represents a direction," said Mr. Keys, whom Mr. Mandela has invited to keep the job of Finance Minister in the new Government. "The biggest thing that has to happen is that it still has to be fitted into what can be done. In the course of that you're going to sacrifice fair parts of it. You can't do everything." The African National Congress that assumes the balance of power this week is no longer the collection of Marxists and economic populists, nationalizers and redistributors that once terrified white business.
Mr. Naidoo, who is to be Minister Without Portfolio in charge of the reconstruction plan, speaks with apparent conviction about "sustainable growth" and the "disincentive effect" of high taxes. He and other economic ministers in the Cabinet listen to an eclectic chorus of advisers, but seem most influenced by market-oriented mentors here and in the United States and Europe. They have signed international trade and borrowing commitments that bind them to honor free markets. They have retained Mr. Keys.
But many wonder how long the congress's new-found market faith -- and the spirit of consensus Government -- will survive when the demands of business and the poor begin to conflict.
"One doesn't know what the reaction will be to failure," said Mr. Keys when asked if he trusts Mr. Mandela's pro-business conversion.
Mr. Naidoo, in turn, does not want the new Government to be taken for African Reaganites. "To think that we are going to solve our problems in South Africa on a sustainable basis through economic populism is a fairy tale," he said.
"We have learned from the experiences of the rest of the world," he said. "But at the same time, there's no way you are going to have economic growth here that continues to benefit just a small minority of people.
"Unbridled free-market systems have failed under Reagan and Thatcher. A Government has got to intervene to create an environment where people's basic needs are met."
There is also a stress on restitution in the new Government that does not sit easily with the capitalists Mr. Keys represents.
In South Africa, said a Stellenbosch University economist, Sampie Terreblanche, 5 percent of the population, mostly white, owns 88 percent of the wealth. That is nearly double the concentration of wealth in the 10 richest Western countries.
Mr. Naidoo rejects, for now, the proposal some of his allies were floating last year to narrow the economic gulf by taxing the accumulated assets of the rich.
But Mr. Naidoo makes clear his sufferance of what he calls the "selfishness" of the rich could end if they resist the new Government.
"The rich need to look at what is their contribution going to be," he said. "We would prefer to do things by agreement rather than being prescriptive."
 
Economy Long in Decline
 The economy the African National Congress inherits is just emerging from 20 years of decline, battered by sanctions, drought and recession. Productivity is low, investment has been neglected, unemployment -- mainly among blacks -- is more than 40 percent. The Government has been bloated and wasteful, and the isolated, cartel-dominated economy has lost the habit of competition.
On the other hand, the country is developed beyond any other in Africa, and its economic system is, as Mr. Keys observes, "as tough as old boots." It has weathered the economic equivalent of the Biblical plagues, yet economic activity and business confidence are higher than before.
"That's not a drifting economic wreck," Mr. Keys said.
The problem, everyone agrees, is how to make the economy grow faster and create jobs. Mr. Keys estimates 4.5 percent annual growth of the economy is needed to stand in place, without even reducing the unemployment rate. This year, growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent.
"We don't have low wages to offer," Mr. Keys said. "The Congress of South African Trade Unions" -- which Mr. Naidoo has run since 1985 -- "set its face against that. The market in southern Africa is likely to grow slowly. You have to get investment up. That means you have to attract entrepreneurs. How do you attract entrepreneurs if you can't offer them low wage costs?
 
'It All Costs Money'
 "You can devise Government programs, incentives, to create conditions for investment. But it all costs money, in competition with your social policies. So that's the nub of the difficulty."
Mr. Naidoo said the main focus would be to educate and enrich the disadvantaged majority, thus offering investors a skilled work force and a great market of new consumers.
Mr. Naidoo insists that the social programs outlined in the reconstruction manifesto can be squeezed from the existing budget.
"We put this forward not as an add-on expenditure," he said. "It's really a growth and development strategy."
The new Government will get some money, he said, from an "apartheid dividend" -- streamlining the redundant bureaucracies that served the different races under apartheid. Segregated school systems and housing programs will be consolidated.
Military spending, he estimated, would be cut by a third over two years, and the defense force's hospital system and youth training ability would be turned to civilian uses.
Mr. Keys questions whether the savings will be as abundant as Mr. Mandela's advisers think. Part of the bargain that brought the congress to power is a promise to protect the jobs of white civil servants and soldiers.
"Well over half of Government spending is the salaries of civil servants," he said. "All of those civil servants' positions and remuneration and so on are guaranteed in terms of the interim constitution. You can't go in and fire half the staff. You have to turn people from doing one set of tasks to doing a different set of tasks. And the inertia involved in that process is quite substantial."
Mr. Keys favors business incentives like tax-free, union-free "export processing zones" where companies could produce goods for sale to Europe and North America.
Mr. Naidoo strongly disagrees, seeing such zones as sanctuaries for "fly-by-night speculators."
"That's not consistent with the democracy that we've just achieved in our country," he said. "We must never reduce ourselves to the type of one-dollar-a-day environment that exists in the south of China."
 
An Issue in Next Election
 Disputes over the economy could strain the unity of the Cabinet, especially as the parties begin to position themselves for the next election.
"If one is a minister then one will be following the Cabinet's policy," Mr. Keys said. "But at a certain point before 1999 it will certainly be necessary for the party that has put one in Parliament to define a different position, so that the voters will have a choice. That seems to me a pretty tricky operation."
Against that, Mr. Naidoo and Mr. Keys point out that the Mandela Government starts out with a flourishing culture of negotiation, including several national forums where unions, business leaders and politicians pursue compromises on economic policies and social programs.
Mr. Naidoo added: "Derek Keys is an ex-businessman. I'm an ex-unionist. We know how to negotiate."

HEADLINE: Mississippi's University System Going on Trial

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ITTA BENA, Miss., May 5

 BODY:
With its flat-roofed, spartan buildings shimmering under the harsh Delta sun, Mississippi Valley State University, established 44 years ago "to train Negro teachers and provide vocational training for Negroes," looks like a no-frills military installation.
Less than 50 miles away in Cleveland is Delta State University, where stately pin oaks shade manicured quadrangles and gabled buildings. The university was founded 70 years ago to educate whites. 
 The sharp contrasts between the two state universities and indeed their continued existence are at the heart of a Federal trial, scheduled to begin on Monday in Oxford, Miss., on just how far Mississippi should go in desegregating its higher education system. Students at Mississippi Valley State, which has 7 whites in its enrollment of 2,300, and the Justice Department are challenging a state plan to close the university and merge it with Delta State.
The plan stems from a 1992 Supreme Court decision, which held that the state's higher education system was still segregated some 30 years after the flagship University of Mississippi was ordered to accept its first black student. The ruling, based on a 1975 lawsuit by a black student named Jake Ayers challenging the disparity in financing black universities and white ones, left it to the Federal courts to work out what a desegregated system of higher education would look like.
 
Effects for 18 Other States
 For the opponents of the closing of Mississippi Valley State, Mississippi's compliance with the law is a cruelly paradoxical twist to what was an effort to upgrade the state's historically black public colleges. But the state said it had no choice.
The outcome here is likely to affect 18 other states that maintained segregated colleges, in some instances well into the 1960's. To date, none of the 38 historically black state colleges and universities in the 19 states that had dual systems have been closed or merged, said Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional Education Board.
A critical issue is just how the historically black institutions will be treated in an era when their formerly all-white counterparts often attract the cream of black students and when the competition in state legislatures for scarce dollars is intense.
The 1992 Mississippi decision, legal experts said, was to higher education what the 1955 Brown v. Board of Education case was to elementary and secondary education.
"After Brown and in the 60's we as a nation had some consensus about integration at the elementary and secondary school level," said Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at Harvard University. "But we have never had any such consensus until now when it comes to higher education."
 
'Justify or Eliminate'
 The Supreme Court said that Mississippi, and by extension other states, had to do more than cease discrimination by race in admissions to its five historically white and three historically black universities. It had to examine its 60,000-student state-financed system and "educationally justify or eliminate" all traces of its old dual system to make sure it was not continuing to foster segregation.
This meant questioning the rigid reliance on standardized test scores for admission, the duplication of programs and the establishment of "mission assignments" for the various institutions. And the Court even challenged the continued existence of identifiably white and black colleges, even if black students preferred to attend historically black institutions.
Years ago, legislatures in Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and most of the other 19 states tried to address the historical segregation first by aggressively seeking black applicants for the all-white colleges and universities and then by increasing the financing of historically black institutions. Most of the 19 states broadened the undergraduate and graduate programs in the black institutions in an effort to attract white students, but with only modest success.
In February, however, the Federal Department of Education warned the other 18 states that their progress toward desegregation was now subject to review on the same basis being applied in the coming Mississippi case. That standard would be used, the Federal officials said, regardless of what past court-ordered or federally approved desegregation plans required of the state in integrating both its white and black colleges and universities.
 
'A Tough Sell' to Whites
 Amid court pressure to re-examine the continued existence of any racially identifiable colleges, there is a powerful constituency that believes that the historically black institutions have earned the right to exist for their own sake and continue to serve thousands of black students with potential who would be passed over by other colleges. And in the competition with formerly all-white institutions to stay afloat by attracting a diverse student body, Mississippi Valley State is at a disadvantage, Mr. Musick said.
"It's rural and isolated, and even if you pick the most idyllic campus you can imagine and transplant it to Itta Bena, it's still a tough sell to attract white students," he said.
"Our history says we are the cotton-patch college but we have managed to survive fiscal neglect over the years out of sheer determination and to educate leaders for the state," said Dr. Roy Hudson, the university's vice president and himself a graduate of Mississippi Valley State. "We are in the unfortunate position of having to ask the courts to make us a legitimate part of this educational enterprise in which we have succeeded in spite of barriers."
Officials at Delta State are not enthusiastic about absorbing their neighbor. They argue that with a 25 percent black enrollment among its 4,000 students, the university is the state's most racially mixed institution of higher learning. Administrators and students say that a merger would harm both colleges.
 
Negotiations Collapse
 Last-minute negotiations for an out-of-court settlement collapsed last week..
Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents much of the Delta, said students at black colleges feared that they would bear the heaviest burden in this desegregation, just as they did with the integration efforts in elementary and secondary schools. In those efforts, he said, it was largely black institutions that were closed and black teachers and administrators who lost jobs in the competition with white counterparts.
In addition to the closing of Mississippi Valley State, the state proposes maintaining the historically black Alcorn State University campus in Lorman while moving its administration to Mississippi State University in Starkville and the upgrading of programs and buildings at nearly all-black Jackson State University. The University of Mississippi would see little or no change.
W. Ray Cleere, the state's Commissioner of Higher Education, said Mississippi was having to take the heat for the Justice Department's failure over the years to address segregation at black colleges and universities while it aggressively pressed for the integration of formerly all-white colleges. Part of the result was the recruitment by those colleges of the top black students, leaving the historically black institutions with those black students in need of the most financial and academic help.
"Mississippi Valley is a weak institution," Mr. Cleere said, "but not because of any lack of devotion or drive on the part of everyone there. It has survived and done a good job when history has limited the resources it had available." But, he added, "that should not stand in the way of making higher education more efficient."
 
Story of Survival
 There have been previous efforts to close Mississippi Valley State, mainly to cut costs. But even that argument has lost some power as the state has gained revenue from an improved economy and from newly legalized riverboat gambling.
In recent years, because of tight budgets, Mississippi Valley State has not been able to fix its leaking roofs. A laundry building sat empty for four years because money was not appropriated for washers and dryers. Only now is an air conditioning plant being built to cool dormitories.
The university also suffered academically. Its degree programs were cut to 17 from 31. Enrollment plunged in the mid-1980's, but then rose. Only in the last five years, Mr. Hudson said, has the university begun to get some of the additional money it needs.
Faculty salaries, which average $35,000 for full professors, are below Delta State's $40,000 average. And Mississippi Valley State is limping along with a graduation rate of about 28 percent, compared with about 50 percent for Delta State and most other formerly all-white colleges.
But the Mississippi Valley State students insist that the encouragement that they get could not be duplicated at at a largely white college. Gwen Granderson, a senior who transferred to the mostly white Mississippi University for Women only to return to Mississippi Valley State, said that although the institutions were about the same size there was a big difference in the atmosphere.
"Here it is a lot more personal and there you are just a Social Security number," she said. "I participate more here. My father went here and he knew then and I know now that with just a little more effort and help, this could be a really fine school."

HEADLINE: Ex-Communists Leading Ballot In Hungary

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, May 8

 BODY:
Hungary's former Communists, swept from power four years ago, appear likely to be the dominant partner in a new coalition government after voting today in the first round of parliamentary elections.
With more than 80 percent of the vote counted, the Socialists, as the former Communists have renamed themselves, led with 32.7 percent; their likely coalition partner, the Alliance of Free Democrats, stood at 19.8 percent. 
 The governing right-of-center party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, led by Prime Minister Peter Boross, stood at 11.6 percent. The far right group, led by Istvan Csurka, which last year was seen as a threat to Hungary's stability, managed only 1.3 percent.
The sharp swing to the Socialists, who got only 11 percent of the vote in 1990, reflected disenchantment with economic conditions across a broad section of society. Hungary's gross domestic product has fallen 20 percent in the last four years as exports of agricultural and other goods collapsed and factories cut production.
 
The Communist Resurgence
 But while many Hungarians became poorer, a few became conspicuously richer, causing considerable resentment in a society that had become accustomed to a sort of egalitarianism under 40 years of Communism.
The composition of the Government will not be decided until a second round of voting on May 29, when there will be runoffs in districts where no candidate wins today.
By bringing the former Communists back to power, Hungary becomes the third country of the old Soviet bloc to throw out an anti-Communist Government. Poland voted last fall for former Communists and an agrarian party allied with the Communists; Lithuania is also now governed by former Communists.
Investors do not seem worried about the prospect. Some investors say they hope for more dynamic economic policies. Several diplomats, concerned about the increasingly nationalistic voice of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, said they expected a toning down of the stridency. They said they viewed Gyula Horn, 62, the leader of the former Communists, as a pragmatic politician.
 
Sanguine View From U.S.
 "Even though the road map and driver may change, the ultimate destination -- a democratic society, market economy and full integration with the West -- remains the same," said the United States Ambassador, Donald M. Blinken.
The early returns indicate that the character of the Government in Hungary will be slightly different than in Poland or Lithuania. In a coalition of the Socialists and the Free Democrats, the former Communists would be balanced by a party formed in 1990 by urban intellectuals active in the anti-Communist opposition.
In the last weeks of the campaign, the two parties tacitly accepted their likely partnership, with both sides apparently burying the animosity they held toward each other in the 1980's.
Even though the Socialists would be the senior member of the coalition, it is not certain that Mr. Horn would be Prime Minister. Mr. Horn did not run as the prime ministerial candidate of the Socialists, apparently because his background as a member of a Communist Party militia that helped suppress the 1956 uprising provided too much of a campaign target for his opponents.
 
The Next Prime Minister
 There has been speculation that the relatively unknown leader of the Free Democrats, Gabor Kuncze, 44, a former engineer and plant manager, would emerge as Prime Minister. Mr. Kuncze proved to be a popular campaigner, with ratings were far above those of Prime Minister Boross.
Mr. Horn was the last Foreign Minister of Hungary under the Communists and is considered to come from the reform wing of the party. He made the decision in 1989 to allow about 20,000 East Germans to cross from Hungary into Austria, a move that helped precipitate the fall of the Berlin wall. Mr. Horn, who was badly injured in a car crash on Thursday, was operated on today for a wrist fracture, and did not vote.
The economy seemed to be the dominant factor in the voting. But in interviews outside polling places, voters who cast ballots against the Hungarian Democratic Forum said they were also angered by the rightist nationalist ideology that the Forum increasingly emphasized.

HEADLINE: Hunger Strike on Haiti: Partial Victory at Least

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Day 27 turned out to be the final day of tomato juice and water for Randall Robinson.
Mr. Robinson, the executive director of TransAfrica Forum, a research and lobbying group, had adopted the liquid diet to protest the Administration's policy of returning refugees to Haiti without hearings on asylum. In the last week, particularly after he was hospitalized for a day for dehydration, reporters increasingly asked whether the fast was worthwhile -- a question that irked him. 
 Today, 13 pounds lighter but triumphant, Mr. Robinson said the answer was clear.
"I never doubted that it was worth it," he said. "No matter what the outcome, it's worth it always to try. It's better when you're successful, but it's always worth it to try."
 
Call From Key Clinton Aide
 Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, called late Saturday afternoon and told Mr. Robinson the Administration would interview Haitians fleeing their country to determine who were political refugees, and would not automatically send all of them back to Haiti. But Mr. Robinson said he would not end his fast until the Administration publicly announced its policy today.
This morning Mr. Robinson, 52, played down his fast as pivotal to the Administration's policy shift.
"I expressed my own opinion, but obviously if it was a lone opinion it wouldn't have done much," he said. "I think it dramatized and facilitated the concerns of many across the nation, people who came to learn of this cruel policy through coverage of the hunger strike. If the Administration reacted, I don't think it was so much from me, but Americans who reacted."
Some, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, felt otherwise. In an interview on the ABC News program "This Week," Mr. Quayle said, "This is foreign policy by a hunger strike, and that is not the way to conduct foreign policy."
 
'Terrifying,' Family Says
 Friends and family said Mr. Robinson would have continued his liquid diet if there had been no action on the refugees. His wife, Hazel Ross-Robinson, said the fast had been "emotionally traumatic and terrifying" for the family. She said that she did not tell the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Khalea, when her father was hospitalized last week. Mr. Robinson also has a daughter, Anike, 22, and son, Jabari, 19, from a previous marriage.
Friends and acquaintainces say Mr. Robinson, though occasionally discouraged, always believed that Mr. Clinton would remember his campaign promise to help Haitian refugees and change his initial policy, which was largely adopted from the Bush Administration.
Last Friday, Mr. Robinson said he never dwelt on what would happen if that faith was unfounded. He said that when he was growing up in Richmond, his parents told him, "You don't do things because they're successful, but because they're right."
For a man who fasted nearly a month, the 6-foot-5-inch Mr. Robinson, whose normal weight is 195 pounds, looked surprisingly well.
 
No Burger Yet
 During his fast, in his basement room, Mr. Robinson could be funny, joking about tips from people who undertake fasts for their health and his new obsession with an advertisement for a hamburger with mushrooms, bacon and cheese. For his first meal, however, he chose dinner with his wife, a staff member of the House Armed Services Committee, at their favorite Chinese restaurant.
Mr. Robinson said he would spend the coming week focused on the logistics of the new asylum policy.
"The last time the Bush Administration tried this, and it was a cursory, farcical undertaking," he said. "We have to look at this process closely this time, to make sure that it meets minimal standards for fair hearings."
 
Beware Emotionalism
 Few Washington officials doubt Mr. Robinson's commitment to foreign policy issues. Aside from his work at the TransAfrica Forum, he is a private man who eschews the limelight. In a city of compromises, his is an unusual personality.
"I respect any man who puts his life on the line, but it's an issue that can easily become very emotional," said Lawrence A. Pezzullo, the former special envoy to Haiti, who was forced to resign last month. "It puts pressure on the Administration."
Mr. Robinson first came to national attention when he and few others began daily protests at the South African Embassy in 1984. The protests called for economic sanctions against the white Government and prompted other demonstrations. In 1986 Congress passed the Anti-Apartheid Act over President Reagan's veto.
In "High Noon in Southern Africa" (Norton, 1992), Chester A. Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Reagan Administration, wrote of his frustrations with Mr. Robinson's opposition.
"He cherished the imagery of confrontation, both before and after the protest began," Mr. Crocker wrote. "He made a point of canceling, boycotting or walking out of meetings scheduled between concerned black Americans and Administration officials. He wanted attention and confrontation, not communication."
But the protests have also been cited as one of the actions that helped lead to international ostracism of South Africa and eventually to last month's open elections.
And Mr. Clinton said today that while his Administration's policy review began before the fast, he respected Mr. Robinson's "conviction and courage and his conscience."

HEADLINE: Seoul Journal;
Nuclear Fears? Korea's Noodle Sales Say No

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 8

 BODY:
Signs everywhere in this city proclaim that 1994 is "Visit Korea Year." Never mind that a North Korean official declared a while back that Seoul might be turned into a "sea of fire."
Even as the nuclear standoff with North Korea approaches its next showdown, people in Seoul are enjoying a warm spring and a reinvigorated economy. Many South Koreans say they do not believe that a war will come or that North Korea would ever use an atomic bomb, if it has one. 
 "People talk about it so I guess it's a dangerous situation, but I really don't feel it," said Bang Young Gyu, a 24-year-old who was visiting Yongsan Family Park here the other day.
Every few minutes, a military helicopter roared directly over the park, swooping in for a landing at the American military base just beyond a wall. But Mr. Bang and hundreds of others proceeded with their picnics and dodge ball despite the deafening noise. The scene was, in a sense, symbolic of the way South Koreans are going about their lives despite the military threat from the North.
In years past, people here say, even a hint of war sent consumers rushing to stock up on dried noodles. But this year, noodle sales did not shoot up even after the "sea of fire" comment in March when North Korean officials walked out of talks with South Korean delegates at Panmunjom, threatening war if Washington and Seoul mounted a pressure campaign.
Young people seem especially oblivious to the situation. Bae Soon Hoon, an electronics executive, said his 16-year-old daughter's high school English teacher had asked the class what the initials N.P.T. stood for. The teacher was shocked when not a single student could identify the nonproliferation treaty, which North Korea is suspected of violating with a nuclear weapons development program.
After being lectured about their ignorance, the students countered by stumping the teacher with some initials more important to them -- K.F.C., for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
A senior official says the South Korean Government has been trying to avoid alarming the public to prevent panic and the hoarding of food. The Government also does not want to scare away foreign investors or visitors as it pushes a campaign for tourism or to dampen celebrations marking the 600th anniversary of Seoul's designation as the nation's capital.
So far, South Korea seems to be surviving the scare. Some people have canceled their visits, a Government spokesman said, but the impact on tourism has not been devastating. The stock market weakened this year as foreign investors stayed away, but it has largely recovered.
Despite the calm in Seoul, political and military leaders here say the confrontation with North Korea could get worse. On Wednesday, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea, in perhaps his strongest warning to date, said his Government's patience with North Korea "has reached a limit." He said North Korea risked "self-destruction" if it continued its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, Lee Hong Koo, South Korea's newly appointed minister in charge of North Korean issues, said action against North Korea by the United Nations Security Council would be "unavoidable" if the North Korean leadership failed to cooperate with international inspections of nuclear installations.
Mr. Lee said it was unclear whether North Korea had already started to change the fuel in the reactor at Yongbyon, 60 miles from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
Tensions have also been rising because North Korea declared its intention to annul the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953 and replace it with a peace treaty that it would negotiate directly with the United States. Washington and Seoul oppose this idea.
In what was viewed here as a show of its contempt for the armistice agreement, North Korea last week blatantly violated the pact by sending two platoons of heavily armed soldiers into a border zone for a few hours. It also withdrew its representative from a commission that oversees the truce. These actions prompted President Kim to order South Korean troops to increase their vigilance.
But details of the tactical back-and-forth between North and South were lost on many people at the park.
"When we look at the 9 o'clock news, it's really difficult for us to make a judgment about what's going on," Hwang Jae Ho, 41, said.
Mr. Hwang, who works for a heavy-machinery company, said it might not be all bad if North Korea did have the bomb because South Korea would inherit it after the inevitable reunification.
"It's sort of like having an older brother who's very good at fighting," he said.
Many of the people in the park, which once was the golf course of the main American base in Seoul, are happy to have the American troops around just in case, even if the helicopters do intrude on their picnics.
But many college students vigorously oppose the presence of the troops, saying the United States is contributing to tensions here.
"I really do think that we and the North Koreans are the same people," said Che Kyung Hui, a 22-year-old student at Kangnam College, who was visiting Yongsan park. "Even if North Korea had a mindset to start a nuclear war, the target would not be us but the Americans."

HEADLINE: Tempest in Court: An Ousted Judge;
Metuchen Officials Want More Fines From Municipal Court

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: METUCHEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Metuchen calls itself the "brainy borough" of central New Jersey, a haven of petite streets, petite stores and grand self-esteem. It hardly seems like one of those fabled backwaters where out-of-towners are summarily ticketed to fatten the coffers of the local chieftains.
But that was the impression that lingered recently after some officials in Metuchen squashed the reappointment of their municipal judge because, they suggested, he had failed to wring enough fines from his part-time court on Main Street, which handles traffic violations, petty theft, zoning disputes and other offenses too trifling for the judicial big leagues. 
 Their apparent reasoning has roiled the legal waters across New Jersey, drawing a rare rebuke from the state's chief judge and kindling a debate over the relationship between justice and money in the state's localities.
"It's an attack on the basic fairness that we expect in our legal system," said James B. Smith, 51, the Metuchen judge whose eight-year tenure ended after he was likened to a vice president of marketing who had neglected the bottom line. "I couldn't believe why they did it and then I couldn't believe it when they actually came out and said it in public."
But the officials who ousted Mr. Smith said they had been badly misunderstood. They said they never tried to meddle with the court in this wealthy borough of nearly 13,000, which got its nickname decades ago because of the many residents who worked nearby at Princeton and Rutgers Universities. What they wanted, these officials said, was to cut the court's expenses so that it would operate as efficiently as some of its counterparts around the state.
At the root of the disagreement was a recent survey by The New Jersey Law Journal that contained some very enticing statistics for local officials hard pressed by the recession and cuts in state aid. The survey found that municipal courts can be wellsprings of money, sometimes yielding three or four times what it costs to run them.
The municipal court in Hoboken, for example, took in $2,895,209 in 1992 on only $636,855 in expenses, a 355 percent return. Over all, the 567 municipal courts in New Jersey took in $135 million and spent $70 million in 1992, The Law Journal said, for a rate of return of 93 percent.
 
Below Average Return
 The Democrats who control the Metuchen Borough Council seemed irritated to learn from the survey that their court was below average, earning a 31 percent return -- $152,501 in revenues on $116,483 in expenses. The nearby Borough of Middlesex, whose population is similar to Metuchen's, had a 102 percent return, taking in $196,256 on expenses of $97,332.
So in late March, when Metuchen's Mayor, Susan Marshall, a Republican, nominated Mr. Smith, a Democrat, for another three-year term, the Council balked. Thomas Sullivan, the Democratic Council President, compared the court to a poorly performing corporation, according to a tape of the meeting provided by Ms. Marshall, who was eager to pin the blame for the furor on the Democrats.
"I believe that it is possible for us to maximize and do a better job for our taxpayers with this court, and the place where you start usually is at the top," Mr. Sullivan said on the tape. "And I think it's time to bring in a new corporate vice president."
Another Democratic member, Barbara Buono, said, "It is incumbent upon the Council in these tough economic times to explore innovative ways to increase our revenues to stabilize property taxes." She later added that "the taxpayer is not getting the biggest bang for the buck."
 
An Unsuccessful Appeal
 About two weeks later, when Ms. Marshall was on vacation, the Democrats replaced Mr. Smith with their own candidate, Lydia Kuhn, a lawyer. Mr. Smith, who has a private law practice here, unsuccessfully appealed the move to the Middlesex County Superior Court.
But his removal did touch off protests from residents and lawyers around the state. William H. Gazi, a trustee of the New Jersey State Bar Association who is a municipal judge in Piscataway Township and Highland Park, resigned as a substitute judge in Metuchen. And the state's Chief Justice, Robert N. Wilentz, issued a statement calling Mr. Sullivan's comments "intolerable."
"It puts cash on the scales of justice," Mr. Wilentz said. "It encourages what amounts to judicial misconduct. It threatens judicial independence and undermines the public's confidence in municipal courts."
Mr. Sullivan, 34, a reporter for Dow Jones, the financial services company, said he regretted equating the court to a corporation. But he said his comments had been wildly misconstrued and he maintained that Ms. Marshall was keeping the fight alive to make the Democrats look bad.
"We take our responsibility to increase the efficiency of government very seriously," Mr. Sullivan said. "We felt to achieve those goals it was time for a change. We wanted somebody to take a fresh look at the situation and that required a fresh face. To say that we wanted to turn the entire town into a speed trap is ludicrous and loathsome."
Ms. Marshall, 37, an administrator at a Roman Catholic high school in Metuchen, said Mr. Sullivan was being disingenuous, pointing out that the Democrats had never indicated any problem with Mr. Smith before the journal's findings were publicized.
"For him to deny that he had any other spin on it is a lie," Ms. Marshall said. "The whole thing is horrible. We are being characterized as a town where justice is for sale."
Some legal experts said the criticism of Mr. Smith was unfair because municipal judges, who can rule on offenses with a possible punishment of less than six months, assess fines under guidelines set by the Legislature, the State Supreme Court and the localities. Aggressive policing tends to have a greater impact on fines than aggressive judges, they added.
And Mr. Smith, who was paid about $13,500 a year as judge in Metuchen, said the statistics in The Law Journal could be misleading because municipalities calculated their expenses differently. He noted that when he served as judge in nearby Dunellen in 1992, the court there took in revenues of $63,874 on expenses of $29,618, a 116 percent rate of return.
The legal experts were divided about the extent of inappropriate political influence on the municipal courts. One prominent trial lawyer active in the state bar association, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was "floored" by The Law Journal's figures, as well as their ramifications.
"What took place out in the open in Metuchen happens every day elsewhere," he said. "Many municipal court judges do not get reappointed for reasons that are never talked about publicly. One is that they have not generated enough money. The other is that they do not back up the police."
In recent years, the Legislature has considered changing the system by giving municipal judges tenure, similar to that of judges on the county-level Superior Courts, who are named by the governor to a seven-year term and receive tenure if reappointed. But the proposal has faced stiff opposition from local officials who say it is their right to choose judges.
Ann Bartlett, chairwoman of the state bar association's judicial administration committee, said she believed that most municipal judges were able to resist pressure from those who select them. But she said she still favored tenure.
"The benefits of tenure far outweigh the interests of municipalities in maintaining their political autonomy because the political autonomy is what is invariably linked to influence-peddling," she said.
Such changes might soothe tempers in Metuchen, where residents like Daniel P. Spiegel said they were disgusted with both factions. Mr. Spiegel, 30, a mortgage banker who as a Republican served on the Borough Council in the late 1980's, said the other day that the Mayor and the Council should stop bickering and ask the county or the state to appoint a new municipal judge, even though Ms. Kuhn has said she is confident that she will be able to be fair and impartial.

HEADLINE: U.S. Businesses Flocking to Brazilian Ventures

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, May 5

 BODY:
Business people from the United States are flocking to Brazil in a new display of confidence that economic ties between the two giants of the Americas will now revolve around trade and investment.
Even before Brazil's $49 billion commercial debt was rescheduled on April 15, Brazilian and foreign businessmen detected the thundering hoofs of United States investors and exporters. 
 Sao Paulo, a state with an economy larger than Argentina's, has seen a string of business announcements in recent weeks: Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank, is to open an office here; J. C. Penney, the retailer, is to start a catalogue mail order business, and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, is opening an advertising agency. Later this year, Wal-Mart Stores is expected to open a discount store in Sao Paulo, its first in Brazil.
"It started last year -- then, all of a sudden, these guys are all over us," said Barry J. Gluck, a United States partner of the Brazilian office of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, referring to the estimated 300 business people from the United States who now visit Sao Paulo each day.
 
Symbol of New Interest
 Indeed, as bankers lined up in New York to sign Brazil's foreign-debt deal, United States exporters and investors in Sao Paulo were already exploring the new United States Trade Center, a freshly minted aluminum-and- glass building that symbolizes the new business relationship.
International business interest in Brazil is rising as investors increasingly look beyond the nation's two prominent drawbacks -- a 45 percent monthly inflation rate and a chronically weak central Government -- and see a Latin American economy the size of Russia's.
But while Russia is struggling to recover from the collapse of Communism, Brazil's economy is growing this year on the shoulders of a record grain harvest of 74 million tons, a forecast of an unprecedented output of 1.5 million automobiles, record foreign currency reserves of $37 billion, a healthy trade surplus and a growing appetite for United States imports.
"Russia should only hope to have Brazil's problems," said Paula Stern, an international economist based in Washington. "I'm sensing a new excitement about Brazil."
By relaxing rules and slashing taxes in the early 1990's on profits sent overseas, Brazil stimulated new investor interest, especially in franchising.
"Australia and metropolitan Sao Paulo have about the same population -- 18 million people," Michael K. Lorelli, president of Pizza Hut International, calculated during a visit here in early April. "In Australia, we have 434 Pizza Huts. In Sao Paulo, we have 38. I don't see any reason why we can't double here every two years."
In the last two years, franchising grew in Brazil by 30 percent a year. Economists predict that in 1994 and in 1995, United States franchises alone will expand by 20 percent a year in Brazil.
With United States companies swarming into a once-restricted market, Sao Paulo's fast-food consumers can now choose among Domino's Pizza, Arby's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Within a year, Taco Bell and Pizza Inn are to enter the market and McDonald's is to open its Latin American training center here, Hamburger University South.
Brazilians, who drink 1.4 billion gallons of soft drinks a year, constitute the world's third-largest soft-drink market, after the United States and Mexico. Opening an aggressive new front in the cola wars, Pepsi-Cola plans to open a new $25 million bottling plant in Rio de Janeiro this year, part of $90 million in investments planned by Pepsi through the end of the decade.
Brazil was long a closed market but abolished its list of banned imports in 1990. Over the last decade, it has slashed average tariffs from 78 percent to 14 percent, near the regional average. In response, foreign imports jumped 25 percent last year, hitting $25 billion. This year, they are expected to jump 20 percent more.
 
Narrower Trade Gap
 For the United States, which is Brazil's largest trading partner, this means that the United States' trade deficit with Brazil is expected to drop by half this year, to less than $1 billion.
"It's a new ball game here," said Richard R. Ades, a Commerce Department official who heads the new United States Trade Center here. "The trade gap is narrowing. A lot of American companies are coming down here to appoint distributors."
The number of United States business executives using the services of his office is running at four times last year's level, Mr. Ades said. Last year, 12 official United States trade missions visited Brazil, four times the number in 1992.
United States exports to Brazil increased by 10 percent last year and are expected to rise another 15 percent this year. Underlining Brazil's new importance to United States exporters, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown will visit Sao Paulo late this month to dedicate the new trade center.
Analysts predict that United States-Brazilian trade will grow steadily in two areas -- computers and tourism. Brazil's imports of United States-made computers and peripherals appear likely to grow by 30 percent a year through 1995. And with more than 700,000 Brazilians expected to visit the United States this year, Brazil could become the fifth-largest source of foreign tourists, after Japan, Germany, Britain and France.
"Brazil has the most dynamic private sector in Latin America," said William R. Rhodes, the Citibank vice chairman who led the creditor banks in the renegotiation of Brazil's foreign debt.
 
A Government's Troubles
 The healthy Brazilian business sector contrasts with its sick public sector. Brazilian executives look to the Government with low expectations.
To beat inflation, which reached a record 2,500 percent last year, economists say that Brazil needs to close its budget deficit by cutting Government spending and by collecting more taxes.
Tax collection is up by one-third over last year's levels. But Congress has been reluctant to cut spending with elections looming on Oct. 3. Brazil's President, Itamar Franco, whose term winds up at the end of this year, recently signed a measure allowing for the return to work of 108,000 federal employees dismissed during the previous Government.
A privatization program cycles along at a modest pace. One state company has been sold so far this year. In May, auctions are to be held for a state shipping line and for the state aircraft manufacturer. In June, seven state petrochemical companies are to be auctioned to private bidders.
A new economic plan to reduce inflation before the presidential election was disclosed in March by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who subsequently resigned as Economy Minister to run for president as Mr. Franco's successor.
"It's a plan of electoral opportunism," said Paulo Rabello de Castro, chairman of SR Rating, a new credit rating company in Rio de Janeiro. "Inflation could go down to 5 or 10 percentage points. But that is nothing new; Brazilian governments have already done that several times. But it won't be permanent."
If the plan is successful in the short term, it will probably set off a consumer spending boom, sending Brazil's growth rate back up to the 5 percent registered last year. But if Mr. Cardoso's plan fails, the election will probably be won by his foremost rival, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a socialist who has led opinion polls by a 2-to-1 margin over any challenger, including Mr. Cardoso.
When Mr. da Silva visits New York and Washington this week, he is expected to reassure United States investors that he supports foreign investment, free trade and the recent reworking of Brazil's foreign debt.
 
Beyond Politics
 Yet the flow of investment suggests that many Brazilian and foreign business people are gambling that there is limited damage a new president can do, whatever his ideological stripe. While few Brazilian business executives back Mr. da Silva, Brazilian and foreign companies here are going ahead with investment plans totaling $45 billion for this year, the highest level in five years.
"Even with its mind-boggling inflation last year, the economy grew by 5 percent in real terms and the manufacturing was up 9 percent," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, who visited Sao Paulo last month.
"The business community is optimistic that Brazil is about to turn the corner," said Mr. Garten, a former New York investment banker. "Business is booming. Foreign investors are clamoring to get in."

For a Haitian Legion

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Here is my secret plan to avert a flood of Haitian refugees seeking political asylum, to reassert the credibility of American power in our sphere of influence, and to bring parliamentary democracy to the hemisphere's most oppressed nation -- all without the use of U.S. ground troops.
Can't be done, you say? Certainly it will not be done by following the increased-asylum plan President Clinton announced yesterday. 
 Concocted to lessen criticism from black leaders in the U.S., his plan is to (a) impose an economic blockade to make civilian Haitians miserable enough to rebel against the army; (b) pick up refugees at sea for interviews aboard U.S. ships, thereby encouraging more to seek political asylum, but turning back the majority as economic migrants; and (c) make veiled military threats with no intention of, or support for, carrying them out.
That last element of the Clinton approach -- pretending to flex military muscle -- was expressed last week in the most nail-nibbling, pusillanimous "threat" ever uttered by a President of the United States: "We are doing our best to avoid dealing with the military option."
Mr. Clinton's entreaties to the Haitian general and police chief fall on deaf ears because no real military threat exists; expending U.S. lives to save Haiti ranks low on the poll ratings that drive Clinton foreign policy. Needed is a counterforce that does not now exist.
My plan is known as "the Bay of Pigs option." Three decades ago, that place became synonymous with the word "fiasco." The C.I.A. secretly trained a military force of Cuban refugees in Florida and transported them to a Cuban beach to help topple Fidel Castro.
But when the decision came to provide the invading force the close support of air cover, President Kennedy flinched; local uprisings never materialized; and the anti-Castro Cuban patriots were killed or captured. Worse than a tragedy, it was an embarrassment.
Just because the intervention spawned in the Eisenhower Administration failed dismally then, however, does not mean that the notion of retaking an island by arming a force of its refugees can never work. We can learn from past tactical mistakes.
Where the Bay of Pigs was a secret enterprise, run by C.I.A. covert operatives who knew little about military operations, the Haitian Legion should be widely publicized, its training and equipment a challenge to the Department of Defense.
Of the nearly 200,000 Haitian refugees already in the U.S., could not a few thousand able-bodied young men be found to volunteer to fight for their country? I suspect there are more than that many patriots among them, and that -- given the training and equipment -- a serious, substantial force could be assembled.
Every American who went from soft draftee to soldier in three months of basic training knows the transformation possible. Add to that three months for development of natural leaders into noncommissioned officers, with simultaneous indoctrination of democratic procedures, and by year's end offshore Haitians would have a proud, fierce, battle-ready unit -- better equipped and trained than Haiti's.
Then you put them on U.S. warships, backed up by an aircraft carrier loaded with helicopter gunships, sail into Port-au-Prince -- and see what effect all that has on the band of hoodlums on the dock who chased us away before.
Even if the Haitian junta shows up with a larger armed force, the sight of oncoming landing craft backed up by an overwhelming show of tactical air power would contribute to a new willingness by the tinhorn generals to restore democracy and hold new, O.A.S.-supervised elections.
The object is to avoid a bloodletting with a credible show of force -- and not a Yankee force in front, but a Haitian Legion ready to fight and equally trained to form a disciplined post-crisis constabulary.
This plan will stress the Pentagon and is not foolproof: care must be taken to see that the legionnaires do not become a new junta. But it would instill pride and self-reliance, reverse the refugee flow, and generate popular bipartisan support.
What's the Clinton alternative? Ever more refugees -- a fiasco.

HEADLINE: Lord Sharp, 77, A British Leader In Communications

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Lord Sharp of Grimsdyke, former chairman and chief executive of Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the British-based international telecommunications company, died last Monday in London. He was 77.
The cause was a heart attack, The Times of London reported. 
 Born Eric Sharp, he was made a life peer in 1989. He was chairman of Cable and Wireless from 1980 until his retirement in 1990 and chief executive from 1981 to 1990.
Cable and Wireless was founded in 1929 and languished after it was nationalized by the Labor Government after World War II. It was privatized in 1981, one of a group of enterprises privatized while Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, from 1979 to 1990.
Under his leadership, the concern's total revenues grew more than fifteenfold a year, and its profits increased more than tenfold. When he retired, it had operations in more than 55 countries.
Mr. Sharp pushed for the establishment of a fiber-optic cable "highway" operated by Cable and Wireless, linking Europe to Asia via the United States. The "highway" linked major financial centers and offered business customers such features as high-definition television and video-conferencing, high-speed data transmission and faxes.
In the early 1980's Cable and Wireless, with a group of investors, set up Mercury Communications, the first competitor to British Telecommunications, the Government-owned phone company. Mercury later became wholly owned by Cable and Wireless.
Eric Sharp was born in London. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics and statistics at the London School of Economics, became a British Army captain in World War II, joined Britain's Ministry of Power in 1948 and remained a civil servant until 1956.
He entered private industry in 1957 and rose high in the international operations of Monsanto, the American chemicals concern, before joining Cable and Wireless.
Lord Sharp is survived by his wife, the former Marion Freeman, whom he married in 1950; a son and a daughter.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday about Lord Sharp of Grimsdyke, former chairman and chief executive of Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the British-based telecommunications company, misstated the increase in the company's revenues under his leadership. The increase was about tenfold from the 1980-81 fiscal year to the 1990-91 fiscal year, not "more than fifteenfold a year."

HEADLINE: Dow Corning Had Conflicting Findings on Silicone

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, the world's largest maker of silicone products made a fateful decision. Two scientific teams for the company had worked side by side for a decade on the nature of silicones, had talked to each other frequently and had come up with very different conclusions.
One group found that some forms of silicone -- including a type used in the manufacture of breast implants -- are biologically active and alter the immune system. The other group determined that silicones were inert and could be used safely in implants. 
 Based on the conclusions of the second group, the Dow Corning Corporation in Midland, Mich., decided to pursue a commercial breast implant business, former and present employees say.
The employees said the company decided to halt research into the immunological activity of silicone in 1975. Dow Corning's first implants went on the market in 1964. Eventually the company's products and those of others were sold to an estimated one million American women, accounting for approximately 1 percent of the Dow Corning's revenues over the years, according to a company spokesman.
Since the early 1980's, nearly 20,000 women who got these implants have sued Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Corporation and Corning Inc., and other implant manufacturers. They say the silicone gel in the implants leaked into their bodies and caused chronic pain, autoimmune disease, disfigurement, fatigue syndromes and other incurable conditions.
 
Maintaining Implants Are Safe
 Dow Corning, in spite of agreeing to be part of a $4.3 billion settlement of these claims, continues to reject their validity. "We've had 30 years of good results with implants," said Dr. Richard Mast, director of toxicology and bioscience research at Dow Corning. "We've done a tremendous amount of epidemiology. No definite connection between our products and disease" has been proved.
Dow Corning scientists have continued to study the safety of silicone materials in animals, Dr. Mast said. But he acknowledged that the company's research had in the past focused on observing the localized response to silicone exposure and not on the deeper questions of basic immunology. The company is now financing at least two laboratories that are researching the immunological effects of silicone.
Details of Dow Corning's early research into the biological activity of silicone came to light two weeks ago when lawyers representing implant patients obtained copies of a former Dow Corning scientist's papers and memorandums. The scientist, Dr. Robert S. Lake, turned the original documents over to a Federal grand jury in Baltimore on April 25, said his lawyer, Wayland Cooke. Dr. Lake is now a research scientist at the Lorillard Tobacco Company in Greensboro, N.C.
Dow Corning says that its biological research was never a secret. "The fact that we were evaluating silicones for biological activity was openly reported within Dow Corning and outside the company through published articles" in the 1970's, said Barbara Carmichael, a company spokeswoman. "We never tried to hide it."
Dow Corning executives and many of the company's top scientists maintain that the research gave proof that silicones are safe. The biological effects were "weak" and confined to materials not present in breast implants in significant amounts, said Gary Anderson, executive vice president of Dow Corning, who has been with the company since 1967.
 
'Decision Based on Profits'
 But Frederic Ellis of Gilman, McLaughlin & Hanrahan in Boston, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class action suit, says the existence of this research is a smoking gun: "It establishes that Dow Corning was well aware of the immunological effects of certain silicone compounds. They can say what they want 20 years later, but they made a decision based on profits, and not on the safety of the materials."
Interviews with Mr. Anderson and others who were at Dow Corning in the 1960's and 1970's help explain how the same evidence could be interpreted so differently.
In the early 60's, Dow Corning scientists were screening a variety of silicone compounds, Mr. Anderson said. Most proved to be inert, he said, but one complex silicone liquid shrank the testicles of mice. Intrigued, company scientists spent three years isolating the active ingredient, which was similar in action to natural estrogen hormones. It was licensed to Kabi Pharmaceuticals in Sweden and later used in clinical trials to treat prostate disease, but it eventually proved no better than existing compounds and was not commercialized.
Nevertheless, Dow Corning was encouraged by this find to move ahead with pharmaceutical research. In 1965, the company hired Don Bennett, an expert in drug metabolism, to head a newly formed research group called the Bioscience Research Laboratory. It was housed down the road at Dow Chemical.
 
Hoping to Cure Common Cold
 Dr. Bennett, who is now director of the division of drugs and toxicology at the American Medical Association in Chicago, recalled those days in a telephone interview. The research "was very exciting, very special," he said. "It was fun to get up in the morning and go to work. We set out to understand the absorption, distribution, biotransformation, elimination and metabolism" of silicones.
According to an article at the time in Dow Corning News, a company publication, researchers in the new laboratory sprayed silicone on plant leaves to retard evaporation, mixed silicone with herbicides to make the poisons go further and looked to see what effects silicone had on plant hormones. They used silicone compounds to kill bacteria, fungi and algae; one formulation that came out of their research is used today to reduce shoe odors.
"We were looking for chemical molecules that would be anti-virals," Dr. Bennett said. There were clues that silicone compounds might kill influenza. Dow Corning researchers hoped they might even come up with a cure for the common cold.
One of the most exciting findings, Dr. Bennett and others said, was that low molecular weight silicones are excellent adjuvants, materials that stimulate the immune system. Adjuvants are used to increase the efficacy of vaccines, he said, and this seemed a potentially lucrative market.
Controlled stimulation of the immune system is a benefit in a vaccine, but chronic uncontrolled stimulation could lead to autoimmune problems. Researchers do not know what the link is but are investigating it.
 
Need for More Research?
 Dr. Lake, an expert on viruses, was one of those researching low molecular weight silicones. In a series of experiments, he found that these could impair a critical component of the mouse immune system. But the reasons for the effects were not clear. These were the silicones later used in the manufacture of breast implants.
Dr. Bennett said recently that his group regarded the findings as indicating the need for more research. "If anything is absorbed or leached to the body systemically, further studies would be required," he said. "That was our position. We were certain that some of the smaller materials moved" and had metabolic effects.
"We never differentiated between implants or drugs," he said.
At about that time, because the group had not developed any commercial products, company executives decided to close the program, Dr. Mast said. "The program started as a scientific decision," he said. "But then you must make a logical business decision, to stop wasting your money."
Meanwhile, a second group had been working on what they believed to be inert forms of silicone for medical uses, including breast implants. This unit, composed primarily of chemists and toxicologists, was also housed at Dow Chemical, just down the hall from Dr. Bennett's group. Based on toxicology studies that looked at the local effects of implants in animals, they found no obvious reactions associated with silicone. They knew about the other group's finding of weak immune reactions, but they took this to mean that silicones are not biologically very active, and therefore were good material for use in breast implants.
 
'Almost an Embarrassment
 Dr. Bennett's group came up with a very different conclusion. "We learned there was a lot of biological activity with silicone compounds," he said. The chemists and toxicologists, on the other hand, were "sold on the concept of inertness."
"Inert did not fit with our work," Dr. Bennett said. "We were looking for active materials and we had them. We were almost an embarrassment" to the company.
One explanation of the contradictory interpretations, Dr. Bennett said, might be that compounds that are chemically inert, like silicone, are not necessarily biologically inert. And Dow Corning, the chemical company, paid more heed to its chemists than to its biologists. "Chemists typically think that biology will take care of itself," Dr. Bennett said.
To understand Dow Corning's decision, one has to recall the climate of the mid-1970's, Dr. Bennett said. Those were the days of artificial hearts and kidneys, heart valves and other mechanical medical devices, mostly made from silicone, that were going to revolutionize medicine. The term "biocompatibility" -- suggesting that materials like silicone were compatible with the human body -- was widely accepted by scientists, and doctors, he said.
Moreover, Dr. Bennett said, the nation was in a recession and this affected the business decisions at Dow Corning.
For all these reasons, the work done by Dr. Bennett's group did not raise red flags at Dow Corning.
Dr. Bennett, Dr. Lake and others in the group left the company in 1974 and 1975. Dr. Lake's research was never published.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 9 about research on silicones at the Dow Corning Corporation that led the company to manufacture silicone breast implants misattributed the statement that documents about the research had been turned over to a Federal grand jury by a scientist, Dr. Robert S. Lake. It was made by a lawyer for the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against implant makers, not by Dr. Lake's lawyer, A. Wayland Cooke.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Radio Stations Reduce Coverage of Local News

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8

 BODY:
The percentage of commercial radio stations with no employees devoted to gathering local news increased last year to 16.9 percent, according to a survey by a radio industry trade group. The survey also showed that television news staffing has continued to grow modestly since 1987 even as radio news staffs declined at the steepest rate in more than a decade.
Opponents of broadcast deregulation cite the findings as evidence that radio listeners are being poorly served by station owners, who since 1981 have no longer been required to broadcast news and public-interest programming to obtain operating licenses. But the survey did not address how much news is broadcast by these stations, since many of them use syndicated news reports. 
 "It is efficiency at the cost of diversity," said Andy Schwartzman, director of the Media Access Project in Washington. He said the trend would most hurt those with the least access to information and cut off a career training ground that is particularly valuable to women and minorities.
 
Fewer Radio Newsrooms
 Last year, about 230 of the nation's 5,500 radio newsrooms went dark, said Vernon A. Stone, a professor emeritus at the University of Missouri, who conducted the research for the Radio-Television News Directors Association. He based his estimate on survey responses from 307 stations.
He estimated that 1,100 radio news operations had ceased since 1981, when rules were lifted on nonentertainment programming. The radio news work force now stands at 15,000, the same as in 1972, he said. The typical station news staff has one full-time employee, who may both compile and read the news, and one part-time employee.
 The findings, however, come as news-talk stations are attracting a record number of listeners. And industry executives said a decline in some local news operations was not a sign that news had been forgotten.
"That news operations are being reduced does not necessarily mean radio is abdicating its responsibilities," said William L. Stakelin, chief executive of Apollo Radio Ltd. of New York, which owns seven stations.
Industry executives say the recession accelerated a move by stations to forgo producing their own news. The industry increasingly relies on syndicated material -- news, music and talk shows -- transmitted by satellite and offered by networks on a barter basis in exchange for commercial time.
The decline in local news programming is also an outgrowth of radio's move to specialized formats ranging from bluegrass to polka; station owners have turned to narrow formats as a way to attract a specific audience desired by advertisers.
 
Consolidation of Operations
 In 1992, the Federal Communications Commission permitted owners to buy more than a single AM and FM station in the same market, and acquire up to 18 of each type of property. The previous limit had been 12 of each. Consolidation of operations, including news staff, has followed, said Bill Clark, chairman of Shamrock Broadcasting Inc. in Burbank, Calif., which owns 19 stations.
The consolidation has come as the news-talk format has soared in popularity, helping to stabilize the numbers listening on the AM band.
Last fall, news-talk stations pulled in 15.7 percent of total listeners, the highest level since 1989, when Arbitron and Billboard magazine began a national survey. "The reality is there are stations specializing in news, which lessens the viability of news for others," Mr. Stakelin said.
Neal J. Conan, a correspondent for National Public Radio, a noncommercial network, contends that the decline in local radio news staffs does not mean that listeners are less informed or or that there is less diversity among the people who present the news. "I'm not sure a three-minute newscast was vastly informative," he said. "It's not a tremendous loss."

HEADLINE: Budget Waiver To Be Sought

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said today he would urge Congress to waive its strict budget rules and avoid a $40 billion bottleneck that could kill the landmark GATT trade deal.
Some Republicans fear that such a move -- a tricky maneuver that needs the backing of 60 senators -- will unravel Washington's avowed new budgetary discipline and lead to calls for more one-time waivers that could boost the deficit. 
 But officials say the White House simply could not come up with any way to find $40 billion and had no choice but to opt for the controversial waiver in an effort to gain Congressional approval for the deal.
The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, which was signed last month in Morocco, will cost billions in lost tariff collections, even though economists believe the deal will spur economy growth by increasing trade. But the Federal government's budget rules require a detailed plan for raising new revenues. In effect, the rules mandate that any program which lowers Federal revenues be countered by matching spending cuts or tax hikes.

Fashion Post Is Filled At Barneys

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Barneys New York said yesterday that it had hired Michele Smith, a top merchant at I. Magnin, as its senior vice president and general merchandise manager in charge of women's fashion.
Effective next week, she will replace Connie Darrow, who left the company in December to join Prada, the Italian leather goods house. 
 Ms. Smith will report to Bonnie L. Pressman, who runs the entire women's division and is a member of the family that owns Barneys.
 
'Lives and Breathes Fashion'
 Ms. Smith, who is 48 and has worked at I. Magnin for 28 years, is highly respected in the garment industry. "She has fabulous taste and is the kind of person who lives and breathes fashion," said Susan Sokol, the president of the designer Calvin Klein's women's collection. "She's got a terrific eye and wonderful people skills, too."
Ms. Smith's appointment comes as Barneys tries to put last fall's furor over delinquent payments behind it. Shortly before Ms. Darrow left the company, several small vendors complained that Barneys was late in paying them, giving rise to speculation that it was in financial straits.
As an outsider with no previous affiliation with Barneys, Ms. Smith may help to heal the rifts between the company and its smaller suppliers, whose cutting-edge fashions are critical to the retailer's identity as a place to find the latest styles and trends. She was responsible for European designer merchandise at I. Magnin.
She leaves I. Magnin, a unit of R. H. Macy & Company, at a critical juncture in the West Coast chain's history. I. Magnin has struggled in the last decade, closing stores as it suffered mightily in the weak California economy and lost business to rivals like Neiman Marcus. Many in the industry believe that the chain will be sold if Federated Department Stores Inc. succeeds in its bid to merge with Macy, which is in negotiations to emerge from bankruptcy protection.
Ms. Smith lives in San Francisco with her husband, David Ledesma, and daughter, Gabrielle. The family plans to move to New York.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees New Policy on Haitian Refugees as Buying Time

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that their new policy on Haitian refugees might buy time for economic efforts to squeeze Haiti's military leaders from power, but they acknowledged that they still faced the fundamental question of what to do if that plan failed.
Even as officials from Florida began to warn about a new flood of refugees, aides to President Clinton said the most important effect of his decision to provide asylum hearings at sea to those fleeing Haiti might be to quiet American dissent. 
 Randall Robinson, a human rights campaigner, has ended his hunger strike protesting the earlier Administration policy, and other critics offered praise for Mr. Clinton's weekend announcement. These changes in attitude led some White House officials to express relief at having wriggled out of a corner.
"What this gives is time to see if the sanctions are going to work," a senior White House official said.
 
Only a Temporary Solution
 But there was no illusion at the White House that the new policy represented more than a temporary solution. Public hopefulness there was mixed with private skepticism that tighter sanctions, to be imposed on May 21, will work in time to unburden Mr. Clinton from having to decide whether restoring democracy to Haiti is worth using military force.
The new measures will impose a near-total embargo on Haiti, and Administration officials said the misery they cause might become so widespread that Mr. Clinton might not be able to wait much more than a month before resorting to blunter options to oust Haiti's military leaders.
A top aide to Mr. Clinton said, "We know that we're on a course toward bringing this to a head."
The officials also said the choice of William H. Gray 3d, a prominent black, to be Mr. Clinton's new adviser on Haiti had been intended in large part to blunt criticism from those who had characterized Washington's policy as racist.
 
Talks With Latin Governments
 In one indication of the new attention being directed at Haiti, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that the United States was talking to Latin American governments about establishing a United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti once the military is forced from power.
Administration officials had said previously that the United States would probably join such a force to help secure the return to power of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's democratically elected President, whom the military ousted 30 months ago. But Mr. Christopher's remarks, during a visit to Mexico, made it clear that Washington was looking to Latin America to reinforce the message to Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his military colleagues that it was time for them to go.
Along with diplomacy, the focus remained on the refugees.
 
Fear of Refugee Increase
 Officials from Florida said Mr. Clinton's decision to stop summarily returning refugees intercepted at sea would result in a major increase in the flow from Haiti.
Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat, predicted that 5,000 to 10,000 people would leave Haiti each month to seek asylum, far more than the 1,300 who have been intercepted at sea so far this year. Mr. Graham said he feared that the new policy would "amount to a very substantial green light for people to leave Haiti."
But Administration officials insisted that they did not expect the increase to be overwhelming. Even though Mr. Clinton said his decision to allow processing at sea was motivated by worsening violence in Haiti, the officials said they did not expect that many more than the current 5 percent of refugees would be judged to be motivated by political reasons, and thereby allowed to enter the United States.
"Most people who are trying to leave the country are still doing so because of the economic situation," a senior official said. "There may be some increase, but I don't think it will be a substantial one."
The complaints from Mr. Graham and other Floridians, including Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, underscored the potential peril of a decision to open the door to more refugees. Even today, Administration officials said they hoped to persuade other nations, including Venezuela and Honduras, to accept some refugees.
With Mr. Clinton vowing with increasing fervor to end what he has called the Haitian military's "brutal misrule," Administration officials are portraying the stiffer sanctions as their final attempt at economic coercion.
 
May 21 Deadline Set
 Along with an immediate ban on granting visas to 600 of Haiti's top military and police officers, the measure gives the military until midnight May 21 to hand over power to Father Aristide or face virtual economic strangulation, with exceptions allowed only for food, medicine and certain supplies like books.
In a television interview this weekend, Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's deputy national security adviser, said the sanctions could cause such resentment among Haitian business and union leaders and others that General Cedras would recognize that he was in a "dead end" and would step down.
But other officials said they were far from confident that sanctions could have that effect during the limited time the White House is willing to maintain them. Michael D. Barnes, a former Congressman who is an adviser to Father Aristide, expressed similar doubts.
"Clearly the Haitian military no longer believes that the international community is serious about restoring Aristide," Mr. Barnes said. "They don't believe that the sanctions will really bite, and they certainly don't believe that they face any threat of ending up like Manuel Noriega, so the international community is going to have to demonstrate some clear resolve." The reference was to the Panamanian leader, removed by United States military intervention.

HEADLINE: Jawboning's Limits;
Some Say It's Time That the Administration Rethought Its Trade Policy Toward Japan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
After almost a year of jawboning and negotiating, the Clinton Administration has little to show for its trade policy toward Japan, and some Administration officials and analysts are beginning to wonder aloud whether it is time for the United States to rethink its strategy.
The combination of the weak new coalition Government in Tokyo and the turmoil in world currency markets has seriously weakened the Clinton Administration's ability to get Japan to open certain of its closed markets and reduce its huge trade surplus with the rest of the world. 
 Japan's Finance Ministry announced today that its huge trade imbalance with the rest of the world had widened again, soaring to a record $130.04 billion in the fiscal year which just ended March 31. That is up 3.3 percent from last year's $125.9 billion, although there are indications that the stronger yen and weaker dollar are beginning to cut away at that surplus.
While senior American economic officials put a brave face on such figures and are counseling patience, several policy makers and lawmakers are saying privately that the Clinton strategy toward Japan is moribund, unlikely to produce the expected results and probably going to have to be redesigned.
These officials note that after a year of trying to negotiate a market-opening deal with Tokyo, the Clinton Administration finds itself without either a Japanese Government strong enough to deliver the trade initiatives Washington wants or the alternative currency weapons it was relying on to achieve the same results.
Since last July, the Clinton Administration has tried, but failed, to get the Japanese Government to agree through negotiations to certain "numerical indicators" that would show over time whether or not Japan was really opening its markets in insurance, autos and auto parts, telecommunications and medical equipment.
"We finally find ourselves face to face with a long-hidden truth, which is that the only people who can deliver in Japan are not the politicians but the bureaucrats and business cartels, who have not been the focus of our policy," said Clyde V. Prestowitz, head of the Economic Strategy Institute, which advocates a tough line against Japan on trade.
"The issue that the Clinton Administration now faces is how do you create a situation in which the bureaucrats and business cartels in Japan see it in their interest to strike a deal," he added. "It is clear the political leaders cannot deliver. And it is clear that there are limits to what we can do through the currency."
When it first became apparent in February that the Japanese Government could not or would not deliver what the American side wanted, the Clinton Administration began tacitly supporting a weak dollar and strong yen to pressure the Japanese Cabinet and bureaucrats to open their markets. A strong yen makes it harder for Japan to sell abroad and a weak dollar makes it easier for American products to penetrate Japan's markets.
But this has come at a price which has become unacceptable to Washington. Currency traders reacted dramatically to what they thought was a green light from the White House for the dollar to go way down, pushing the dollar to levels that were intolerable to the Clinton Administration, which had to intervene in the markets to prop up the American currency.
 
 
Pressure on Fed
 The falling dollar increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to keep attracting foreign investors to buy American Treasury notes and bonds needed to finance the deficit. While Japanese investors bought a net total of $6.5 billion in American Treasury securities in the fourth quarter of last year, the falling dollar resulted in their selling a net $3.75 billion in the first two months of this year -- contributing to a widening of the current account imbalance and higher overall interest rates.
"The data suggests that the risks of continuing to maintain an image of policy conflict with Japan will be to discourage Japanese from investing in our markets," John P. Lipsky, chief economist for Solomon Brothers, said.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, has been told by Japan's Prime Minister, Tutsomo Hata, that Tokyo is eager to try to resolve the trade conflict between the two countries and that he will be forwarding some fresh proposals shortly. President Clinton wants to give Mr. Hata a chance to deliver and spoke with the Japanese Prime Minister by telephone over the weekend about resuming the negotiations, officials said.
 
 
Lacks Political Muscle
 But many Clinton Administration economic officials and analysts are skeptical about what Japan will come up with. The Hata Government does not even have a majority in the Parliament and hardly appears to have the political muscle to take on the Japanese bureaucracy and force through the sort of fundamental changes in Japanese trade policy demanded by Washington.
Some analysts believe that the Administration really now has only two choices. The first is to acknowledge that the sort of far-reaching, market-opening devices it hoped to negotiate with Tokyo are not going to happen and they should take whatever they can get out of the Hata Government, declare a modest victory, and try other means to keep the pressure on Tokyo for long-term change. That would at least stabilize the financial markets and take some of the pressure off the dollar and the yen.
The other option is simply to maintain the status quo, of pressing Japan to meet American demands, but to focus less on opening specific sectors of the Japanese economy and more on the other main American objective: getting Tokyo to stimulate its overall growth and consumer spending through tax cuts and other fiscal and monetary measures so that it will import more of everything. Some officials believe this holds out the best hope of diminishing Japan's global trade surplus, without destabilizing either the fragile Japanese Government or the currency markets. But it may take a long time to show results.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Revisited: A periodic report.;
Where Monuments Speak of a U.S. Defeat, the Talk Is of 'Peaceful Contacts'

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City there are Vietnamese who wash down pizza with Coke, pay for things with American dollars, wear American flag patches on jackets and yell "hello!" at any "big nose" foreigner they see.
But the country still raises patriotic banners gloating over what the Communists regard as America's defeat in the Vietnam War. Beneath an outwardly friendly curiosity many Vietnamese display toward Americans, a predatory undertone tinged with bitter resentment is often detectable. There are many reminders for Americans visiting Vietnam of the lacerations left by a war that ended nearly two decades ago but that still colors Vietnamese attitudes. 
 Vietnam's political leaders face something of a quandary as they reshape national policy toward the United States.
On one hand, the 1975 victory over the South Vietnamese Government and its American ally, still fresh in the minds of many, is commemorated as a historic triumph comparable to America's victory over the British at Yorktown. America, to some, is still an enemy -- a fighting enemy to Communist military veterans, and a perfidious former friend to those Vietnamese who regard America's withdrawal from the war as a betrayal.
 
Much Is Needed And U.S. Can Help
 Moreover, there are some who resent the 19 years it took Washington to lift its trade embargo, and the attitude of American conservatives who continue to block diplomatic recognition of the Hanoi Government.
But eclipsing these irritants, Vietnamese leaders have come to believe that there is a pressing need for American investment, technical aid, tourist visits and many other kinds of contact with the United States. Hanoi is even trying to persuade thousands of overseas Vietnamese (known as Viet Kieu), including Vietnamese-American refugees, to return to their native land and help rebuild it. Many have come back for temporary visits, and a few, disillusioned with life in the United States, expect to remain.
The Government is celebrating a double anniversary -- the 19th of the fall of Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war, on April 30, 1975, and the 40th of the fall of the French bastion at Dien Bien Phu on May 7, 1954.
Anti-American sentiments adorned some of the red-and-gold celebratory banners flown over streets for the occasion, but as a sign of the times, Vietnamese authorities did not include English or French translations that might have offended foreign visitors. Aside from the Communist slogans, visiting Americans -- tourists, business executives, journalists and officials of the United States Missing in Action Mission -- are treated by officials in Vietnam with studied courtesy and conciliation.
On the anniversary of Saigon's surrender to the Communists, for example, this correspondent was received at the home of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap for a brief chat. The 83-year-old general, who commanded the Vietnamese Communist forces against both the French and the Americans, has been rated by Western military analysts as one of the greatest generals of the 20th century. But "the victor of Dien Bien Phu," as he is often called, does not gloat.

 One subject of the conversation was the fall of Saigon in 1975, which this correspondent covered for The New York Times.
Imposing in his olive-green uniform and general's shoulder tabs, General Giap was avuncular and cordial, and clearly reluctant to say anything he thought an American might find objectionable. Speaking in French, he deferred benignly to frequent interjections and corrections from his wife, Dang Bich Ha, who was once a soldier in the Communist forces herself.
At his comfortable villa a few hundred yards from the Lenin-style mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, General Giap, the supreme commander of Hanoi's legions from 1952 until 1977, mused on the changing state of the world.
"In the traditional sense, the threat of colonialism and imperialism has disappeared," he said, "and we shall probably not need to confront such threats again. We Vietnamese are optimists. But even though we face no shooting war in Vietnam, the world is in a very uncertain state, and Vietnam must always be willing to sacrifice to protect its freedom."
He praised the "fairness" of American journalists, and said that after retiring from active command he had turned his attention increasingly to the war against pollution and the preservation of the environment -- causes he knew to be popular with the American press.
General Giap's masterly command of logistics and maneuver, and his deployment of artillery at the isolated Dien Bien Phu fortress in 1954, caught the French defenders by surprise and stunned world leaders; a peasant army had brought a well-armed European army to its knees.
General Giap's 1962 book "People's War, People's Army," which outlines the mixture of political warfare and military strategy that was his hallmark, became a textbook for guerrilla insurgents in many parts of the world, and was highly regarded even by such longtime battlefield foes as the late Gen. William E. DePuy of the United States Army.
Although General Giap spent much of the anniversary of the fall of Saigon receiving Vietnamese military well-wishers and admirers, he took care in the interview to avoid any suggestion of belligerency.
"We certainly have no fight with the American people," he said, "and we welcome peaceful contacts with your country."
But despite the diplomatic language Vietnamese leaders use with Americans, there remain many reminders of the war that most Americans would find galling.
On Hai Ba Trung Street in Ho Chi Minh City stands a tall, unkempt-looking building that was formerly the Brink Hotel -- a military billet erected for United States Army officers. On Christmas Eve 1964, Vietcong terrorists drove a jeep containing a huge bomb into the building's courtyard and set it off, killing two Americans and wounding 58.
Today a monument stands at the corner entrance of the building, adorned with a concrete relief sculpture depicting American dead and wounded scattered through the debris. In front of the marker is a single strip of barbed wire, symbolizing the huge thicket of barbed wire that surrounded the building in the war years.
 
A Forbidding Prison, Full of Memories
 There is no marker at the floating My Canh Restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, but many Americans remember it as the place where Vietcong bombs set off in June 1965 killed 44 diners, including 12 Americans. One, Sgt. Al Combs of the Special Forces, was killed along with his Vietnamese wife and their children.
Hanoi is also filled with disagreeable reminders of the war. At the Army Museum on Dien Bien Phu Street, a large bin containing dozens of flight helmets taken from American fliers shot down over North Vietnam is displayed. Outside, a freshly painted MIG-21 has been mounted; a sign says the aircraft shot down a dozen American planes.
The looming yellow walls and electrified wire surrounding Hoa Lo Prison in Hanoi -- known to Americans as the "Hanoi Hilton" -- remind visitors of a time when many American servicemen were imprisoned there, undergoing privation and mistreatment.
In Ho Chi Minh City, the former Doc Lap Presidential Palace has been restored as a museum intended to show the wasteful extravagance of the old regime, as abetted by the United States. Guides at the palace, English-speaking girls who had not even been born at the time Saigon fell, shepherd visitors through "shamefully opulent" reception chambers, a ballroom, dining halls and private quarters where South Vietnam's last President, Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu, spent his last days before fleeing to the United States.
Adorning the walls of District People's Committee headquarters and other official offices in many parts of Vietnam are photographs of Nguyen Van Troi bound to a stake and facing a firing squad in Saigon on Oct. 15, 1964. Troi, now a national hero for whom one of Ho Chi Minh City's main streets has been renamed, was caught and shot after trying to kill Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara by planting a bomb under a bridge Mr. McNamara's limousine was scheduled to cross.
 
The War Is Over; English Classes Call
 At West Lake in Hanoi is a monument honoring city residents who helped to find and capture downed American airmen. At a small lake in the suburban Ngoc Ha ("Flower Village") district of Hanoi is a monument honoring the antiaircraft missile crews that shot down American bombers in the 1960's and 1970's. In the middle of the lake stand a large fuselage section and wheels from a B-52 that was shot down at the spot in 1972, and was left where it fell.
Although the relic could offend some Americans, Vietnamese passers-by seldom spare it a glance. Many are hurrying to attend evening English classes offered at a school facing the lake, and the few Americans who visit the lake are usually hailed by children eager to practice their English. "We all must learn English if we hope to become traders and make money," one said.
A recent American visitor to Hanoi was John Denver, the folk singer, who happened to arrive on the anniversary of the fall of Saigon to begin a series of concerts.
"We had a phone call from an American back home who was under the mistaken impression that our first concert would coincide with the anniversary, and the caller didn't like what that seemed to imply," Mr. Denver said, "but we reassured him our arrival on that day was just coincidence."
Mr. Denver, who said he was exempt from the draft in the Vietnam War years because of a medical disability, said his concerts here -- the first by any American folk singer since the end of the Vietnam War -- had no political significance.
 
The Nation's Poverty Is Breeding Crime
 The crime bred by Vietnam's poverty is not helping to heal Vietnamese-American relations. Gangs of street children envelop foreigners as they step out of their hotels, and theft is a constant threat. Believing that a recent American visitor could not understand Vietnamese, one gang leader was overheard instructing his scruffy lieutenants to obstruct her way in the next block so that confederates could grab her watch.
It seems to some American businessmen that many Vietnamese are determined to attract as much American investment as possible while giving as little as possible in return. "In their eyes, Americans lost the war and although we are rich, we are weak," a businessman said. "The idea seems to be to take us for all they can get."
A Vietnamese former employee of an American company that had an office in Saigon before the Communist victory expressed a common view of Vietnamese who remained after their American colleagues fled.
"We have had very difficult lives," he said. "Some of us spent years in prisons, re-education camps and 'new economic zones' -- Vietnam's Siberias -- because we worked for Americans. But despite all, we love our country. I am glad I stayed, and so is my family. Some Vietnamese who opposed the Communists still resent America's leaders for abandoning Vietnam, but I say, forgive and forget."
A Government official offered a more diplomatic view. "The war brought us victory and we are proud of that," he said, "but the hatred is past and we are getting on with the future. Part of that future means learning English and making American friends."

Rates Continue to Rise; Traders Still Nervous

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Interest rates continued to surge yesterday, rising to their highest levels since shortly after President Clinton was elected.
The most obvious source of upset during yesterday's session seemed to be the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Expectations that the Fed would move immediately to raise short-term interest rates in the wake of the strong April employment data released Friday were unrealized, because the Fed gave no sign that it had raised the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market.
But given the sour tone that has been pervasive in the market since early February, when the Fed began to tighten monetary policy, it is unlikely a move by the central bank would have done much to calm nervous traders.
"I don't think I can ever remember when the market's psychology was this bad," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "The gloom is pervasive, and deep."
By late in the day, the bellwether 6 1/4 percent bonds of 2023 were offered at a price of 83 7/8, down a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 7.63 percent. Over the last two trading sessions, bond yields have risen by 30 basis points.
Meanwhile, the outstanding 5 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a late price of 8831/32 , down 29/32 on the day, to yield 7.48 percent.
Traders expect the Fed to continue raising short-term interest rates because the economy appears to be steaming along at a pace that if left unchecked will push up inflation.
 
An Incremental Approach
 Although some analysts expect the Fed will continue its incremental approach to raising short-term rates, many said they expected a more dramatic move this time.
Rather than raise the funds rate by one-quarter point for the fourth straight month, at some point between now and May 17, when the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet, these analysts contend the Fed will raise the funds rate by half a point, to 4.25 percent, and increase the discount rate.
"The market needs an exclamation point," said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney Shearson.
The April employment data, and big upward revisions in previously reported numbers for February, reinforced that notion.
"During the first four months we have created almost one million new jobs, and are on a pace to create 2.5 million to 3 million this year," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at BA Securities Inc. in San Francisco. "In all of last year we only created 2 million."
The jobs report caused many analysts to ratchet up second-quarter growth forecasts.
Mr. Wood is projecting growth of between 4 percent and 5 percent this quarter, a pace that he said "continues to have the Fed and the market worried about how strong the economy is, and about inflation."
Economists say that if not reined in, growth in excess of about 2.5 percent will fuel inflationary pressures.
But so far, inflation remains under control. With inflation remaining low, Edward S. Hyman, president of International Strategy and Investment, a money management firm, noted in a weekly report to clients that the rise in interest rates that has taken place over the last three months has pushed real, inflation-adjusted bond yields to their highest level in nine years.
With the Treasury set to begin its quarterly refunding auctions today, professional traders seem to believe that yields will go even higher. But some analysts acknowledge that the increase in rates should begin to attract demand from small investors.
A good test of that view will come at today's three-year note auction.
 
Sale of New Securities
 The Treasury is scheduled to sell $17 billion of the new securities. By late yesterday, the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.66 percent. Last October, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds got as low as 5.79 percent.
"It's an incredible value," Mr. Liro said, "because inflation is running at a 2.5 percent rate now, and over the next three years the worst case inflation rate is about 4.5 percent.
The surge in short-term and long-term interest rates was also manifested at yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills, which were sold at their highest levels in about two and a half years.
The three-month bills were auctioned at an average discout rate of 4.32 percent, up 32 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the average yield on three-month bills at last week's auction. It is the highest yield on a three-month bill since the auction on Dec. 2, 1991, when the average yield was 4.39 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Bills	Average Price	98.908	97.568	Discounted Rate	4.32%	4.81%	Coupon Yield	4.43%	5.00%	High Price	98.918	97.589	Discounted Rate	4.28%	4.77%	Coupon Yield	4.39%	4.95%	Low Price	98.908	97.563	Discounted Rate	4.32%	4.82%	Coupon Yield	4.43%	5.01%	Accepted at low price	83%	2%	Total applied for	$39,978,491	$39,732,117	Accepted	$12,053,010	$12,033,117	Noncompetitive	$1,496,199	$1,149,129

HEADLINE: Jury Convicts Rifkin, Rejecting Insanity Plea

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 9

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who led a secret life of killing prostitutes and keeping their corpses for days, was found to be legally sane today by a jury that took only two hours to convict him of murder.
Mr. Rifkin, 34, who stood expressionless as the jury read its verdict, had admitted killing 17 women, so the facts of the case were never at issue in the two-week trial. 
 The real question before the jury was whether Mr. Rifkin, described by the prosecution's expert witness as a sadist and necrophiliac who even as a child was fascinated by strangulation, was legally insane, as his lawyer maintained.
But the jurors, to their own surprise, voted unanimously on their first ballot that he was guilty of murder, agreeing that he did not meet the legal definition for insanity because he knew what he was doing when he strangled his victims, and knew it was wrong.
Mr. Rifkin was also convicted of charges of reckless endangerment stemming from the police chase. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison for the murder conviction and another 2 1/3 to 7 years for the endangerment conviction.
Mr. Rifkin's own words convicted him, jurors said after leaving the Nassau County Courthouse.
"When Rifkin was talking over the possibilities of a psychiatric defense with one of his psychiatrists and said, 'I'm not in the book,' that did it for me," said Joseph Cavaco, a business manager from Levittown.
"He knew from the start an insanity defense wasn't going to work, and we proved him right," Mr. Cavaco said. "Our first vote was unanimous, which surprised me. I thought for sure there would be some differences of opinion, but no one bought his insanity defense."
Mr. Cavaco, who has a 16-year-old daughter about the same height and weight as Mr. Rifkin's 17th victim, Tiffany Bresciani, 22, of Manhattan, said, "It didn't affect my verdict, but I couldn't help thinking about my daughter and all those young women he killed."
Another juror, Rita Cobian, a manager for Nynex, said that the prosecutor, Fred Klein, had been "very effective" in convincing the jury that Mr. Rifkin was not insane.
"He put all the pieces together for us, and reaching a verdict was no struggle at all," Ms. Cobian said.
On leaving the courthouse, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, John Lawrence, said, "We gave it our best shot, presented the evidence and the issues, and the jury didn't see it that way."
He said that Mr. Rifkin, whom he had represented for no fee, "had no reaction whatever" to the verdict. "He just stood up and said, 'I'll see you.' He thanked me, and that was it."
Mr. Rifkin was on trial only for the killing of Ms. Bresciani, whom he picked up on the streets of lower Manhattan last June, paid $20 for sex, then strangled in the back seat of his mother's car.
He took her body to his home in East Meadow, where he stored it in the garage for three days, then loaded it in the back of his pickup truck. In the early hours of June 28, while looking for a place to dump her corpse, he was stopped by the state police for a traffic violation, and troopers found the body. After his arrest, he confessed to killing Ms. Bresciani and 16 other women.
Mr. Rifkin is to go on trial as early as next month in two killings in Suffolk County, and he faces other trials in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.
Lawyers on both sides addressed the insanity issue head-on during their summations this morning. Mr. Lawrence insisted that his client did not know what he was doing and often drove around in a haze after strangling his victims, "talking to them as if they were still alive."
"Strange? Yes," he said. "Sick? Yes. Incomprehensible? Yes. But to Joel, it was a state of mind. He did not understand what he was doing. His was a mind that was unraveling."
But the prosecutor urged the jurors to reject that claim.
 
'He Wants to Fool You'
 "He knew he was a serial killer," Mr. Klein said. "He studied books on it; it was his bedtime reading. And he studied police procedures for tracing bodies so he could fool people. Now he wants to fool you."
Mr. Klein said that when the state police arrested him, Mr. Rifkin was planning to dismember Ms. Bresciani's body before dumping it near an airport in Suffolk County.
He showed the jury a knife that was found in the front seat of Mr. Rifkin's truck, along with a set of bolt cutters he said Mr. Rifkin planned to use to cut through Ms. Bresciani's joints.
In closing, Mr. Klein read off the names of Mr. Rifkin's known victims, and said there were probably at least one or two more that Mr. Rifkin, "for reasons of his own," would not talk about.
Mr. Klein, the last to speak to the jurors, completed his summation shortly after noon. Judge Ira H. Wexner spent the next hour charging the jury, explaining the vagaries of an insanity defense and the charges against Mr. Rifkin.
After the verdict was announced, Judge Wexner remanded Mr. Rifkin to Nassau County Jail until sentencing on June 8.
Mr. Klein said he was "gratified by the verdict" and "glad that the jury was able to resolve the issues in what seems like a fairly short amount of time for all the evidence they had to consider."
Mr. Klein said "the fact that the verdict was so quick should convince the other counties that they have good cases against Mr. Rifkin also."
Mr. Cavaco, the juror, said that he and other jurors were affected by two letters Mr. Rifkin wrote to Mr. Lawrence last December, when Mr. Rifkin was hiring a new psychiatrist to help in his defense.
Mr. Rifkin said he wanted to carefully determine what documents were given to the new doctor so that the doctor was not given anything "incriminating." Mr. Rifkin also talked in the letters of writing a book and marketing his story before it became a public record.
"This just said to me, 'Here's a smart clever man who knows just what he's doing and is trying to cash in on it,' " Mr. Cavaco said.
Another juror, who declined to give her name but said she works for a branch of Apple Bank in Bethpage, also said that it was Mr. Rifkin's comment "I'm not in the book" that "stands out most in my mind."
"He knew he wasn't crazy," she said. "He knew what he was doing was wrong."
The letters Mr. Rifkin wrote and all of his taped conversations with his own and prosecution psychiatrists and psychologists became a part of the court record because Mr. Rifkin pursued the insanity defense, which places the burden of proof on him.
Margarita Gonzalez of Brooklyn, whose 23-year-old sister, Jenny Soto, was one of Mr. Rifkin's victims, said she was praying for a guilty verdict and wanted to shout with joy when the jury announced its decision.
But she said the verdict did not bring an end to her pain. "I'm just going to keep going to the other trials, and maybe they'll get around to my sister's," she said. "Then I can go back to my own life."

HEADLINE: Christopher Presses Mexico To Insure Its Election Is Fair

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 9

 BODY:
In a sign of growing American concern that political strife could arise from Mexico's coming presidential election, Secretary of State Warren Christopher urged the Mexican Government today to take further steps to assure a credible outcome, officials of the two countries said.
Publicly, Mr. Christopher took the opportunity of a biannual meeting of senior United States and Mexican officials to praise the economic and political changes undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and voice confidence that the Aug. 21 vote would be free and fair. 
 In private, however, American officials said Mr. Christopher departed from the agenda of the so-called Binational Commission to convey the Clinton Administration's belief that Mexico must leave behind the fraudulent practices and contested results of its electoral past if ties between the two countries are to be strengthened.
"Any kind of challenge to the legitimacy of the election will be a tremendous problem for our relationship," said one of several United States officials who discussed the American position on the condition they not be identified.
"There is a feeling that the general lines of the electoral reforms they have laid out are in the right direction," the official said of election-law changes that the Mexican Congress has approved in recent months or is now considering. "There's less confidence that these things are working out in the way they should."
For the most part, United States officials said they had merely pushed the Mexicans to approve and fully implement democratic reforms that the Government and its Institutional Revolutionary Party had already promised to adopt. Those include auditing the voter rolls, prohibiting the political use of Government funds, new limits on campaign spending and more equal access to the news media for opposition parties.
Yet the officials said their warnings also reflected a sense that some Mexican Cabinet officials are resisting the proposed changes and that despite the passage of other measures their success will still depend on how they are put into effect.
In particular, the officials said Mr. Christopher pressed the Mexican Foreign Minister, Manuel Tello Macias, to support the invitation of foreign election observers as a way of increasing the legitimacy of the result. Two officials said President Clinton also raised the issue in a conversation with the Mexican Ambassador to Washington, Jorge Montano, on May 5.
Three Mexican officials said that while Mr. Tello and some others did oppose the observers, Mr. Salinas supported their presence.
With his assent, they said, members of the United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit visited Mexico in late April. They added that the Government would soon respond to a memorandum from the unit suggesting that it could play a limited role in helping to organize the network of Mexican-born observers that has emerged over the last three years.
The stance taken by Mr. Christopher and other American officials represents a shift in United States policy toward Mexico after the peasant rebellion that began Jan. 1 in the southern state of Chiapas and the assassination on March 23 of the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. Both events have badly shaken the Government and its party.

HEADLINE: Executives Balking At Clinton Health Plan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
As Congress moves toward a vote on health care, the great majority of the nation's top executives are lining up against President Clinton's plan -- particularly his insistence that companies insure all their workers and pay most of the cost, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Business opposition to the Clinton plan, with its mandatory coverage, appears to have increased in recent months, some executives suggested in interviews after the poll. Some say they oppose the plan even though it might reduce their health insurance costs, because they are philosophically opposed to giving the Government a greater role in health care, as the President would do. 
 While there are some notable exceptions -- like the Ford Motor Company and the Bethlehem Steel Corporation -- opposition to big government has become the corporate rallying cry in the battle over health care legislation. When President Clinton first proposed his plan, many companies welcomed his ideas. Now, however, the broad corporate resistance presents a big obstacle to passage of the White House's proposal.
"The crowd I run in, there is clear opposition to the Clinton plan, and it is solidifying," said Richard K. Davidson, chief executive of the Union Pacific Railroad, who is among the opponents, although the Clinton plan would probably reduce Union Pacific's costs for insuring 28,000 employees. "People are thinking of the negatives, the big brother role for government, the hidden costs, the taxation, that sort of thing. They fear big-government solutions."
The poll of top officers at 484 companies, representing a cross section of corporate America, showed a preference for keeping the present basic payment system, with its heavy reliance on voluntary, rather than mandatory, company-sponsored insurance -- a practice that leaves gaps in coverage for millions of people.
While 60 percent of the executives agreed that the health insurance system should be changed, 75 percent balked at altering their own status. They suggested, in the interviews, changes aimed at achieving such goals as reducing malpractice claims or giving small companies easier access to private insurance. But, on the other hand, they insisted that companies should retain their right to decide whether to insure employees and at what cost. And that view showed up in large and small companies.
"The Clinton plan might save me money, but I am not for it anyway," said Melbern G. Glasscock, president of Texas Aromatics Inc., a Houston company that buys and sells petrochemicals and employs 21 people, most of them covered under a company health insurance policy. "I am against any government interference. The long-term effect is that it will end up costing us more in the long run, and we give up freedom."
 
Millions Are Left Out
 The current voluntary system leaves 48 million working Americans without health insurance from their employers, although many are covered through a spouse's policy or a parent's. Lack of coverage particularly affects part-timers and people who work for small companies. Also, some companies design their premiums to encourage workers or their families to go elsewhere for insurance -- a practice the Clinton plan would end.
The Lucas Dealership Group, a chain of auto dealerships in the San Francisco area and in Hawaii, follows this practice. Lucas pays the entire $250-a-month premium to insure each of its 711 workers, but only 50 percent of the additional amount for family members. Thus, while each employee gets full coverage free, those with a spouse and, say, two children pay $150 a month to cover them. "That encourages the spouse to sign up where he or she works, which keeps down our costs," said Donald Lucas, the company's chief executive.
The Clinton plan requires every employer to pay 80 percent of the premium for family coverage for all employees, up to a maximum of 7.9 percent of a company's payroll. (The Lucas Dealership spends 5 percent of its payroll.) If a husband and a wife work at separate companies, then each company pays for full family coverage for the same family, thus increasing the contributions to the pools for insuring all Americans.
Under the Clinton plan, the money is to be paid into regional alliances, supervised by state governments, that contract with private health groups to offer a variety of insurance plans from which employees and unemployed individuals can choose. The Federal Government would subsidize premium payments for the poor, the unemployed and low-wage workers. It is the subsidies and the bureaucracy required to administer the program that have become targets of corporate opposition.
In the poll, conducted in late April, 71 percent of the executives said that health care would "worsen" with Clinton's plan in place, a far higher degree of pessimism than among the public. Only 38 percent of 1,215 people questioned in a New York Times/CBS News Poll in April thought the Clinton proposal would cause health care to deteriorate. While 78 percent of the executives polled described themselves as Republicans or nearly so, only 45 percent of the people in the public opinion poll described themselves in the same way.
If American companies fail to get Congress to go along with their first choice -- retaining the right to control the health insurance they offer -- then 58 percent of the executives said they would accept a fallback law requiring them to offer health insurance to all their workers, but with the proviso that the employees could be charged the entire premium. Only 32 percent of the executives polled said companies should be required to pay most of the premium.
 
Small Retailer's View
 Harry Jensen, owner of two rural grocery stores near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, would accept a requirement that he offer health insurance to his 50 employees, as long as he can decide who pays the premium. Currently only 10 of his employees, all full-timers, are offered coverage. Ten other full-timers in the less profitable of his two stores are not, nor are any of the 30 part-timers in both stores.
"If you are working in a no-growth area like I am, where you can't get prices up, it is hard to pay for health insurance," said Mr. Jensen, who is president of Jensen Holiday Foods Inc. He pays half of the premium of $1,500 a month for all of his insured workers, up from $700 five years ago. "I would not mind making health insurance available to everyone, as long as I did not have to pay too much of the cost," he said. "If I did, I might have to lay people off or cut salaries."
Among the various bills before Congress, corporate America has concentrated on two principal alternatives to the Clinton approach, which is itself embodied in several bills, including one proposed yesterday by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. One of the two alternatives is sponsored mainly by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. It would require employers to offer health insurance to all employees, but without making them pay for it. The other, whose principal sponsor is Representative J. Roy Rowland, Democrat of Georgia, requires employers to offer health insurance only to employees working more than 30 hours a week -- but also without making the companies pay for it.
The Rowland bill comes close to maintaining the status quo for nearly a decade. It does so by excluding part-timers -- people working fewer than 30 hours a week -- from coverage and by exempting until 2002 any company that was contributing to group health insurance on Sept. 1, 1993. That approach has won over many companies, including the J. C. Penney Company, with 190,000 employees in stores across the country.
 
Not All Are Covered
 Penney's 65,000 part-timers are excluded from the company's health insurance plan, which offers coverage comparable to that in the Clinton package. Of the 125,000 full-timers, each working 25 hours a week or more, 90,000 are covered. Many of the rest are covered under a relative's policy at another company -- a practice that Penney, like the Lucas car dealership, tends to encourage with differential premiums. The company pays 70 percent of the cost for each employee, but only 50 percent for a spouse and 60 percent for each child.
"We consider health insurance as a benefit freely provided to attract people to work for our company," said James Schwaninger, Penney's director of government relations. "When health insurance is mandated, it is no longer a benefit. Social Security is not a benefit."
Corporate support for the Clinton plan comes mainly from giant manufacturers like Ford or Bethlehem Steel. Under union contracts, these companies pay all the cost of rich health insurance policies that cover not only all their employees but also tens of thousands of retirees not yet old enough for Medicare.
The Clinton plan would subsidize insurance premiums for these early retirees. And by subsidizing coverage for poorer Americans, the Clinton plan would also relieve these companies of the burden of cost-shifting. That happens when an indigent person is treated at a hospital or by a doctor without charge. These providers then cover the cost by padding the bills for a Ford or a Bethlehem.
 
Some Expect Lower Costs
 "The Clinton plan would lower our costs over a number of years," said Benjamin C. Boylston, vice president of human resources at Bethlehem, which has 20,000 employees and 70,000 retirees. He added that "most companies, if they really looked at their numbers," would find that the Clinton plan lowered their costs.
The poll offered contradictory evidence on this point. At least two-thirds of the executives disagreed with Mr. Boylston, saying the Clinton plan would raise their costs. But more than half also said that they did not know yet what the impact might be on their businesses.
The Union Pacific Railroad, like Bethlehem, offers rich health care coverage, although it has fewer retirees. But like so many other executives, Mr. Davidson, the railroad's chief executive, opposes the Clinton plan on the ground that he is against big government. "We would end up with additional taxes and the costs of a government infrastructure that would offset any savings from less cost-shifting," he said.
While big companies like Union Pacific and Ford might cut their spending on health care under a Clinton plan, many small companies might end up having to pay more, among them Morey Mahoney Advertising, a Denver agency with 14 employees. It pays 80 percent of the premium for family coverage for its employees, and the Clinton plan would probably drive up the agency's costs, says Arthur Mahoney Jr., the president.
Nevertheless, he favors it. "I have a major problem with anything that is inefficient," Mr. Mahoney said. "But no one has been able to demonstrate that the insurance industry, with all its multiple forms of bureaucracy, is more efficient than the Government. And this is a problem that cannot be solved by taking a selfish view of one's self-interest."
 
 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
 The New York Times/CBS News Poll of business executives is based on telephone interviews, conducted from April 15 to April 29, with senior executives at companies throughout the United States.
The sample of companies and executives was randomly drawn by Dun & Bradstreet Information Services from those listed in its data base of privately held and publicly owned companies.
As with previous polls in this series, companies with $5 million or more in annual revenues were eligible for the survey. However, because the subject of the latest poll, health care, is especially relevant to small business, an additional sample of companies with less than $5 million in revenues was also drawn for comparative purposes.
At each company, one senior executive was interviewed. Titles eligible for the poll included owner, partner, chief executive, president, chairman, executive vice president and senior vice president, with first opportunity for an interview given to the most senior official.
The completed sample included 115 interviews in companies with annual revenues of $500 million or more, 121 interviews in companies with $100 million to $499 million, and 248 interviews in companies with $5 million to $99 million in annual revenue. This combined sample of 484 was then weighted by revenue size to reflect the actual distribution of all listed companies in the country, because smaller companies predominate.
The separate sample of very small businesses -- those with revenues of less than $5 million -- had an additional 191 interviews.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, results based on such samples will differ by no more than six percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out senior executives at all listed companies in the country with revenues exceeding $5 million.
The potential sampling error for groups with fewer cases is larger. For example, for the group of companies with less than $5 million in revenue, the potential error is plus or minus seven percentage points.

HEADLINE: AT&T Wins $4 Billion Saudi Project

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
After heavy lobbying by top officials of the Clinton Administration, Saudi Arabia selected the AT&T Corporation today to modernize its entire telecommunications system -- a deal the company said would be worth $4 billion over the next six years.
The decision marks another major example of the Administration's determination to campaign for American companies in winning big contracts from foreign governments. 
 Two months ago, after personal campaigning by President Clinton and other top officials, Saudi Arabia awarded a $6 billion contract for commercial aircraft to two big American companies, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Over the last several months, President Clinton has written King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, urging him to give serious consideration to the American telephone giant. In addition, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown has made the case personally on two trips to Riyadh since September, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke on AT&T's behalf during his own trip there a month ago.
Under the decision announced today, the Saudi Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications signed a letter of intent awarding AT&T the job of modernizing the entire telephone network with fiber optics, advanced switching systems and a nationwide cellular telephone system.
The job has been ardently sought by many of the world's biggest telecommunications companies. The losers in today's decision are believed to be Alcatel S.A. of France; Siemens A.G. of Germany; Northern Telecom of Canada, and an alliance between Ericsson of Sweden and the NEC Corporation of Japan.
Each company submitted detailed proposals last September, and each has been supported at least to some degree by its Government.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France visited Saudi Arabia several months ago, and is believed to have pressed the case for Alcatel. Top Swedish officials pleaded on behalf of Ericsson. And Ottawa recently announced generous financing arrangements for countries buying telecommunications from Canada.
In today's action, the Saudi Government essentially decided that it would deal only with AT&T. Although the company must now negotiate a formal contract for the precise terms, the decision virtually assures AT&T that the business will belong to it.
The Saudis offered little detailed information today on why they had picked AT&T, though AT&T has been doing business in the country for 15 years.
In a statement, Telecommunications Minister Alawi Darwish Kayyal said simply that "after several months of intense and detailed analysis by our engineers of all the offers, AT&T was chosen as the best, both technically and in cost."
Executives of the company also cited those factors, and explicitly acknowledged the Administration's political assistance.
"We are extremely pleased with the strong support we got from Clinton Administration, particularly from Secretary Brown and Secretary Christopher," said Dan Hesse, president of AT&T Network Systems International.
 
U.S. Redeeming Back Credits
 Daniel F. Burton, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a nonprofit group in Washington supported by business and other groups, said the United States was undoubtedly calling in foreign policy chits that it earned from orchestrating the Persian Gulf war against Iraq.
"I think it's highly appropriate," Mr. Burton said. "The Administration is saying, 'We've helped you in terms of your foreign policy needs, and now our foreign policy objectives have changed to place greater emphasis on economic issues and we'd like you to help us.' "
Mr. Hesse said that AT&T had offered the Saudis a financing package for the project, but that the United States Government would not play a financing role, as it did in the aircraft deal. In that case, the United States Export-Import Bank offered $6.2 billion in loan guarantees.
Ann Frye, a spokeswoman for the Export-Import Bank, said it had offered financial assistance, though far less than the deal's total value of $4 billion. She said the Saudi Government had not so far taken up the offer.
Even in its current state, Saudi Arabia's communications system is considered relatively advanced in the region, with satellite transmission and international direct dialing from urban areas. AT&T will extend that process and further modernize the system.
Under the terms of today's deal, AT&T will build a digital phone network with 1.5 million lines, and supply the extensive switching equipment, network management systems and training projects that the network will require. At least 200 sites are involved, many in remote rural areas.
The company will also build a cellular telephone system capable of serving 200,000 customers across the country. The entire project is scheduled to be completed by the year 2000.
The deal was announced after the stock market closed. In Big Board trading, shares of AT&T closed down 25 cents at $51.75.

HEADLINE: In Wave of Anticrime Fervor, States Rush to Adopt Laws

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

 BODY:
The Florida Legislature has voted to increase the size of the state's prison system by nearly one third and to try juvenile criminals, regardless of their age, as adults when they commit three felonies. Texas has approved "no bail" provisions for sex offenders and other violent criminals, and proposals known as "three strikes and you're out" and "truth in sentencing" are finding support in state legislatures from coast to coast.
While much of the nation's attention has been focused on the Federal anticrime package to be negotiated by the House and the Senate, state legislatures have been moving even more quickly and aggressively to address the issue. Responding to what they describe as a state of alarm among their constitutents, lawmakers are writing tough new bills and supporting ballot initiatives intended to punish criminals more severely while they are in prison and make it more difficult for them to get out. 
 The single most popular legislation is the "three strikes and you're out" policy of life in prison without parole for criminals convicted of a third serious felony. Variants of this idea have been introduced in more than 30 states since voters in Washington State approved such a law last November and legislators in California and New Mexico did the same this year.
But legislatures are also moving toward treating both juvenile and adult offenders more harshly, as well as weighing stricter controls on guns and imposing "truth in sentencing" rules that would preclude early release for prisoners.
"It's almost impossible to keep up with what's passing in the 50 states, much less what is pending," said Donna Hunzeker, a criminal justice analyst at the National Council of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research group with headquarters in Denver. On gun control alone, the organization calculates, more than 2,000 bills have been introduced this year, an increase of more than 100 percent over last year's record figure.
The rush by states to enact tough new anticrime legislation is exemplified by Florida, which has the nation's highest crime rate. Galvanized by the widely publicized killings of 10 foreign tourists in less than a year, the Florida Legislature convened last fall for a special session on crime, during which it made it illegal for juveniles to possess handguns. Almost simultaneously, legislators in Colorado, responding to a spate of drive-by shootings, took the same step in a special session of their own.
The crime issue also dominated the Florida Legislature's regular session, which ended April 15. Though lawmakers here balked at a "three strikes" proposal endorsed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat seeking re-election, saying it would be too costly, and though they defeated a proposal for the "chemical castration" of rapists, they did approve measures that would hold parents legally accountable for crimes committed by their children, and they authorized localities to impose curfews on teen-agers.
Some of the burst of activity around the country has come as elections draw near; talking tough on crime clearly has political appeal. But public sentiment has been deeply stirred by a succession of brutal incidents like the tourist killings in Florida, the kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas in California, the slaying of Michael Jordan's father in North Carolina, a carjacking death in suburban Washington, and the shooting rampage on the Long Island Rail Road.
 
'Politically Irresistible'
 "People are just fed up," said Bret Kinsella, a staff member for the North Carolina Senate President Pro Tem, Marc Basnight. The Legislature there earlier this month concluded a seven-week special session, the first extended extra session in state history, to grapple with the problem. "There was crime before, but you don't see the types of crime we have now," Mr. Kinsella said. "It's sociopathic, and that's the difference."
The aggressiveness of the states on the issue also reflects the reality of where and how crimes are committed and prosecuted. About 95 percent of all criminal cases are handled at the state or local level, a figure not expected to change much even with the expansion of Federal jurisdictions under the anticrime package in Congress.
But the punitive tone of much of the state legislation already approved or pending worries many experts. They say that building more prisons and imposing longer sentences is a strategy that has already failed to halt crime. They call for more support of alternatives to incarceration, especially for young, first-time offenders.
Getting tough "is a politically irresistible response to crime," said Beth Carter, national coordinator of the Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy, a coalition of state law-enforcement and elected officials that seeks more crime prevention efforts. Legislatures around the country appear to be acting on the principle that "if the response to crime is not lock 'em up, people will think you're doing nothing about crime," she added.
 
A Call for Discretion
 Research shows, however, that "acting on the crime after the crime has taken place will only help so far," Ms. Carter said.
"It is necessary, but not sufficient," and must be accompanied by efforts to keep young offenders out of prisons that have become "schools for crime," she said.
A few states have, in fact, taken a more balanced approach. Minnesota has approved legislation that will impose stiffer penalties for a variety of crimes, but the state is also alloting more money for crime prevention programs. Lawmakers there have rejected an automatic "three strkes and you're out" policy in favor of discretion in sentencing.
"Why would you want to put a third-time barroom brawler in prison and run the risk of letting out a first-time rapist?" asked Marcia Greenfield, administrative assistant for the Crime Prevention Committee of the Minnesota State Senate. "We want to have the flexibility to toughen penalties as we see fit, depending on the record of the offender."
By and large, though, states have chosen punishment over prevention, even when juveniles are involved. During its special session, North Carolina approved a measure that allows youths as young as 13 to be tried as adults, and makes an adult trial mandatory if a 13-year-old is charged with first-degree murder.
 
Three Strikes or One?
 Other states have had to contend with measures so Draconian as to be whimsical. "One legislator wants three strikes and you're dead," said Thomas R. Caltagirone, the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. "It's Fantasyland up here. I'm trying to get cooler heads to prevail. Whether I'll succeed or not, I don't know."
Inevitably, some states are now arguing that the "three strikes" policy is too generous. Georgia recently approved legislation that would provide for life-without-parole sentences to offenders who have been convicted twice of violent crimes like murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, rape or other sex crimes.
"If you want three strikes in Georgia, you'd better join a baseball team," Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat seeking re-election, said last month when he signed a bill putting a proposed constitutional amendment to that effect on the November ballot. In addition, California is considering "one strike" legislation that would apply to rapists and child molesters.
As the Georgia constitutional amendment effort makes clear, though, both voters and politicians increasingly see ballot initiatives as an alternative to a legislative process that is slow and full of compromises. Florida appears likely to vote on a "truth in sentencing" amendment that would require criminals to serve 85 percent of their sentences before becoming eligible for parole, while "victims' rights" proposals will be on the ballots in six states from Alaska to Maryland.
 
'The Grand Slam'
 In Washington, the two men who led the drive for last year's "three strikes" initiative are sponsoring a new ballot measure they call "hard time for armed crime." Their plan would increase sentences for crimes committed with guns, make the theft of a firearm a more serious crime than the theft of other property, and require stiffer sentences in cases of drive-by shootings.
Neighboring Oregon, alarmed that "three strikes" laws in Washington and California may send criminals its way, is now witnessing a drive to get a package called "the grand slam" on the ballot. Those proposals would require all able-bodied state prisoners to work or study, prohibit the reduction of criminal sentences without a two-thirds vote by the Legislature, make it more difficult to sentence criminals to probation or community service, and impose mandatory minimum sentences for all offenders older than 15 who are convicted of violent felonies.
"I have been frustrated by the lack of political will to take some tough steps on crime," said Kevin Mannix, a Democratic state representative who is sponsoring the initiatives. "I think the people are way ahead of the politicians."

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Over Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Inflation fears hit the financial markets hard for a second straight session yesterday. As long-term interest rates soared to a 19-month high in the bond market, stock prices declined sharply. Blue chips like Caterpillar, interest rate-sensitive utilities like Duke Power and high-technology stocks like Intel all were hurt.
For traders, yesterday was a replay of Friday's market, only worse. Then, stronger-than-expected data from the Government on job creation led to renewed inflation fears, a rout in bond prices and a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 Some traders had hoped for an inflation-fighting increase in short-term interest rates on Friday and didn't get it. More, however, had expected a rate increase yesterday. High inflation cuts the value of current bonds and raises corporate borrowing costs, thus hurting stocks.
But when the Fed move did not materialize around 11:30 A.M., the typical time for such action, the Dow began to fall steadily, dropping 40.46 points for the day to close at 3,629.04.
 
Now, 'a Waiting Game'
 Now, traders forecast volatile markets until the Fed acts between now and its policy-setting meeting next Tuesday.
"It's going to be a waiting game now," said Kathleen M. Camilli, chief fixed-income economist for Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an economic consultant. "The longer it takes the Fed to act, the higher bond yields will rise."
Yields on the benchmark 30-year bond have risen faster than any time in recent memory, bond watchers said, a mark of traders' anxiety about inflation. [Page D19.]
If the Fed does not act quickly, Ms. Camilli said, the central bank may be trying to prove that "the Fed is not hostage to the markets" or that it may want interest rates to rise sharply to help cool an overheating economy.
Since April 27, just nine trading sessions ago, the long bond has added more than half a percentage point. It settled yesterday at 7.63 percent, up 9 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
At this rate, the long bond could hit 8 percent by the end of the week, further adding to stock-market volatility. "I don't think I've seen anything like this since early 1987," Frederic T. Leiner, fixed-income market strategist at Continental Bank in Chicago, said. "The magnitude astonishes me."
 
Nasdaq Index Falls 9.90 Points
 The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 5.50 points, to 442.32, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.90 points, to 722.96. The New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 3.14 points, to 245.33, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks, 1,756 to 509. The American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 4.31 points, to 435.42.
The number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange was light at about 251 million shares, about 17 percent below this year's daily average of about 303 million shares.
Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow industrials, 24 fell, led by Caterpillar, which fell 2 1/2, to 105 5/8, on no discernible news. Philip Morris, another Dow stock, fell 2, to 50, after news reports that a rival, Brown & Williamson, had kept silent about cigarette hazards while the United States Surgeon General was preparing his landmark 1964 report on smoking.
Of 500 component stocks in the S.& P. 500, 375 stocks fell, led in declines not only by Philip Morris, but also Exxon, General Electric, AT&T and the FPL Group, the parent of Florida Power and Light. Exxon fell 5/8, to 61 3/8, on no discernible news. General Electric fell 1 3/4, to 94 7/8, after increasing its bid on Sunday for the Kemper Corporation, which put itself on the auction block to the highest bidder.
When interest rates rise, income stocks like utilities are often hurt. AT&T fell 1/4, to 51 3/4, despite announcing that it had won a contract valued at $4 billion to supply telecommunicatinos to Saudi Arabia. Duke Power fell 1 5/8, to 34. And FPL Group, which like other electric utilities pays high dividends, dropped 4 3/8, to 27 1/2. It announced a cut in its dividend, its first in 48 years, after determining that its payout was too high.
Symptomatic of the stock selloff in many high-technology companies, Intel, the maker of computer microprocessors, fell 11/16 , to 58 5/8, in Nasadaq trading.
Shares of Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. fell 20 percent, dropping 5 5/8, to 22 3/8, in Nasdaq trading, after investors rebelled against the company's five-year plan to increase market share at the expense of near-term profits.
McKesson's shares jumped 5 5/8, or 8 percent, to 77 7/8, after The Sunday Times of London said Glaxo Holdings was negotiating a multibillion-dollar deal with the company.
Interneuron Pharmaceuticals saw its shares plunge 1 1/4, or 17 percent, to 6, in Nasdaq trading, after the company issued a statement disputing a study that criticized its prescription anti-obesity drug.

Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await an Interest-Rate Rise

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against leading European currencies yesterday as a much-anticipated increase in American short-term interest rates did not materialize.
But the dollar rose against the Japanese yen as President Clinton and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata of Japan said they wanted to find a way to revive trade negotiations soon, before the July meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
 
 
Dollar at 102.80 Yen in New York
 The dollar, which recently neared its post-World War II low against the yen, has been under pressure because of a soaring American trade deficit with Japan. 
 The dollar fell to 1.6539 German marks in late New York trading from 1.6621 marks on Friday. But it edged up to 102.80 yen, from 102.53 yen on Friday.
Many market players had hoped that the Federal Reserve would respond to the latest signs of economic strength by pushing up the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans ahead of Treasury's quarterly "mini" refunding, a major offering of three-year and 10-year notes scheduled for today and tomorrow.
But as the day wore on and it became clear that the Fed would not act, the 30-year Treasury bond fell to an 18-month low, extending steep losses suffered on Friday. The dollar was dragged down as well.
Traders said this was another example that European debt markets are increasingly luring funds away from the United States market.
Donald Maude, the chief United States fixed-income strategist at Scotia-McLeod, said the absence of an immediate Fed move seemed to indicate that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had not yet managed to get all members of the Federal Open Market Committee -- the Fed's monetary policy-making arm -- to agree on the magnitude of the next funds rate increase.
Meanwhile, the British pound rose in New York to $1.4985 from late Friday's $1.4935. The dollar also fell to 1.4110 Swiss francs, from 1.4125; 5.6665 French francs, from 5.6935 on Friday, and 1,587 Italian lire, from 1,596. The Canadian dollar was little changed, at 72.35 United States cents.

Price of Copper Advances On Signs of Faster Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices jumped to a 13-month high yesterday amid new indications that the American and European economies are growing faster, increasing the likely industrial demand for the metal.
Copper for July delivery rose 2.10 cents, to 97.55 cents a pound, its highest price since March 1993, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
 "You have a lot of things working in its favor," said David Rinehimer, director of futures research at Lehman Brothers, including "indications that European demand is picking up" and "the data that came out Friday as far as growth prospects here."
The Labor Department reported on Friday that 267,000 jobs were added to the economy in April, a number that exceeded economists' expectations and pointed to strong growth.
 
 
German Export Orders
 Europe's economy also is growing again. Export orders in Germany rose by 5.8 percent in April. Although European copper consumption fell by 10 percent in 1993, analysts said demand should increase by about 2 percent there this year.
Steep declines in stockpiles are also encouraging traders to push prices higher. Last week, stockpiles held in London Metal Exchange warehouses fell by 3.5 percent, the 15th consecutive week of declines. Stockpiles in New York have fallen 59 percent so far this year.
"What's happening in Europe is some supply is moving to the U.S." Mr. Rinehimer said, as U.S. copper prices have risen above Europe's. Also, copper demand is rising in Korea and Taiwan, encouraging shipments from South America to be diverted there instead of sent to the United States or Europe.
The rally in copper did not extend to other metals. June gold fell $2.20, to $382.30 an ounce, on the Comex, while July silver lost 3 cents, to $5.445 an ounce.
On other commodity markets, gasoline and crude oil prices advanced after the Chevron Corporation said a fire yesterday forced it to shut a 63,000-barrel-a-day catalytic converter at a Mississippi refinery.
Unleaded gasoline for June delivery gained 0.97 cent, to 51.07 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while crude oil rose 3 cents, to $17.73 a barrel. Heating oil rose 0.24 cent, to 48.34 cents a gallon.
 
 
Coffee Prices Jump
 Elsewhere, coffee prices soared, rising to their highest level since June 1989, after coffee exporters said they would release only half the coffee that they have held off the market.
July coffee soared 4.7 cents, to $1.089 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
The Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which represents about 80 percent of the world's coffee exports, decided yesterday to release 50 percent of the coffee held in warehouses since October as part of a plan to lift prices. The plan called for the group, which holds about 525 million pounds of coffee, to sell its stocks once the average price exceeded 85 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Russia Seeks Help to Fix Its Phones

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Boris Y. Nemtsov, the Governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region 250 miles east of here, introduced a novel program recently: selling, for up to $450, a certificate that promises purchasers they will get telephones installed in their homes within six months instead of the years they would normally wait. Officials said residents were snapping up the certificates.
The money raised will be spent improving the region's decrepit telephone system. By paying interest at 1 percent a day for any delay beyond six months, the plan provides considerable incentive for the local telephone company to speed its work. Though the method may be unorthodox and the scale relatively small, the plan indicates the huge demand for improved communications in a country where getting a dial tone can be a triumph of will, and of the lengths Russia is going to in addressing the problem. 
 If there is a consensus within Russia on anything, it is that the telephone system must be upgraded, to provide Russians with greater access to service and to make it possible for business to be conducted more easily with the rest of the world and within a country that spans 11 time zones.
"It's hard to speak seriously of economic and business development in Russia without the development of modern telecommunications systems," said Dmitri B. Garamov, the director general of Westelcom, which operates the nation's main international telephone service.
Modernizing the telecommunications system is so high a priority that it is one of the few businesses in which the Russian Government, local and regional authorities and the domestic industry have all made a determined effort to welcome foreign investors like U S West and AT&T -- or at least the cash, technology and operating skills they bring.
"It's next to impossible to develop a high-quality telecommunications infrastructure without Western investment," said Vyacheslav F. Gurkin, a former first deputy communications minister who now runs Moscow Cellular Communications, a joint venture with U S West, the regional telephone company based in Denver.
Indeed, U S West and other foreign companies have established sizable operations here, and are cautiously optimistic that the upgrading of the national and local phone systems will prove to be a huge business opportunity.
"In a place this size, communications in the long run is going to be a big deal," said Viktor V. Pavlenko, the president of U S West International's division in Russia.
Right now, however, communications in Russia is a big headache. By various counts, Russia has 11 to 15 phone lines for every 100 people. In Spain there are 35 lines for 100 people, and in the United States, 70 lines for 100 people.
In Moscow and St. Petersburg, callers can usually count on getting a dial tone, but not much more. Calls are often not completed, or are plagued by static and other mysterious noises, or are abruptly cut off. In outlying areas, service is much worse -- if it exists at all.
Even in Moscow, which has 4 million of the country's 23 million phone lines, hundreds of thousands of people have been waiting years for service.
The centerpiece of the nation's telecommunications strategy now is a multibillion-dollar plan, in which U S West will play a key role, to install 31,000 miles of new intercity long-distance lines and 50 new switching centers across the country. After a number of fits and false starts, there is cautious optimism all around that the plan -- the biggest telecommunications project on the boards anywhere -- will come to fruition, wiring the country reliably together for the first time.
For foreign companies seeking business here, an even bigger prize lies just over the horizon: the tens of billions of dollars -- some estimates run as high as $120 billion -- that it would take over several decades to add 20 million or more new local lines and bring Russia's phone service up to the level of, say, Spain's.
While both Russian and Western executives here said they were hopeful about the opportunities, the prospects for the modernization programs remain clouded by the very scale and the cost of the task in a nation that is struggling just to keep its economy functioning.
 
Regionals Take Action
 Moreover, it is unclear that the Ministry of Communications can exert sufficient control over local and regional telephone authorities to pull off what some Russian telephone executives consider one last gigantic central planning project. They said the local phone companies were increasingly setting up their own expansion projects and responding more to local pressure for more lines and better service than to plans hatched far away in Moscow.
Then there is the continuing question of political stability. When Mr. Pavlenko of U S West assembled a group of institutional investors from the United States and Europe in Moscow last Oct. 25 to ask for $40 million to help finance the American company's expansion here, he hardly needed to point out the risks. Clearly visible through the conference room window was the charred hulk of the White House, the parliamentary building where a political uprising had been violently squashed by President Boris N. Yeltsin a few weeks earlier.
Despite the risks, nearly every big American and European telecommunications-equipment supplier and telephone network operator has a presence here, including AT&T, Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany. Cable and Wireless of Britain recently bought a stake in an international long-distance carrier in St. Petersburg.
U S West, France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom have been named as the foreign partners in the domestic long-distance upgrading project, which is known as "50-50" after the 50 switching centers and 50,000 kilometers of long-distance lines involved. The foreign companies are seeking ways to minimize their risk without giving up the potential rewards, and none has done so in more innovative ways than U S West.
 
Investors Brought In
 To raise more money without increasing its own financial exposure here, U S West eventually persuaded its group of institutional investors, including units of Morgan Stanley and Baring Securities, to put up $40 million. The investment, as well as all of U S West's operations in Russia, went into a newly formed entity called the Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation, which U S West will manage.
In addition, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a United States Government agency that helps finance private deals in emerging markets, agreed to provide $125 million in loan guarantees. Including all its borrowing capacity, the venture should have $400 million to $500 million to invest in telecommunications projects in Russia, Mr. Pavlenko of U S West said. All of the venture's profits will be reinvested in the business for some time, he said.
While the "50-50" project is the biggest single deal in the cards, the U S West venture is not concentrating all its energies or investment there.
It has already found considerable eagerness among local and regional governments and their telephone companies in pursuing their own modernization plans. It signed a joint venture deal in March with Rossvyazinform, the local phone company in Rostov, and Rostelcom, Russia's primary long-distance company, to provide long-distance digital switching equipment, cellular phone service, cable television and other services in the Rostov area, 400 miles south of Moscow.
In addition to Moscow Cellular, U S West and its investment partners also own stakes in cellular phone services in St. Petersburg and 10 other regions around the country, as well as 50 percent of Westelcom, which operates the three main international "gateways" for switching international calls.
"Clearly you're betting that this place is going forward and that this infrastructure is critical to the continued economic reforms of the country," Mr. Pavlenko said. "If the trends continue and you look at this over a one-to-two-decade period, this is a very interesting place to be."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Infectious Diseases on the Rebound in the U.S., a Report Says

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

 BODY:
DOZENS of healthy people become acutely short of breath and die from a new virus, which turns out to belong to a group of viruses known to cause kidney disease and bleeding. Why the new virus attacks the lung, not the kidneys, is a mystery.
A parasite rarely known to affect humans causes the largest outbreak of waterborne illness in this country. 
 A toxin produced by an intestinal bacterium contaminates undercooked hamburger, causing kidneys to fail and killing several children.
These are not the myths of science fiction.
All occurred in the United States last year, severely straining the resources of health departments and showing that vulnerability to new infections has never been greater. In addition, in a number of instances recently, bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics.
The lung disease was produced by a new hantavirus, and it has been fatal in more than half of the 72 cases that are known to have occurred since it was first detected in New Mexico last summer.
The parasite, cryptosporidium, contaminated the water supply of Milwaukee, producing prolonged diarrhea in 400,000 people and putting 4,400 in the hospital.
The toxin, produced by E. coli bacteria, infected not only people who ate the hamburgers but probably some who ate salad cut with the same utensils used on the meat, and some who came into contact with those who were infected. It made more than 500 people in the Seattle area sick and led to kidney failure in at least 29. Four died, all children.
Elsewhere, a new strain of cholera swept across India and Bangladesh, spread to Thailand and threatened other parts of Asia, infecting hundreds of thousands of people and killing thousands. Many experts believe cholera is likely to move from Latin America, where in 1991 it struck for the first time since 1895, into the Caribbean in the not-too-distant future.
Not so long ago, Government officials and medical leaders all but pronounced the end of infectious diseases as a major public health problem. These striking examples of new and emerging diseases prove that prediction wrong. They join a list that includes, among others, AIDS, legionnaire's disease, Lyme disease, Lassa fever and bleeding and fever from the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some were unknown or minor hazards only a decade or two ago. Others increased significantly in incidence over the last 20 years. Still others threaten to become bigger hazards in the near future.
Some new and emerging infections are part of the poorly understood natural cycles of epidemics. Others reflect the rapidly changing spectrum of infections that has accompanied population growth, expanding poverty, urban migration, increasing international travel and rapidly changing technology.
Infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in the world. The toll is swelling as a result of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, which is estimated to have infected 14 million people, mainly in Africa and Asia, since it was first recognized in 1981. By 2000, experts estimate, the number infected will be 40 million.
Yet overconfidence about infectious diseases has weakened public health systems in this country and elsewhere, jeopardizing their ability to detect and prevent new and old ones. What the United States needs now, a new Federal report says, is an infusion of up to $125 million a year to carry out a plan to provide the vigilance and rapid response needed to contain infections.
The single most important weapon in any country's defense against infections is its disease surveillance system. Surveillance is used to characterize disease patterns by time, place and person, to detect epidemics, to evaluate prevention and control programs and project future health care needs.
"Whatever shape health care reform takes in this country, surveillance will be the key to the meaningful evaluation of new programs," said the new Federal report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal agency in Atlanta.
The sudden, unexpected appearance of AIDS shocked health officials into a belated recognition of the need for improved surveillance and an awareness that such vigilance might serve as an early warning system to prevent new and emerging infections from becoming public health disasters. But the report said, "The ability to detect what is new or emerging depends on the capacity to identify and track the routine as well as the unusual."
Successful surveillance hinges on the accuracy of statistical analyses, and they hinge on the accuracy of reports that doctors and hospitals are supposed to mail to local health departments about specified infections. But many diseases are notoriously underreported in the United States.
Surveillance also relies on an effective laboratory system. Microbiologists can be the first to detect genetic changes in organisms that could signal an impending outbreak of antibiotic-resistant infections. Microbiologists can also be the first to detect known diseases that have spread to new geographic areas and populations. Laboratories can be vital for the early detection of exotic microbial agents that might be used for biological warfare or terrorist activities.
Surprisingly, the report said, no Federal resources are provided to state and local health departments to support the national disease reporting system. And other parts of surveillance systems have been weakened by budget cuts.
Although widespread misuse of antibiotic drugs has led to the emergence of resistant bacteria, the magnitude of the problem is unknown because no national system exists to monitor it.
Many outbreaks from infections that are transmitted through contaminated food and water go unrecognized or are detected late because current disease monitoring systems are inadequate to confront the present and future challenges. Twelve states have no monitoring system at all for surveying foodborne or waterborne diseases, the report said.
One of the most astonishing discoveries in recent years is that a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, can cause ulcers and other stomach ailments including possibly some forms of stomach cancer. (The same bacterium was noted in the stomach in the early part of the century but was widely ignored.) Last February, the bacterium's causative role for ulcers was given widespread acceptance by a Government-appointed panel of experts that made antibiotics a required component of ulcer treatment.
Few had suspected that ulcers were caused by an infection. But H. pylori turns out to be just one of a small but growing list of microbes that have been found to produce what had previously been classified as noninfectious diseases.
Scientists have now determined that the hepatitis C virus, for instance, is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. They are exploring a link between the papillomavirus and cervical cancer. And scientists in the United States and South Africa have reported evidence linking a microbe, Chlamydia pneumoniae, to coronary artery disease. C. pneumoniae, which is also known as TAWR, is a common cause of pneumonia, bronchitis and sinusitis. The findings suggest but do not prove a link between C. pneumoniae infections and atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of heart attacks.
Scientists are also exploring the role of microbes in multiple sclerosis, Sjogren syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Kawasaki disease and insulin-dependent diabetes.
But such searches can be disappointing. From time to time, scientists have reported hints that one or another microbe causes coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis. But proof is lacking for any microbial cause of heart attacks and arthritis.
Saying that the concept of separating domestic from international health is outdated, the report suggested a number of measures to guard public health, including these:
*Improving communications between health officials in countries throughout the world so they can share more information about trends in infections.
*Creating a global network of scientific centers.
*Improving surveillance by strengthening and creating long-term collaborations and partnerships with practicing doctors, microbiologists, public agencies, universities, private industry and communities.
*Organizing a network of doctors, emergency rooms, laboratories, medical examiners, travel medicine clinics, veterinarians and others to report certain problems like influenza and drug-resistant infections as sentinel surveillance systems.
*Using modern computing techniques to speed reporting of diseases from a doctor's office to a health department.
*Using aerial photography and satellite imaging techniques to investigate environmental sources of infection and formulate effective control measures.
*Seeking to discover the role of insects or other vectors in transmitting diseases that are not yet known to be spread in such fashion.
*Teaching more about public health and the basic principles of surveillance to medical students and young doctors.
Surveillance is hampered by the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests for microbes like Mycoplasma, which causes respiratory illness, and by the lack of technicians who are proficient in applying the many tests that are available.
In both the Seattle and Milwaukee outbreaks, lack of training in the testing necessary for detection resulted in delayed recognition of outbreaks, the centers' report said.
At a time when most budgets are being cut, some see appeals for more money for infectious disease surveillance as self-serving. Yet, expensive as it is, prevention is often the cheapest medicine. Penny-pinching could be enormously costly in human suffering and dollars.

HEADLINE: American Box Turtles Decline, Perishing Cruelly in Foreign Lands

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
WHILE not exactly the American eagle or the Bengal tiger, the common box turtle, one of the most familiar and benign animals in the United States, may have a stronger hold on the memories and affections of millions of Americans. Now its very appeal has subjected it to a savage assault that threatens the future of the breed.
Box turtles by the thousands are being killed each year as the result of a booming wildlife trade that sends them to Europe as pets, say scientists, conservationists and officials on both sides of the Atlantic. Many die or are greatly weakened when jam-packed together without food or water for shipping, and many more succumb to an unsuitable European climate and to mistreatment by pet sellers and owners ignorant of the turtles' needs, they say. 
 Of the many kinds of wild animals being traded internationally, box turtles are attracting special attention because of the great numbers in which they are being exported -- 25,000 to 30,000 a year, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Since a female box turtle typically takes half a century or more to produce just two offspring that survive to reproductive age, this rate of capture and export is unsustainable and will eventually call the future of the breed into question if continued, scientists say.
Even before the surge in exports, box turtle populations, generally found east of the Rockies, were declining in many parts of the country because of human encroachment on the wild. That squeeze continues, and the added pressure of the international wildlife trade "is just disastrous," said Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a herpetologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, formerly the New York Zoological Society. The trade is not going to drive box turtles extinct any time soon, he said, but if it continues at the present rate, "it is not sustainable."
The disastrous situation has been largely unnoticed, says Suzanne Dohm, the president of the New York Turtle and Tortoise Society, which has made preservation of the turtles its top priority. In focusing on conserving more exotic and charismatic animals, she said, "we have a tendency to forget about our local species; by the time we notice what's going on in our own backyard, it's too late."
Both the society and Dr. Klemens are campaigning to persuade parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, which will meet in November in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to require permits for and the monitoring of trade in box turtles. If that were to happen, the Fish and Wildlife Service, which exercises Cites authority in the United States, would be able to enforce humane practices in the trade and to assess the magnitude of the problem better. If the turtles eventually became endangered, the participants in Cites (pronounced SITE-eez) could prohibit trade altogether, as it has done for a number of other animals.
The Fish and Wildlife Service is to decide by June 10 whether to propose a listing for the turtles under the treaty, and "most likely" will do so, said Dr. Susan Lieberman, a herpetologist who heads the branch of the agency responsible for Cites activities.
For many Americans, the black and yellow or black and orange domed shell of the box turtle is one of the earliest memories of a wild creature up close. Abundant in the past, easily found on the edges of woodlands and in fields, they have long been favored as pets. They flourish in warm conditions, hibernating in the winter (they have just come out of their sleep in the Northeast), snuggling down in dense vegetation, mud or humus during summer drought, and emerging after a good rain. That is when they are most catchable.
 
Not Fussy Eaters
 What many who capture them may not know is that these turtles' ability and willingness to eat almost anything gives them an important role in the food web of many an ecosystem, and therefore in maintaining ecological integrity. Nor, presumably, do many of the captors realize that longevity has been the key to the turtles' survival as a genus for millions of years.
"The only thing turtles have going for them, ecologically, is that they live for a long time and that they reproduce pretty much right to the end," Dr. Klemens said. In the case of the box turtle, that means a reproductive life of 50 years or more. They can easily live as long as humans, and one is said to have died at 138.
But unlike humans, turtles do not protect and nurture their young. They typically lay three or four eggs at a time, and the young are left to fend for themselves. Few reach adolescence, and fewer still become adults. This means that every adult turtle -- and especially every long-lived one -- is important to the survival of the genus.
Habitat destruction, road kills and mowing accidents have steadily reduced populations of both adults and juveniles in many parts of the country. A Texas study in the 1970's found that the local population of box turtles turned over completely within 32 years, indicating that adults were living out only part of their reproductive lives. Studies in Maryland revealed that the population in one area was cut in half between 1965 and 1975. A study from 1977 to 1987 in Wisconsin found that too few hatchlings were being born for each adult death to prevent population decline.
The decline has tended to go unnoticed because, to the casual observer, there still appear to be plenty of turtles around. Although this is true, Dr. Klemens said, many of the turtles are members of doomed populations -- the "living dead."
Into this already gloomy picture has burst the international wildlife trade.
For years, Mediterranean tortoises were favored as garden pets in northern Europe. But in 1984, trade in these tortoises was banned within the European Community on conservation grounds. Wildlife dealers looked elsewhere, and their eyes fixed on box turtles.
Though not strictly land tortoises at all (they are closely related to terrapins, and like other terrapins can swim), the box turtles resemble tortoises. In Britain, where box turtles have become especially popular, the distinction is blurred further because the British tend to refer to all species except sea turtles as tortoises.
As it became apparent that the trade in box turtles was increasing, Fish and Wildlife agents at American ports of exit began keeping detailed track of it. They counted 28,583 turtles exported in 1992 and 26,411 in 1993. Since the turtles have only recently emerged from hibernation, the 1994 season is just beginning. Dr. Lieberman said that data from Britain suggest that the exports are even higher.
 
About $1 Apiece
 Wholesalers and professional collectors typically place box-turtle orders by word of mouth to various people, including farmers and children, and pay them perhaps a dollar apiece for the animals, said Joe Ventura, a supervisory inspector for the Fish and Wildlife Service at Kennedy International Airport.
"What we've been seeing is very large numbers in shipments, 1,000 or more, sometimes 2,000 box turtles going to Europe," he said. "Initially, the animals are in horrible condition," kept in wet burlap sacks and cardboard boxes, in their own excrement, with no food or water.
Once in the hands of traders, no binding rules govern the turtles' treatment. Moral suasion has moved some shippers to treat them humanely, Mr. Ventura said, but "until they're listed under Cites, they can basically ship them any way they like."
The turtles' export value is generally declared at $5 or $6 apiece, he said. They bring 10 times that much and more on the European pet market, according to studies by British conservationists.
"There's a very long delay between the animals' being captured and gathering enough together to make it economic," said Andy C. Highfield, the director of the Tortoise Trust, a British conservation organization. "They are stressed, overcrowded, and quite frankly, half dead by the time they arrive in Europe. We are seeing the result here and it's not a pretty sight."
Mr. Highfield, who has made extensive studies of the turtles' fate, said that once the turtles arrive in Britain, their rate of illness and death is high. Some conservationists estimate that 90 percent perish prematurely after capture.
 
Inhospitable Climate
 Herpetologists say the northern European climate, with longer winters and shorter, cooler summers, is inhospitable to box turtles, just as it was to Mediterranean tortoises before them. To insure their survival there, said Dr. Klemens, would require that they live in elaborately devised environments with controlled humidity and ultraviolet light.
"You can't just take them and throw them in the garden, which is what people do," he said. There, most of them slowly die, he said, over months and months during which they do not display suffering in any obvious way.
Ignorance is a big part of the problem, said Dr. Clifford Warwick, the director of the Institute of Herpetology, an independent British scientific and conservation organization, who explained that both pet dealers and pet owners frequently do not even know what kind of turtle they have.
"You've got the blind leading the blind, literally," he said. "Owners don't know what they're doing, and the pet shop owners don't know what they're doing." Owners of turtles have told Mr. Highfield, in surveys he has taken, that if they had known the animals' true identity and survival requirements they would never have bought them.
A number of American states regulate the capture, killing and sale of box turtles, but in others, mainly in the Middle West and South, they remain unregulated. Since there is no evidence yet that they are endangered, they are not protected by the Endangered Species Act.
Dr. Klemens said that seeking separate Federal legislation would probably be more complicated than seeking a Cites listing, which, he said, seems the most appropriate course given that the convention's main purpose is to regulate trade.
Ms. Dohm sums up the situation this way:
"That foreign market is absolutely draining us. You can't buy a box turtle legally in New York State, but you can ship thousands of them out of Kennedy Airport. We cry about saving animals, and yet we let situations like this go on. Something's not quite right."

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Finchem Selected as P.G.A. Commissioner

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN 

 BODY:
Opting for continuity over change, the Tournament Policy Board of the PGA Tour named Timothy W. Finchem yesterday to succeed Deane Beman as the commissioner of the multimillion-dollar organization that oversees touring professionals.
Finchem, 47, the deputy commissioner and chief operating officer of the PGA Tour, had been rumored to be the frontrunner for the job ever since Feb. 28, when Beman announced his intention to step down. 
 Although the other candidates for the job were formidable, and included prominent golf names like Jack Frazee, former chairman of Centel Corporation; Charles Mechem, commissioner of the L.P.G.A. Tour, and Vincent Giles, president of Pros, the board never tipped its hand.
Until late yesterday morning, when Finchem went through another interview with board members in Dallas, he was still uncertain which way the board was leaning.
"I think the word would be relieved more than surprised," Finchem said of his reaction.
In the end, they were leaning close to home. Known to golf insiders as a tough, straightforward negotiator and an indefatigable worker, Finchem was always Beman's No. 1 choice for the job. A University of Richmond graduate who received his law degree from the University of Virginia, Finchem is similar to Beman in substance and probably will differ only slightly in style.
"He would have been my choice if I'd had one," said Beman, 56, who will officially end 20 years on the job when he steps down June 1. "I didn't have a vote and didn't attend any of the board meetings."
Finchem, who joined the PGA Tour in 1987 as the vice president for business affairs, came to golf from National Strategies and Marketing Group, a Washington consulting and marketing firm that he co-founded in 1984. A former deputy adviser for economic affairs to President Jimmy Carter and the national staff director for the Carter-Mondale presidential campaign in 1980, Finchem is regarded as a Washington insider.
Finchem takes over an organization that has very few pressing problems. He will have to overcome some opposition from a group of players who wanted Beman's successor to come from the ranks of touring pros. Finchem, a four-handicap at the TPC at Sawgrass, is the equivalent of a scratch player when it comes to negotiating.
"I think we'll just handle that head-on," he said. "What I really want to do is sit down and talk to every single player, particularly players who might have some misgivings, look them in the eye and tell them about what my approach will be to the job."
The main style point on which Finchem could differ from Beman is flexibility. Beman, for all his accomplishments, was viewed as a dogmatic and combative man who did not yield willingly once he had established an opinion. This was particularly true on matters such as the 15-tournament minimum for PGA Tour members, a requirement that kept many foreign players from participating more often in PGA Tour events.
His first order of business, once he smooths over any ruffled feathers, will be to forge some long-range plans for maintaining and expanding the Tour's sponsorship base, a base largely responsible for the growth of purses from $8 million when Beman took over in 1974 to their current level of more than $100 million on the three tours overseen by the PGA Tour.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Haitian Mirror

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Haiti holds up a mirror to Americans and tens of millions should look away in shame.
They live in freedom and safety because their parents or grandparents had the strength to flee pogroms or travel thousands of hard miles in search of work and bread. 
 But for years now, when Haitians have come seeking refuge, their need deep, their oppression relentless and their danger acute, they have been turned away. Children and grandchildren of earlier immigrants say nothing, mumble excuses or icily approve.
After his election, President Clinton went back on his word to allow Haitians a decent chance at entry into the promised land, instead of capturing them at sea and sending them back, as President Bush did. Now he has found the courage to recognize his error, and try to rectify it.
For giving at least a hearing, at last, to black refugees he deserves respect, not the warnings of approaching calamity that he is getting.
Black. White Americans at least should acknowledge what they see in the Haitian mirror. The Haitians have been turned back because of the color of their skin.
It is cowardly to pretend otherwise. Haitian refugees are poor, most are unschooled and some are ill. So were many of the European refugees without whom this country would now be less educated, less wealthy and less healthy than it is now.
Sons and daughters of European immigrants are among those who warn us against Haitians. They turn out studies that are supposed to show that immigrants are a hideous economic threat. In America, you can pick your study -- and on immigration I pick those like the one from the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in Washington. Ten states with the lowest concentrations of immigrants in 1980 had an unemployment rate one-third higher than the states with relatively high immigration.
"Hordes" -- the word has not been used much about immigrants since the early 20th century, when it was a favorite of anti-Semites and Catholic-haters. Now it just hangs there in the talk and writing of anti-immigration groups -- Haitians and Chinese moving toward us, over the horizon, millions and millions of foreigners, in mass, not a one of them what you could call white.
But if we have any sense we will let the nation-building record of American immigration guide us. If we decide some day that the U.S. just cannot handle any new brains or more muscles, we can abandon American self-interest in immigration then, but for heaven's sake not now.
If ever there was a country whose people deserve warmth when they seek U.S. refuge it is Haiti. It is part of the Americas, a neighbor. The thug "police" and "army" officers who rule the country with machete and gun are direct descendants of the Duvalier dictatorships so long supported and armed by the U.S. And they overturned a President who may not be to American tastes but who was democratically elected.
Somehow, we have managed to think of only one plan to help Haitians: strangle them ever tighter in sanctions. Sanctions against enemy governments like Iraq's, or as pressure for a specific political purpose against a South Africa or North Korea -- that's one thing. But sanctions that can starve out a friendly neighboring people -- how long can the Haitians stand that? How long can we?
The Haitian mirror shows more than an American double standard just against black refugees. American politicians and commentators who scream for heavy bombing of Serbia, with all its risks of a wider European war, seem petrified at the thought of any military action against a mob of Haitian killers who have only fought unarmed civilians.
I cannot understand why the Latin American republics are not volunteering to share military action against the Haitian thugs. But then I could never understand why Western Europe could not handle Bosnian intervention, if it was so hot for it, without calling for America.
U.S. intervention in Bosnia could prolong and widen war. But it is hard to believe that U.S. armed forces could not handle the Haitian cops in a few days, if they don't pack up and get out first.
So, a final thought for mirror-gazing. If Canadians were taken over by marauding gangsters, surely we would offer them something better than the simple two-part plan so many Americans think is entirely good enough for Haitians: they just stay home, and we just starve them.

HEADLINE: To End Welfare, Create Real Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The prospect of eliminating welfare, discussed in your April 22 article on Charles Murray of the American Enterprise Institute and his decadelong campaign to let poor women and children fend for themselves, sounds exciting. But history has proved that the recommendations offered by Mr. Murray and others are misdirected and will not work. 
 In the past, poorhouses and orphanages provided government assistance to the poor. Because "outdoor relief," or government subsidies, was not given, poor parents were forced to watch their children starve or give them up to institutions. Eliminating welfare today and reinstituting orphanages would not reduce out-of-wedlock births by much; it would break up families into unemployed parents and parentless children.
The value of welfare benefits has decreased continuously since the 1970's while the rate of out-of-wedlock births has risen. According to Mr. Murray's theory, these births should have decreased when benefits went down. Since they did not, welfare must not be a major factor in the rise.
We do not spend large proportions of our budgets on welfare. The amount of social spending on the children of poor single mothers (aid to families with dependent children, food stamps and Medicaid) is a small fraction of a total that includes Social Security, education, Medicare, unemployment insurance and disability insurance. An attack on welfare for its costs seems misplaced since other programs receive so much more.
Studies have shown that, realistically, only 15 percent of out-of-wedlock births can be linked to welfare benefits. Most unmarried women do not decide to have children because they know they can rely on welfare. Charles Murray's supposed statistics are proved wrong repeatedly by history and other researchers.
Democrats have listened to the experts selectively on eliminating welfare. David Ellwood and others have recommended a two-year limit, providing that child care, national health insurance, training, child support assurance and, most important, jobs are in place for those leaving welfare. The Government would create "last resort" jobs for those unable to find work in the private sector. Without these other programs, eliminating welfare will not reduce poverty or single motherhood, crime, or any other target for social change.
A set of answers offered in the studies of Mr. Ellwood and others emphasize that the availability of jobs for the mothers and fathers of poor children is the key to self-sufficiency. When there are jobs, people work. If more attention was paid to creating decent-wage jobs and instituting programs to make work pay, welfare could become obsolete by assuring that everyone who can work has a job.

HEADLINE: A to Z Plan Spells Fiscal Responsibility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The A to Z spending-cut plan, which would allow the House of Representatives to vote separately on any amendments proposed for the budget bill from A to Z, has been endorsed by a majority of the members. Yet it fails to win your endorsement in "Foolishness, From A to Z" (editorial, May 2) because the plan represents a radical departure from business as usual in the House. This is the point. Our bill compels Congress to do what state and local governments, businesses and families throughout the country have had to do -- go through each item in their budget and decide if they can afford it. 
 The "sane deliberation" you refer to has saddled our nation with $4.5 trillion of public debt. The status quo effectively ropes off three-quarters of the Federal budget from discussion and debate. As a result, our economy hobbles between periods of recession and modest recovery.
Under the A-to-Z process, members with meritorious ideas for reducing spending can have their own ideas voted on. The plan will open the agenda of the House and let the American people see how their representatives stand on spending priorities. The decisions that representatives must make will not be easy. Our deficit problem cannot be solved merely by eliminating pork-barrel projects or $500 wrenches. Denying this course, however, is opting for a far more damaging path.
If we do not force the Government to change how it operates, our economy will continue to suffer, and we will continue to burden future generations with our irresponsible fiscal policies.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans License Sale Of WNYC

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that his administration planned to sell the license for WNYC-FM, the New York City-owned classical-music station, to help close the budget deficit for the next fiscal year.
But Mr. Giuliani said the city would strive to keep the station -- one of only two that still broadcasts classical music -- on the air by buying a less expensive license from a nonprofit station. 
 Although WNYC is a publicly supported nonprofit station, it has a commercial license -- a valuable commodity in a city whose radio band is filled to capacity. Administration officials believe that by selling WNYC's commercial license, and by buying a less valuable nonprofit license, the city could reap about $60 million, without changing the content of the station's programming.
But it was unclear last night how the administration intended to obtain a new noncommercial license for the station, since Federal officials say there are no spots left on the FM dial for a new station. And an independent analyst suggested that the sale would produce much less money than the administration was estimating.
 
Trying to Bridge Shortfall
 The sale of the license is one of dozens of cost-cutting proposals Mr. Giuliani will unveil today as he presents his formal budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. The cuts are intended to fill a $2.3 billion gap between revenues and expenses, the lingering effects of a deep recession in which slow increases in tax revenues have not kept up with sharp increases in spending on welfare, Medicaid, homeless shelters and other city services.
To bridge the shortfall, Mr. Giuliani is expected to propose nearly $1.3 billion in spending cuts to city agencies. The remainder will be made up with $400 million in additional state and Federal aid, a $200 million bond-refinancing scheme and other measures aimed at increasing revenues.
But the sale of WNYC's license is an emotional proposal that goes beyond a question of dollars and cents. Supported by a nonprofit foundation, the 50-year-old station is one of the few outlets of National Public Radio programming and counts about 600,000 listeners.
 
WNYE Seen as Option
 A senior Mayoral aide said one option the city was considering was moving WNYC's classical programming over to WNYE, another FM station operated by the Board of Education. WNYE broadcasts educational programs.
WNYE was established in 1938 and broadcasts an eclectic mix of educational and instructional programming. The lineup includes also sports, jazz, political programs, and programs tailored to black and Caribbean audiences.
Although no concrete proposal has been negotiated with the Board of Education or any other radio station, Mr. Giuliani has assured board members of the station's foundation that WNYC would continue to reach the same listeners in any event.
"This is really the best possible result for the city and the listeners of WNYC-FM," he said. "At a time when the city is facing a very difficult financial situation the sale of WNYC-FM will bring in very badly needed revenues."
Irwin Schneiderman, chairman of the WNYC Foundation, called the proposal "an elegant solution." He said that even if the city has to spend money to upgrade a noncommercial station, the administration would come out ahead because the station's commercial license is so valuable. "As long as we've got a facility that's comparable to what we've got, we're happy," Mr. Schneiderman said.
Steven Bauman, the president of the WNYC Communications Group, said the Mayor had promised him that none of the station's classical programming would be lost. "If we switch to a noncommercial band, all we will have done is to have sold the commercial license, which is of no use to us," he said.
Still, selling assets is not generally viewed with favor by bond-rating agencies and fiscal monitors, who prefer to see the city reduce its long-term expenses, rather than turning to one-time ways to raise cash.
The WNYC Communications Group, which also owns a television station and an AM radio station, receives 90 percent of its $18 million annual budget from private donations. In the current fiscal year, the city provided about $1.7 million in tax dollars as well, although Mr. Giuliani has declined to say whether he would continue that subsidy.
Finding a new home for the station may be easier said than done. By last night, the Board of Education had held only "preliminary conversations" with Giuliani aides about either selling the city the license for WNYE or melding WNYC and WNYE into one, said John Beckman, a spokesman for the board, said.
"The Chancellor has emphasized instructional programming for WNYE," Mr. Beckman said. "That does not preclude in any way listening to proposals the city might have."
Stuart Bedell, a lawyer for the Mass Media Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission, said that there is no vacant frequency in New York City and that it would be highly unlikely that the F.C.C. would approve a proposal to drop a new channel into the crowded field.
 
Turning to Colleges
 So the city would have to buy a license from one of the other non-commercial stations in the city, most of which are far less powerful than WNYC-FM and are operated by colleges and universities which are unlikely to part with them.
WNYE is the most powerful of the noncommercial stations in the city limits with a broadcasting strength of 20 kilowatts. But because its transmitter is on Tillary Street in downtown Brooklyn at 430 feet above sea level, the signal does not reach outside the city.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about plans by the city to sell the operating license of WNYC-FM referred incorrectly to the signal strength of another FM station, WNYE, owned by the Board of Education. WBAI and WNYC -- not WNYE -- have the strongest FM signals and the widest listening areas in the city among noncommercial stations. Both have transmitters atop some of the city's tallest buildings. WNYE's 430-foot antenna is in downtown Brooklyn, and the reach of its signal is limited by Manhattan's towers.

HEADLINE: Nice Drive to the Ballot Box

BYLINE: By Jordan Moss; Jordan Moss, a writer, has worked for Human Serve, a national voter registration advocacy group.

 BODY:
When President Clinton signed the National Voter Registration Act, or "motor voter" bill, into law a year ago next week, it was the final achievement of the 1960's voting rights revolution. Yet today, resistance from individual states is threatening the law's promise of universal enfranchisement.
Blatant obstructions to the ballot box have been outlawed since 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was passed. "Motor voter" addresses more subtle obstacles, eliminating the maze of regulations that hamper voter registration in almost every state. With 40 percent of eligible voters unregistered, the change was long overdue. 
 Properly carried out, the new law will let Americans register to vote when they apply for driver's licenses, welfare or unemployment benefits or use other government services. But a disturbing pattern of resistance is taking shape around the country. In drafting state laws to carry out the Federal law, which will take effect Jan. 1, legislatures are treating social service agencies differently from motor vehicle bureaus.
Registering will be virtually automatic in motor vehicle offices; typically, driver's license applications and voter registration will be combined on the same form. But some states -- for example, Georgia, Massachusetts, Florida and California -- are planning to require that welfare recipients ask to register, then fill out a separate form: a sure-fire deterrent, since welfare agencies are already notorious for long, complicated applications.
Even worse, many states haven't begun to draft plans for voter registration in welfare offices, a provision that was included specifically to insure that the bill didn't leave anyone behind. In major cities like New York, Chicago and Atlanta, where many poor people don't have driver's licenses, this preference for motor vehicle bureaus will worsen the very inequities that "motor voter" was supposed to eradicate.
President Clinton can rescue the National Voter Registration Act by instructing the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and of Agriculture, who have jurisdiction over welfare and food stamps, to issue guidelines on voter registration and to provide technical assistance to state agencies. And the Justice Department should make it known that it will be aggressive in monitoring the law's success.
Voter advocates have been urging the Administration to take these steps, but to no avail. Mr. Clinton, who rightly invokes the bill as one of his important achievements in office, must intervene soon to prevent the perverse possibility that it could mean even greater injustice at the ballot box.

HEADLINE: SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA: THE OVERVIEW;
SOUTH AFRICANS HAIL PRESIDENT MANDELA; FIRST BLACK LEADER PLEDGES RACIAL UNITY

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, May 10

 BODY:
With the commanding dignity that has carried him through more than half a century of defiance, captivity and conciliation, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela became the first black President of South Africa today.
He stood before a crowd of world leaders who shunned this capital during its decades of infamy, and in a husky, resolute voice swore the oath to become the 10th leader of South Africa since its union in 1910, but the first elected with the participation of the black majority. 
 Then the 75-year-old leader opened his presidency with an intimate speech of shared patriotism, speaking of South Africans' common exhilaration in the seasons and the soil, their common pain for their country's humiliation before the world and their shared relief at being readmitted to the company of civilized nations.
"Never, never, and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world," he said. [Transcript, page A8.]
As a token of renewal, Mr. Mandela promised that an amnesty would soon be announced for "various categories" of prisoners.
He lavished praise on F. W. de Klerk, the President who collaborated with him in negotiating the end of white rule and who today took the oath as one of Mr. Mandela's two Vice Presidents in a unity Government.
In a post-inaugural visit to the 50,000 ordinary citizens celebrating on the lawn far below the Government buildings, Mr. Mandela held Mr. de Klerk's hand aloft and hailed his predecessor as "one of the greatest reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil."
For the day, at least, blacks and whites were united by the mutual strain of taking in the recently unimaginable:
There was Fidel Castro on his first visit to the country that tried to pulverize his army in Angola, the only one among the scores of dignitaries singled out by the crowd for lusty shouts of "Viva!"
And Muslim and Hindu prayers broadcast into the air of what has been the most rigidly, officially Christian of capitals.
And the Navy band in dress whites entertaining the inaugural dignitaries with a Zulu migrant labor song.
And finally President Nelson Mandela, now Commander in Chief, reviewing the defense force that was built, in large part, to prevent someone like him from taking power.
When nine Mirage jet fighters streaked overhead as part of an aerial salute, the citizens assembled on the grass sent up a roar, it seemed, out of a new feeling of custody rather than at the thrill of high-speed machinery.
Mr. Mandela's ascent has been virtually inevitable, at least since last July when negotiators cinched the dates for the first elections open to all races.
In the elections that finished on April 29, the African National Congress won more than 62 percent of the vote, earning 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly that elected Mr. Mandela on Monday without opposition.
Mr. Mandela, whose Xhosa name, Rolihlahla, means "someone who brings trouble on himself," knows well enough the difficulties he has taken on in maintaining the richest economy in Africa while satisfying the promises inherent in his triumph.
Still, today was a last occasion to contemplate the distance the country has traversed before it looks ahead.
Four years and three months ago -- just midway through the Bush Administration -- Nelson Mandela was serving a life sentence for trying to overthrow the Government. Today he heads it.
He became President on a stage erected in the reddish sandstone crescent of the Government building that overlooks Pretoria and, beyond, the hulking monument to the great inland trek of the Afrikaner Voortrekkers.
Mr. Mandela is a President who comes to power preceded by a myth, already embodied in liberation songs that swelled spontaneously in the waiting amphitheater: "Nel-son Man-DEL-a! Nel-son Man-DEL-a!"
He arrived, an hour behind schedule, between two of his daughters, and listened to the swearing-in of his two Vice Presidents, Thabo Mbeki and Mr. de Klerk.
When his own turn came, he eagerly began his oath before the Chief Justice prompted him.
 
Salute by Guns and Aircraft
 After he spoke, the cannons thundered a 21-gun salute and buzzing formations of helicopters and aged warplanes passed overhead.
The guests arrayed in the autumnal sun included 45 heads of state, plus an American delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore and including Hillary Rodham Clinton. Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II of England, attended, as did Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations.
So did James Gregory. Mr. Gregory was Mr. Mandela's warden for two decades, first at the Robben Island Prison and later at Victor Verster Prison, and they became so close that after Mr. Mandela was released the jailer retired out of boredom. "Life had become empty for me," Mr. Gregory told a Johannesburg newspaper.
 
Castro and Arafat Welcomed
 World figures long shunned here as Communists and sponsors of guerrilla insurgency, like Mr. Castro and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, arrived today to more enthusiastic welcomes than the Americans received.
At an inaugural lunch in the residence called the Presidency, Mr. Mandela introduced the Cuban leader to Mr. de Klerk and then to the military chief of staff.
"Welcome to South Africa," Mr. de Klerk said.
"I hope you are successful," Mr. Castro replied.
It was a day for conciliatory gestures.
Joe Modise, a former guerrilla leader and now Mr. Mandela's Defense Minister-designate, noticed a delegation led by Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi, of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party, and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini, languishing in the B-list seats and moved them to the front row.
Someone likewise rescued Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of the new President, and led her from her chair behind a low sandstone wall to the covered stage where family and invited guests were seated.
 
A Victory in Soccer
 Tonight the new President dropped in at the packed soccer stadium where the South African national team defeated Zambia in an inaugural special. He frowned when the 60,000 spectators failed to raise their voices in the two anthems of the new South Africa -- the old Afrikaans poem, The Call of South Africa, and the liberation anthem, God Bless Africa.
"You have to learn the words to both anthems," he scolded the crowd. "If you don't know Afrikaans, you must learn it. If you don't know Zulu or Xhosa, you must learn those."
"It's nice that he came, but I think this is the last time we'll come together like this," said one fan, a resident of the Phola Park squatter camp who declined to give her name. Wrapped in a huge A.N.C. flag but already feeling the seep of disillusionment, she wondered, "What are we going to do now? There's nothing to protest against."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
BBC Plans International Expansion

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 10

 BODY:
In an effort to take a bigger share of rapidly growing television markets around the world, the British Broadcasting Corporation said today that it planned to create news and entertainment channels in Europe, Asia and the United States.
The BBC said its international expansion, which would put it in more direct competition with the likes of Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch and the American broadcasting networks, would take place through a partnership with Pearson P.L.C., one of Britain's largest communications companies. 
 The partnership's first venture, in which Pearson will invest as much as $45 million, will be two satellite-delivered channels in Europe. One will be an all-news network and the other an entertainment network. They are scheduled to go on the air by the end of the year.
 
Other Plans in Works
 Although no firm plans have yet been set, the BBC and Pearson are also considering a wide range of other opportunities around the world for news and entertainment channels, children's programming and educational and documentary networks, executives said.
"In commercial terms, the BBC as a brand is respected around the globe," said Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director general. "Britain has an unrivaled reputation for high-quality program making. Production levels are the highest outside Japan and the U.S., and the BBC's archives are extensive and renowned."
The move comes at a time when deregulation of broadcasting by national governments and the rapid development of satellite and cable technology have set off a global stampede by program makers and broadcasters to establish new networks.
Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation has invested heavily in satellite-delivered services such as BSkyB in Britain and Star TV in Asia. Mr. Turner's Turner Broadcasting Company is making a big push to establish Cable News Network around the world, and is trying to become a competitor in entertainment television with its Cartoon Network and TNT movie channel in Europe. NBC has purchased a pan-European broadcaster, now called NBC Super Channel, and Capital Cities/ABC has acquired a string of European program producers and cable networks.
The BBC, although state-owned and advertising-free in its home market, is under increasing pressure from the British Government to develop additional revenue to help finance its operations. It has long had international radio and television broadcasts, but in television the BBC has increasingly found itself scrambling to keep up with better-financed rivals. The BBC's World Service Television, for example, can no longer be seen in much of Asia even as Mr. Murdoch is building a big presence there through Star TV.
 
A Way to Speed Growth
 For Pearson, which owns The Financial Times and other publishing and broadcasting properties, the deal with the BBC provides an opportunity to speed its growth.
"By adding our commercial skills and program assets to the formidable program-making and library resources of the BBC, we have created a strong British combination that should prove very attractive to regional partners wishing to develop satellite television within their markets," said Michael Blakenham, Pearson's chairman.
The executives said the companies would draw on the BBC's worldwide news network and huge library of programming. They will also draw on programming owned by Thames Television, a British programming producer owned by Pearson. Pearson also owns 50 percent of The Economist magazine and 17.5 percent of BSkyB, the British satellite-television system controlled by Mr. Murdoch.
The two companies said they were also negotiating with additional potential partners in each of the geographic markets they move into.
The BBC-Pearson venture will encompass the BBC's previously announced plan to start a version of its World Television news service in the United States by the first quarter of 1995. A BBC executive said the broadcaster expected the 24-hour-a-day service to generate "a substantial niche following" in the United States but not to make significant inroads against Cable News Network and other all-news networks.
The BBC and Pearson consider the United States one of the most attractive markets for other types of networks, executives said, but have not decided on details of any further expansion into the market.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Orange Juice Prices Drop As Brazil Sees Bigger Crop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Orange juice prices fell yesterday to their lowest in more than a year amid reports that Brazil's crop would be larger than expected.
Orange juice for July delivery fell 3.30 cents, to 93.40 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange. Orange juice futures have tumbled 18 percent in the last two months. 
 The Brazilian Association of Citrus Exporters estimated that its crop would total 295 million boxes in the 1994-95 season, compared with the previous crop of 302 million boxes.
"It's not positive," said Robert Barber, economist with Florida Citrus Mutual, a farmers cooperative. "Up until yesterday, they had been talking about 285 million boxes."
Brazil is the world's largest producer of frozen concentrate orange juice, accounting for about 70 percent of world output, the United States Agriculture Department said.
The larger-than-expected crop in Brazil comes as Florida's crop has grown sharply in recent years, Mr. Barber said. Florida's crop was estimated last month by the Agriculture Department to be 174.3 million boxes.
"It's smaller than last year, but it's still a lot larger than what we had been having in the early 1990's and late 1980's," he said.
On other commodity markets, wheat prices fell after the Agriculture Department said stockpiles would be higher next year than now, reflecting poor exports. July wheat fell 3.75 cents, to $3.2175 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat has fallen 3.8 percent this month.
This summer's crop is expected to push up wheat stockpiles by 10 percent, to 615 million bushels, the Agriculture Departent said. Stockpiles as of April totaled 559 million bushels.
The rising stockpiles come in the face of smaller crops. The department estimated the winter wheat harvest for this year at 1.66 billion bushels, down 6 percent from 1993, because of fewer acres planted and weather problems. And it forecast that total wheat production would drop by 2 percent, to 2.36 billion bushels.
But poor demand from China and Russia, two big buyers of American grain, have kept stockpiles high.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI BUDGET: AN ASSESSMENT;
Mayor's Bet: Safety Carries More Weight With Public

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
In proposing his budget for the next fiscal year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made a calculated political judgment: that the voters and their representatives are worried more about safe streets than clean streets and more about fighting fires than maintaining parks, and that ultimately, the City Council will not have the nerve to battle him on public safety issues.
In the $31.6 billion spending plan, two departments -- police and fire -- stood out like beacons as the only two major Mayoral agencies protected from a 7 percent reduction in the municipal work force that Mr. Giuliani imposed to reduce the $2.3 billion deficit. 
 And lawmakers quickly made it clear yesterday that a significant issue before them as they debated the Mayor's budget would be whether protecting those agencies was worth the pain in the schools, youth programs and hospitals.
"We believe there is administrative bloat and excess that can easily be knocked out without affecting the number of cops," said Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker. "We're not going to do anything to reduce the number of cops, but that doesn't mean in any way, shape or form that we are exempting the Police Department from cutting bloat, and if they can't find it, we'll help them."
Mr. Giuliani, a former prosecutor who ran on a platform of fighting crime, was already anticipating the debate, which has been percolating quietly since he first submitted a preliminary financial plan in February that proposed cutting a multitude of services while letting the budgets of the Police and Fire Departments grow to record levels.
And he vehemently maintained yesterday that police strength was crucial to the city's social fabric and quality of life.
"I believe that the single most important priority in this city is making the city safe, and this budget reflects that," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's the reason I believe I was elected. That's the reason I believe I'm Mayor of New York City. I believe that's the single most important thing that I can do for this city."
Economic development itself, Mr. Giuliani said, hinged on the perception of crime in the city, "because even compared to the massive tax burden presented by New York City, way out of proportion to any other city, the primary reason for the contraction in New York City is fear of crime and a declining quality of life."
He said the strategies he had announced in recent months to combat illegal guns, domestic violence and youth violence all required a substantial commitment of manpower.
And he said that even if he wanted to reduce the police force, he is bound by a memorandum of understanding that would have to be altered by the State Legislature. The chances of the Legislature reducing the force size in an election year, he said, "are between zero and none."
But many Democrats looked at the service reductions spread throughout the rest of the municipal government -- a loss of a quarter of the city's park workers, a large cut in youth services and jobs programs, a reduction in recycling pickups from weekly to biweekly, a 20 percent reduction in the staffing of the social service agencies -- and wondered whether Mr. Giuliani's view was too narrow.
"It's your definition of quality of life," said Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat. "I don't think that somebody who wants to clean my windshields is as troublesome to me as a homeless person on my street or rats playing on my corner or in the basement of my house or walking into a park that's not maintained."
Many black and Hispanic lawmakers were also fuming at a budget that they saw as protecting a largely white police force and fire department -- whose unions rallied around Mr. Giuliani during the campaign -- at the expense of other municipal jobs held by members of minority groups and at the expense of services needed by the poor and by minorities.
"I think this is rising to the level of minority versus Giuliani politics," said Herbert E. Berman, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Council's Finance Committee.
Councilwoman Una Clarke, a Brooklyn Democrat, echoed the thought. "The issue is equity," she said. "Right now the only people who think this budget is fair are millionaires who live on the Upper East Side."
To fend off the Council charges of inequity, Mr. Giuliani called for $11 million in productivity measures from the police, asking the force to assume functions that had been performed by lower-paid civilians from other city agencies.
His budget proposed that the police take over traffic enforcement in midtown Manhattan from the Transportation Department. The police would take over taxi enforcement from the Taxi and Limousine Commission's inspectors and some of the duties of parks workers.
"We're talking about arresting people who are engaged in assaults, in drug dealing and sometimes tragically engaged in murder," Mr. Giuliani said. "We need to have the flexibility to have police officers do this.
But the move reinforced perceptions among the Mayor's critics that he was going to lengths to safeguard the police, even if it means giving them duties that could be done at a lower cost by civilians. "Will we soon be having police officers ticket garbage or inspect restaurants for health violations?" asked Manhattan Borough President Ruth M. Messinger.
 
Next Move Is Unclear
 Where the Council moves from here is not clear. Earlier this year Mark J. Green, the Public Advocate proposed that the Mayor could save $11 million in the Police Department by contracting out such services as repair of police cars. The Citizens Budget Commission, an advocacy group financed by business, has said that the city could save at least $50 million a year and put more police officers on the street by changing police work schedules and replacing hundreds of officers in administrative positions with civilians.
But the proposal would require the city to change its memorandum of understanding with the state, which set a fixed number of officers in exchange for financing the Safe Streets, Safe City program.
Mr. Vallone seemed reluctant yesterday to reopen debate on the memorandum. And one Democrat close to the Council leadership predicted that ultimately the Council would not have the nerve to go that far in finding police savings without the Mayor leading the way. "It's like Nixon going to China," he said. "Rudy can cut the cops. We can't."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Seeing a U.S. Policy Shift, Traders Push Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The dollar moved sharply higher against the German mark, the Japanese yen and other leading currencies yesterday, as traders around the world began to conclude that recent signals from the Clinton Administration favoring a stronger dollar constitute a shift in exchange-rate policy.
In a rally that started overnight in Tokyo, the dollar gained momentum through the day. Its rise yesterday was widely seen as the catalyst that prompted a strong performance by world stock and bond markets. 
 By late in the day in New York, the dollar was trading at 104.42 Japanese yen, up from 102.80 yen on Monday. Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.6731, from 1.6539 on Monday.
Interest rates fell as the dollar rallied, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond falling to 7.49 percent. [Page D16.] And stocks surged, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 27.37 points, to 3,656.41. [Page D8.]
The change in currency policy that traders sense is focused on the dollar's exchange value with the yen. Recent statements and actions by Administration officials and monetary authorities suggest that a period of almost total concentration on the yen-dollar relationship may be coming to an end.
Because the United States has been unable to persuade Japan to further stimulate its economy or to loosen trade barriers, driving down the value of the dollar against the yen in hopes of paring the huge Japanese trade surplus has been a main, if not always openly articulated, goal since Mr. Clinton took office.
But the sharp selloff in American financial markets since February, particularly in the bond market, seems to have forced a reassessment.
After enduring a period of renewed weakness against the yen, and a sudden drop against the mark, last Wednesday the Administration indicated that it was changing its tune,asking the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to join with foreign central banks in a large-scale round of dollar buying on currency markets.
That intervention, which was coupled with statements from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that the dollar had fallen to a level not justified by economic fundamentals, was followed by more strong statements on the dollar from officials yesterday.
Currency traders also said that an article in The New York Times yesterday helped to buttress sentiment for the dollar. The article, which cited unidentified senior American economic officials, said the United States was pondering a shift in its trade policy with Japan.
"Through yesterday, the market was skeptical" about the change, said Nicholas Sargen, chief investment officer at Global Advisers, which has a $5.5 billion foreign bond portfolio.
A currency trader who asked not to be identified, said: "The market has been concerned for some time that the U.S. has been following a single-minded policy of Japan trade bashing, and has ignored other markets, including our own. To the extent the Administration is now cognizant of the implications of that, it could help to stabilize markets."
Many involved in the financial markets said a shift in exchange-rate policy in favor of a stronger dollar tended to calm nervous foreign investors and stabilize markets.
But the apparent change has critics. "I think the Administration has changed its view because it has been spooked by the alleged link between the yen's strength, the dollar's weakness and the weakness in the American bond market," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "I see no evidence of that. I think what the Administration has done is a mistake, and unlikely to work, because it runs against the economic fundamentals. It is hard to say our currency is undervalued when we will probably run a record $170 billion trade deficit this year, and move toward $200 billion in 1995."
The change in attitude was helped by monetary authorities in Japan and Germany, who chose to ease short-term interest rates yesterday.
Those reductions, coupled with the widespread expectation that the Federal Reserve Board would soon push its short-term rate target higher, prompted a buying surge of Treasury securities in Tokyo. The rally continued when trading shifted to European markets, and finally to New York.
"This is the first time in some time where I have seen significant foreign buying" of American debt securities, Mr. Sargen said. "And it intensified as the yen softened."
John P. Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, foresaw at least two challenges in buttressing the dollar. "The Administration," he said, "should refrain from criticism when the Fed moves to raise interest rates. The other potential test is whether or not they will intervene to support the dollar if it comes under renewed downward pressure."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Air Canada To Buy Jets From Airbus

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 10

 BODY:
After intense trans-Atlantic competition among aircraft manufacturers, Air Canada announced today that it would replace its fleet of 35 aging American-made DC-9's with the A319 airplanes produced by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.
Air Canada said it would acquire 25 of the A319's, which are twin-engine, 112-seat aircraft, and had taken an option on an additional 10 of the planes. The carrier, based in Montreal, did not announce a price, but the A319 is listed in the Airbus catalogue at $39 million, which would value the initial order at about $1 billion. 
 The deal gives Air Canada, which acquired 34 of the slightly larger A320's about five years ago, the second- largest fleet of Airbus planes in North America, after United Airlines. Counting all orders and options, United will be operating 100 various Airbus models, and Air Canada, 75.
A spokeswoman for Air Canada, Kym Robertson, said the acquisition "makes a tremendous amount of economic sense" for the airline, which is short of cash and she said was getting 100 percent financing from the manufacturer.
 
A Better Fit
 "The salesmanship was very aggressive," she said. "Our position was that any kind of proposal that we entertained had to be cash-neutral or better." She added that the A319 made a better fit than other planes because it had the same engine, cockpit and galley as the A320 Air Canada used. The common features allow parts to be interchanged, and can lower the costs of pilot training and maintenance.
Air Canada, hit hard by the latest recession and locked in a bitter competitive struggle with Canada's other national airline, Canadian Airlines International, has suffered two years of heavy losses.
But its loss of $32 million (Canadian), or about $23 million (United States), for the first quarter of this year was lower than expected, and the company predicted that it would break even in 1994. In the first quarter of last year, Air Canada lost $293 million (Canadian) after provisions for staff reductions and investments totaling $147 million (Canadian).
"They still have to deal with Canadian Airlines," said Philip Koven, airlines analyst for Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. "But air traffic is picking up, and they've managed to increase market share and done a good job on costs."
 
U.S. Review Likely
 Canadian Airlines International, based in Calgary, recently concluded a life-saving deal with American Airlines, which has paid $246 million (Canadian) for a 25 percent voting interest in Canadian Airlines. In turn, Canadian Airlines will pay $115 million (Canadian) for computer technology services from American.
Still, Air Canada's deal with Airbus is likely to be reviewed closely by the United States Government, which has had a long dispute with the Europeans about subsidies granted to aircraft manufacturers to win markets abroad. Washington has an agreement with the European Union that limits direct and indirect subsidies.
Air Canada had earlier announced plans under which the McDonnell Douglas Corporation would have refurbished the carrier's 35 DC-9's. But as a result of new proposals from Airbus, the airline changed its plan.
"The bottom line is that the new aircraft would be cheaper than refurbishing the DC-9's," Ms. Robertson of Air Canada said.
A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, John Thom, declined to comment on the Air Canada deal.

HEADLINE: Form of Insanity Defense Planned for the Next Rifkin Trial

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., May 10

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin's new lawyer says he expects to pursue another form of insanity defense when the convicted murderer goes on trial again this summer in the killing of two women he buried in Suffolk County.
The court-appointed lawyer, Martin Efman, said today that he planned to show that Mr. Rifkin suffered from an "adopted child syndrome" and a multiple-personality disorder and was therefore legally insane when he killed 17 women. 
Mr. Efman plans to argue that because Mr. Rifkin was rejected by his biological mother, whom he believed to be a prostitute, his peers and his father, he sought refuge in an underworld of prostitutes where he strangled women to ease his suffering.
On Monday, Mr. Rifkin was found guilty of murdering his 17th victim, Tiffany Bresciani. A Nassau County jury rejected the insanity defense that he was a paranoid schizophrenic, afflicted with delusions and hallucinations. That trial had included testimony on the adoption and Mr. Rifkin's belief that his mother was a prostitute too poor to abort him.
 
Confessed to Killings
 His second trial is to be held in Suffolk County, where Mr. Rifkin has confessed to dumping at least two of his victims, Leah Evens, 28, of Brooklyn, a mother of two children and the daughter of a former New York City judge, and Lauren Marquez, 28, of Sunnyside, Queens, a mother of two.
Ms. Evens's body was discovered in Southampton a year ago on Mother's Day, several weeks before Mr. Rifkin was arrested in Mineola on June 28 for a traffic violation by state troopers who found Ms. Bresciani's decomposing body in the back of his pickup truck. In a 12-page confession, Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, said he killed Ms. Bresciani and 16 other women, including Ms. Evens and Ms. Marquez.
Judge John J. Jones of Suffolk County Court has scheduled a conference for next Monday with lawyers in the double-murder case.
Mr. Efman said the defense had retained Dr. David Kirschner, a psychologist and director of a psychotherapy clinic in Bellmore, as its main witness.
 
Pattern of Disturbed Behavior
 Dr. Kirschner, who has helped in the defense of 10 adoptees involved in killing people, said today in a telephone interview that he had spent many hours with Mr. Rifkin and that "there were many relevant facts that did not come to light in the first trial."
Dr. Kirschner is extensively quoted on the adopted-child syndrome in a book, "Journey of the Adopted Self" by Dr. Betty Jean Lifton, recently published by Basic Books. She writes that Dr. Kirschner gave the name "adopted child syndrome" to a pattern of disturbed behaviors among some adoptees, including pathological lying, learning problems, running away, sexual promiscuity, an absence of normal guilt and anxiety and extreme antisocial behavior.
Dr. Kirschner says a small subgroup of adoptees commit violent crimes, including serial killers like David Berkowitz and Mr. Rifkin. He says both vented their rage on women as if to get revenge.
But Dr. Thomas Gutheil, professor of psychiatry and law at Harvard University, said that the adopted child syndrome was "a clinical assessment, designed to help psychologists treat patients," and that the subject of multiple personalities was "a whole different discourse."
"Putting them together in a single sentence is meaningless noise," Dr. Gutheil said. "It may fascinate legal scholars, but let's face it, the jury tends to vote its gut anyway."
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not list the adopted child syndrome, said Doug Fiezel, a spokesman for the American Psychological Association, and it is not officially recognized by most psychologists and psychiatrists as a mental disorder.
The Suffolk County District Attorney's office declined to comment on the case today except to say that it was prepared to go to trial.
Mr. Rifkin is scheduled to be sentenced on June 8 in Nassau County. He faces a maximum of 27 1/2 years to life in prison. He is also charged with three murders in Brooklyn, and one each in Queens and the Bronx.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged To Allow In More Haitians

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Because of the new policy announced by President Clinton to grant hearings to all Haitian asylum seekers, the top United Nations official on refugee matters and numerous human rights groups are pressing the United States to let more Haitians in.
Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in an interview on Monday that in light of the recent surge of violent repression in Haiti, the Administration should admit a higher percentage of Haitian refugees than the 5 percent of applicants it has accepted so far. 
 Under its refugee laws, the United States admits emigrants with a well-founded fear of persecution but refuses so-called economic refugees who are fleeing poverty in search of a better life.
Mrs. Ogata and human rights groups are turning up the pressure on this issue because they see a contradiction in President Clinton's revised policy, which reverses the practice of summarily returning Haitians without individual hearings.
 
Admission Rate Called Low
 On one hand, Mr. Clinton said the bloodshed perpetrated by Haiti's military leaders and their supporters had reached alarming proportions, but on the other, Administration officials say they expect to continue allowing in only about 5 percent of Haitians seeking to flee.
"That rate is very low," said Mrs. Ogata, who is in Washington to discuss Haiti and other refugee matters with the Administration.
"The spread of violence and widespread suppression of human rights to the point that the United Nations is going to levy sanctions in a very serious way means the whole country is not in a normal situation," she said. "In these situations, people who flee should be given some kind of chance to stay outside of the country, at least until democracy is restored."
American officials say the overwhelming percentage of Haitians are fleeing for economic reasons rather than to escape political persecution. But Mrs. Ogata urged the Clinton Administration to take a broader view.
"Killings, disappearances and mutilations are increasing, while whole areas that favor President Aristide have been targeted by the military," she said. "Maybe these people aren't leaving exactly because of their political convictions, but because their security is in danger. We should make sure these people aren't just turned back."
 
Emigration Surge Predicted
 Rolande Dorancy, who works with Haitian refugees in Miami, estimated that 95 percent of the people in Haiti are subject to persecution. "If the hearings are done the right way, then the United States should find that at least 50 to 75 percent of Haitians have a well-founded fear of persecution," he said.
Officials from Florida predicted a surge in emigration from Haiti in response to President Clinton's decision not to return refugees summarily. Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, predicted that 5,000 to 10,000 Haitians would flee each month to seek asylum, far more than the 1,300 Haitians intercepted at sea so far this year. Mr. Graham said the United States Government, and not Florida, should absorb the cost of handling the refugees.
While welcoming the Administration's new policy on Haitian refugees, human rights and refugee groups assert that it is nearly impossible to provide full and fair hearings for Haitians who are intercepted on the high seas and interviewed aboard Coast Guard cutters.
Some Administration officials admit as much. They say that the Administration does not want to conduct hearings on cutters, and that the use of larger naval vessels, perhaps Navy amphibious vessels that are used to carry hundreds of troops, is being considered. Another option under consideration is renting commercial vessels.
 
A Request to Canada
 Recognizing the shortcomings of hearings at sea, an Administration official said, "We're most eager to seek third countries not only to resettle bona fide refugees but for the purpose of processing them."
Madeleine Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, went to Ottawa on Monday to ask Canadian officials to accept Haitian refugees. She is scheduled to meet with officials from several Caribbean countries on Wednesday to ask them to set up processing centers on their shores for Haitian refugees.

HEADLINE: A Lack of Money and Edgy Dissent Delay the P.L.O.'s Assumption of Power

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 10

 BODY:
On Sunday night a distress cable from Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator in Cairo, landed on the desk of Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman in Tunis, detailing the trouble the organization faced as it tried to carry out a peace agreement with Israel after 46 years of conflict.
"I have just sent $60,000, all secured through personal guarantees and loans, to finance the entry of some of our troops into Gaza," Mr. Shaath's cable read. "I cannot do more. Please send money; otherwise the situation will become very difficult." 
 He said he had sent the money to the commander of the Palestinian police officers who were then on the Egyptian-Gaza border. Those funds made possible today's entry of 148 officers, a small fraction of the 9,000 agreed upon by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
"I cannot perform miracles," Mr. Shaath's cable continued. "I cannot be responsible for any further delays if the money does not arrive. May God be my witness, for I have delivered the message."
 
Breakdown of Bureaucracy
 In the message, provided to The New York Times by a P.L.O. official, Mr. Shaath did not specify how much money he needed, but it is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Gathering the police officers and their families, moving them to Egypt and Jordan for training, and outfitting them with weapons and uniforms have proved to be very expensive. One official calculates the cost at a minimum of $1,500 a soldier monthly, or $162 million a year -- money the P.L.O. does not have.
In addition to the severe lack of funds, the Palestinians are dogged by a host of other difficulties, including a serious and continuing collapse of the P.L.O.'s administrative structure.
For nearly 25 years -- first in Jordan, then in Lebanon, now in Tunisia -- the organization maintained a kind of civil service, with as many as 20,000 employees around the world. Until the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when Mr. Arafat angered the Saudis and other benefactors by siding with Iraq, the P.L.O. could count on about $500 million a year from other Arab countries. But that flow has become a trickle, although exactly how little is not known.
As a result, many in the bureaucracy have not been paid for months and have quit to make a living elsewhere. And of those who remain, many so thoroughly disapprove of the management style of Mr. Arafat that they are actively blocking orders.
 
Discord at the Top
 While the international community, represented by the World Bank, has pledged $2.2 billion to help the Palestinians, the money is tied to specific projects and can be released only after the P.L.O. undertakes its new authority.
A payment of $5 million from the United States and other donors to put the process into motion has yet to reach the P.L.O., a fact Mr. Shaath noted in his cable to Mr. Arafat. Washington's contributions "may be delayed by American bureaucracy," he said.
In addition to the cash flow problem, political discord at the top of the Palestinian command has made it impossible for Mr. Arafat to name the 24-member Palestinian authority that is supposed to rule Gaza and Jericho until elections are held four months from now.
"What is left at the Tunis headquarters now is a group of people inhabiting a complex of offices who report to no one and have no idea what's to become of them," said a middle-level executive, venting the anger of many other Palestinians. "People who have worked for the P.L.O. for 20 or 30 years are just milling about, stunned. The message is that Arafat wants us to just go away."
Israel and the Palestinians had agreed that the Palestinian authority would be formed by Wednesday; otherwise, Israel may delay the transfer of power, including the deployment of Palestinian police officers, until it has the names of the P.L.O. staff members who are to run things.
 
Who's in Charge?
 But in interviews today it appeared that Mr. Arafat, who is in South Africa for Nelson Mandela's inauguration, has yet to discuss the issue with his aides. Many are insisting they will not serve unless they are granted their own executive power, intead of just being Mr. Arafat's pawns.
"It does not matter if we are 5, 20 or 24," one senior official in Tunis said. "Arafat will, as usual, make every decision himself. That has been the problem all along."
Senior officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mahmoud Abbas, for example, the P.L.O. executive committee member most responsible for fashioning the peace agreement with Israel, has refused to serve on the governing board. So has Farouk Kaddoumi, a sort of P.L.O. foreign minister.
According to one official, Mr. Abbas was "mortified" on May 4 in Cairo when Mr. Arafat staged a high-profile, last-minute refusal to sign the peace accord until some phraseology was changed. Mr. Arafat raised his objections in the presence of scores of dignitaries in Cairo for the signing.
"He swore that was the last time Arafat embarrasses him in this way," the official added.
Nearly 7,000 officers have been recruited for the police force from the remnants of the Palestine Liberation Army, a force that once numbered 20,000 guerrillas based in Lebanon. The army was largely disbanded after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and scattered around the Arab world, with units in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq.

HEADLINE: Camera Maker Signs Lease to Stay on L.I.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., May 10

 BODY:
Spurned last year when it tried to build a new corporate headquarters on state-owned land in Melville, Olympus America said today that it had signed a six-year lease to occupy a former Grumman Corporation building in a nearby commercial area and that it would remain on Long Island.
The signing caps an intense effort by Suffolk County, New York State and the Town of Huntington to find an alternate site for the Japanese-owned manufacturer of cameras and medical equipment, and to provide incentives to keep the company, which employs more than 600 people on Long Island, from moving away. 
 It follows a recent decision by the Northrop Grumman Corporation to keep two divisions on Long Island, ending fears that the company, formed last month when the Los Angeles-based Northrop Corporation acquired Grumman, would cut hundreds of jobs in the area.
 
Competing Offers
 An Olympus official, Sidney Braginsky, said Olympus weighed offers from Westchester County, New Jersey, Virginia and North Carolina before deciding to lease and renovate the building, which is in Melville, a part of Huntington.
"There was consideration of moving off Long Island," Mr. Braginsky said, but he added that "the 600 employees who work for us here are our most important asset."
Olympus now leases offices in Lake Success and Woodbury in Nassau County, but the leases will expire by next March, and the company said it needed more space.
A plan devised by the State Urban Development Corporation for a new Olympus headquarters on the site of a former state developmental center in Melville was abandoned last year when officials in Huntington and a local civic group sued to block the project. Nearby residents said commercial development would destroy their neighborhoods.
Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County Executive, said the company's decision marked "a successful battle in the war for economic development" that would spur activity in the commercial corridor along Route 110, where office vacancies soared in recent years.
Olympus will lease the 270,000-square-foot building, vacant since July, from the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, or MONY, for six years with two options to renew, for a total of 15 years. MONY said the value of the transaction ranged from $29 million to $73 million, depending on the length of occupancy and other options.

HEADLINE: Denver's New Airport Still a 'Field of Dreams'

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
When Denver officials started selling the idea in the early 1980's that the city needed a new airport, they built their pitch on some basic promises: build it and they will come; build it and it will work; build it and it will be completed on time and for the price we have projected.
But the biggest public works project in Colorado's history -- financed by investor bonds and $500 million in Federal grants -- is having trouble delivering on those promises. 
 Passenger traffic at Denver, while increasing, is still far short of projections made around 1989, when the new airport was approved by Denver residents. The project's cost has ballooned to about $3.2 billion, more than $1 billion more than the original price tag. On May 2, city officials announced that Denver International Airport would miss its fourth deadline for completion because its baggage system still did not work. As for a new scheduled opening, all that Mayor Wellington Webb was willing to say was, "I won't hazard a guess."
 
Cutthroat Competition
 That so large a project is off schedule and more costly than planned is not unusual. What angers critics is that as cutthroat competition forces airlines to slash budgets and jobs, Denver International -- with its high rent and landing fees -- will be a luxury that airlines can ill afford.
Airline executives are reluctant to criticize publicly a project that is the pride of the Transportation Secretary and former Denver Mayor, Federico F. Pena. But in an interview with Time magazine before the Clinton Administration took office, Robert L. Crandall, the outspoken chairman of American Airlines, called the new, 53-square-mile Denver International Airport a "field of dreams."
"A lot of money is being poured into building a great big new airport way out in the boonies" some 23 miles from downtown Denver, Mr. Crandall told the magazine in 1991. "There's no need for a new airport in Denver." A spokesman said last week that Mr. Crandall did not wish to discuss the airport at this time.
 
Rising the Cycles
 The new airport's proponents dismiss recent problems as minor in light of the airport's potential to attract companies to Denver and its ability to help relieve an overburdened national air-traffic system by reducing the ripple effect of chronic weather delays at Denver.
"This was a visionary project that was preparing the city and state for the next century," Mr. Pena, who was mayor of Denver from 1983 to 1991, said in an interview last week. "There are going to be changes in the cycles as you go along, but you've got to realize that these are 40- to 50- to 60-year investments."
Denver is subject to boom and bust cycles. It is currently enjoying growth, not like in the early 1980's, when the building crane was humorously referred to as the state bird, but steady growth nonetheless. Air traffic is returning to levels close to Denver's peak in 1986.
City officials decided early on that expanding Stapleton International Airport was not an option. The 65-year-old Stapleton, the nation's sixth-busiest airport, has a terrible record of delays -- industry surveys showed it was the third worst last year -- largely because its runways are so close together that bad weather can cut capacity by two-thirds, from about 80 flights an hour to about 25.
 
Promise of a New Airport
 In the early 1980's, city officials said the proposed site of a new runway for Stapleton, the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal, was too contaminated from military weapons and chemical testing to build on. And they noted that as part of a settlement in a suit over Stapleton's noise level Denver had agreed to close it by the year 2000 and build a new airport.
By the late 1980's, air traffic through Denver had dropped with the region's economic downturn. But by then the new airport was being touted as a way to create thousands of jobs and to attract new businesses.
It did create jobs, and without Denver taxpayers paying for it.
But while critics concede that Denver will eventually need a new airport, they argue that Denver International is too much too soon. It was conceived, they say, for short-term political and economic gain, using unrealistic predictions.
"It was sold to the voters and to the public based on promises that were clearly not kept and upon data that have been shown to be inaccurate," said Michael J. Boyd, president of the Aviation Systems Research Corporation, an airline consulting firm in Golden, Colo.
For example, passenger-traffic projections made by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1990 stated that 27.4 million people would board planes at Denver in 1995. In 1992 that estimate was lowered 37 percent, to 17.2 million passengers.
The original project approved by Denver voters in 1989 was a $1.9 billion airport with 12 more jetway gates than at Stapleton. The reality is a $3.2 billion facility with 88 gates, 20 fewer than at Stapleton.
City officials blame the rise in cost on changes demanded by the airlines, like the insistence of United Airlines, Denver's primary carrier, that a sophisticated system be installed.
The original estimate did not budget money for a baggage system because the airlines usually pay for that themselves. But in the name of efficiency the city demanded that all airlines at the airport use the same system. The result was a $193 million, computer-operated system that has thus far proved unworkable in tests.
Much of the friction is the result of a familiar conflict over airports generally: Cities want a striking foyer for visitors, which Denver International clearly is, with its tent-like roof mimicking the nearby Rocky Mountains, a four-story atrium and $7.2 million in art. But this is precisely the kind of Taj Mahal airport that airlines disdain because they, and their passengers, ultimately pay for it.
Airports are mainly financed by airlines, which pay rent and user fees. To finance construction of the Denver airport, the city sold bonds based on that projected revenue. The city and its taxpayers are not liable even if the airport defaults; the bondholders are.
The problem is that the high cost of building Denver International will add to the airlines' cost of using it at a time when travelers are seeking low air fares, and airlines are trying to accommodate them. The airlines' cost of using the new airport will be the highest in the nation, rising from $6 per passenger at Stapleton to $16 per passenger at Denver International, about twice the national average. Even the new airport's proponents agree that the expense will likely outweigh the savings generated by reductions in airport delays.
This higher cost will undoubtedly be passed on to passengers or airline shareholders. Southwest Airlines has already said that, given the choice, it may opt out of Denver completely. "We don't like passing on costs and raising fares," said a spokesman for Southwest, Ed Stewart.
To some degree, the airport's backers have history on their side. New or redeveloped airports, like Kennedy, Newark and Dulles, were once considered white elephants.
"We really did look at the world as it's going to be and take an action that prepares us for the next 40 years," said Tucker Hart Adams, president of a Denver economic research and forecasting company.
Besides, the airport will pay for itself, city officials say, pointing to estimates that revenue from the airlines and other sources will be $374 million a year, $32 million more than the airport's projected annual $342 million in expenses.
But for people who bought the airport bonds, the project is not risk-free. A 1991 report by Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, noted that the possibility for default would become more likely if several things, including delays in the airport's opening and traffic shortfalls, were to occur.
Moody's lowered its credit rating on the airport's revenue bonds last Wednesday, saying that though the airport's credit worthiness is strong an indefinite delay adds to its risks.
It also fuels doubts among Denver residents, who appear increasingly skeptical about assurances that no Denver taxes are being used for the project. A recent telephone survey found that 59 percent of respondents said they would vote against the project if they had the chance again.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Pepsico expands its snack-food horizons by introducing corn chips to a crisp-loving nation.

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THEY eat all kinds of strange snack foods on these shores, including the prawn-flavored crisp -- an acquired taste, to be sure. But they haven't acquired a taste for that American staple, the corn chip, a failing that the king of salty-snack marketers, Pepsico Inc., is now out to remedy.
Pepsi, the owner of Frito-Lay, will officially introduce Doritos to Britain today. It is spending $9 million on advertising and promotion to do so, more than half of it on a television campaign from BBDO New York that is scheduled to begin in the next few weeks, not to mention another $18 million it spent to build a state-of-the-art corn chip factory. 
 Pepsi and its British snack-food subsidiary, Walkers Smiths Snack Foods Ltd., have high hopes for Doritos in Britain, a nation whose per capita consumption of potato chips, or crisps as they are known here, almost matches that of the United States.
But Britain is merely a test-bed for Pepsi's real dream: transforming the snack food industry from a highly fragmented business dominated by local favorites into one dominated by global brands that can be packaged and advertised much the same way anywhere, just like, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola, with all the economies of scale that would bring.
After Doritos could come global campaigns for Pepsi-owned products like Cheetos cheese puffs, Ruffles potato chips and 3D's, a snack product developed by Pepsi and General Mills in Europe.
Or, in the marketing jargon used by Christopher A. Sinclair, the president of Pepsico Foods and Beverages International, "If we can get three or four major global platforms on the brand front, that's where we can really build the franchise."
Pepsi's international sales of snack foods, he said, could triple over the next 5 to 10 years, to $13.5 billion annually from $4.5 billion currently.
Pepsi has invested heavily in its international snacks business, spending $1.5 billion in recent years to acquire local manufacturers and distributors, including $600 million for Walkers Smiths, the leading crisp maker in Britain.
Because local tastes and snacking habits vary so much, Pepsi has largely viewed each market as distinct and has done little to send its brands across borders. But now the company is taking the next step in the belief that adroit product development and marketing can create brands with international appeal.
Britain, for example, is potato-chip crazy. Consumers eat 5.28 pounds of potato chips per capita each year in Britain, and are the closest rivals on that front to Americans, who gobble 6.16 pounds of potato chips per person. Yet while Americans eat another 6.16 pounds each of corn chips every year, the British eat almost none.
Wondering if that void could be filled, Pepsi and Walkers Smiths spent several years testing corn chips. They found that the British liked corn chips just fine, as long as they were cut slightly thinner than Americans are accustomed to -- more like the potato chips the British are used to -- and as long as they were flavored to British tastes.
If Pepsi has learned a single important lesson from its experience with Doritos in Britain, in fact, it is that even global snack-food brands have to be adapted somewhat to local tastes.
"We could not simply copy the Doritos mix, we had to treat it as a new product opportunity," said Martin Glenn, the director of new product development for Walkers Smiths.
But Pepsi is betting that advertising and packaging will be transferable across borders. The BBDO New York campaign that will begin for Doritos in several weeks will also be seen soon in the United States. Mr. Sinclair declined to disclose details, other than to describe the theme as "cutting loose or letting loose" with Doritos.
The new packaging developed for British consumers is also expected to become the standard for the brand as it is gradually introduced in other markets around the world. Moreover, the packaging is being test-marketed in the United States, and Mr. Sinclair said it would probably be adopted there as well.

HEADLINE: Legislator Urges Diplomacy to Improve Rights in China

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said today that he expects China to meet President Clinton's human rights demands as a condition to renewing Beijing's trade status. If it does, he said, the Administration should stop threatening China with sanctions and use other means to promote human rights.
The chairman, Representative Lee Hamilton, an influential foreign-policy voice, also urged President Clinton to lay the groundwork for a policy that will take account of United States trade, security and political interests. 
 "I believe the President has not always provided the personal articulation and justification that his policies need," Mr. Hamilton said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute.
"On China, we need a broader understanding of our national interest. We need a skillful balancing of economic, security and human rights interests, rather than a single-minded emphasis on one objective."
Mr. Hamilton thus highlighted an intensifying debate, just three weeks before President Clinton must decide whether to renew China's trade benefits as a "most favored nation." Senior Administration officials said they are involved in an intense dialogue with China to try to get Beijing to demonstrate as much progress on human rights as possible in the next few weeks.
While no one at the White House will say so out loud, it is now widely assumed within the Administration and on Capitol Hill that Mr. Clinton will find a way to renew all or most of China's trade benefits, which allow it to export products to the United States at the lowest tariff rates.
The only real question is what political steps the President will take to get down from the tall tree he climbed a year ago, when he declared that he would not renew trade benefits without "overall significant progress" on human rights. While China has made some progress, and Administration officials hope for more, how "significant" it will be remains to be seen.
One option was endorsed by Mr. Hamilton today, when he said "I hope and I expect" that China will do enough by June 3 -- like accounting for political prisoners -- that the President will be able to declare that Beijing has met his conditions.
Mr. Hamilton said President Clinton should then renew China's trade status, and retire permanantly the threat of a revocation. Instead, he said, Mr. Clinton should try to influence China by fostering "change through personal diplomacy and our economic ties."
Under another option, some lawmakers and human rights organizations argue that, barring some dramatic move, China at best will only fulfill some of the President's human rights demands before the deadline.
They contend that the President, for his own political credibility, cannot renew China's trade benefits across the board, given the spotty progress Beijing has made on human rights. Instead, they advocate renewing the most-favored-nation status for China's private exports, but withholding it for selected exports from Government-owned or army-owned factories.
Like the White House, this school understands that the economic stakes are too great -- more than $40 billion a year in trade -- for Washington to totally revoke the trade benefits. But they want to keep up the pressure.
 
Describing the Targets
 "I honestly believe that if the Chinese do not make overall significant progress, the President will honor his executive order and have some revocation" of the trade benefits, Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who has been a leader of the get-tough policy.
She said one possible target is China's state-owned military industries, which export everything from clothing to AK-47 assault weapons to the United States.
Senior officials say the final decision will come down to a political judgment for the President. If he gets just enough progress from Beijing, he could swallow hard, renew China's trade status and take the criticism from editorial writers and some members of Congress, who will inevitably point up the differences between his oratory and his actions.
Or he could choose the politically more attractive route of renewing trade benefits selectively, thus remaining true to his campaign promises while not aborting the trading relationship.
Not only the President has a political interest in such a compromise; so do many of the most outspoken Democratic lawmakers who have advocated a tough line on China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Although many Administration officials believe a selective approach is unworkable, given the difficulty of sorting out whether a company is privately owned or state-owned, it may turn out for political reasons to be the policy.

HEADLINE: China Allows a Prominent Dissident to Leave

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 10

 BODY:
A onetime Communist propaganda chief who became a vociferous advocate of democracy in China and whose case has been followed by the Clinton Administration will be allowed to leave the country this month to study and lecture at Columbia University, Western diplomats said today.
Ten previous petitions by the dissident, Yu Haocheng, to go abroad were refused by Communist authorities. 
 Mr. Yu, 66, the former chief editor of the Masses Publishing House, an organ of China's Public Security Bureau, this week received a Chinese passport allowing him to apply for a visa to enter the United States.
China's decision to grant Mr. Yu an exit permit is an important step in Beijing's efforts to comply with part of President Clinton's May 1993 executive order on human rights in China. Mr. Yu was first on the list of dissidents whose unsuccessful attempts to leave the country were raised by the State Department's top human rights official, John Shattuck, last fall.
 
Another Dissident Freed
 Mr. Yu was not available for comment, but he has reportedly purchased an airline ticket to leave the country on May 28.
[Mr. Yu will be a visiting scholar at Columbia starting later this month and is scheduled to take part in a project called "China and Constitutionalism" at Columbia's Law School and Center for the Study of Human Rights, Judith Leynse, associate director of public information at Columbia, said.]
The resolution of Mr. Yu's case follows the release last month of Wang Juntao, one of the leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising who had received a 13-year prison sentence in 1991 and was suffering from hepatitis. He was put on a flight to New York to seek treatment on "medical parole."
Human rights organizations hailed Mr. Wang's release, but they also have stepped up their efforts to demonstrate that China's human rights record has been deteriorating in some important respects, including the continued detention without charges of Wei Jingsheng, China's best-known dissident; his secretary, Tong Yi, and thousands of other political and religious detainees.
Even as Mr. Yu was receiving the news about his passport in Beijing, security authorities in Shanghai appeared to be staging a new crackdown on a group of dissidents, with four reported arrests.
A Western diplomat who has followed Mr. Yu's efforts said the news of his freedom to travel was "very encouraging" because his case was "one of the more difficult ones" that the Clinton Administration had hoped to resolve this month. Mr. Clinton must decide by June 3 whether China has made "overall significant progress" in human rights, or Beijing will face cancellation of favorable tariff status for $30 billion in Chinese exports to the United States.
 
Clinton Remarks on Trade
 Mr. Clinton, in remarks last week, gave strong indication that he is not inclined to cancel the trade agreement because to do so " would be detrimental to the economic progress of China and to the standard of living which has come to so many millions."
Along with Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist who lives in exile in the United States, Mr. Yu was the first of China's intellectuals to assert that human rights were not something to be granted by the Communist Party, but rather were inherent and inviolable rights of individuals.
As recently as last November, Mr. Yu challenged the assertion, widely made by China's leaders, that international pressure on China over human rights amounts to interference in China's internal affairs.
"If it is the sovereign government which infringes or tramples upon the human rights of its citizens" then "all the resolutions safeguarding human rights passed by the United Nations are but a mere scrap of paper," he wrote in an address, delivered in his absence, to a Hong Kong symposium on human rights.
Born in northeastern China, the son of a professor of Chinese literature, Mr. Yu joined the Communist Party in 1942. His fluency in Russian and English got him a job in the Ministry of Public Security in 1956, where he was given the task of setting up a publishing house to propagate the Communist Party line.
 
Imprisoned in Late 1960's
 During the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960's Mr. Yu landed in prison, apparently for incurring the wrath of Jiang Qing, the wife of Mao Zedong. He was tortured and spent three years in solitary confinement.
With the rise of Deng Xiaoping as China's leader in 1978, Mr. Yu was rehabilitated and named chief editor of the Masses Publishing House.
But his trenchant assaults on the Communist Party's power, often put him in opposition to Mr. Deng's attempts to balance the conservative and liberal elements of the party leadership.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise on Dollar Rally; Dow Up 27.37

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
At last the volatility in the international currency markets has helped the domestic stock market. Yesterday, the dollar rallied to its highest level in more than two weeks, lifting bond prices and thus lifting stocks after four straight declining sessions.
Blue chips like AT&T and General Motors, pharmaceutical companies like Warner Lambert and Bristol Myers, and high-technology companies like Microsoft and Oracle all benefited. 
 But the lift in the dollar may be short-lived and so may the stock and bond rallies. A negative inflation surprise from the April producer and consumer price indexes due tomorrow and Friday could just as easily send dollar, bond and stock prices tumbling.
"I think it's a temporary rally for the dollar," said David F. DeRosa, director, foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
For the moment at least, currency speculators may be joining in the bond and stock markets' consensus that the Federal Reserve Board will, between now and its policy-setting meeting next Tuesday, decisively raise interest rates as an inflation-fighting action.
Or the United States and European central banks, according to a current market rumor, may be buying dollars at moderate rates of intervention in advance of today's $12 billion auction of 10-year Treasury bonds.
At the very least, the United States, Germany and Japan seemed to be coordinating their actions yesterday to benefit the dollar. The German and Japanese central banks cut money market interest rates, thus making the dollar more valuable, especially if the Fed raises rates soon. President Clinton said he was upbeat about trade talks with Japan.
Whatever the case, the dollar rose to 104.42 yen, up 1.62 yen. What has that got to do with stocks or bonds? A more valuable dollar makes American exports more expensive and less competitive, easing inflationary pressures and thus helping both stocks and bonds.
"It's in the mutual best interest of the U.S., Japan and Germany to see the dollar stronger," said Martin D. Sass, whose M. D. Sass Investors Services manages $2 billion, about 70 percent of which is in fixed-income investments and 30 percent in stocks.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.49 percent, down 14 basis points. Yields fall when prices of current bonds rise, because traders do not need to offer higher rates to entice buyers. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.37 points, to 3,656.41, after falling 69 points in the previous four sessions. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 3.69 points, to 446.01. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.04 points, to 725.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was normal at about 295.6 million shares changing hands.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.61 points, to 246.94, while advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,327 to 887. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.23 point, to 435.19.
Of 30 component stocks in the Dow industrials, 21 rose, led by AT&T and General Motors. AT&T rose 1 3/4, to 53, in reaction to a $4 billion telephone contract with Saudi Arabia announced after the closing bell Monday. General Motors rose 1 5/8, to 55 1/2, on no discernible news.
Of 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 296 stocks rose, led not only by AT&T and G.M., but also by Exxon and Procter & Gamble. Exxon rose 3/4, to 62 1/2, and P.&G. rose 1 1/8, to 54 5/8, both on no discernible news.
The most active stock yesterday at 15 million was the American depositary receipts of Ericsson, the Swedish maker of telecommunications equipment. Ericsson was one of several telecommunications manufacturers that lost out to AT&T on the huge Saudi Arabian contract.

Treasuries Surge, Aided By Dollar and Auction

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities surged more than a point yesterday as a rebounding dollar and a well-received three-year note auction helped sentiment after two-days of sharp losses.
The buying came from both retail and institutional bond traders and allowed the market to recoup almost half of the losses sustained on Friday and Monday. 
 The average yield at the Treasury's three-year note auction was 6.54 percent. While the yield was far above the 4.83 percent rate at the February sale it was lower than many traders expected.
Traders were especially encouraged by the auction's noncompetitive bidding, which is a gauge of small investor sentiment. The noncompetitive bids totaled $1.45 billion -- the highest since the May 1990 auction, when they were $2.44 billion.
Traders said the large number might be an indication that small investors now thought Treasury securities were a good buy relative to other investments. For example, the yield on the new three-year note is higher than the yield was on the 30-year bond in February.
 
Lift for Market
 If that is the case, this buying could give a lift to a market that has sold off strongly since the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates in February.
By late in the day the price of the 30-year bond was up 119/32 , to 8511/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.49 percent, from 7.63 percent on Monday. That was the biggest one-day drop in yield since April 5, when the bond yield dropped 17 basis points.
Jane Tedder, vice president and senior portfolio manager of the Security Management Company, said the surge in bond prices was welcome, although confounding. "Nothing makes a lot of sense, but with two days of price declines, the market to some extent is responding to being oversold," she said.
Also adding to the momentum, Ms. Tedder said, were reports of coordinated interest rate moves by the United States, Germany and Japan, which would help support the dollar.
Most of the recent trading, she said, has been psychological. "The market has been trading in anticipation of inflation, or of the perceived threat of inflation," Ms. Tedder said. The Fed, she said, has not done a good job of easing the market's concerns and in the last interest rate increase "should have come with a boulder, but instead chose to shoot pebbles and that is leading to market uncertainty."
With the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week, Ms. Tedder said she thought the Government would have to increase both the Federal funds and discount rates by 50 basis points.
"One nagging thought," she said, "has been that the Fed is seeing something in the economy that the market can't, or they have already accomplished what they've set out to do. And if they have, than they are seeing things we are not seeing."
Traders said the strengthening of the dollar against the yen also stirred talk of greater Japanese participation in this week's Treasury auctions.
Market analysts said they were encouraged to see the market rallying ahead of the auction, suggesting that the market had reached an oversold condition.
 
New Debt Is Sold
 Municipal and corporate issuers took advantage of the drop in yields to sell new debt, with municipals selling about $1.8 billion, while the Ford Motor Company's finance unit sold $1 billion of certificates backed by car loans.
Puerto Rico sold $305 million in general obligation bonds with a maximum yield of 6.50 percent in 2023 through Smith Barney Shearson. The commonwealth's debt is rated A by Standard & Poor's and Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service.
Bond traders said investor demand was good enough so that yields were lowered by five basis points in some maturities after the initial pricing.
Shorter-maturity serial bonds were initially priced to yield from 3.75 percent in 1995 to 6.45 percent in 2010.
Ford sold the senior asset-backed certificates at a price of $999.49 for $1,000 of debt to yield 6.47 percent through Goldman, Sachs. The certificates, which have an average life of 1.59 years, were priced to yield about 54 basis points more than the 4.25 percent Treasury note due in 1995. they are rated triple-A by Moody's and S.& P.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-year Treasury notes:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Average Price . . . 99.893 Average Yield . . . 6.54% Low Price . . . 99.866 High Yield . . . 6.55% High Price . . . 99.893 Low Yield . . . 6.54% Accepted at low price . . . 44% Total applied for . . . $48,246,041 Accepted . . . $17,099,620 Noncompetitive . . . $1,452,000 Interest set at . . . 6 1/2%

HEADLINE: Report Links Growth And Natural Resources

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The Commerce Department released a new report on the gross domestic product today that attempts to determine just how fast the economy is using up the nation's natural resources.
Government economists hope the annual report, known as the "Green G.D.P.," will help them determine whether the economy is using natural resources faster than it is finding new reserves or alternative resources. 
 Such depletion could mean that the economic growth rate does not reflect the price society will pay if there are not enough resources to meet future demand.
For example, today's report said the average annual rate of return on capital for the oil and mining industries would have been only 4 percent to 5 percent from 1958 to 1991 if depletion costs had been included. Existing economic growth figures estimated that the average annual rate of return for the oil and mining industries at 23 percent.
 
 
Practical Uses Unclear
 Economists say it is too soon to tell how the Green G.D.P. figures will be used and practically applied. Unlike most conventional economic indicators -- like the regular report on the gross domestic product, which measures the economy's output of goods and services -- the Green G.D.P. will not produce a single number that can be compared with previous totals.
For their part, Government analysts have been careful not to draw too many conclusions from their work, leaving that instead to politicians and academics.
"Our natural resources have real value and must be treated as important economic assets and part of our nation's wealth," the Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, said.
Initially, the new report will track oil, gas, coal and minerals and metals drilled and mined in the United States and its territories.
Over the next few years, the Commerce Department plans to add renewable commodities like lumber and farm crops to the report. Later, the Government hopes to quantify the cost of air and water pollution.
The new annual report, formally called the Integrated Economic and Environmental Satellite Accounts, also provided these details:
*Proven oil and mineral reserves would add 3 percent to 7 percent to the nation's business assets if included in existing economic growth statistics.
*The value of new reserves discovered over the last three decades has roughly offset the depletion of reserves.
*The value of proven oil and mineral reserves is two to four times greater than existing buildings, equipment and extracted inventories in the oil and mining industries.
In computing the results, Government analysts charge the value of the extracted products against the G.D.P. much in the same way a business depreciates its assets, such as plant and equipment.
 
 
Exploration and Development
 The prices of the commodities used take into account exploration and development costs, not just the current price of a barrel of oil or a shipment of coal, a Government analyst said.
In addition, discoveries of new reserves will be counted as additions to the economy's environmental account, much in the way construction of new structures is added to the G.D.P.
Critics contend that the Clinton Administration could be "prostituting Government statistics to advance a certain point of view," according to Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. "Environmentalists want to use this so they can argue, 'We value clean air this much, we value clean water this much,' " Mr. Mitchell said.

HEADLINE: Review/Music;
Abbreviated Russian Fountainhead

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
It must take an unusually strong faith to start an opera company in Russia these days. Even the most established and renowned Russian companies, the Kirov and the Bolshoi, are reeling under economic pressures, and they can at least live on a back list of productions. Nevertheless, the New Opera of Moscow has been braving this harsh climate since 1991, offering alternative views of standard repertory works.
The company, conducted by its artistic director, Yevgeny Kolobov, made its American debut on Monday evening at Avery Fisher Hall. Its showpiece was an idiosyncratic reconsideration of Glinka's "Russlan and Ludmilla," a mammoth 1842 work that Richard Taruskin, writing in the New Grove Dictionary of Opera, describes as the fountainhead of the 19th-century Russian style. 
 This semi-staged, seriously truncated edition was not the production to prove Mr. Taruskin's point, although it did confirm that the score offers stretches of glorious choral writing, brilliant orchestral textures and inventively shaped arias. Full-length versions of the work are rare, even in Russia; the Kirov Opera's uncut version, which just opened in St. Petersburg, runs more than five hours. Mr. Kolobov, paring away a great many episodes, choral expansions, orchestral dances and even the overture (the only part of the work regularly heard in the United States) brought the work down to two and half hours.
The essentials of the story were retained. Based on a Pushkin poem, the opera begins at the wedding of Russlan and Ludmilla, from which the bride is abducted by Chernomor, an evil sorcerer. With help from Finn, a benign sorcerer, and hindrance from Naina, an evil sorceress, Russlan and two of Ludmilla's other suitors, Ratmir and Farlaf, set out to rescue Ludmilla, who is ultimately restored to Russlan.
Mr. Kolobov, besides telescoping the action, has decided, his program note says, that "the main criterion in producing the opera is to stress the importance of Baian, the narrator." Baian, actually, is a minstrel whose aria in the opening wedding scene foretells the trials Russlan and Ludmilla will face. Mr. Kolobov opens the work starkly with Baian's aria and has him give a reprise at the end of the work in place of the wedding festivities. The overture -- or a section of it -- makes its first appearance as a coda to the opera.
On Monday, the singers were costumed and given some space to mill around in at the left side of the stage. And if they were dramatically constricted, some of them did fabulous work vocally. As Russlan, Pavel Daniliuk had ample opportunity to show off a big, resounding voice with the rich, deep tone that is characteristic of the best Russian basses. Marina Zhukova had some pitch problems in the highest passages of Ludmilla's coloratura arias, but elsewhere her soprano was attractive and flexible. Yelena Zelenskaya's somewhat darker, more rounded and almost mezzolike soprano was heard to good effect in Gorislava's music.
There were also solid contributions by the cast's two mezzo-sopranos, Irina Chistyakova (Ratmir) and Yuliya Abakumovskaya (Naina), two lyric tenors, Marat Gareyev (Baian) and Sergei Khomov (Finn). Tigran Martirosian, a bass, made Farlaf into a comic character somewhat like Monostatos in "The Magic Flute." The silent role of Chernomor was played by Viktor Tsyplayev.
Mr. Kolobov elicited a shapely, warm-toned performance from his orchestra and chorus. It was a pity that so much of the music was deleted.

HEADLINE: Is It Art or Merely a Safety Hazard?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Wherever art and commerce rub together, the potential for conflict lurks. At the old Macy's warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, the two are digging in for a head-to-head court fight that could test, for the first time, the Visual Artists' Rights Act, a Federal statute that went into effect in June 1991.
On one side are three artists who, over two and a half years, transformed an 18,000-square-foot lobby at 47-44 31st Street into an eye-popping sculptural installation made of recycled materials, scrap and abandoned appliances reconfigured into a huge silver fish, a moon that opens up to reveal an astronaut with a trash-can head, a bathtub sun and much more. 
 Testifying last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the art historian and critic Robert Rosenblum compared the work, which is unfinished and untitled, to the Watts Towers in Los Angeles and Antoni Gaudi's Church of the Holy Family in Barcelona, Spain.
 
Argument Against a Work
 Helmsley-Spear, the New York City real estate giant that owns the building, takes a different view. At a hearing to decide whether the artists should be granted a preliminary injunction that would bar the owners from disturbing the work until its fate can be decided at a trial, the lawyers for Helmsley-Spear are arguing that the sculpture presents a safety hazard to the tenants of the building and to members of the public who walk through the lobby. Many of the sculptural elements, some of which weigh hundreds of pounds, are suspended from the ceilings and walls. The work was commissioned by a partnership, which is now dissolved, that leased the building. Helmsley-Spear says it must go.
"The owner is caught in an unfortunate situation," said Adrian Zuckerman, a lawyer with Davidoff & Malito, which is representing Helmsley-Spear. "We are attempting to protect the health, safety and welfare of the tenants and the public. This has nothing to do with the quality or the esthetics of the piece."
But if the judge in the case, David N. Edelstein, accepts the argument of Richard A. Altman, the lawyer for John J. Veronis, John Swing and John Carter, the sculptors who created the work, Helmsley-Spear will have no choice but to begin talking about art, not safety.
 
Saving From 'Distortion'
 Mr. Altman contends that the work is protected by the Visual Artists' Rights Act. Signed into law by President George Bush in 1990 and effective six months later, the act is an amendment to Federal copyright law that seeks to protect certain categories of visual art commissioned or completed after June 1991 from intentional "distortion, mutilation or other modification" that would harm an artist's honor or reputation and to prevent the destruction of works "of recognized stature."
The law is much narrower than European laws that govern what are known as the moral rights of an artist. It does not deal with books or musical works, and it protects only certain categories of visual art: paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints (in editions of less than 200) and photographs produced for exhibition.
Motion pictures and other works of visual art produced in multiple copies, including photographs for magazine publication, are not protected. It is assumed that they are, as a matter of course, altered to suit the demands of different markets. In addition, in virtually every case they would be excluded by the act because they were produced for hire by salaried employees. The intent of the statute is to protect unique works of art that once mutilated or destroyed, could not be recreated.
"It started out being much more expansive, and ended up being whittled down to a statute that provides very little protection," said Marci A. Hamilton, an associate professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City. "This is the way moral rights are going to work in this country, because they do not fit neatly in our economic system of copyright protection."
 
Safeguards and Precedents
 Other experts argue that despite its relatively narrow focus, the statute extends important legal safeguards and establishes potentially important legal precedents.
"It establishes that artists have rights that are different from copyright," said Robert A. Gorman, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania. "It also opens the door to the recognition of moral rights in this country. It's an acknowledgement that the law should protect certain rights that go beyond economic rights to affect an artist's reputation and the integrity of the artwork."
The Congressional report on the legislation cites the case of two Australian entrepreneurs who bought a Picasso print, "Trois Femmes," cut it into hundreds of pieces and sold them as "original Picasso pieces."
Although the act is deliberately narrow, legal experts say it could have been invoked to protect "Shinto," a 1,600-pound-metal sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, which once hung in the lobby of the Bank of Tokyo Trust Company at 100 Broadway, in the financial district. In 1980, without notifying the artist, the bank chopped the sculpture into pieces and put it into storage.
Under the 1991 act, the bank would have had to make a good-faith effort to notify the artist and give him 90 days to remove the sculpture, at his own expense, before it took action.
 
In Another Case
 It is unlikely that the act would have helped the sculptor Richard Serra in his fight to prevent the General Services Administration from removing his sculpture "Tilted Arc" from the plaza in front of a Federal building in lower Manhattan in 1989. It might even have hurt him.
Mr. Serra argued that because "Tilted Arc" was "site-specific" -- that is, created with a particular site in mind that is inseparable from the artwork -- the act of removal amounted to destruction of the work. Under the Federal statute, if the owner of a building and an artist agree that removal of a work would irreparably harm it, the owner has the right to destroy it.
"The artist would not do well to pursue the site-specific argument," said Jane C. Ginsburg, a professor of law at Columbia University. By calling as his witnesses Mr. Rosenblum and Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, Mr. Altman is trying to establish that the lobby installation is "a work of recognized stature," as required by the act. The meaning of this vague phrase remains to be tested in court.
Mr. Rosenblum, who called the installation "staggering in its lunatic invention," nevertheless puzzled over the question of stature. "A work of art that is unknown can't be of stature because nobody knows it," he said.
There are other confusing points. New York is among 11 states with their own visual arts law, the Artists' Authorship Rights Act. In fact, in 1984 Mr. Altman argued the first case under the state law, which involved an artist whose mural on the side of the Palladium, on East 14th Street in the East Village, was about to be painted over by the new tenant of the building, who argued that outright destruction, as opposed to alteration, was not barred by the law.
In the end, the tenant simply desisted, and the mural remains.
At the moment, is not clear when the Federal arts law supersedes state law.
 
Implications for Building Owners
 Thus far, the only legal light that has been shed on the statute comes from a 1991 Illinois case, in which a judge ruled that the act did not apply to a puppet theater.
The case has potentially far-reaching implications for the property rights of building owners. It is one thing to hold off for 90 days while a sculptor removes his work from a lobby. But the law also protects works, like murals, that cannot be removed without undergoing mutilation. In theory, if the three artists prevail, their work cannot be removed from the Macy's warehouse until the last of these artists has died.
"If the owner of the building has not secured a signed written agreement entitling him to dismantle the work, the statute does appear to say that he is stuck with the undesired work," said Mr. Gorman, law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
The arguments continue this week. If Judge Edelstein grants the artists a preliminary injunction, their work will be protected until their case is heard. If not, Helmsley-Spear can begin dismantling the work, as it says it would like to do. A decision is expected within a few days, and Judge Edelstein has stated that he intends to set a trial date quickly.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
JABULANI NTSHANGASE is not, from all outward appearances, an overly emotional man. But it was clear yesterday that some of the euphoria that gripped South Africans cheering their new president had rubbed off on him.
"This is truly a great day for us," said Mr. Ntshangase (pronounced chan-GAH-say). "We are finally free." He was born in Soweto, a black township near Johannesburg, and now lives in New York, where he sells South African wine. 
 Given the attitude of most Americans toward apartheid, his task has not been easy. Even after economic sanctions against his country were lifted in 1991, it was evident that little had changed in the lives of millions of South Africa's blacks. South African products, including its wines, found little support here.
"All that has changed overnight," Mr. Ntshangase said, shaking his head in disbelief. "I was out in Amagansett, on Long Island, yesterday," he said, "and the shop owners were pleading for every bottle I could give them.
"One fellow kept saying: 'Whatever you've got, I'll take two cases. Whatever you've got.' It's amazing."
Jabulani Ntshangase came to New York 14 years ago from London, where he, like so many other South Africans, had fled to make a life away from the oppression of apartheid. (Jabulani is a common name in South Africa; it is the name of a neighborhood in Soweto and of the stadium where President Mandela gave many of his political speeches.)
"I came on a United Nations scholarship," he said. "It was under something called the United Nations Educational Program for Southern Africa, which was open to students from Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, Namibia, then Southwest Africa and South Africa.
"I started at Long Island University, but eventually got a degree in business at Baruch College here in Manhattan."
He has been involved in the wine business since shortly after he arrived in the United States. "I came in May," he said. "School didn't begin until October, and I was broke. A friend, another South African, told me about a job opening as a clerk at a liquor store on the Upper West Side, Acker, Merrall & Condit. I took it."
By chance, Acker, Merrall is one of the city's leading retail wine shops. Mr. Ntshangase, who had had little to do with wine at home, soon became a knowledgeable wine salesman.
When apartheid began to crumble in the late 1980's, it became evident to a few South African wine makers and to an even smaller number of importers here that one day there could be a respectable market for South African wines in this country.
South Africa is the world's ninth-largest wine-producing nation. Its wine-making history dates from the time of the first European settlers in the middle of the 17th century. The wines, mostly produced by French Huguenot colonists, were valued in Europe before many of the famous chateaux in Bordeaux existed.
South African wines had long been popular in the United Kingdom. Canada, too, was a major market, particularly for South African brandy. But it was mostly inexpensive stuff, shipped in bulk and bottled on arrival in some northern port.
One of the first to see a future, however modest, for South African wines in this country was Neal Rosenthal, a New York fine-wine importer. He hired Mr. Ntshangase to work with him on bringing in and selling Cape wines.
In 1992, Mr. Ntshangase, who is 44, joined forces with Andre Shearer, 32, a white South African who had worked in Europe for a decade and came to the United States to sell wines. His wines come through a business he and his brother run in South Africa called the Natural Company.
Last year, about 67,000 cases of South African wines were shipped to the United States. "How many were sold is another matter," Mr. Shearer said frankly. Both men -- they call their partnership Cape Classics Inc. -- are emphatic about bringing in only quality wines. "The U.K. market is floundering because the South African image is all cheap wines."
Mr. Ntshangase recalled with relish a roomful of Boston retailers who, in a blind tasting, overwhelmingly chose a $20 South African chardonnay over a $48 French meursault.
Mr. Shearer recounted with equal joy how some of New York's top retaurants were vying with each other to snap up as many bottles as he could supply of a sauvignon blanc from Mulderbosch Vineyards in Stellenbosch.
Together, they crowed about Lespinasse, the luxurious restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel, where six South African wines are featured on the wine list.
"The world is awash in wine," Mr. Shearer said. "There is no way we can compete with California on inexpensive wine. We have to put our best foot forward."
"In fact," he continued, "we're not just selling wines; we're selling a culture, a region, an exciting part of the world." Both men say their customers often express as much interest in visiting South Africa as they do in buying its wines.
Mr. Shearer, tall, blond and voluble, and Mr. Ntshangase, short, dark and more reserved, make a striking pair when they put on dinners and wine tastings for prospective distributors around the country. They share a sense of mission and a firm conviction that time is of the essence.
"Wine leads the way," Mr. Shearer said. "It opens the door to a wide variety of other South African products." Not that there has been excessive resistance to South African goods recently; last year, the United States became South Africa's principal export market.
As for time, Mr. Ntshangase and Mr. Shearer want to capitalize on their country's moment in the sun. "We have one shot at this," Mr. Shearer said. "We have 12 months ahead of us. Then the euphoria will die and South Africa will, we hope, become just another country."
 
TASTINGS
Louis M. Martini Barbera, 1989. About $6.25.
 
Italian-style wines have become chic in California. They even have a cute name: Cal-Italian. Most of the newer ones, made from the principal Chianti grape, sangiovese, are disappointing. They don't hold a candle to some of the older, traditional wines that sell for a third of the price. But this Martini barbera is a decidedly untrendy wine. It is even made from untrendy grapes like petite sirah, gamay beaujolais and the untrendiest of all, barbera itself. Some of the grapes actually come from the hot San Joaquin Valley. It's hard to get less trendy than that. It's a good wine. It is aged for about three years in large oak tanks and is just right for cookouts and hearty old-fashioned Italian meals. Back in the 1930's, Mr. Martini peddled his barbera to Italian places in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco. Those folks knew a good Italian-style wine when they tasted it. So will you.

HEADLINE: A Responsible Budget

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposes to cut $1 billion from New York City programs next year without cutting the services that make life bearable for the city's most vulnerable. It takes an optimistic nature to believe his administration can raise the city bureaucracy's productivity enough to sustain services while reducing the number of employees. But, as the Mayor points out, he has already accomplished some things his critics claimed could not be done. Most notably, he has persuaded unions to accept a severance plan for city employees and to give him extraordinary authority to transfer employees between agencies.
The budget Mr. Giuliani submitted to the City Council yesterday was his formal plan for fiscal 1995, starting July 1. He faced an awesome $2.3 billion deficit -- the largest since the city's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's. And closing the gap is made more difficult by the public's rebellion against further tax increases. In contrast to predecessors who raised taxes, the Mayor opts to cut them -- only $35 million next year, but $260 million the year after, and more after that. He includes long-overdue relief for apartment owners, who pay higher taxes than owners of houses. 
 Mr. Giuliani hopes to cover most of the $2.3 billion deficit with program cuts, more help from Albany and Washington, and city employees' contributions for their health insurance. In addition, he plans an intricate refinancing of city debt and sales of city assets -- an FM radio license, a hotel, gas stations and, later on, sewage plants. Such deals can bring in quick cash, but they are one-shots that offer no long-term relief.
None of those are sure things. Cost-free health insurance for most city workers is too generous, but they resist paying any share of it. The $45 million he hopes to get for the WNYC-FM license seems high. And, not least, Council members from poor neighborhoods are understandably unhappy with staffing cuts at social service agencies while the Mayor refuses to cut police and fire personnel -- key supporters of his mayoral candidacy.
Over all, the new budget seems more realistic than the Mayor's preliminary plan in February. For example, he now pledges not to cut the number of social workers and preserves the Department of AIDS Services. And, sensibly, he has adopted a slower plan for merging the city's police, housing police and transit police, an idea that has encountered resistance.
As before, Mr. Giuliani projects a slight reduction in total spending, to $31.6 billion from $31.7 billion, and stresses that this would be the first reduction in 16 years. If it happens, without further injury to services already maimed by earlier cuts, that would be a real accomplishment.
In yesterday's presentation, Mr. Giuliani demonstrated an impressive personal knowledge of the budget, although he provided few details on the specific impact of cutbacks. It now becomes the Council's responsibility to test his blueprint, to assure that the city fulfills its obligations to the needy and disadvantaged.

A Tale Of Two Women

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
Imagine that Anita Hill had come forward with her accusations against Clarence Thomas more than a year after he had been confirmed by the Senate.
Imagine that she had chosen to introduce herself to the American people at a press conference sponsored by the A.C.L.U. and NOW, accompanied by a sworn enemy of Justice Thomas who had made a cottage industry of digging up dirt. 
 Imagine that a friend of Justice Thomas was willing to swear under oath that he had been told by an attorney for Ms. Hill that she might be persuaded not to go public in exchange for a job.
Imagine that she then announced that the only way to get satisfaction was to bring a suit asking for $700,000 in damages.
Would Americans have responded to Anita Hill in a different fashion than they did three years ago?
You bet they would have.
And therein lies an essential difference between the cases of Professor Hill and Paula Jones, the woman who has gone to court to get the President to pay up for an alleged outrage in a hotel room.
The complaint by conservatives that feminists, who rallied round Professor Hill, have not done the same for Ms. Jones reminds me of sitting in a meeting next to the picture editor of The Times, the only other woman in the room.
When a clerk came in with the photographs for that day's paper, he gave them to me.
Because, of course, all women are the same woman. And, according to those who insist that feminists should embrace Ms. Jones unquestioningly, all women's stories are the same story.
That's ridiculous and condescending. Each instance of sexual harassment has to be judged on its own merits. Facts, timing, motives, credibility: all must be considered before we make up our minds what to believe.
On all those counts Ms. Jones sorely needed better advice and counsel. Her first public appearance, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, led to suspicions of political motivation or manipulation. The appearance with her of Cliff Jackson, who instead of a life has a vendetta against Mr. Clinton, smacks of a smear campaign. Bringing a suit for damages after an attorney first tried to negotiate a settlement in which she and her husband would get jobs if she kept mum makes the question of gain a very real one.
Above all, her timing is troublesome. Why did she not make these charges of sexual harassment in time to inform the choice of Americans at the polls in 1992?
Ms. Hill herself had made the atmosphere somewhat more hospitable for such charges by the time the Presidential election rolled around. And Gennifer Flowers had broken silence about Mr. Clinton's alleged womanizing. At a time when this country was deeply embroiled in discussions about Mr. Clinton's private behavior and how much it mattered in public life, why didn't Paula Corbin Jones come forward and say, "Wait until you hear what he did to me!"?
Time, they say, wounds all heels. Justice Thomas's tenure on the high court is shadowed not by Ms. Hill's charges but by his own lack of stature. The taxpayers could save on the salaries of his staff if Justice Scalia was simply given two votes.
The same may be true of Mr. Clinton. Many voters say they care about health care, crime and the economy, not his private life; some feminists are disheartened by his reputation and the seaminess of this alleged incident. In 1996, the first opportunity she has provided us to use the allegations she now proffers, both groups may decide Paula Jones's story of being solicited for oral sex pales beside the President's accomplishments -- or lack of same.
There's no doubt liberal ideology plays a clear role in all this, making feminists less eager to embrace the accuser of a pro-choice President than that of a conservative jurist. There's no doubt feminist ideology should make us demand that Ms. Jones not be crucified on the altar of rumor and sexual innuendo, as Ms. Hill was.
But that's no reason to let right-wing activists, no friends to either the President, women, or the issue of sexual harassment, shame us into foolish lock step. We feminists, of all people, know that all women are not the same woman, all stories not the same story. Accept, knee-jerk, each accusation without looking at how and why it came to be made? That's not feminism, it's credulity.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
Giuliani's Budget Proposes Cuts For Spending and Work Force

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a $31.6 billion budget for New York City yesterday that would reduce spending slightly for the first time in 16 years and sharply cut the municipal work force in almost every major agency except the Police and Fire Departments.
Submitting his first executive budget to the City Council, Mr. Giuliani said the city "has been spending itself beyond its economy" for more than a decade, creating perennial gaps between what it spends and what its tax base can support. The Mayor said the city's overspending had drained the local economy, driving private industry from the city. 
 "The purpose of this budget is to redirect the economy of New York," Mr. Giuliani said. Saying the city was "hemorrhaging jobs" while the rest of the nation was recovering, Mr. Giuliani added, "We can't employ people through government alone."
In drafting his plan, Mr. Giuliani needed to close a $2.3 billion gap between projected spending and revenues for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. To do that, he has suggested about $1.2 billion in spending cuts from city agencies, mostly through cutting 15,000 workers, or 7 percent of the city-financed work force. Mr. Giuliani said those cuts could be made without serious damage to services if managers learned to run agencies more efficiently. Over all, spending would fall by $102 million.
He also proposed some modest tax cuts totaling about $35 million.
The extent of the service cuts is likely to figure in the debate over Mr. Giuliani's budget as it moves to the City Council, particularly since the budget makes no cuts in the Police or Fire Departments. Already some lawmakers are asking whether protecting those agencies is worth the pain for schools, youth programs and hospitals. [News analysis, page B5.]
Besides cutting jobs, the Mayor relied in his efforts to close the budget gap on some actions that will still require the cooperation of the State Legislature, the Federal Government or the municipal unions.
Those measures include about $400 million in increased aid from Albany and Washington, $200 million from persuading unions to pay for part of retirees' health benefits, $200 million from refinancing city bonds, $110 million from selling a city-owned radio station and the United Nations Plaza Hotel, and $51 million from changing payments on an outstanding debt to the city's pension funds.
Despite some signs of an economic recovery, the Mayor's plan assumed that tax revenues will remain flat next year, bringing in only $18 billion. The main reason is that property taxes are expected to continue to sink because the prolonged recession has driven real-estate prices down, Abraham M. Lackman, the city's Budget Director, said.
If a budget is a blueprint of a Mayor's priorities, then Mr. Giuliani's made clear that his highest priority is law enforcement, where he began his career as a prosecutor. The heaviest cuts fell on social programs and other services. The Mayor has proposed eliminating 1,400 jobs in the Transportation Department, 2,000 in the Sanitation Department, 4,600 from social services and nearly 2,500 administrators in the school system.
But the Police Department, whose uniformed officers are protected from reductions under a 1991 state anti-crime law, will not only grow slightly next year but also will absorb the missions of other agencies. Uniformed officers will take over some responsibilities for directing traffic, patrolling parks and enforcing taxi rules.
 
'Most Important Priority'
 "I believe the single most important priority in this city is to make this city safe, and this budget reflects that," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's why I believe I was elected."
Mr. Giuliani will now have to sell his proposal to the 51-member City Council, where some members yesterday objected strenuously to his plan to shield the police from spending cuts while cutting social services.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat, responded positively to most of Mr. Giuliani's budget proposals, praising the Republican Mayor for cutting taxes and for accepting a Council proposal to sell the city's waste-water treatment plants two years from now.
But Mr. Vallone said the Council would seek to restore nearly $28 million in cuts in youth programs and some of the $317 million cut for the Board of Education. He said he was also especially troubled by a $1 billion reduction in the construction budget for schools.
"Our priorities may not be the same when it comes to youth and education, but that could and should be negotiated out," Mr. Vallone said.
Several black and Hispanic Council members said the budget hurt minority neighborhoods disproportionately, especially the deep reductions for the Social Services, Youth and Parks Departments. Some pointed out that many of the jobs that were being cut were held by minorities, while the predominantly white Police and Fire Departments avoided the ax.
"We're getting a double whammy in that we lose jobs and plus we lose services," said Councilman Enoch Williams of Brooklyn.
Mr. Giuliani said his job reductions would come from the ranks of supervisors and support staff rather than front-line social workers or others who deal directly with the public. And he said the cuts would not necessarily reduce services, noting that he was challenging his managers to do more with less.
Nevertheless, under the Mayor's proposed budget, parks would be cleaned less often, sanitation workers would travel longer routes, lines would be longer at welfare offices and there would be fewer after-school programs for young people. Recyclable trash would be collected half as often and welfare recipients would be fingerprinted to reduce fraud.
In a departure from past practice, Mr. Giuliani's budget did not spell out in detail where jobs would be eliminated or what programs would be reduced, though budget aides had detailed documents listing the expected service cuts.
Mr. Giuliani said, however, that the majority of the jobs are to be eliminated through a severance program that has so far attracted 7,400 applicants. Since municipal unions agreed earlier this spring to allow the city to transfer employees from agency to agency, the city will be able to shore up vital services, the Mayor said.
"Because of the redeployment program, we can't tell you exactly where the service reductions are going to take place," he said. "I'm asking the people who manage this city where they have service cuts to try to do more with fewer people."
 
A Campaign Pledge
 The plan also reflected the Mayor's campaign pledge to create a leaner government that lives within its means and provides essential services while cutting taxes for the city's seven and a half million residents.
On taxes, Mr. Giuliani proposed a $28 million reduction in the commercial rent tax and a $7 million cut in the tax on hotel rooms next year. Over the next four years, he has proposed nearly $1 billion more in sundry tax cuts, including a $70 million reduction in property taxes for co-op and condominium owners in 1996 that was first suggested by Council leaders.
Mr. Giuliani's plan would also consolidate some agencies and introduce other efforts to "reinvent government" that he promised in his campaign. The plan calls for merging the city's Police Department with the Housing and Transit Police Departments, a proposal that has met stiff resistance from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It also calls for moving the Parking Violations Bureau into the City Finance Department and dismantling the Taxi and Limousine Commission, handing its enforcement powers to the police.
In another controversial proposal, Mr. Giuliani has stuck by his earlier plan to save $7 million next year and $88 million each year after that by using an electronic device that fingerprints recipients of welfare payments.
 
Wall Street Reaction
 On Wall Street, the reaction was generally favorable. Richard P. Larkin of Standard and Poor's Corporation, a bond rating agency, said the plan was "one of the more positive budgets we've seen in the last five years in terms of trying to get spending in line with recurring revenue." But he added that "this budget still contains items for which the city has been criticized in the past."
Mr. Larkin said bond traders were troubled by the Mayor's plan to save $225 million by stretching out the city's debt and to raise $110 million by selling off some city assets, including WNYC-FM's license. He also criticized a plan to borrow $215 million against future tax revenues. None of those actions would help to reduce the city's long-range budget problems, he said.

A New Owner of a Philadelphia Development Site Hopes to Build a Large Office Building

BYLINE: David J. Wallace 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
ONE of downtown Philadelphia's largest development sites has a new owner who envisions building the city's first large commercial office building in at least two years.
A development partnership, financed primarily by German banks and led by Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, bought the site, known as Penn Center West, from the former developer for $8 million. The price was approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had acquired the mortgage in the takeover of a savings bank. 
 The land spans more than four blocks, a total of eight acres, several blocks northwest of Philadelphia's main business district, with the largest parcel along the riverfront. Under the city's zoning it could accommodate 7.5 million square feet of office, retail, residential or hotel development, Mr. Rosen said.
The former owner, H. Leonard Fruchter, bought the property in 1980 and has seen other buildings constructed in the central business district while his property went undeveloped. As a condition of the sale, Mr. Fruchter will take a portion of any future profits generated by the site.
The new owner, R.F.R. Holding, is the United States affiliate of a German real estate and development company, Rosen Development, which is based in Frankfurt.
The L-shaped property spans four narrow blocks from 20th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard west to the Schuylkill alongside the elevated tracks for the city's commuter rail lines. A five-acre riverfront parcel at 24th Street, now a parking lot, is considered to have the greatest potential for development. It lies directly across from the 30th Street railroad station, where Amtrak and commuter trains arrive, and is easily accessible by a bridge that crosses the river at Market Street a block away.
Although no development plans for Penn Center West are pending, Mr. Rosen predicted a build-to-suit corporate headquarters of up to 800,000 square feet might be the first project. Several local companies are known to be shopping for headquarters space.
Real estate brokers say that other uses besides offices may be appropriate for the Penn Center West site, a subject of development speculation in Philadelphia for many years.
"We are currently reviewing the plans that came with the property," Mr. Rosen said. "They were very ambitious proposals that might have worked in the 80's, but now we are downscaling and having an architect look at them."
Instead of the full 7.5 million square feet allowable, Mr. Rosen predicted long-term construction of four million to five million square feet.
Mr. Rosen said the cost of obtaining space at Penn Center West had given it a new competitive edge, however, because of a 75 percent write-down by the Resolution Trust Corporation of Mr. Fruchter's original loan. That has reduced the developer's land costs, which makes it possible to offer space at a lower price.
Mr. Rosen is not the only developer with a site, however. The Rubin Organization, JMB Realty and other companies have sites for office towers, some within blocks of R.F.R.'s property. Their large sites, envisioned for major office buildings, have remained parking lots, with developers unable to find tenants willing to pay their price or pre-lease enough space.
Many companies are consolidating their space rather than expanding or building now, however, dimming prospects for new construction.
"The utmost care is being taken in terms of capital allocations, decisions to lease and purchase, and the right to contract or sublease is as important as the right to expand," said Clive G. Mendelow, chief operating officer of the Binswanger Advisory Group, which does consulting work for corporations on real estate asset portfolios as part of the Binswanger Organization, a brokerage and advisory firm.
For example, Rosenbluth International, a corporate travel agency, gave up prestigious rental offices in One Liberty Place -- the city's tallest office building -- and four other locations, combining its operations in a 144,000-square-foot building it bought at 24th and Walnut Streets, at the edge of downtown's business hub, said a company spokeswoman, Diane Peters. It was an expansion, but the company chose to buy an existing building rather than go into a new one at higher cost.
Mr. Fruchter said he assembled the Penn Center West property in 1980 and, in 1985, sold one square block to Maguire Thomas Partners and I.B.M. for construction of twin office buildings called Commerce Square.
"The plans are fluid in the sense that we're flexible in responding to need as it arises," Mr. Fruchter said. "You could have different uses and they would have to interrelate. You just have to reconcile the architectural needs with the demands and social needs of the neighborhood."
R.F.R.'s portfolio includes rental apartments in Connecticut, office buildings in New York City -- the 65,000-square-foot building at 3 West 57th Street and the 145,000-square-foot building at 830 Third Avenue -- and a 10-acre commercial development site in Miami, Mr. Rosen said.

HEADLINE: Right-Wing Lawmakers in Haiti Swear In a Provisional President

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
In a defiant step supported by Haiti's military leaders, a rump group of right-wing legislators in Port-au-Prince swore in an 80-year-old Supreme Court justice as Haiti's provisional President today, intensifying the country's confrontation with the United States.
The move came just as President Clinton has adopted a stern new posture toward Haiti's military rulers over their refusal to permit the return to power of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's democratically elected President ousted in 1991. 
 Although the action was carried out by only a minority of Haiti's Parliament, the military's backing was seen as an effort by the ruling junta to make formal its ouster of Father Aristide.
With the step today, the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and his military allies seem to be hardening their rejection of Mr. Clinton's appeals to step aside or face tougher economic sanctions and possibly military force.
In Washington, Clinton Administration officials and supporters of President Aristide said they would not accept the action as legitimate. The White House denounced the installation of the new President, Emil Jonassaint, as "cynical, unconstitutional and illegal."
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton remained committed to restoring Father Aristide to power and that he would seek to extend the punitive sanctions already imposed on 600 of Haiti's leaders to Mr. Jonassaint and other members of the newly declared Government.
The appointment of Mr. Jonassaint follows months of threats by General Cedras and his followers to install a successor to Father Aristide. Administration officials described the move today as a disturbing sign of intransigence by the Haitian officers in the face of new demands from Mr. Clinton and the United Nations that they relinquish power.
General Cedras and four other senior members of the army's high command attended the ceremony in Port-au-Prince at which Mr. Jonassaint took the oath of office, and the Legislative Palace where it took place was ringed by scores of heavily armed soldiers and armed civilians.
The 13 Haitian senators and 30 deputies who supported the move and attended the ceremony today contended that Father Aristide's long absence from Haiti left them with no option under Haiti's Constitution but to turn to the Supreme Court justice as his provisional successor.
Representing only a minority of each body, the group included eight senators elevated after irregular elections organized by the military in January 1993.
 
An Act of 'Open Defiance'
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the procedures used to replace Father Aristide "seem to us to be invalid." The Haitian Embassy in Washington, which supports Father Aristide, issued a statement denouncing the move as "just one more act in open defiance of the international community by the coup regime."
Michael Barnes, a top adviser to President Aristide, called the step "just another cynical, tragic piece of evidence that the military regime in Haiti has no intention of fulfilling the commitment it made last year to give up power and permit the restoration of democracy."
A United Nations Security Council resolution approved last week calls on General Cedras and his supporters to honor the accord they signed last summer at Governors Island in New York and step down by May 21 or face a near-total economic embargo.
Mr. Clinton, who pressed for that new ultimatum, has said only that it would not be wise to rule out the use of force if those sanctions fail. But his aides have made clear that sentiment within the White House is moving in favor of military action to oust Haiti's leaders if the sanctions do not force them to step down within several weeks or months.
American officials in Washington nevertheless acknowledged today that the move by the right-wing Haitian legislators appeared to serve notice that the army leaders would not easily be swayed. A senior official said it was being regarded by the Administration as an effort by General Cedras and his supporters "to demonstrate that they are in control, that they are going to call the shots, and that they are not intimidated by sanctions."
 
A 21-Gun Salute
 The honors showered by the Haitian military on Mr. Jonassaint in Port-au-Prince today included a 21-gun salute at the National Palace and a chance to review the Presidential Guard on the lawn of the gleaming white-domed building, whose gates were flung open for the first time in months. He was later ushered upstairs to a reception.
In his short acceptance speech, Mr. Jonassaint called on the United States and Haitians to allow his Government a chance to put its policies in action. "Let there be a truce to give the Government a chance to make decisions," he said. "We ask all citizens to show patience, to give us a chance."
But a radical right-wing Senator, Bernard Sansaricq, delivered a fiercely nationalistic speech in which he appealed to the United States to switch its backing from Father Aristide to Mr. Jonassaint.
Haiti has been without a day-to-day leader since the resignation in December of Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was appointed by Father Aristide as part of a procedure that was supposed to lead to his reinstatement. Father Aristide has refused to name a new Prime Minister until General Cedras steps down.
To reinforce its tough new stance, the Administration has sought to persuade other nations to agree to join in a United Nations force to keep peace in Haiti once its military leaders are gone.
While Canada has said it would take part, no Latin American countries have agreed. But officials of Mexico , which has long championed non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations, passed up a chance to criticize the American threat of military force in Haiti while senior United States officials were in Mexico City for discussions this week.

HEADLINE: GERMANS REDUCE 2 INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, May 11

 BODY:
The German central bank lowered its key interest rates by half a percentage point today to the lowest levels in five years, suggesting that Germany was again joining the United States and its allies to stop the recent slide in the dollar that has troubled American financial markets.
The larger than expected interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, which spurred hope for economic recovery in Europe, were accompanied by similar or smaller rate reductions in Italy, France, Belgium and Denmark. 
 The German rate cuts sent the value of the dollar higher in early trading in Europe. But by the end of trading in New York, the dollar was slightly lower against both the German mark and the Japanese yen, after a sharp jump on Tuesday.
The bank reduced its discount rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent and the Lombard rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent, lowering the band within which commercial short-term interest rates fluctuate in Germany.
In Frankfurt and in German Government offices here, there was a sense that now it was up to the Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates in the United States to halt the decline on world financial markets and stop the fall of the dollar against strong German and Japanese currencies. Lower German rates make it less attractive for currency speculators to hold German marks, and higher American ones would make the dollar more attractive.
Worries about world currency and financial markets played an important role in the decision, according to one of the Bundesbank officials involved. "We have to do something about the volatility we've seen on the markets since the Federal Reserve first raised U.S. rates in February," the official said. "If the Fed were to raise the Federal funds rate by 50 to 75 basis points next week, that would go a long way to calming the markets." A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The dollar's recent drop against the mark and the yen has signaled a decline in confidence in the Clinton Administration's policies, according to some traders and analysts, and sent financial markets in the United States and abroad tumbling. Long-term interest rates in the United States shot up today to 7.63 percent, the highest level since just after President Clinton was elected in November 1992.
 
Where Coordination Helped
 In the last two weeks, first Washington and then both the United States and 16 allies stepped into the currency markets to buy dollars and support the ailing currency. Today's larger-than-expected cut in German interest rates is likely to make currency traders think that a coordinated effort to prop up the dollar might be gaining steam.
German financial analysts welcomed the cuts in key lending rates there. "Neither in wage settlements nor on the demand side are there any signs of danger for domestic price stability, or of the value of the mark abroad," the Dresdner Bank said. "In these conditions the Bundesbank has every reason to continue siphoning down money market rates in coming months and more or less regularly lowering the key indicators."
Peter Pietsch of Commerzbank said the Bundesbank was trying to encourage investors to put their money into long-term instruments rather than parking it in bank accounts, which has the effect of inflating the money supply. "I do not believe there will be another big reduction before the summer," he said.
The last time Bundesbank rates were as low as the levels set today was early in 1989, well before the surge of inflation and the record high European interest rates that followed German reunification in 1990.
German politicians, facing a difficult election campaign this fall, sang a chorus of praise for the central bank for lowering rates and expressed hope that the step would accelerate the recovery and transform the gloomy German national mood.
 
Signs of Better Times
 Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that the change from shrinkage to growth in the economy was becoming "steadily clearer" and that spending cuts by the Government had given the Bundesbank leeway to make more dramatic reductions than the earlier quarter-point cuts.
The Economics Ministry, recently backed by several independent institutes, is forecasting growth of about 1.5 percent this year, after a decline of about 2 percent last year, though not fast enough to reduce unemployment much below 10 percent, or four million workers, before the elections.
The Bundesbank has insisted that its sole considerations are its mandate to defend the German currency, which has soared by more than 5 percent against the dollar in the last two months, and to keep down German inflation, now running at 3.1 percent and expected to fall to less than 3 percent for the year.
While the bank remained true to that mandate today, and said so in explaining that the outlook for low inflation had let it cut rates, it is now led by a president, Hans Tietmeyer, who is more able than his predecessor, Helmut Schlesinger, to do what other countries want and lower German rates instead of increasing them.
"Tietmeyer isn't exactly what you would call an internationalist, but he's certainly more internationally minded than Schlesinger was," a colleague said. "Lowering rates today was also easier because nobody could argue that doing so would weaken the mark on the currency markets. If the Fed were to raise U.S. rates, that would neutralize the effect of lower German ones on the value of the dollar."
 
Differing Circumstances
 Mr. Schlesinger presided over the Bundesbank from 1991 to 1993, a time when heavy private and Government borrowing to finance the unexpectedly high costs of reunification had sent inflation up and forced the bank to raise the discount rate to a record 8.75 percent in September 1992.
Mr. Tietmeyer, a former aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, succeeded Mr. Schlesinger on Oct. 1, after the high rates had done most of their work and brought inflation down, at the cost of a severe recession that sent most of the rest of Europe into the economic doldrums and helped wreck the system of tightly linked currencies that was supposed to evolve into a common European currency as early as 1997.
The links were loosened after the last European currency crisis, including an attack by speculators on the French franc last summer. European central banks are no longer required to intervene to prop up each other's currencies when they fall sharply in trading.
But because they are not obliged to intervene, buying or selling currencies on speculation that the central banks will step in is riskier. As a result there is less of it, and the French, Belgian and Dutch currencies have been more stable in relation to each other in recent months.
This has not been true of the dollar, which investors have been selling in recent weeks because of widespread speculation in Europe that the Clinton Administration wanted to use a weak dollar as a weapon in a trade war with the Japanese. A weak dollar would make it so easy for holders of Japanese yen to buy dollars that Japanese consumers could hardly resist buying American imports.
 
Effect in Europe
 The hesitation of the Federal Reserve to raise American interest rates, despite fears that the economic recovery would spur inflation, rattled traders in the European markets, who reacted by selling dollars and buying marks.
After the Bundesbank's move today, the dollar rose from 1.6740 marks, the level set on the Frankfurt exchange just before the announcement of lower rates. It briefly reached the 1.68 level before falling back to 1.6690 marks in late New York trading, down from 1.6731 marks on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Welfare Plan Seeks Limit On Benefits

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Unwilling to wait for President Clinton to act, his Democratic allies in the House of Representatives today proposed a welfare bill similar to the one he has long promised but has yet to deliver.
The measure would place a two-year limit on welfare benefits and then require indigent mothers to join a community service program. To finance its provisions, the bill seeks deeper cuts in benefits to immigrants than legislation that White House aides say they are likely to propose. Indeed, those cuts alienated some potential co-sponsors in Congress. 
 The Congressional plan comes from the Mainstream Forum, a group of centrist and conservative House Democrats affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council, the political organization that Mr. Clinton helped found and headed when he was Governor of Arkansas.
The forum's leaders have been urging Mr. Clinton for months to put his welfare plan on a faster track, and the move today reflected the allure the issue holds for both parties in an election year.
 
Stench in the Nostrils?
 "We believe that welfare reform should be at the top of his agenda," said Representative Dave McCurdy, the Oklahoma Democrat who is both the founder of the forum and the current chairman of the leadership council, a non-Congressional group that includes governors and other elected officials.
One representative after another stepped to the microphone at a news conference today to denounce the current system and urge fast change. Declaring welfare dead, Representative Nathan Deal, a Georgia Democrat, said, "The stench from its decaying carcass has filled the nostrils of every American."
With the White House still preparing its plan, it is probably too late for Congress to pass a bill before the November elections. But the likely outlines of an eventual law are starting to appear. Mr. Clinton and both parties in Congress are now advocating sweeping changes that would limit the time mothers could collect benefits and then enroll them in a work program.
Important differences include how to pay for the program and what to do about families who complete a community service program but still cannot find private employment.
The Administration issued a statement today praising Mr. McCurdy's plan as "further proof of the broad consensus in Congress."
The clamor for welfare changes owes much to Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, when he issued his promise to "end welfare as we know it" by imposing a time limit. But after the bold talk, Mr. Clinton has been accused of foot dragging on the issue.
He has been slowed in part by the difficulty of finding a politically viable way to pay for his plan, which is expected to cost close to $10 billion over five years, for expanded training, child care and work programs. To avoid a tax increase, the Administration is trying to raise that amount by cutting other programs; it has still not settled on a final list.
In addition, Mr. Clinton has been reluctant to put forward a welfare plan at the same time he is pushing health care, since both proposals must travel through the same Congressional committees. Mr. Clinton does not want to overwhelm the Congressional staffs or have to trade votes on one issue for votes on the other.
 
Problems of His Own
 Mr. McCurdy was having his own problems this week, when a number of important co-sponsors refused to back the bill because it would raise much of the approximately $18 billion it is expected to cost by denying Supplemental Security Income to many legal immigrants.
Mr. McCurdy argues that some legal immigrants are abusing the program, by bringing their parents to the United States and then signing them up for benefits, which are about $130 a month.
Among those refusing to co-sponsor the bill was Representative Jim Slattery, a Kansas Democrat, who was the chairman of the task force of the Mainstream Forum that drafted the proposal. Mr. Slattery argued it was unfair to pay for it by cutting assistance to legal immigrants.
While the Mainstream Forum contains about 90 members, it was unclear today how many would sign on as co-sponsors to the bill, which has not yet been officially introduced.
One aspect of Mr. McCurdy's bill that is likely to provoke fierce disputes is his plan to limit the community service program to three years, after which welfare recipients would be eligible for no cash at all.
House Republicans would allow states to impose the three-year limit; Mr. McCurdy would require it, but allow states to grant extensions to 10 percent of the caseload.
The provision raises several central questions: Are there really enough jobs in the economy for all five million families now on welfare? And do welfare recipients have the skills and emotional stability to hold the jobs?

HEADLINE: $10 Billion For G.M. Pensions

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 11

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced plans today to contribute $10 billion of stock and cash to finance the pensions of its retirees, in hopes of narrowing the nation's largest financing gap in a private pension fund.
In one of many wrinkles, the complex deal, which was worked out with one Federal agency but still requires the approval of another, would allow G.M. to more easily sell all or part of Electronic Data Systems. For months, rumors have circulated on Wall Street that G.M. is seeking to unload E.D.S., the information technology subsidiary it acquired in 1984. 
 At the end of 1993, G.M. estimated that it had set aside $22.3 billion less than required to pay the pensions for its future retirees. Since then, G.M. has set aside another $1.9 billion, and rising interest rates have further reduced the liability. G.M. has said it intends to finance its pensions fully by the end of the decade.
 The new proposal applies to G.M.'s most underfinanced pension plan, which covers more than 600,000 active and retired hourly workers.

 
 
Revision of Earlier Plan
 In November, G.M. announced a plan to contribute a vast chunk of one class of its common stock to pay for pensions, pending Government approval. But after negotiations with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal agency that insures some private pension plans, G.M. arrived at the proposal announced today, which includes $4 billion of cash and a slightly smaller number of the shares, 177 million instead of 185 million.
The value of the G.M. class E shares is tied to the performance of Electronic Data Systems. The stock's closing price today was $33.75, down $1.50. Based on that price, the value of the contribution would be $5.97 billion.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who oversees the pension agency and who announced the agreement in Washington today, said it would be the largest private pension contribution in history. But Mr. Reich also called the extent of underfinancing by corporations nationally, which he said grew from $27 billion in 1987 to $53 billion in 1992, a "very dangerous trend."
While the plan has the support of one pension regulator, G.M. must still receive waivers from another arm of the Department of Labor, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. Mr. Reich oversees that office, but officials there insisted that their approval was not a foregone conclusion. The approval process is likely to take months, the officials said.
"We've still got to wait for the important waiver," said Catherine J. Baker, an industry analyst in Boston who follows G.M.'s class E stock for Cowen & Company, a brokerage firm. She said that while she rated the stock a buy despite the pension contribution, "I would prefer as a holder of the G.M.E. stock that it didn't go through."
 
 
 
Stock Price Might Suffer
 G.M. announced that United States Trust would act as trustee for the stock once G.M. made the contribution, with responsibility for maximizing the shares' value. But, Ms. Baker said, the arrival of so many new shares on the market through the pension plan would inevitably put pressure on the price -- unless G.M. is planning to sell E.D.S., she said, in which case class E shareholders would benefit from the contribution.
According to the proposal, G.M. will contribute $2 billion in cash by the time it makes the stock contribution and will pay the remaining $2 billion by October 1995. G.M. will also continue to make its regularly required annual payments, which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation estimated would total $8 billion by the end of 1996.
In return, G.M. sought and received from the Federal pension agency an important benefit: E.D.S. was freed from any liability for G.M.'s pensions, making the unit more attractive to buyers should G.M. decide to sell it.
"We wanted to have that flexibility with respect to E.D.S.," said Heidi Kunz, treasurer of G.M. Ms. Kunz would not comment on whether G.M. intended to sell the subsidiary.
 
 
 
Rumors of a Sale
 G.M. paid $2.5 billion for E.D.S. in 1984. Simply on the basis of the class E stock's value, the subsidiary is now worth more than $16 billion. Since the unit generates little cash for G.M. -- its gains go to dividends, or else back to E.D.S. -- selling all of it, or selling part of it to a strategic partner, would be a quick way to strengthen G.M.'s balance sheet. Various large telecommunications companies -- most recently AT&T and Sprint -- have been rumored to be interested.
Some industry analysts see the stock contribution as the first step in an elaborate plan to sell E.D.S. The problem G.M. faces is that the capital gains taxes on an outright sale would be prohibitive, industry analysts said. But if the pension fund sold the shares, the fund would apparently pay no capital gains taxes.
To make the pension fund contribution, G.M. requires waivers from at least two provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Federal law that governs pensions. Under that law, no more than 10 percent of a pension plan's assets may be in the employer's stock. Further, a pension plan may hold no more than 25 percent of any class of the employer's stock.
The 177 million shares represent 37 percent of all class E stock and would raise to 25 percent the amount of the plan's assets consisting of G.M. stock.
In addition to those waivers, G.M. is lobbying Congress for legislation that would free it from a 10 percent excise tax related to the stock contribution.

HEADLINE: In Twist, Consumer Group And F.C.C. Back Cable TV

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
So much for convergence the idea that the telephone, television and computer industries will work together to build futuristic information networks that offer everything from movies on demand to video games.
Less than two months after most cable television and telephone companies abandoned their mating frenzy, the cable industry has declared war and begun a major legal campaign to delay phone-company plans to enter the television business anytime soon. 
 In a surprising twist, moreover, cable operators are getting a sympathetic hearing from the Federal Communications Commission, the same regulatory agency that in February ordered cable systems to roll back prices by a total of 17 percent.
Perhaps even stranger, the cable industry's main lobbying group has teamed up with the Consumer Federation of America, the nonprofit organization that led the political campaign in Congress for strict regulation of cable rates.
In a barrage of legal challenges filed around the country, the cable industry is arguing that telephone companies should be blocked from building video networks until the F.C.C. imposes elaborate new rules. The coordinated effort is part of a strategy developed by the National Cable Television Association.
"The telephone industry is seeking the opportunity to finance their infrastructure investment on the backs of ratepayers," said Decker Anstrom, president of the cable association. "We have a very simple view of all this: rules first, and then applications."
Phone companies have filed nearly two dozen proposals with the F.C.C. to build video networks around the country, which would carry television and other new services in addition to regular telephone conversations. The cable industry argues that phone companies are trying to finance their ventures at the expense of ordinary phone customers, who may end up with higher bills and services they may not want.
On Tuesday, California cable operators petitioned the F.C.C. to investigate efforts by the Pacific Telesis Group to build an advanced video network in several California cities where Pacific Telesis provides phone service. In New Jersey, the National Cable Television Association has called for a Federal investigation of Bell Atlantic over what it describes as unauthorized efforts to lay optical fibers that are ultimately intended for use in a video network.
In the next few days, the New England Cable Television Association is expected to ask the F.C.C. to delay the Southern New England Telephone Company's plan to build a video network in Connecticut.
 
Want Some Regulation
 These efforts may not be successful. But they demonstrate that despite lip service throughout the communications industry for unfettered competition between different industries, the individual industries are still interested in preserving their traditional regulatory protections. Many cable companies are eager to enter the telephone business, an effort that phone companies have frequently delayed through their own maneuvering on regulation.
In fact, telephone executives are now arguing that the cable television industry is merely stalling for time. "The cable industry's agenda is to hold us off as long as they can so that they can continue to make money and prepare themselves for competition," said Ward White, vice president of the United States Telephone Association.
In any case, the chairman of the F.C.C., Reed E. Hundt, is listening to the cable industry's arguments. It was Mr. Hundt who infuriated the cable industry by getting the agency to approve rate cuts on Feb. 22, a move that helped derail some of the biggest proposed alliances between cable and telephone companies. But now he is raising some of the same concerns as the cable industry.
"These are not questions to be taken lightly," Mr. Hundt said in an interview on Tuesday. He said that he strongly supported fair competition between the cable and telephone industries, but that he remained concerned about the potential for the phone companies to use their monopoly position unfairly. "We want to make sure that telephone ratepayers are not subsidizing the telephone companies' entry into the video business," he said.
 
The Opposing Arguments
 The telephone companies argue that there are already rules in place to insure that they do not use money from their regulated phone rates to subsidize unregulated activities like Yellow Pages advertising or cellular telephone services. Those rules could simply be applied to the new video networks, the phone companies contend.
But lobbyists for the cable industry say they want to be sure the that telephone companies properly account for their costs. The biggest dispute is over whether telephone companies will treat most of their investment in video networks as simply a modernization of phone services. That might mean that the costs could be rolled into regulated phone rates, the cable companies fear.
In recent weeks, the F.C.C. has begun asking telephone companies to describe their plans in greater economic detail and offer further evidence that they would not be using ratepayers to subsidize their video efforts. In letters to Bell Atlantic and to Ameritech, the regional Bell company serving Midwestern states, the agency asked for information on their projections on revenue and on issues like the payback period the companies anticipated on their investments in video services.
Thus far, telephone companies around the country have filed 23 applications with the F.C.C. to deliver television programming under a regulatory framework that the agency adopted two years ago, known as video dial tone. Under those rules, a phone company can build a video network and sell its capacity to others, though it cannot own or even package its own programming.
But Congress is considering legislation that would lift the programming restriction, and most of the Bell companies are building video networks with that in mind.
In Chicago, for example, Ameritech has proposed hooking up 1.2 million homes by the end of 1995. Pacific Bell would link up nearly 1.3 million homes in four cities by the end of 1996. Bell Atlantic wants to hook up more than one million people in Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey. Nynex, which serves New York and New England, is conducting some limited trials but has not yet announced plans for new services.
Brad Stillman, legislative counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, said the F.C.C. must first adopt strict rules on how these networks would be financed. "We don't want telephone ratepayers to bear the cost of building out the network," he said. In some of the applications, he said, "they are giving hypothetical architectures, hypothetical costs, and we have no idea how much it's going to cost."
So far the F.C.C. has approved only five video-dial-tone applications, and those approvals are only for limited experiments. Virtually all the other applications call for permanent television operations, and it is these applications that the cable and consumer groups have opposed.
Mr. Hundt said he strongly supported the concept of head-to-head competition between telephone and cable companies and has organized a team of senior staff people to sort out the policy issues. But he also said that the commission needed new rules to regulate the way in which it allowed phone companies to proceed.

HEADLINE: In Vallone's Hands

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
With Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's $31.6 billion budget before the City Council, its fate now depends largely on the leadership skills of Speaker Peter F. Vallone and on how he positions himself in negotiations between a Republican Mayor, whose core values he shares, and the Democratic City Council.
Like Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Vallone, a Democrat from Astoria, Queens, has long appealed to middle-class constituents and championed quality-of-life services like police, schools and sanitation. The next two months of wrangling over the plan will test whether Mr. Vallone can deliver a budget similar to Mr. Giuliani's in the face of concerns among many minority lawmakers that the cuts Mr. Giuliani is proposing would fall particularly hard on their constituents. 
Mr. Vallone, with the good-humored adeptness of a practiced legislative leader, left all his options open yesterday. Sprawled in a red leather chair in his City Hall office, he signaled his basic agreement with the direction Mr. Giuliani had taken by speaking of how much the Mayor had adopted the Council's own priorities. He particularly singled out Mr. Giuliani's support for police strength.
 
Warning to Commissioners
 But then he added a warning -- possibly leaving an opening for a legislative revolt -- that Mr. Giuliani's budget is far too vague about how cutting the municipal work force by 15,000 would affect city services. The Council expects to get details from the Mayor's commissioners in hearings beginning tomorrow. "They are going to have to be very forthcoming with us," he said. "You can't come in and tell us everything is going to be rosy if it's not going to be rosy."
Even as he spoke, some lawmakers in the 22-member black and Hispanic caucus huddled to hammer out their own position on the budget to be delivered at a news conference today. Councilwoman Virginia C. Fields, who attended the session, said the lawmakers were concerned about the education budget, social services, the hospital system and the work force reductions.
The job cuts, she said, "are a major issue for us because they buy into a philosophy many of us do not support: that government has to be reduced for job growth and the economy to move forward."
Other members were trying to determine whether the balance of power in a Council that has been strongly controlled by Mr. Vallone had changed because of antagonism toward Mr. Giuliani among some black members on the Council. And they questioned whether those dynamics would drive Mr. Vallone to accommodate calls to find substantial savings in the Police Department to restore funds for social programs.
 
'It's a New Era'
 "While we think we understand the sense of the body, on an issue like this, I don't know," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman, the Finance Committee chairman. "It's a new era, a Republican Mayor, a Democratic legislature, a large segment of the Council that feels offended by the new Mayor. It's too early to see how that works out."
The Council has had control over the budget only since 1990, when a new City Charter eliminated the Board of Estimate. During a heated budget battle with Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1991, Mr. Vallone threatened to develop a Council budget from scratch. But in fact, over the past four years the Council has changed the executive budget only at the margins: normally altering about $100 million of the $30 billion budget each year.
But the minority caucus has enough votes in the 51-member Council to swing the budget debate and could force bolder action if it works in concert with the Council's five white liberals. "If the caucus holds together they could change the budget," said City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat.
While no one expects an open rupture among Council Democrats, lawmakers said that if the caucus held together as a bloc it could confront Mr. Vallone asking for restorations in social programs and cuts from the Police Department.
Others believed any confrontation was unlikely. Mr. Vallone traditionally exerts very tight control over the budget process, demanding the loyalty and votes of his members once he and his finance committee negotiate a deal with the Mayor.
Members who cross him know they will pay immediate consequences -- such as the disappearance of the funds each member is allotted for pet programs in their districts.
Mr. Vallone already has many members of the caucus in key leadership positions, and he has been moving quietly over the past few months to strengthen his influence over possible dissenters. In late March he announced the appointment of four caucus members to chairmanships of new subcommittees -- which come with extra money.
Further strengthening Mr. Vallone's hand in the budget battle is a Council vote scheduled for today on a bill that would allow Council hearings on any major effort by the Mayor to turn over government service to private contractors.
The Council is expected to pass the bill by a margin large enough to override a veto. The confrontation over the bill is expected to be heated and noisy enough, some Council aides said, that any black lawmakers who feel that it is good politics in their districts to oppose the Mayor can do it on the privatization bill instead of the budget.
Mr. Vallone said yesterday that, as ever, he expects lawmakers to pass a budget by the end of June, in time for the new fiscal year. "This is serious stuff and we understand we have to come together as a Council," he said. "Otherwise we have anarchy."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Begins A State Visit To Germany

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, May 11

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia began a three-day state visit to Germany today, pushing hard on several fronts with his friend Helmut Kohl for more respectful and dignified treatment of his battered but still great-power country.
"Dear Boris" and "my friend Helmut" hugged each other warmly in bright spring sunshine, but there was tough diplomatic bargaining nonetheless. 
 Mr. Yeltsin offered Russian support for a permanent seat for Germany in the United Nations Security Council, "if it is expanded."
In response, Chancellor Kohl gave German support for the full inclusion of Russia in the group of the world's most powerful industrial democracies after the economic summit meeting in Naples this summer.
Mr. Kohl, who insisted in 1985 that President Ronald Reagan visit a German military cemetery that included the graves of Waffen SS soldiers, diplomatically gave way to Mr. Yeltsin's objections to a ceremony for departing Russian troops this summer in the eastern German city of Weimar. The Russians felt that it would invite comparisons between their 49-year occupation of eastern Germany and the cruelty of the nearby Nazi concentration camp in Buchenwald.
 
New Invitation Planned
 "There will be one event, which will take place in Berlin," Mr. Kohl said at a news conference with the Russian leader this afternoon. It will take place in Mr. Yeltsin's presence on Aug. 31, the German leader said, "in a respectful, dignified way and a friendly atmosphere."
Deploring the fact that the Weimar proposal had somehow been misunderstood, Mr. Kohl said that all he had wanted was to invite the Russian leader to join him in paying tribute to the traditions symbolized by Weimar as a cultural and political capital, where the Constitution of the short-lived Weimar Republic was proclaimed after World War I, and that he would invite Mr. Yeltsin back later to do so.
At the news conference, Mr. Yeltsin did not bring up previous suggestions that Russian troops should be included in military parades for the British, French and American soldiers who defended West Berlin in the midst of Communist territory until unification in 1990. All allied troops will leave Berlin by the summer, and a separate ceremony will be held for them on Sept. 8.
Nor did Mr. Kohl yield today to his guest's insistence on special treatment as a condition of joining the "partnership for peace" offered by NATO leaders at their summit meeting in Brussels in January. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and some other formerly Communist countries accepted the partnership reluctantly as a possible first step toward full membership in NATO for themselves, something Russia objects to strongly as a threat to its security.
 
Alliance 'Indispensable'
 "The Atlantic Alliance remains indispensable for us Germans as the guarantee of our security, but also as an anchor of stability for all Europe," the German Chancellor told Mr. Yeltsin at a state dinner in the Petersberg guest house. It sits on a hilltop across the Rhine where Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Britain and Hitler talked in the period leading up to the Munich Agreement of 1938, which led to the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.
Because of American fears that excluding the Russians could encourage nationalist militancy and weaken Mr. Yeltsin in a time of economic and political fragility, the NATO offer was extended to all formerly Communist countries in Europe, including Russia, on an equal basis.
Perhaps acting under pressure from the nationalist bloc in the Russian Parliament headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian Government has not yet accepted. Mr. Yeltsin said today that Russia should be treated differently because of its size and great military strength.
And in a brief interview, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev would explain Russia's proposals when he visited NATO headquarters in Brussels on May 25. They are thought to involve a bigger role for the 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has neither the military might nor the decision-making ability of the alliance.
 
A Plea to Industrialists
 At the dinner tonight, Mr. Yeltsin said, "It is unbecoming to split Europe into zones of greater and lesser security."
During his visit here, accompanied by his wife, Naina Y. Yeltsina, the Russian leader will visit Mr. Kohl's home in Oggersheim, near Ludwigshafen, and see the Romanesque cathedral in Speyer, where some of the German Holy Roman Emperors are buried.
Mr. Yeltsin will also press German industrialists in Stuttgart on Friday to invest more money in helping Russia become a market economy. Last year, there was just $18 million of private German investment there, while Russian businesses pumped 10 times as much, $181.5 million, into Germany.

Poor Auction Demand Pushes Up Bond Yields

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond yields surged yesterday, as the second leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding drew less demand than expected and the auction of the new 10-year note went poorly.
Expectations of another rise in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve and caution ahead of the release of two key inflation reports today and tomorrow also helped push prices lower and yields higher. 
 After a surprisingly successful three-year note auction on Tuesday, when retail interest caused many in the market to conclude that small investors were ready to do some serious buying, the results of the 10-year sale were sobering, leading some to believe that conclusions drawn on Tuesday may be premature.
Frank Sannella, an analyst with Technical Data, said yesterday's poor showing at the 10-year note auction hit the market hard.
After the results of the disappointing Treasury auction were released in the afternoon, the yield on the 30-year bond spiked 14 basis points, to 7.65 percent, before finishing down 13/32 of a point, to 848/32 for a yield of 7.60 percent. That was up from 7.49 percent on Tuesday.
In an effort to sell the new 10-year note, dealers had lowered the price by late in the day so much that the yield jumped to 7.40 percent. The 7.36 percent average yield at the auction was the highest since May 1992, when the yield was 7.53 percent.
 
 
Limited Upside
 "The upside to the market remains limited until there is a clearer picture of the economy and the Fed uncertainty is out of the way," Mr. Sannella said. "I expect the market's bias will continue down for the remainder of the week or until the Fed takes some action."
In early trading, the bond market showed little reaction to the German Bundesbank's cut of its discount and Lombard rates by 50 basis points, to 4.50 percent and 6 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Price jumps in precious metals pushed the Commodity Research Bureau index up 1.84 points, to 226.78. The index, a closely watched basket of commodities, is viewed as a forward look at inflation pressures.
Traders said there was still uncertainty among Fed watchers over whether the Fed would raise its short-term interest rate target by 25 or 50 basis points. But they said the market prices seemed to have already discounted a half-point increase into the Federal funds rate over the near term and an end-of-year funds rate in the area of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent.
 
 
Economists Are Divided
 A recent survey conducted by MMS International shows a split among economists on the outlook for what the Fed will do next. The Fed's policy making group meets next Tuesday.
According to the survey, only 57 percent are forecasting a half of a percentage point increase in the Federal funds rate, which is now 3.75 percent, while the while the other 43 percent expect a quarter of a point increase.
In the municipal market, the largest negotiated sale of the day was $176 million of park revenue bonds issued by the Los Angeles County Public Works Financing Authority through Lazard Freres & Company.
The issue, rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, was initially priced to yield a maximum 6.439 percent for a bond due in 2015.
Elsewhere, S.& P. announced yesterday that it was dropping the debt rating on about $2.7 billion of Denver International Airport bonds by three grades, to BB, or junk bond status, from BBB.
The rating agency cited continuing difficulties with the baggage system that has made it impossible to predict when the airport would be able to open, a situation that could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments. Ernie Perez, an analyst with S.& P., said that "the airport debt is not in danger of imminent default."
 
 
'No Viable Backup System'
 He added: "That no viable backup system is in place while they try to de-bug the existing system is a main concern to us. They haven't even put together a team to work on it. And we don't know what the final cost will be in fixing it."
S.& P. said the developing outlook on the rating reflects the possibility that the rating could be raised or lowered in the next one to three years depending on the effects and duration of the delay, including the costs to correct the baggage system.
Following are the results of the 10-year auction:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops as the Fed Fails To Increase Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve took no action to push up short-term American interest rates.
Traders sold dollars through the day as it became clear that the Fed would not act yesterday. Adding pressure to the dollar was an afternoon selloff in the bond market after weak demand in the auction of 10-year Treasury notes. 
 The steady selling of dollars erased gains made after the German central bank lowered both its key interest rates by half a percentage point, larger than the cuts expected.
"The Fed has been disappointing currency traders for days now," said Koichi Takenaka, assistant vice president at Industrial Bank of Japan in New York. "We keep expecting the Fed to do something with rates to support the dollar and bonds."
 
Rises, Then Falls
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6690 German marks, down from 1.6731 marks on Tuesday. It rose as high as 1.6810 marks just after the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent and lowered its Lombard rate to 6 percent from 6.5 percent.
The dollar also slipped to 104.29 Japanese yen from 104.42 yen. Its retreat followed strong gains on Tuesday, when traders focused on signs that recent support for the dollar by the Clinton Administration represented a shift in exchange-rate policy.
Many currency traders had expected the Fed to push up short-term interest rates after the Bundesbank lowered its key lending rates. A Fed move would have suggested a more strongly coordinated effort to lift the dollar from its recent slump. In one such move on May 4, the Fed, the Bundesbank and other central banks teamed up to buy dollars.
 
Focusing on the Fed
 Higher rates here and lower rates abroad buoy the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
"Any dollar benefit from coordinated interest-rate action depends far more on the Fed than on the Bundesbank," said Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at J. P. Morgan Europe in London.
The Fed is to hold a policy meeting on Tuesday, and many traders expect it to raise short-term interest rates for the fourth time this year.
"The dollar is facing a crisis of confidence," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a consulting firm. "There's a lot of reluctance to park money in U.S. assets right now."
The dollar has fallen as much as 6 percent against the mark and 10 percent against the yen this year as investors sold dollar-denominated assets, and speculators tired of waiting for the dollar to rally.

HEADLINE: G.M. Gives Mexico Its Own 'Chevy'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 11

 BODY:
Passionate purple, nail-polish red and swimming pool aquamarine are colors that a growing number of Mexicans have begun to associate with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As soon as the trade pact took effect on Jan. 1. General Motors de Mexico started importing a cuddly new subcompact car from Spain called Chevy in several psychedelic colors. Its arrival has brightened an otherwise dreary automotive sector. 
 The new car is called the Chevy here, though it is not a traditional Chevrolet and has been sold in Europe as the Opel Corsa. But General Motors decided to go with a familiar nickname to bring a new model to Mexico.
Importing the Chevy is just the first step. By the end of next year, General Motors plans to start producing the car in its Ramos Arizpe plant in the state of Coahuila, which borders Texas. While the company has not talked of exporting Chevys to the United States, that is considered a logical move.
With more than 5,500 sold in Mexico and nearly as many on order by customers, the Chevy may be the most visible symbol of the trade agreement, which lowers tariffs on goods crossing the borders of the United States, Canada and Mexico. G.M. officials said they would not have imported the Chevy into Mexico before the pact, which substantially reduced the restrictions on such imports.
The 5,500 Chevys sold here since January might not sound like a lot in a country of 90 million people, but it is impressive considering that General Motors de Mexico imported just 1,700 vehicles in all of 1993.
The little four-cylinder gas-saver is the most colorful in a wave of more than 10,000 imports that G.M. brought into Mexico during the first quarter of 1994. The other 4,500 or so were manufactured in the United States and Canada, and include Corvettes, Cadillacs, fire-breathing Firebird Trans Ams and bullet-shaped fiberglass Oldsmobile vans.
The influx of imports into Mexico is seen by the American auto makers as proof of what they said last fall: The trade pact would not cost American workers jobs because cars from the United States and Canada would be exported to Mexico while Mexican-made cars came north.
"What Nafta does is allow us to rationalize our production, which means that we'll support the Mexican market by producing the majority of our products here and importing the rest," said Gary L. Henson, president of General Motors de Mexico.
But Steve Beckman, an international economist with the United Automobile Workers union in Washington, said he disagreed. "Looking only at the import side doesn't give you the whole picture of whether or not jobs are being lost," he said.
Mr. Beckman said that while American exports to Mexico had risen, Mexican exports to the United States had grown as rapidly, canceling any benefit to American labor.
 
More Models Available
 Still, the impact of the trade agreement is clear at General Motors showrooms like the one at Chevrolet Aguinaco in Naucalpan, a suburb of Mexico City. The large American-style dealership is loaded with more models than Mexicans have ever seen in a G.M. showroom. Juan De Aguinaco, director general of the company, said imports accounted for almost two-thirds of the increase in sales from last year's first quarter.
"If we could have gotten all the cars we had orders for, we could have sold twice as many as we did." Mr. De Aguinaco said.
From January to the end of March, Mr. De Aguinaco's agency sold 180 Chevys, among the highest for any automobile dealer in Mexico.
With companies in Mexico no longer required to export more than they import, and with lower percentagesfor local manufacturing content, General Motors was able to import the Chevy and enter the lucrative market for first-time car buyers. Until now, the market had been dominated by Volkswagen, which still makes the old-fashioned Beetle here, and Nissan, which manufactures a no-frills sedan called the Tsuru.
 
Costs More Than a Beetle
 The Chevy comes in two models: the basic Joy and the better-equipped Swing. Both are available in two-door and four-door versions, with five-speed manual transmissions and 1.4-liter engines that get about 40 miles a gallon. The Joy costs about $11,000, which is $1,500 to $2,000 more than the Beetle.
Buyers like 27-year-old Cesar Borja of Mexico City are willing to pay the difference because the Chevy is much more powerful, maneuverable and stylish than the Beetle.
"It's modern," said Mr. Borja, who drove up in an old Volkswagen that he hoped to replace with a Chevy Swing. "And on this type of car, these wild colors are fun."
G.M.'s desire to enter the low end of the market with a car for young people is understandable. Sixty percent of Mexico's population is younger than 25. Until it introduced the Chevy, General Motors had not competed for that market segment, not only because Volkswagen was too strong but also because the Mexican Government had limited the number of models that a company could build.
 
More Export Activity
 Because the Chevy comes from Spain for the time being, it is subject to import limitations and a 20 percent Mexican tariff. Cars made in the United States and Canada encounter a smaller tariff of 10 percent that will disappear in 10 years.
The trade pact has prompted other American companies to step up exports. Last month, Ford introduced four models to Mexico, including the redesigned Mustang. Mexicans have long favored and lovingly cared for the older classic Mustangs. Chrysler is also bringing in new models, including the Dodge Intrepid and Jeep Cherokee Sport.
Even with the higher level of imports, the Mexican market for automobiles is still troubled. Domestic sales dropped by 14 percent in the first quarter of this year, even as export sales climbed by nearly 44 percent. The decrease is attributed to a lingering recession, uncertainty caused by several violent incidents in Mexico this year and interest rates as high as 35 percent caused by the defense of the peso by the central bank of Mexico.

Air Products' Charge Set

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ALLENTOWN, Pa., May 11

 BODY:
Air Products and Chemicals Inc. said today that it would take an after-tax charge of $60 million, because of derivatives contracts it entered into with the Bankers Trust New York Corporation
The company, which produces industrial gases, entered into five interest-rate swaps with Bankers Trust between October and December last year. The swaps were bets that United States and European interest rates would remain stable and were "leveraged," meaning that profits, or losses, could multiply very quickly. 
 Air Products' loss on its swaps will reduce net income to $13 million, or 12 cents a share, the company said. Without the charge, earnings would have been 65 cents a share, it said.
The company's stock fell 75 cents today, to $39.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Air Products' loss is the latest in a series of setbacks companies have suffered in derivatives trades with Bankers Trust. Procter & Gamble said last month that it had lost $102 million after tax on a leveraged swap with Bankers Trust, the biggest loss on interest-rate swaps by a United States industrial company.
Gibson Greetings Inc. said it had lost $19.7 million and the Mead Corporation announced a $7.4 million loss on swaps last month.
The company "will absolutely not" do any more leveraged swaps, and senior managers will keep a closer watch on the types of trades carried out by treasury executives, said Kevin Ramundo, an Air Products spokesman.
Air Products, which employs 14,000 people, has used swaps for some years to guard against swings in interest rates that could raise the cost of servicing its $1.3 billion in debt, Mr. Wagner said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Looking ahead, an industry group rethinks its meeting venue.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
CHANGE is slow in coming to the advertising industry. But as the American Association of Advertising Agencies begins its annual meeting, there are palpable signs that there is indeed change.
For one thing, the Four A's, as the industry organization is known, is taking steps to modernize the meeting, which started yesterday at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. 
 The agenda includes forward-looking sessions on reinventing and re-engineering the nation's agencies and the future of commercial communication. References to this being the 76th annual meeting are being played down in favor of the fresher-sounding phrase, "the 1994 annual meeting."
And the entertainment at the black-tie dinner tomorrow, which usually runs to performers of a certain era like the comedian Rich Little, will be the Capitol Steps, a group from Washington that fashions today's headlines into song parodies that mock high-profile figures like President Clinton and the conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.
But perhaps the most notable indication of change is a declaration by O. Burtch Drake, who was named the president and chief executive of the association in January.
"The Greenbrier is no longer a sacred cow," Mr. Drake said in a telephone interview from his office in New York before the meeting.
The frequency at which the annual meetings are held there "is a subject that will be renewed after this meeting," he said, adding that it was "the most black-and-white issue" among the members of the Four A's.
The Greenbrier serves as the meeting site every third year; in between, there is a meeting in the South and one in the West. While it is "a first-class resort," Mr. Drake said of the Greenbrier, it is "always a difficult draw."
"It's very expensive and very hard to get to," he added. "We virtually can't get anybody from California to come to the Greenbrier because it's impossible to get there."
The Greenbrier is tucked away in the Allegheny Mountains of southeastern West Virgina, about 50 miles northwest of Roanoke, Va., the nearest large city. Its inaccessibility is typical of the grand resorts that executives once used as getaways.
About 400 people are expected to attend the meeting, which runs through Saturday, down from earlier estimates of 430. As recently as 1990, before the recession hit the industry, the annual meeting drew 627 people in Palm Desert, Calif.
To be sure, the issue of where to hold an annual meeting looms small compared with the industry's most pressing problems, ranging from the fraying ties between consumers and name-brand advertised products to the increasing difficulty agencies have in building long-lasting, stable relationships with clients.
Yet in a field in which perception is often reality, the selection of a meeting site can take on larger significance. That is particularly true when the disaffection with the genteel Greenbrier goes beyond issues like cost and location.
The remote resort has, in effect, become a symbol of a reluctance, even a resistance, to change among the industry's leading executives.
Part of that is attributable to the Greenbrier's old-fashioned atmosphere. The last time the Four A's met there, in 1991, signs were still posted in the hallways at night advising quiet because "it's sleepy time down South."
And part of that stems from the favor the Greenbrier finds among those who once dominated the industry, the older top executives of the big agencies based in New York. By extension, it has become synonymous with a time when those men ruled advertising, much to the dismay of women and members of minorities, as well as executives of smaller agencies and those from agencies in the Midwest, West and Northwest.
"There are people who love the Greenbrier and think it's the finest resort in America," Mr. Drake said. "But there are people who think it sends all the wrong signals, that we're a bunch of old stodgy guys in green pants standing around with drinks in our hands."
Mr. Drake said the 77th annual meeting of the Four A's, to be held next April, would be at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando, Fla.
"We're going to Disney World," he added, laughing. "It's a sign of a change of the times."
At a business session yesterday, the Four A's board, in its annual election of officers, voted as expected for Edward L. Wax, chairman and chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide in New York, to become the chairman for 1994-95. Mr. Wax, who has been vice chairman for 1993-94, will succeed Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, who has served as the chairman for 1993-94.
Mr. Wax, in brief remarks, said he would focus on three issues during his tenure: advocating the effectiveness of advertising, protecting "the right to commercial free speech," and promoting "the value of advertising agencies."
Burt Manning, chairman and chief executive of the J. Walter Thompson Company in New York, was elected vice chairman for 1994-95. That places him in line to succeed Mr. Wax and become the chairman for 1995-96.
The session ended on a light note when, as Eric Mower, chairman and chief executive of Eric Mower & Associates in Syracuse, delivered the treasurer's report, the Eastern Greenbrier Junior High School's wind ensemble marched through the room playing "We're in the Money."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Things were fine until the Fed's foray, a Nobel laureate says.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE economy is perking right along, but growth is still modest by the benchmark of other recoveries. A handful of commodity prices are inching up, but there is no evidence that self-sustaining inflation driven by wages is in the works. The President is a Democrat, but on the critical issues of taxation, spending and regulation he is acting more like a deficit-fearing pre-Reagan conservative.
Why, then, have the bond markets reacted so perversely to what the Federal Reserve labeled a long range pre-emptive strike against inflation? And why have the big central banks had to intervene repeatedly to stabilize the dollar against the mark and yen, just when the interest-rate advantage to holding assets in dollars is rising?
Some would point to President Clinton's flat-footed policies toward Japan and China, which have unsettled major trade relationships. And some fear that the Democrats will revert to free-spending form, once they come to their liberal senses. But a more plausible explanation for the markets' jumpiness is offered by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics who advised President John F. Kennedy. "The markets are fighting the last war," he argues, behaving as if the inflation of 1979 is just around the corner. 
 In the view of some very respectable economists Washington has already gone too far. The Fed's initial moves to raise short-term interest rates in February, Mr. Tobin insists, were at best premature and, arguably, based on spurious evidence of inflation in the making.
Commodity prices always edge up during economic recoveries, he points out, just as they go down during recessions. What would have been worrying (and is nowhere in sight) was a sign that wages were rising in response to the increased demand for labor, creating the conditions for cost-push inflation. And while it is true that the tighter the labor market, the greater the risk of bottlenecks that would generate cost pressures, Mr. Tobin insists that "Alan Greenspan doesn't know where this 'natural rate' of unemployment is, any more than I do."
Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard who advised President Jimmy Carter, shares Mr. Tobin's skepticism about the Fed's stance. The pervasive sense that foreigners are ready and eager to take a chunk of America's markets, he notes, makes employers more resistant to wage demands and workers less militant than in past recoveries.
Just how much the slack product markets in Europe and Japan and the fierce competition from low-wage Mexicans, Brazilians and Chinese have reduced labor's moxie is a matter of conjecture. But Neal Soss, chief economist for CS First Boston, speculates that it is in the range of half a percentage point, leaving the economy with room to fill perhaps another million jobs before labor shortages become an issue.
The opinion that the Fed has overshot is also reportedly held by some members of the Administration. But their voices have been muted, perhaps because there is little expectation that tighter credit will actually choke off growth. Mr. Cooper wonders, though, whether the sanguine assumption that all the Fed has really done is to stretch out the recovery is correct. Some forecasts, he points out, suggest that a "growth recession" -- a period of positive growth but at a rate insufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor force -- will set in before the 1996 election.
To be sure, the majority view among economists is still that both the timing and the size of the Fed's increases in interest rates were prudent. "The main point is that the economy isn't very far from full employment," said Benjamin Friedman of Harvard. But whether the Fed's initiative was good policy or overkill, it remains a puzzle why the bond and currency markets have been behaving as if double-digit inflation is just around the corner.
Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, thinks that the problem is largely one of presentation rather than policy. "Short-term rates always go up in this stage of the business cycle," he said. "What's new is that the Fed is talking about it."
The Fed's idea, presumably, was to get the maximum anti-inflation bang from the minimum tightening of credit from its new show of openness. But the psychological spin apparently was reversed, with the markets assuming that the Fed's break with precedent was evidence the financial gnomes were concealing the really bad news.
Still to be seen is how the tempest over bond rates and the dollar will play out in economic growth and employment. It will not feed back to change the Government's behavior, Mr. Gordon argued, since the Fed has already gone about as far as it will go on interest rates and the White House is bound to a passive fiscal policy by the deficit reduction law.
Mr. Tobin is not-so-quietly worried, though, that what he sees as the Fed's bumbling foray against a remote threat of inflation will do great damage to businesses that need cheap capital to grow. "The markets just aren't sophisticated about economics," he laments.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall in Computer-Driven Trading; Dow Drops 27.37

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market declined yesterday in computer-driven trading, following a sharp rise in long-term interest rates when the Government experienced more difficulty than stock or bond traders had expected in selling the new 10-year Treasury note.
Higher interest rates cut the value of current bonds, raise borrowing costs for corporations and thus hurt their stocks, as well as slow the overall rate of economic expansion. 
 Blue chips like Motorola and General Electric, widely held utilities like Ameritech, and oil companies like Exxon, all fell. High-technology stocks were especially hurt, including Microsoft and Novell. Computer disk-drive makers like Conner Peripherals and Seagate Technology fell over concern of an industry price war.
William R. Rothe, managing director for Nasdaq trading at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., said high-technology stocks tended to rise or fall faster than the general market, and were known as "high beta" stocks. "They may be the first to go to when traders look for liquidity and want to cash out their stocks," he said.
Despite a normal volume of 277.4 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, traders suspect that many Wall Street firms are still on the sidelines and that computer trading accounted for much of yesterday's action. Traders may be waiting for the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates as well as for the Government this morning to release the producer price index, a closely watched gauge of inflation.
"It was pretty quiet around here," said William Lord, vice president-trading for UBS Securities Inc. "I don't know how much of today's volume was machines and not humans, but there must have been a fair amount of machines."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.37 points, to 3,629.04, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 4.52 points, to 441.49. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which has a heavy concentration of technology stocks, fell 8 points, to 717.
 
Decliners Outpace Advancers
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.43 points, to 244.51, while the number of declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,550 to 672. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined 2.02 points, to 433.17.
Much of this week's stock market volatility is linked to the turmoil in the international currency markets. The dollar rose sharply Tuesday but ended a little lower in New York yesterday, despite a half of a percentage point cut in key German interest rates. The interest rate cut could make the the dollar a more attractive investment for many investors, especially if the Federal Reserve follows with another rate increase soon.
Bond traders yesterday had expected slight demand for the new 10-year Treasury notes and therefore a quite expensive average yield of 7.34 percent at the auction. But demand was even less, and the average yield was even pricier at 7.36 percent. Yield on the 30-year bond soared to 7.60 percent, up 11 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
As soon as the auction results were announced at 1:42 P.M., the stock market's high-speed computer-guided trading kicked into full force, selling hundreds of stocks. The Dow fell more than 20 points in 15 minutes, but at no time were the New York Stock Exchange's anti-program trading "circuit-breaker" rules required, because the Dow did not fall more than 50 points.
Of the 30 stocks of the Dow industrials, 20 fell, led by General Electric, which fell 1 7/8, to 93 1/8, on no discernible news, except for continuing legal troubles of Joseph Jett, the ousted bond trader at G.E.'s troubled Kidder, Peabody unit.
Of the 500 stocks of the S.& P. 500, 343 fell, led by G.E. and also Philip Morris, which fell 1 5/8, to 47 5/8, after a Wheat First Butcher & Singer analyst cut his assessment of seven tobacco stocks, including Philip Morris.
The most active stock yesterday was Perrigo, one of the most active stocks Tuesday, when management of the nonprescription pharmaceutical concern announced that fourth-quarter sales may not reach expectations. Perrigo's volume was 8.6 million shares.

Streisand Opens American Tour With Optimism

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Near the close of Barbra Streisand's frequently thrilling concert on Tuesday evening, she hit the opening notes of "Happy Days Are Here Again," the first song on the first album she recorded. In her famous 1962 interpretation, the bouncy little proclamation of good times was slowed down and interpreted as the hysterical cry of a woman who disbelieved every word she was forcing herself to sing.
This time, at the 14,000-seat USAir Arena in Landover, Md., the song was rehabilitated into an upbeat pop anthem accompanied by a slide show illustrating reasons for her optimism. Newspaper headlines with announcements like "Roe v. Wade Upheld" were interwoven with pictures of Ms. Streisand's heroes, from the Clintons to Nelson Mandela. The number was followed by Ms. Streisand's only speech of the evening, a defense of Hollywood that stressed the movie industry's importance to the economy and its sense of moral responsibility in turning out movies about the Holocaust and AIDS. 
 But music, thank goodness, not politics was the show's main order of business. And Ms. Streisand, who ended her long absence from public performance on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, displayed a voice near the peak of its form.
It has been three decades since she made her reputation as a modern-day Fanny Brice with Judy Garland's wounded heart. Now, as then, she has simply to open her mouth, and out comes a sound that is beautiful, though edged with a whine, and that conveys a primal mixture of yearning and driving ambition. Interpretive ideas aren't what make the singing so compelling, but rather raw, needy emotion guided by a dramatic instinct that infuses everything with an operatic intensity.
But if Ms. Streisand's voice is as strong as it ever was, her perspective has changed. In evolving from an insecure teen-age diva into Hollywood royalty, she has exchanged her girlish hysteria and spontaneity for a measured regality. The hyperemotionalism remains palpable, but it is under control to the point that Ms. Streisand can look back with some affection and humor at the brash, stage-struck kook from Brooklyn she used to be.
Tuesday's concert, the first American date on a tour that will take her to Detroit, Los Angeles, San Jose, and New York (June 20, 23 and 26 at Madison Square Garden) over the next month and a half, was a lavish, rather formal retrospective in which the lighter moments had the feel of a playful therapy session.
During the first half of the show, moving about an elegant living-room set that she said was suggested by Monticello, Ms. Streisand conversed with three unseen "therapists." In one clever bit of film editing, Dr. Susan Lowenstein, the psychiatrist she portrayed in "The Prince of Tides," fielded complaints from several of the nuttier characters from her other films. The most charming interaction between stage and screen had her singing "I'll Know" with her teen-age idol, Marlon Brando, shown in a film clip from "Guys and Dolls." In the most sentimental interaction, she serenaded a series of growing-up pictures of her son, Jason Gould, with "Not While I'm Around," from "Sweeney Todd."
Musically, the concert was one long romantic symphony of ballads of varying hue, skillfully joined together and augmented with enough bright patter to keep things from dragging. A 64-piece orchestra, led by Marvin Hamlisch, accompanied her, playing handsomely enlarged versions of the original arrangements from her albums.
After a full-blown overture, Ms. Streisand made her entrance singing "As If We Never Said Goodbye," an imposing ballad from the musical "Sunset Boulevard," which established the show's semi-operatic tone. The most memorable vocal performances in the first half included a tender "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man," which showed off Ms. Streisand's too-seldom-heard crooning voice, a soaring "He Touched Me," and a version of "The Man That Got Away" that stood beside the classic Judy Garland version in its sweep and depth of feeling. On the lighter side was "I'm Still Here," from "Follies," for which Stephen Sondheim supplied new custom-written lyrics. (Best line: "I kept my nose to spite my face.")
In the more musically forceful second act, most of the scenery disappeared, except for an overhead screen that flashed then-and-now pictures of the star. A dramatic peak was hit with a suite from the film "Yentl," which the singer belted with a ferocious conviction, at one point singing harmony with her own screen image. It was complemented by a soft, glowing "Lazy Afternoon," from the musical, "The Golden Apple." A slightly jazzy "For All We Know" and a stentorian "Somewhere" ended the show with flourishes that were grand but not overblown.
As Ms. Streisand's recent album "Back to Broadway" showed, she can be her own worst enemy by over- thinking songs, imposing rigid concepts and creating music that sounds so worked-over it becomes remote and frozen. Onstage, where retakes and retouching are impossible, the raw emotion runs free. Barbra in concert is Barbra at her best.

Nixon On 1996

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"'94 will be a great year for non-incumbents," Richard Nixon opined a few months before his death. "People want change. Clinton asked for it; now the country is going to demand it."
But to a man who won four out of five national races, matching F.D.R.'s record, the focus had to be on the national ticket in 1996. 
 "Lamar Alexander would be an excellent President. It's early for him, though. Like Carroll Campbell or Tommy Thompson, he may be V.P."
Nixon then came up with a surprise: "In '96, we should have a woman on the ticket. It doesn't do anything for the Democrats, but would do plenty for Republicans. Not a senator, Hutchison or Kassebaum; has to be a governor. Executive experience."
He grinned at the thought of the New Jersey Governor as Vice President: "Christie Whitman would be a real sleeper on the ticket." He liked the way Governor Whitman, daughter of a Republican State Chairman, rose to a crisis: "She showed great presence during the Rollins flap."
What should she do? "Get to New Jersey's issues -- crime, welfare, drugs. Be progressive but conservative. Travel abroad to get New Jersey business; that's always a good excuse. Then come back and talk to the New York Economic Club."
To the top slot: Is Bob Dole the front-runner? "Yes, and if Dole keeps his voice and his sense of humor, he has a good shot." He thought about that and pointed to my notebook, to make sure I wrote it down: "Dole likes people, you know." I have an underlined note: Dole likes people.
"Kemp has the problem of a young star fading, but he has enthusiastic supporters and that's good. To get over the question about being heavy enough, he has to travel, make himself more of a world figure. No more Johnny-one-note on economics. He's an attractive candidate and has to win an early primary."
Nixon thought Dick Cheney, the Defense Secretary who won a war, was an homme serieux, but was "a beltway candidate"; the approval of the Washington Establishment was a negative.
Pat Buchanan, one of his former speechwriters? "Pat's a true believer. Third party, maybe." He thought Pat likely to split if the Republican Party backed away from its anti-abortion stand, as it must do to win: "On abortion," said Nixon, "the state should stay out of it. Don't subsidize and don't prohibit."
Which brought up William Weld, the conservative but pro-choice Governor of Massachusetts: "He'd win if nominated," said Nixon, perhaps thinking of Nelson Rockefeller in 1960, "but Weld would not be nominated for President at a Republican convention. It's a social thing."
James Baker he dismissed with a glare. Senator Phil Gramm: "Smarter than most, but weak on the tube." I did not ask about Dan Quayle, who had not yet begun his run, but my guess is that Nixon would advise him to forgo a '96 candidacy and make his loyalist mission the keeping of the Christian right behind a Republican centrist -- the mirror image of what centrist Nixon did for far-right Goldwater in '64.
Who's left? "If Pete Wilson survives in California in '94, he will be nominated in '96 and will be a strong candidate," Nixon, the survivor, unequivocally predicted. "He's very good on foreign and defense policy. Been everything -- Mayor, Senator, Governor. A moderate on domestic stuff, but not a mushy moderate."
Colin Powell? "Formidable. Intelligent, tough-minded, sound. But Republicans would want him for the wrong reason, because he's black. Blacks will keep voting liberal because they're poor."
A wild card? "Perot is the Democrats' secret weapon. Gore's victory in debate over Perot on Nafta was good short-term for the Democrats, bad long-term. They need Perot to stay in because two-thirds of his support are Republicans. This time, let him buy his own time, deny him debates."
Would Hillary be a campaign issue? "Leave her alone, she's effective." But Nixon recalled: "When we met, I told her about a ballplayer from Arkansas, 'Arky' Vaughan. But she never heard of him. Can you imagine? Hall of Famer, lifetime batting average .367."
I looked it up afterward; Arky Vaughan, Pittsburgh shortstop, had a lifetime average of .318. We often had to straighten out Nixon's statistics, but on political assessments he was pretty longheaded.

HEADLINE: Package Deal Is Offered to Lure Tourists to Big Apple

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Every New Yorker knows: avoid lines, never pay retail. But visitors stand in line at a lot of places, paying a lot more money. Acknowledging Big Apple sticker shock and the city's innate ability to intimidate, government officials and business and arts leaders have joined for the first time to offer a unified front on tourism.
Here's the deal: a package including two nights at a New York hotel with parking and breakfast, lunch at a high-priced restaurant like Lutece (sorry, no dinner), a ticket to a Broadway show, free admission to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other major arts institutions, and a tour of New York by boat or double-decker bus. 
 All for $199.40 a person, double occupancy, tax included.
The package, which does not include a well-known bridge linking Manhattan and a borough to the east, is being announced today by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a group of business leaders. The idea is to spur tourism, an industry worth more than $14 billion to the city, according to city officials.
The package deal, called NY 94 and available May 15 through Oct. 15, is intended as a first step in redressing what officials characterize as lackluster support for tourism. Sponsors say that cultural institutions like the Met and the Museum of Modern Art -- not to mention Broadway producers -- have never before offered tickets and admissions as part of a tourism promotion.
"This is the first time in my memory that the arts institutions and cultural organizations in the city have combined with the private sector to promote the city of New York," said Martin E. Segal, the former chairman of Lincoln Center, who organized the arts community's involvement.
Participants include 110 restaurants, 52 hotels, 49 cultural institutions and 13 retailers.
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said yesterday that the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau has been "asleep at the wheel." He said that the need for New York to promote itself as a destination has become more critical as the city loses some of its cultural exclusivity: New York is increasingly exporting its cultural offerings, and more and more Broadway shows are getting their starts outside the city.
"But there has been a kind of New York City hubris about tourism," Mr. Dyson said. "Our attractions are so obvious, it was thought you didn't need to sell it. But you need to sell everything more today."
One of the main selling points of the package, organizers say, is that it seeks to quell some of the confusion in a New York holiday by arranging two days of discounted activities and reservations through one toll-free phone number.
The organizing consortium, which consists of hospitality industry executives and state and city government officials, say the full-price value of the $199.40 deal would be $345.06 list price, for a saving of $145.66. There are to be four packages, rising in price to $459.40 a person. That price could include a room at the elegant Mark on the Upper East Side or at the Hilton in midtown, while the $199.40 package would offer one of seven hotels like the Ramada Milford Plaza near Times Square.
All choices depend on availability. If a restaurant or hotel is full, participants would be booked elsewhere at comparable places. Broadway producers have set aside blocks of orchestra seats for the promotion. By generating more business, hotels and restaurants are hoping to benefit from the promotion, which has a total budget of more than $3 million.
New York State has committed $2.2 million, including $1.7 million that would otherwise have been spent on national advertisements for New York City. The city will pay $125,000 to produce a guidebook, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will donate $10,000 for general purposes.
In addition to offering the project discounted meals for $19.94 or free admissions, restaurants, hotels and cultural institutions are being asked to contribute $1 million for advertising and operations. Some $800,000 has so far been pledged, including $18,000 from cultural institutions.
 
Anyone Can Play
 An advertising campaign, to begin today, is focused on the Northeastern states and eastern Canada, partly to persuade day trippers to stay overnight, though anyone, including New Yorkers, can buy a package. Ads are being taken out in newspapers and magazines like Gourmet and People.
The city has considered such a campaign before. Officials at the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau said they had planned a similar promotion four years ago, but had to pull back when money expected from the city hotel tax was not forthcoming. As a result, efforts to promote tourism have centered on trade shows and larger groups.
"We basically have not had our act together," said Tim Zagat, a promotion organizer and publisher of the Zagat Survey of restaurants. "To get New Yorkers to even get down and talk to each other is very hard."
Companies have staged their own promotions revolving around New York with varying success. "Individual companies seldom have the clout to create enough noise to really get attention," said Jonathan Linen, vice chairman of American Express, which has contributed $250,000.
The new tourism effort grew out of the promotion effort for the 1992 Democratic National Convention, during which Broadway performers put on a free lunchtime show; restaurants offered $19.92 lunches, and a fashion show was staged in Bryant Park. The organization behind that campaign, the New York Host Committee, in effect decided to stay intact. The group expanded last year as cultural institutions became involved.
"New York is just vibrant," said Bill Fischer, owner of Fischer Travel Enterprises. "People want to be here. And the money that government commits to it is minimal compared to foreign governments."
 
Occupancy Is Up
 There is some evidence that visits to New York are picking up, as the city inches out of recession.
Hotel room occupancy started edging up last October and has increased each month since, said John A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which tracks the lodging industry. In March hotel occupancy was 69 percent, compared with 64 percent a year earlier.
"In general," Mr. Fox said, "we've seen a good resurgence, and I'm fairly bullish that we'll have a pretty good year."
Jonathan Tisch, president and chief executive officer of Loews Hotels, a participant, is confident there will be plenty of room to handle the hoped-for surge. "We will be able to provide additional rooms from those properties already involved, or from others who may also want to participate."
Organizers are also speaking of an even bigger promotion to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations next year. New York, Mr. Zagat says, could be pitched as the capital of the world, with each nation being honored on a separate day.
Rick Binford, senior vice president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, foresees that his agency will work in similar directions as NY 94. "Everybody believes a strong, sustained, extended tourism effort is healthy for us," he said.
 
 
If You Go. . .
 NY 94, a package deal for New York sponsored by a consortium of businesses and cultural institutions, is offered May 15 to Oct. 15.

HEADLINE: The Making of a Fiasco

BYLINE: By Thomas Carothers; Thomas Carothers, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is author of "In the Name of Democracy: U.S. Policy Toward Latin America in the Reagan Years."

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Scrambling to revive its moribund Haiti policy, the Clinton Administration has decided to rule out a compromise with the country's military leaders and to broaden economic sanctions. The one certain effect of this new policy will be to greatly increase the possibility of U.S. military intervention.
Faced with the tightened embargo, which will go into effect next week, Haiti's rulers will not just throw up their hands and go. They will engage in political maneuvering, like yesterday's installation of the 80-year-old Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint as "provisional president." And they will continue their sickening game of chicken with the United States -- clinging to power as the suffering in Haiti goes from terrible to truly horrifying, betting that the U.S. will lose its stomach for the embargo before it forces them out. 
 As the stalemate intensifies, the choices facing the Clinton Administration will be increasingly stark and agonizing: to admit defeat and call for a lifting of the embargo, to hold tight and bear responsibility for enormous suffering in Haiti with an uncertain prospect of eventual "victory," or to invade. Faced with these choices, the Administration may well go the military route. U.S. Presidents can tolerate only so much defiance from tinpot strongmen before they send in the marines, as George Bush did in Panama in 1989.
Haiti has been a source of tremendous frustration for the Clinton Administration. That frustration inevitably combines with the aggravations in Bosnia, Somalia, North Korea and elsewhere to create a besieged mentality in which some unexpected spark -- a daytime massacre of dozens of Haitians or the killing of a group of foreign relief workers -- could push the President to order an invasion.
Military intervention in Haiti may look like a plausible way out of a perplexing policy dilemma. But a U.S. invasion -- and it would be a U.S. invasion, even if Secretary of State Warren Christopher proves successful in his recent efforts to persuade Latin governments to provide multilateral support afterward -- would be a serious mistake.
The political problem in Haiti is not simply that the military refuses to allow the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's first freely elected President, to return. It is that Haitian society is profoundly polarized between an entrenched business and military elite, some of whom are violently anti-democratic and some of whom are not, and the great mass of ordinary Haitians, who deeply hate the elite and in 1990 chose a leader who promised a fundamental redistribution of power.
A U.S. invasion to "restore democracy" in Haiti, therefore, could not simply aim to pacify the country. It would have to shatter the hold of the violent, anti-democratic members of the elite by eradicating the web of thuggish armed groups that have asserted control across the country. It would then have to be followed by a long-term occupation to check the extremists on both sides and slowly forge a moderate consensus, which has never existed in Haiti. And it would have to be complemented by an extensive and costly long-range assistance program.
These tasks are enormous. Yet if we invade Haiti we will almost certainly do so trying to minimize our mission. Mr. Clinton could persuade the extremely reluctant Joint Chiefs of Staff to move only by assuring them that it will be a short-term pacification action. And Americans are likely to support an invasion only if it is short and painless. Any military action would thus be designed as much to meet constraints at home as to confront the actual challenges in Haiti. Its underlying purpose would be to solve the public relations problem that Haiti has become for the Administration.
Even if the U.S. does invade with a commitment to overseeing a long-term restructuring of Haitian society, it is unclear that we could succeed. We can scarcely point to a track record of American invasions' leading to the transformation of highly underdeveloped countries with few democratic traditions into stable, functioning democracies. Foreign occupations rapidly wear on both the occupiers and the occupied. We might be hailed by Haitians on our way into Port-au-Prince, but we would soon be taking blame for the country's continuing troubles and looking for a way out.
Armed intervention poses problems of principle as well as practice. At root, we have no interest at stake in Haiti so compelling as to warrant unilateral military action. Some people argue that the U.S. should promote democracy abroad by force. But a U.S. invasion of Haiti would not be widely seen as upholding such a principle, and it would not convince the world that the United States would act decisively when elected leaders in other countries were overthrown.
We hardly blinked at the forcible negation of the elections in Algeria and the ouster of an elected leader in the former Soviet republic of Georgia in recent years. In this hemisphere, few Latin Americans would be persuaded that we would invade other countries, say Venezuela or Brazil, in response to a coup. Instead, the lesson the world would extract from an invasion would be that if a U.S. President is humiliated long enough by strongmen in a relatively powerless country with a history of American involvement in its internal affairs, he will send in the marines. This would not be an especially impressive lesson.
American military intervention in Haiti would violate international law, and would thereby contradict our efforts since the end of the cold war to promote an international order based on heightened respect for the law. Within the hemisphere it would set back our goal of moving beyond unilateralism and developing a regional approach to the promotion of human rights and democracy.
Finally, an invasion would set a dangerous example for other regions where our strategic interests are greater. Do we want to send a signal to Russia, for example, that it is acceptable for dominant regional powers to use force to solve their neighbors' internal political problems?
All of our options in Haiti are unsatisfying. Armed intervention is among the worst. The Clinton Administration must instead consider alternatives that don't depend on the immediate return of President Aristide, up to now a central part of U.S. policy. An option that should be considered is the formation of a multiparty interim government, fully backed by the legitimately elected members of the Haitian Parliament. This would be part of a U.N.-sanctioned negotiated accord that would permit a substantial U.N. force to oversee next year's elections and stay in place afterward to protect the results.
The paradox of Haiti policy is that the longer we hold out for the best of all possible worlds, the more likely we are to end up with the worst.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Senate Approves Bill To Jail 3-Time Criminals for Life

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 12

 BODY:
The State Senate today unanimously approved legislation that would require mandatory life imprisonment for a person convicted of violent crimes on three or more occasions.
The vote of 35 to 0 put New Jersey on the path toward enacting one of the nation's toughest versions of the "three strikes" concept. If this bill or one similar to it becomes law, as expected, a person convicted on three occasions of certain violent crimes in any jurisdiction would be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole. The crimes the bill covers are murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery and possession of a firearm, explosive or destructive device for an unlawful purpose. 
 The bill already has the support of more than half the members of the Assembly, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman campaigned in favor of such legislation, although she said today that she wanted to make sure the law applied only to the most violent crimes.
To face sentencing under the new law, criminals would have to commit three violent offenses after the date that the Governor signs it.
One of the few reservations expressed before today's vote concerned how cash-strapped governments will cover the cost of anticipated increases in already booming prison populations. But Senator Louis F. Kosco, the sponsor of the three strikes bill, a Republican from Paramus, said the costs were irrelevant.
"Each time they go through the revolving door, repeat offenders cost the state a great deal in legal and parole expenses," he said. "And we must take into account the economic and social costs society incurs with each new offense perpetrated by repeat offenders."
The New Jersey prison system is already operating at 135 percent of capacity, with about 25,000 inmates, said Patricia Mulcahy, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Corrections. The department's budget for the current fiscal year is $663 million, and the department has requested $730 million for the fiscal year beginning July 1.
It currently costs an average of $26,000 a year to house a state prison inmate in New Jersey.
Ms. Mulcahy said that 54 percent of the state's inmates are violent felons. Backers of the tougher sentencing statute said that current recidivism rates show that about 150 inmates a year are returned to prison in New Jersey after committing a third or more violent offense and they serve average sentences of 5 to 10 years.
The average age of the habitual criminal is 29, with a life expectancy of 69, meaning an average prison stay of 40 years for criminals convicted under a three strikes law.
Under current New Jersey law, inmates with multiple violent offenses generally serve a minimum of five years before being eligible for parole. But the majority of those inmates do not become eligible for parole for 10 years, correction officials said.
Based on the assumption that most repeat violent criminals already spend at least a decade behind bars, the Department of Corrections estimated that the financial impact of the three strikes bill would not begin to be felt until the 11th year.
 
Additional Costs
 The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services said that the additional costs would hit the state in the sixth year, since some inmates are paroled after only five years.
"For every inmate who is not paroled as a result of this bill, an additional $80,000 in construction costs and $1 million in operating costs would be incurred over the lifetime of that inmate," the Office of Legislative Services said in a fiscal impact statement it released today.
That accounting breaks down to $25,000 per year per inmate for operating costs or an additional $3.75 million each year for 30 years, or $1.7 billion, assuming an increase of 150 inmates each year.
In a separate action, the Senate voted to allow greater public access to criminal records of juveniles. The legislation, proposed by Governor Whitman, was prompted by several recent cases involving suspects with juvenile crime records that were, by law, kept secret from law-enforcement and school officials.
Before either bill passed by the Senate today becomes law, the Assembly must give its approval and Governor Whitman must sign the legislation. But politics and the mood of New Jersey residents against crime make it highly unlikely that anything will prevent the bills from eventually becoming law.
The Assembly Speaker, Chuck Haytaian, is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate, and a tough stance on crime is one of the major planks in his platform.
 
Cautious Support
 As early as last year, in the midst of a gubernatorial race, Mrs. Whitman was calling for three strikes legislation. But she gave only cautious support to the Senate's version of the legislation.
"I support and always have supported what I call three strikes and you are in," the Governor said. "My concern is the scope of this particular legislation. We are looking at it to insure it is tight enough and that we go after the appropriate offenses to insure that those who are the most egregious offenders are the ones."
Legislators in Connecticut in the last three weeks passed a bill giving prosecutors the discretion to seek life sentences against repeat violent criminals, rejecting the opportunity to make such sentencing mandatory. The bill was among about 250 pieces of legislation passed in the closing days of the session, and Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has not yet considered the bill or made his position on the issue public, his spokesman, Doug Quat, said today.
In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has pushed for legislation to imprison third-time violent felons for life without parole. But it appears there is little chance of New York joining the rush toward such legislation since the Speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, opposes the idea.

HEADLINE: In Alaska, a Yearning For a New Ice Curtain

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SOLDOTNA, Alaska

 BODY:
The Russian Far East and Alaska share the midnight sun, an affinity for fish and a common disdain for central governments that are more than 5,000 miles and many time zones away.
But with post-cold war business ventures floundering and some cultural exchanges turning into a horror movie ("The Guest Who Wouldn't Leave"), people on both sides of the Bering Sea are now wondering if it was easier to like each other when their governments hated each other. 
"People used to say, 'Gee, they look just like us, we share the same kind of environment, and wouldn't it be great if they got rid of Communism,' " said Rick Matiya, an Alaskan school administrator, who is fluent in Russian. "Now, you hear people say, 'They stink, they drink too much and they all want to buy guns.' Well, you can say the same thing about Alaskans."
Six years ago, when the Ice Curtain between Russia and Alaska came down, Mr. Matiya led an exchange between his Alaskan town of Soldotna and the Russian city of Magadan, a mining and industrial center on the northern shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. This year, his latest effort in diplomacy was telling a Russian guest that he had overstayed his welcome and would have to leave.
 
Guests Who Like to Linger
 "The problem is, you invite them for two weeks and they want to stay six months," Mr. Matiya said. "We tend to be workaholics. You go over there and life stops when you walk through their door."
Soldotna (pronounced sole-DOT-nuh), a three-hour drive southwest of Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula, was one of the first communities in Alaska to welcome Russians into its homes and schools. To outsiders, it is known as a place where even the nicer hotels warn against bringing fish into the room at night.
But to people who have several generations of northern latitudes in their blood, the Kenai is the cradle of Russian America. In 1791, the Russians established their first settlement on the mainland of Alaska when they landed about 10 miles west of Soldotna and built a fort on Cook Inlet. And it is on the Kenai that Nikolaevsk, a new village of Russian exiles, was started in 1968.
Despite these links to the country across the Bering Sea, some Russians feel less than welcome on the Kenai and elsewhere in Alaska. The post-cold war glow has faded, replaced by a tenuous relationship, new stereotypes about drunks and leeches, and a wariness about business ventures.
 
'We All Have Much to Learn'
 "When I first came here, I felt myself to be a celebrity, all the time with people wanting to talk, to hug, to invite me to dinner," said Natasha Kokavrov, who came to Alaska three years ago and has now set up a guest house and a consulting business catering to Russians. "People are still very nice, but we all have much to learn. Russians too often say things like, 'Shut up, you jerk' in public."
More than any other state, Alaska has been trying to build business and cultural bridges to Russia, which can be seen on a clear day from the tip of the Seward Peninsula. Aeroflot and Alaska Airlines now fly between the countries. And native people, mostly Eskimos, can travel back and forth within a special zone without visas.
But even the biggest boosters of northern brotherhood are having some doubts now. They compare the relationship between Russians and Alaskans to marriage: after a nice honeymoon, things are getting rocky.
"There was this love-at-first-sight relationship," said Jim Stimpfle, a Nome realtor who has had Russian visitors to his house. "We welcomed them and their rubles at face value. Now, there isn't a merchant in town who will take rubles anymore. And the only Russians flying over here are bureaucrats and members of the Russian Mafia."
 
When Hosts Confront Guests
 The Federal authorities in Alaska, while reluctant to give out details, say they are investigating reports of a black market trade in walrus ivory and of drug and prostitution rings run by Russian-organized criminals who have come to Alaska.
But more commonly, the authorities have been called to Alaskan homes as mediators in problems where a Russian guest will not leave. "I get called out all the time on that; you've got a host family who can't tolerate their Russian guest anymore," said Kermit Liebel, an investigator with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Anchorage.
Betty Obendorf, a Soldotna resident, told of having a boy as a guest who was supposed to stay for a month. "But he stayed for seven weeks, and I finally had to force him to leave," she said. Ms. Obendorf, who has had many Russian guests and has been a guest in Magadan, blames cultural stereotypes for the problems.
"When they see our homes, they think we are all rich Americans," Ms. Obendorf said. "I was so open because I was caught up in the emotion of it all. I was taught to hate these people because they had atomic bombs aimed at us. Now, some Russians are taking advantage of us. But some Alaskans are taking advantage of them as well."
 
High Expectations Blamed
 Mr. Matiya, the school administrator, said only a handful of the thousands of Russians who have come to Alaska since the end of the cold war -- and an equally small percentage of the Alaskans who have gone to Russia -- have created tension.
"I think part of the disappointment comes from this expectation that Alaskans are supposed to understand Russians better than anyone else in America," he said.
Dr. Ted Mala, a doctor in Anchorage of Russian-Eskimo heritage who helped initiate exchanges between the two countries, said the Soviet culture had left a legacy of dependence. "Russian-Soviet culture has taught them to be anything but independent," he said, "so when they come here they expect everyone to do everything for them."
While personal contacts have sometimes soured, formal tie-building efforts continue, with mixed results. The University of Alaska at Anchorage has become a center for Russian students. With grants from the United States Agency for International Development, the school brings budding Russian entrepreneurs to Anchorage for classes on how to run a business. They also send Alaskans to Russia for the same purpose.
 
Boon for Warehouse Stores
 "We know this is not going to restructure their economy," said Charles Neff, director of the university's American Russian Center. "But these are the pioneers. We have pretty much kept the scam artists out."
Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the open borders has been the giant warehouse stores. When the Aeroflot flight from Magadan lands at Anchorage each Wednesday, there is a mad dash of cabs from the airport to Costco, the largest of the warehouse stores, where Gummi Bears are sold by the barrel.
"The only places they want to see are Costco and the Alaska Bush Company," a strip club, said Sheldon Harris, Costco's Russian coordinator.
In that sense, they may be little different from rural Alaskans who visit the city for the same reasons.
 
Looking at Other Shoes
 Here in Soldotna, a town of 4,000 people famous for its king salmon, some Russians have learned to laugh at things being said about their countrymen in Alaska.
"We all gasped when we first came here," said Grigorii Vaisenberg, who teaches Russian at Soldotna High School and has been in Alaska for three years on an extended work visa. "You know the old Russian comedian's line about our shoes being the best shoes in the world until we see other shoes. At first it was like that for most of us here. But now it's changing."
Mr. Vaisenberg, who lives in an apartment here with with his wife and two children, says he feels stuck between two cultures -- Russian and Alaskan. But last winter he started leaning one way.
"I hit a moose with my car," he said. "So now I am an Alaskan."

HEADLINE: Interest Rates Don't Faze Companies

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., May 12

 BODY:
Who's afraid of the Federal Reserve? Not the chief executives of the nation's biggest companies -- at least not yet.
The nation's central bank has increased short-term interest rates three times this year and is expected to raise them again. But business leaders gathered here today for a semiannual conference with top Administration officials expressed no concerns. 
 A group of 16 big companies went so far as to declare that not one of them had experienced any noticeable loss of sales or orders thus far because of the higher rates and that none of them anticipated an appreciable loss of business during the rest of the year.
Lawrence A. Bossidy, the chairman and chief executive of Allied Signal Inc., a maker of automotive and automobile parts, was blithely unworried. "On my own company, it hasn't had any impact yet," he said.
Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T, was equally unconcerned. "I don't think the current move is going to make any significant difference."
 
 
'Euphoric State'
 And John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, was downright effusive. "A lot of us were here six months ago and never would have predicted the euphoric state we're in today," he said.
Similar sentiments from business leaders have led the Fed to raise interest rates even higher in the past. But the mood here today at the conference of the Business Council was too cheery for anyone to fret about interest rates.
The chief executives basically supported the Fed's moves because they said they thought the increases would help control inflation and not hurt their sales. They said consumer confidence, which is high now, was as important -- or more important -- than the modest interest rate increases so far.
The chief economists from 16 of the 100 companies represented here forecast in a report that the United States economy would grow strongly this year, despite some slowing in the second half. The optimistic forecast, seemingly at odds with Government statistics released today, reflected the extent to which the recent economic expansion has helped blue-chip companies.
 
 
Strong Demand
 Demand for goods and services is so strong that companies have new freedom to raise prices, although some are not doing so for fear of damaging relations with long-term customers, according to the report. None of the 16 companies that drafted today's report said they had found any drop in sales or orders from the recent increases in interest rates, "and none thought that current levels of interest rates were high enough to affect business appreciably," the report said.
The report predicted that the Fed would push overnight interest rates up to 4.3 percent by the end of the year. But Dennis Weatherstone, the chairman and chief executive of J. P. Morgan & Company, said big companies did not expect such an increase to harm their sales.
The Fed's interest rate policy committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday, and economists and former Federal Reserve governors have been predicting that it will raise short-term interest rates again.
The chief economists predicted that inflation in consumer prices would rise from 2.7 percent last year to 2.9 percent this year and 3.3 percent in 1995, and would peak in the current business cycle at up to 4.5 percent.
Top economists at the 16 big companies, which also included Ford Motor, Caterpillar and Bethlehem Steel, prepared today's estimate.
Chief executives here foresaw a gradual pickup in inflation, as some factories begin operating flat out and raise prices. Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Du Pont, said that some of his factories were operating at full capacity and that prices of some products were rising after three years of decline.
None of the companies involved in the 16-company report, and none of the 11 chief executives who addressed this evening's news conference, were active in the housing industry, which has begun to complain that higher interest rates will discourage Americans from buying new homes.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Defense Secretary William J. Perry are scheduled to address the group on Friday, while Robert E. Rubin, the head of the President's National Economic Council, is scheduled to speak on Saturday.

HEADLINE: France Says It Won't Support Military Intervention in Haiti

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The French Foreign Minister said today that France would be willing to take part in a United Nations force to keep watch in Haiti after democracy is restored, but would "certainly not" join an intervention intended to overthrow the military government.
Alain Juppe, who met with President Clinton at the White House, said, "We aren't going to play the conquerors all over the world." His Government has already contributed more troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Bosnia than any other country. 
 Instead, the Foreign Minister made plain France's view that the United States and its partners should rely, at least until the fall, on the strict new economic sanctions that take effect on May 21 to compel Haiti's military leaders to step down.
Mr. Clinton has said that he would consider using American force to overthrow Haiti's military leaders if the sanctions alone failed to do so. And in a television interview this morning, Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, said the United States would "preferably" be joined by troops from other nations in any such operation.
 
Haiti's 'Four Friends'
 Along with Canada, Venezuela and the United States, France has been among the so-called Four Friends who have played a central role in seeking to restore Father Aristide.
While making clear today that French soldiers would not join in an American military intervention, Mr. Juppe would not say whether his Government would approve of such an operation if it were ordered. But the Foreign Minister did say that the United States and others should wait "four months to allow the sanctions system to work," a time limit that suggests considerably more patience than aides to Mr. Clinton are willing to show. They have mentioned one month as a reasonable period to determine if tightened sanctions would drive the military leaders from power.
A senior Administration official said today that the United States had "absolutely not" committed itself to the four-month waiting period, adding, "This is a matter that is being viewed with some urgency."
A day after a rump group of parliamentarians in Haiti installed a provisional president, Emil Jonassaint, who is backed by the military, Mr. Juppe made clear that his Government remained committed to the return of Mr. Aristide. And his pledge of France's willingness to join in a United Nations force to help retrain the military in Haiti after its leaders step down represented a small victory for the Clinton Administration, which has been seeking ways to demonstrate that other countries are looking ahead to the ouster of the army.
 
An Expanded Mission
 The kind of United Nations operation that Mr. Juppe said France would participate in would be a revised and expanded version of the mission that was aborted last fall.
In weighing that approach again, White House officials have said a similar United Nations mission would not be dispatched until Haiti's leaders step down or are forced from power, a task that could require thousands of American soldiers.
While expressing willingness to take part in a renewed operation, Mr. Juppe used sarcasm today to express his criticism of the American decision to abandon the previous mission. "Unfortunately," he told reporters at a breakfast meeting, "the ship that was carrying the force did a U-turn because there were some people who were shouting rude remarks on the key side, on the wharfs."

HEADLINE: Auto Insurers Say Florio Aides Hid State Deficit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 12

 BODY:
Lawyers for the insurance industry charged today that the Florio administration knew that the state-run auto insurance pool it had created was running at a deficit from its inception, but hid that reality from the public for political reasons.
That accusation, documented in a lawsuit by insurance companies against the state, emerged as the insurance industry and the Whitman administration appeared close to an agreement to pay off the $1.3 billion debt of the insurance pool, known as the Market Transition Facility. 
 That arrangement, which sold insurance only from Oct. 1, 1990 until Sept. 30, 1992, was created to succeed the deficit-ridden Joint Underwriting Association, an earlier state-run insurance system set up to hold down costs for drivers unable to buy insurance on the open market. At one point 53 percent of the drivers in New Jersey were relegated to the joint underwriting pool.
The Joint Underwriting Association was declared bankrupt three years ago, chiefly because of lax monitoring of claims by the private companies, which were paid to administer the pool but did not bear the costs. The state's Insurance Department has been assessing insurance companies a surcharge to pay off its debt.
Gov. Jim Florio was father to the transition pool. On the way to his landslide election victory in 1989, Mr. Florio promised to scrap the troubled and unpopular joint underwriting system and the $222 surcharge that all car owners were dunned to help finance it. He made good on his promise and New Jersey drivers saw their rates drop to $825 from $1,050, on average.
The new arrangement simply charged the old rates without the surcharges, a system that the companies strenuously but unsuccessfully protested as economic folly. They filed the current lawsuit to block the state from forcing them to pay $217 million on top of what they have already paid to settle the $1.3 billion debt. The Whitman administration appears ready to pay off about $700 million of that sum by issuing bonds if the industry will pay the rest.
According to briefs filed in court today, the Florio administration ignored warnings from its own experts that it had to increase customers' fees by 63 percent to keep the pool solvent. At a meeting on May 31, 1990, four months before the new pool had issued a single policy, Jasper J. Jackson, the deputy Insurance Commissioner, told the pool's advisory board that adjusting the rates to make the arrangement actuarially sound was "probably not possible politically," according to documents filed with the industry brief.
Samuel F. Fortunato, Mr. Florio's Insurance Commissioner, had said he intended to run the transition pool to break even, but the insurance companies argue that he rejected repeated calls by his own advisers for an immediate rise in auto insurance rates.
The Insurance Department documents show that in November 1990 two actuarial consultants, Milliman & Robertson Inc., which was hired by the department, and William M. Mercer Inc., which was engaged by the market transition pool's actuarial committee, independently concluded that rates should be increased immediately by at least 60 percent. Both companies predicted a deficit of more than $1 billion unless the "grossly inadequate" rates charged by the pool were increased.
 
State's Own Estimates
 A month later the actuarial committee again warned the Commissioner that a rate increase was "both urgent and long overdue." In January 1991, the Mercer company advised the pool of a projected first-year deficit of $396 million and a 15-month deficit of $509 million. The deficit was growing about $33 million a month, the report stated.
About this time the New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company released its own projections, showing the same $1 billion deficit as the department's own actuaries in their as-yet undisclosed reports.
A spokesman for the Insurance Department at that time, however, called the insurance company's projections "complete bunk," and added that department officials "absolutely refute that there's a deficit already."
The transition pool kept running up a deficit until December, when the department issued a "cash call" to auto insurers, requiring them to pay $217 million to let the pool continue paying claims and keep it afloat. The call came after Mr. Florio was defeated in his bid for re-election by Christine Todd Whitman.
The insurance companies went to court and won approval to keep the money in an escrow account instead of turning it over to the state until its challenge to the cash call is resolved. Mrs. Whitman was forced in March to declare a freeze on paying claims until the case is settled.
Marc Buro, the spokesman for the current Insurance Commissioner, Drew Karpinski, said the Commissioner would not comment on industry claims that Mr. Fortunato intentionally allowed the deficit to grow.
 
Democrat Doubts Motives
 William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson and the State Assembly's deputy minority leader, said today that he was worried that the Whitman administration's bonding plan was just part of a long-term strategy "to saddle everyone but the insurance companies with the M.T.F. debt."
Mr. Pascrell said the taxpayers could end up paying for most of the bonds, which could end up costing $2 billion when all the interest is paid.
But John K. Tiene, the spokesman for the New Jersey Insurance News Service, an industry group, said the bonds would be paid by surcharges on car owners with bad driving records. He said the insurance companies had already contributed $240 million toward the debt, and that when the $217 million in escrow is released, probably within a month, the industry will have lived up to its end of the bargain.
While the insurance agreement between the administration and the industry was being studied, more than 100 insurance brokers and agents staged a demonstration on the steps of the State House today to protest what they said was the refusal by some insurance companies to write car insurance for urban residents.
Murray Weber, president of the Insurance Brokers Association of New Jersey, said many agents feared that they would be dismissed in the coming year because of the practice.
But Mr. Tiene said that many insurance writers had been discharged for mismanaging customers' fees and collecting illegal service charges, and that drivers in urban areas were not being turned away.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Agency to Send a New Inspection Team to North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 12

 BODY:
The International Atomic Energy Agency said today that it will send a team of inspectors to North Korea this weekend in what appears to be a last-minute attempt to avoid imposing United Nations sanctions, Asian and American officials said.
The loose arrangement will permit the inspectors to finish most of the testing and sampling in North Korea's nuclear reprocessing center that they were prevented from carrying out in March. North Korea has also been warned that its hopes of diplomatic talks will disappear unless it freezes any action to remove spent fuel from its nuclear reactor. That fuel, once converted to weapons-grade plutonium, would give the North enough material for four or five nuclear weapons. 
 As in the past, the arrangement was reached in last-minute brinkmanship, amid threats of sanctions. But both the United States and South Korea have backed down in recent weeks on details of their demands, in an effort to create an atmosphere that could lead to long-delayed, high-level talks at which the United States planned to offer incentives for the North to give up its weapons project.
"There is no real deal, so it is a bit risky," said a senior South Korean official closely involved in the talks. "But our main objective is to keep the replacement of the fuel from happening, to keep new material out of their hands. I am not optimistic, but I haven't given up hope."
Because they have been burned so many times, American and South Korean officials stressed that they were far from declaring that the long-brewing crisis has eased. In the past, when the Government of Kim Il Sung reached similar agreements, inspectors ran into obstacles once they arrived at the complex at Yongbyon, near North Korea's capital. Just a week ago, the Administration's top official handling the dispute, Robert L. Gallucci, suggested that the policy may have hit a dead end, and expressed pessimism over whether a diplomatic solution could be reached.
North Korean officials have said publicly in recent days that no spent fuel rods have been removed. So far, however, they have adamantly refused demands from the I.A.E.A. to take samples from the rods.
The sample process would solve a mystery: Has North Korea secretly removed some fuel rods, obtaining a raw source of plutonium that might already have been converted into weapons. The Central Intelligence Agency has said that North Korea may possess one or two bombs.
Administration officials and their South Korean counterparts have said that they expect the next few weeks to be the critical test of whether North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear project for the right price by putting its new harvest of fuel rods under strict I.A.E.A. control.
"The whole idea is to test the proposition that the North Koreans are willing to deal," Mr. Gallucci said last week. If the current inspection fails, the Administration is likely to move toward sanctions.
South Korea has been veering from sharply-worded warnings to optimism. Its president, Kim Young Sam, told a group of retired military officers today that "I have confidence that North Korea's nuclear weapons development should be stopped and can be stopped."
Such assistance would require an agreement for much broader I.A.E.A. access, including permission to inspect two suspected nuclear waste sites. It was the effort to see those sites that touched off the standoff.
I.A.E.A. officials acknowledge that one reason they are visiting the North with only a vague agreement is to get another look at two vital sites: The reprocessing center and the reactor. If seals placed on equipment at either site have been broken since the failed March inspection, it would indicate that the weapons program is moving along fairly quickly. Moreover, in the course of replacing security cameras and film in the reactor, inspectors are likely to see whether the unloading of the fuel rods has actually begun.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
'Come and get me': A Government lawyer takes up a sword -- er, pen -- against his employer.

BYLINE: By Linda Greenhouse 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
In the annals of American civil disobedience, simply receiving payment for writing an op-ed article sounds a bit tame. And Peter G. Crane, a soft-spoken lawyer for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who holds a high security clearance and spends his spare time researching the final decades of czarist Russia, appears a most unlikely candidate even to think about defying the law.
But when Mr. Crane accepted a $150 payment from The Washington Post for an article entitled "Arrest Me, Officer, I'm Writing," he put himself in deliberate violation of a Federal law that prohibits Government employees from receiving pay for any "speech, article or appearance," whether or not connected in any way to their Government work. 
 Unless the Supreme Court finds the law unconstitutional in a case it accepted for review a few weeks ago, Mr. Crane's gentle act of defiance could cost him a $10,000 civil fine and possible suspension or dismissal from his job.
His 1991 article criticized the law and ended with an invitation to Government enforcers to "come and get me." They did. The next morning, two investigators from the inspector general's office at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission appeared at his door, advising him that for his own good he should ask The Post not to pay him, since the violation was not in the writing but in the payment. Mr. Crane replied that he was set in his course, and when The Post's check arrived he took it to the inspector general's office and endorsed it in the investigators' presence. He then donated the money to CARE.
Two more op-ed articles by Mr. Crane followed. One was another critique of the law entitled "Let My People Write"; the most recent, in March, was an essay on the 40th anniversary of the American hydrogen bomb test that vaporized two of the Bikini Islands and brought radiation-related disease to the surrounding Marshall chain. Mr. Crane spent a recent year in the Marshall Islands as a member of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal there.
The Post paid $200 for each of those articles. The Justice Department has brought an enforcement proceeding, which is on hold until the Court rules sometime next year on whether the law violates the First Amendment.
"It hadn't occurred to me to write for money -- and I probably never would have, had it not been for this nonsensical law," Mr. Crane said the other day at his home here in Bethesda, where his study, a converted porch, is crammed with the fruits of his research into the late Romanov period.
The law, a 1989 amendment to the Ethics in Government Act, was the product of one of those spasms of sanctimony that sweep periodically over Washington. Congress, eager for a pay raise and at the same time stung by scandals concerning members' outside earnings, linked a raise to the abolition of honorariums and then extended the honorarium ban -- minus the raise -- to the entire Federal civil service.
The law's passage coincided with Mr. Crane's deepening interest in Russian history, sparked by his desire to document for his two children some of the history of his family, German Jews who had a ringside seat on the events that swept Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
His grandmother's uncle, Adolph Rothstein, was the financial adviser to Sergei Witte, the finance minister under Czars Alexander III and Nicholas II. And Raphael Loewenfeld, Mr. Crane's great-grandfather, was Tolstoy's German translator and first biographer. Some Tolstoy material that Mr. Crane found among his grandmother's papers is of such interest that the Russian Ministry of Culture wants it for the national archives and has invited him to Moscow as an official guest. He will make the trip next month with his wife and children.
The 47-year-old Mr. Crane, who studied British history at Harvard before going on to Duke Law School, is diffident in telling his story. "I'm afraid it will sound like ancestor worship," he said. But he became so intrigued by what he was learning, particularly about an economic reform movement in the 1890's "that has tremendous parallels to what's happening in Russia today," that he decided to write some scholarly articles.
He was just about to try his hand when the new law took effect. Although the scholarly journals for which he was prepared to write do not typically pay for articles, he was so offended by the law that he joined one of several suits that groups of Federal employees were readying. Other plaintiffs include a freelance theater critic who works for the Department of Health and Human Services and a mail handler who writes and speaks about the Quaker religion.
Mr. Crane believes that if the law itself is bad, the interpretive regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics are even worse. The regulations give examples of prohibited and permitted extracurricular activities: a Federal employee whose hobby is comedy may accept a fee "for performing a comedy routine at a dinner theater" but not for a speech that includes jokes "or otherwise amuses his audience."
To Mr. Crane, examples like this not only underscore the tortured distinctions that he believes the Government is now making in policing its employees' ethics but also raise the specter of Federal monitors sitting in the back row counting jokes to decide whether a performance is a comedy routine or simply a funny speech.
The legal challenges have been successful so far: both a Federal district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit have declared the law unconstitutional. The courts ruled that the across-the-board ban on compensation was so unjustifiably broad as to burden the free-speech rights of even those employees whose extracurricular writing might relate to their jobs and so could properly be restricted.
After some internal hand-wringing, the Clinton Administration took an appeal to the Supreme Court. The case, now called U.S. v. National Treasury Employees Union, will be argued in the fall.
Mr. Crane, meanwhile, has submitted one article to a history journal and is working on other projects, including a proposal for a book about the experience of four Berlin classmates, all 15-year-old girls, who fled the Nazis in 1933 and found refuge in four different countries. One was his mother.
A Government lawyer since 1975, Mr. Crane appears a bit baffled by his new status as Government adversary. "I see myself not as a crusader for the First Amendment," he said, "but as someone speaking out for basic common sense."

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise as Data Ease Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
As if they had never heard the news before, stock traders bid up prices yesterday after the Government offered still more evidence that the economy was expanding moderately without worrisome inflation.
But the stock market gave up much of its gain as the session wore on. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 35 points by 2 P.M., closed with a gain of 23.80 points at 3,652.84. 
 The bond market helped lift stocks, as prices rose and yields retreated from an 18-month high, lowering borrowing costs for corporations and enhancing stock values. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond dropped to 7.56 percent, down 4 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The release today of the April Consumer Price Index "will be a key story in terms of whether this market is going to continue to rally," said Gene J. Seagle, who heads Tactics and Technics, a technical market consultant in Weston, Conn. "If the Consumer Price Index is favorable and the market is strong and goes above 3,700, then the market is turning."
By most of the technical indicators he watches, including a bottoming out of bearish sentiment, Mr. Seagle said the stock market was due for a sustained rally in two to three weeks.
 
Rate Increases Seen
 Still, traders continued to expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon as an inflation-fighting measure. Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, said the Fed must raise interest rates by half a percentage point for both the Federal funds rate and the discount rate.
The Fed must take that step to reach a "neutral" monetary policy, Mr. Chalasani said, one that neither encourages nor discourages economic expansion.
But both the bond and stock markets have tumbled each of the three times the Fed has raised interest rates since February. Since then, the markets have tumbled even further whenever Government or private-sector data seemed to confirm inflation.
Still, traders have tended to ignore steadily accumulating data that disproved that inflation was a threat. But yesterday traders took notice. The Labor Department offered the most convincing data yet that the economy was not building up inflationary pressures in a month that was not distorted by severe winter weather.
Wholesale inflation fell. The April Producer Price Index, a closely watched inflation gauge, posted a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, instead of the gain of two-tenths of 1 percent expected by private economists. The "core" rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, posted a similar increase, again half of expectations.
 
A Rally Falters
 Moreover, consumers bought less. April retail sales, another index of inflationary pressures, showed a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent, or $183.6 billion, instead of the expected gain of two-tenths of 1 percent.
Both the bond and stock markets rallied convincingly until midafternoon, then faltered. One reason might have been a speech in Arizona by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, who said the Fed had "a way to go" before declaring victory over inflation. Mr. Parry is a member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which meets next week.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.26 points, to 443.75. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 2.61 points, to 719.61. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.04 points, to 245.55, on volume of more than 270 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining stocks by 1,207 to 977. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.18 point, to 433.35.
Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow industrials, 20 rose, led by Philip Morris, which rose 3, to 50 1/2, on speculation that it may be close to spinning off its food or tobacco businesses.
Of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500, 240 rose, led by Philip Morris and Exxon, which rose 5/8, to 62, on news that it was selling its Callaway Chemical business for an undisclosed price.
The most active stock yesterday was Cisco Systems, a computer networking company, which closed unchanged at 29, in advance of the release of its third-quarter earnings. After the market closed, the company reported a rise of 82 percent in its profit, to $84.3 million, or 32 cents a share, from the comparable period a year ago.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Raise Threshold for the 'Nanny Tax' to $1,250

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The House voted today to simplify the "nanny tax," the Social Security laws that may have turned thousands of household employers into tax cheaters, deprived many housekeepers of their retirement benefits and embarrassed several Clinton Administration nominees.
The House voted 420 to 0 to revise the tax made famous by the case of Zoe Baird, whose failure to submit Social Security payments for her household help cost her a chance to become Attorney General. 
 The bill would also ban Social Security payments to criminally insane people in a mental institution and infuses the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund with enough cash to prevent it from going broke next year.
The Senate Finance Committee has approved a similar version. The full Senate has not taken up that bill.
 
44-Year-Old Law
 Enacted in 1950, the tax on household workers has never been changed. It requires household employers to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for workers who earn more than $50 in a quarter or $200 a year.
"Congress never intended to make tax cheats out of law-abiding households who occasionally hire a teen-ager to baby sit their children," Representative Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, said in a debate on Tuesday.
The Government has estimated that three-quarters of household employers ignore the law. Ms. Baird became the first of several candidates for top jobs in the Administration who were embarrassed by disclosures that they had failed to pay the tax.
If employers do not make the payments the workers will not have Social Security benefits when they retire.
Under the House legislation, the annual threshold would be raised to $1,250 next year and indexed to inflation in future years. Employers would be allowed to file those taxes once a year, instead of quarterly.
 
Added Protection Seen
 "This simplification, coupled with the updating of the threshold, should result in a significant increase in compliance with the law, and should therefore increase the number of people protected under Social Security," said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
But under the higher threshold thousands of domestic workers would actually lose benefits, according to a Social Security actuary. Fewer would lose coverage under the Senate Finance Committee version, which would set the threshold at $630 next year.
In a separate provision of the House bill, the legislation would reallocate a small percentage of the Social Security payroll tax from the Retirement Trust Fund to the Disability Insurance Trust fund to keep it from running out of money next year. The amounts of payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers would not be affected.
Mr. Bunning said the transfer of money was "just a temporary solution" to the serious problems in the disability program. Record numbers of ill and injured Americans are seeking benefits and wait months for decisions on their claims. Some have died, lost their homes or received welfare while seeking Social Security.
"The administration has to take a serious look at why the disability program is in trouble, and it has to act fast," said Mr. Bunning, the senior Republican on the Social Security subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. He criticized the agency for giving employees $32 million in bonuses last year while it was pressing Congress for extra money for the backlog of disability claims.

HEADLINE: U.S. Data Suggest A Lull in Growth, With No Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
In reports suggesting a lull in economic expansion, which could ease some concerns about future inflation, Government figures showed today that retail sales fell in April while first-time claims for unemployment benefits climbed unexpectedly and substantially during the first week of May.
At the same time, the Labor Department said inflation at the producer level was nonexistent for both April and for the latest 12 months. 
 The combined reassurance that neither the economy nor inflation is overly rapid set off a rally in the bond and stock markets early in the day. But a warning about inflation by a senior Federal Reserve official later in the day made some investors turn more cautious. Stocks retreated from their highs and the yield on the 30-year bond ended at 7.56 percent, down from 7.60 percent on Wednesday. [Page D5]
Despite today's soft figures, analysts generally agreed that the Federal Reserve would not be dissuaded from a path of gradual but steady tightening of monetary policy and that it would likely raise short-term rates next week for the fourth time since early February.
"The reasons for their raising rates are still there," said Bernard M. Markstein 3d, economist at the Meridian Bancorp in Reading, Pa. "They're moving on a plan to shift policy to where the Fed considers it to be neither stimulating the economy nor holding it back.
Another quarter-point rise to 4 percent in the overnight lending rate among banks, which is the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate target, would bring it into the lower range of what many regard as such a neutral position.
Some analysts called for the Federal Reserve to emphasize its determination not to allow inflation to break out in the future by hoisting the Federal funds rate by a half-point and raising the discount rate charged on Federal Reserve loans to banks sharply as well. Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, indicated this afternoon that he favored such a course.
Yet there was little in today's figures other than an exceptionally large upward revision to retail sales for March to nudge the Fed in this direction.
 
Economy Limping
 The economy, which many had been expecting to speed up in the second quarter after severe weather held it to a 2.6 percent growth pace over the winter, has clearly begun to limp.
Pent-up demand has been satisfied, various analysts suggested, and no longer is refinancing of mortgages adding to consumer spending power. Moreover, companies continue to cut back, military activity is on the wane and taxes have been raised.
"Now there's a lull," said Brian Fabbri, a New York consultant.
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Bank, noted that retail sales had risen only negligibly so far this year after adjusting for inflation and predicted that second-quarter growth would probably be shy of a 2 percent pace.
"From December to April there was no growth in one-third of the economy," Mr. Kellner said, referring to retail sales.
Today's report of an eight-tenths of 1 percent decline pushed April sales down to $183.6 billion, with almost every category lower. Nondurable goods fell 1.6 percent and nondurables fell two-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department's report showed.
The revisions raised the March advance to 1.7 percent from the four-tenths of 1 percent that was first estimated and raised the February advance to 1.9 percent from 1.6 percent.
Sales by merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes slumped 2.5 percent, while automotive dealers posted a 1.7 decline and those selling furniture and other home equipment saw sales fall five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Declines in Nondurables
 Among nondurables, the declines were 1.3 percent at clothing stores, 1.1 percent at drug and proprietary stores, nine-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and two-tenths of 1 percent at food stores. The only gains were 1.2 percent for gasoline service stations, which benefited from higher prices, and a one-tenth of 1 percent gain for department stores and other general merchandisers.
By contrast, seven of the nine major categories posted gains in March, six of them by more than 1 percent. The relatively early Easter and Passover holidays were thought to have helped March results at the expense of April even though the sales figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading differences but not for price changes.
The Labor Department's report on first-time jobless claims showed a jump of 26,000 in the week ended May 7, lifting the total to 378,000. The four-week moving average climbed to 358,000 from 351,000, the highest reading since mid-February.
The one-tenth of 1 percent decline in prices received by American producers for finished goods, which matched similar performances in December and October, reflected a five-tenths of 1 percent decline for food and one-tenth of 1 percent for energy. Excluding those often erratic components, the finished goods Producer Price Index edged up one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
No Intermediate Changes
 The Labor Department's report also showed no change in prices for goods at the intermediate stage of production and a five-tenths of 1 percent decline for raw materials.
One source of upward price pressure in intermediate goods was a 6.8 percent surge for organic chemicals but this was countered by a 7.3 percent drop for softwood lumber.
In still other gauges of business activity, the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation reported that optimism remained strong among executives in the construction industry but that expectations among manufacturers eased from the record levels of mid-February.

Allied Signal to Buy Textron's Lycoming Unit

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 12

 BODY:
In a significant consolidation of the small airplane engine business, Allied Signal Inc. said today that it had agreed to buy the Lycoming Turbine Engine division of Textron Inc. for $375 million in cash.
Allied Signal, a diversified manufacturing company based in Morristown, N.J., has been seeking to expand its aerospace business, which is based in Torrance, Calif. Its plant in Phoenix makes motors for regional transport planes containing 19 to 30 seats. 
 The acquisition of Textron's Lycoming division, which makes engines for planes with 70 to 115 seats, will make Allied Signal the nation's largest manufacturer of small airplane engines, eclipsing Pratt & Whitney and Allison.
 
 
Layoffs Expected
 The deal is expected to result in layoffs at the Stratford, Conn., plant of Lycoming, which employs more than 2,000 workers, and at its plants in Greer, S.C.; Dallas, and Luton, England, which combined have about 900 workers.
Regional air transport is considered the fastest-growing segment of the airline industry. Traffic in the regional segment grew by more than 10 percent in 1993 and is expected to double by 2003 as it becomes more economical for major airlines to turn over short-haul routes to regional carriers, Allied Signal said.
"Both companies have taken dramatic steps to improve productivity and overall performance," Daniel P. Burnham, president of Allied Signal Aerospace, said in a statement. "Combining them will generate significant savings which will help create a stronger, more cost-effective organization for today's intensely competitive market."
Wall Street liked the acquisition, with industry analysts agreeing that the combined businesses would result in significant cost savings by consolidating their manufacturing, engineering and marketing activities.
 
 
Share Prices Gain
 Shares of Allied Signal closed today at $35.75, up $1.50, in trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Textron's shares finished the day at $54.75, up $1.375.
The analysts said that $375 million was a fair price to pay for the Textron division but noted that Allied Signal would also assume Lycoming's liabilities, including $70 million in pension obligations.
"This one is clearly accretive to earnings because it will improve their market position, grow the business, and improve returns," Howard A. Rubel, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. "Allied is putting together a bunch of high-tech businesses that are stronger merged than they were as individual entities."
Allied Signal's engine business, which had sales of $1.3 billion last year, makes turbofan engines for business jets like the Falcon and Lear, turboprop engines for business and regional aircraft, and auxiliary power units for commercial and military aircraft.
Textron's Lycoming, which generated $620 million in revenue last year, manufactures turbofan engines for regional airlines; helicopter engines for commercial, military and utility aircraft; military tank engines, and marine propulsion engines.
 
 
Tank Engines
 Lycoming's engines are used in a variety of aircraft and tanks, including the British Aerospace BAE 146 and Avro RJ regional airliners, Bell AH-1s Cobra, Boeing CH-47 Chinook, the United States Navy's LCAC hovercraft and the Army's M1 series Abrams main battle tank.
Dennis Signorovitch, a spokesman for Allied Signal Aerospace, said that the merged airplane engine businesses would have headquarters in Arizona and that the company planned to maintain Lycoming's operations in Stratford and elsewhere. But Mr. Signorovitch said the company anticipated some reduction in staffing levels. He declined to be more specific.
James. F. Hardymon, Textron's chairman and chief executive, said that selling Lycoming was part of the strategy of the company to aggressively manage its systems and components businesses. Textron, based in Providence, R.I., is a $9.1 billion conglomerate with aircraft, automotive, industrial, systems, components, finance and business segments.
Mr. Hardymon said proceeds from the sale would be used for general corporate purposes, including reducing debt, repurchasing common shares and financing acquisitions.

Treasuries Up Modestly On Bond-Friendly Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Government securities moved modestly higher yesterday after an unexpected drop in April wholesale prices and consumer spending.
The weaker-than-expected data eased investor fears of rising inflation pressures. So far this week the anxious market has not been able to put together two consecutive days of a similar trading pattern, its concerns shifting over interest rate increases, a weaker dollar, a quarterly refunding by the Treasury, inflation data and the the coming Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 
 The 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 8422/32 , for a yield of 7.56 percent, down from 7.60 percent on Wednesday.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve's index of business activity added to the market's firm tone. The April index fell to 19.4 from 37.2 in March, while the prices-paid component of the index dropped to 22.1 from 23.1. Analysts at MMS International, an economic analysis firm, said declines in production, new orders and shipments pulled the index down.
 
Rally Is Tempered
 Bonds prices initially rallied, with the yield on the 30-year bond dropping as low as 7.48 percent after the Labor Department released data showing April prices down one-tenth of a percent, compared with expectations of a two-tenths of a percent rise. Wholesale prices for the 12 months ended April fell four-tenths of a percent, the Labor Department reported, the first drop in two years in the 12-month period.
The bond gains were slowed though, by comments of Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Mr. Parry said the Fed still had "a way to go" before inflation was contained. While the evidence so far shows little inflation, the Fed has to "anticipate problems and pay attention to warning signs," he added.
One trader said, "He took the wind out of the market's sails."
Maureen Allyn, the chief economist at Scudder Stevens & Clark, who has been saying all along that growth will slow in the first half of this year because of a downturn in consumer and Government spending, said yesterday's data confirmed some of those expectations. The Government reported a decline in retail sales for April.
"Underpinning that forecast is consumer spending, and unlike January through March where spending was brisk, we may be seeing some of that spending beginning to slow down," Ms. Allyn said, "simply because salaries are not keeping pace with needs and desires of consumers."
Ms. Allyn said it was difficult to worry about inflation in light of the wholesale price data, adding that she was expecting a fairly benign report on April consumer prices to be issued today.
 
Municipal Bond Demand
 In the municipal bond market, where investors have not been scared off by this week's swings in prices, demand helped tax-exempt issues outperform Treasury securities.
Issuers sold $760 million in debt, including the week's largest sale, a $400 million offering of revenue bonds by the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority, which was sold through competitive bidding.
The issue, awarded to First Fidelity Securities Group, was reoffered to the public at a price to yield from 3.75 percent in 1995 to 6.10 percent in 2013 and 2014. And because the bonds are insured, by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, they are rated triple-A by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch.
The City of Phoenix sold $96.3 million in airport revenue bonds in a negotiated sale through Smith Barney Shearson. Officials at the underwriting company said the lowering of Denver Airport bonds on Wednesday to junk status by S.& P. did not affect yesterday's sale.
The issue, some of which may be subject to the Federal alternative tax, was tentatively priced to yield a maximum 6.55 percent for a series C bond due in 2012.
Moody's and S.& P. rate the bonds triple-A because they are insured, by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Bond Market Rally Fades, Pulling Down the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was lower against most leading currencies yesterday after a rally in the bond market faded.
Signs that the Clinton Administration might resume its tough trade stance toward Japan also seemed to weigh on the dollar. 
 Bond prices rose yesterday morning, pulling the dollar up, after the Labor Department reported that the producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in April, suggesting that fears of inflation might be exaggerated.
But bonds retreated from their highs after Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that the Fed still had "a way to go" before inflation was completely under control.
And Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, asserted: "Producer prices were good, but not good enough to change people's concern that inflation is roaring out of control. With U.S. assets so unstable lately, there's no demand for dollars to buy them."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 104.32 Japanese yen, down from yesterday's high of 104.80 yen but up slightly from 104.29 yen on Wednesday.
The dollar also slipped to 1.6656 German marks from 1.6680 marks. It had traded as high as 1.6739 marks.
"The dollar is moving in lock step with the bond market," said Tom Hoge, vice president for corporate trading at the Bank of New York. "Capital flows are determining the dollar's direction now."
Uncertainty about the Clinton Administration's trade stance toward Japan helped knock the dollar off its highs, traders said. The dollar fell after Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the United States had not softened its approach to curbing Japan's trade surplus, as some had read in remarks by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other Administration officials this week.
Traders bought dollars on Tuesday after Administration officials said they did not want to see the dollar weaken further.
Last week, the Fed and other central banks teamed up to buy dollars for marks and yen in an attempt to end a three-month dollar slump.
Elsewhere, the British pound rose in New York to $1.5001, from $1.4941 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 5.7186 French francs from 5.7251 francs. It was little changed at 1.4237 Swiss francs. The dollar fell to 1,594 Italian lire from 1,600 lire. The Canadian dollar was steady at 72.43 United States cents.

Oil Prices Rise Above $18 On Concerns About Supply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rose above $18 a barrel yesterday for the first time since last October amid growing concerns about reduced supplies.
Oil production has slowed since the Piper Bravo platform in the North Sea was shut on May 1 because of a natural gas leak that forced workers to evacuate. More than two million barrels of crude production has been lost and traders do not know when the platform will start pumping again. 
 In addition, the civil war continues in Yemen, which produces as much as 350,000 barrels of crude a day, while village protests in Nigeria are forcing the Royal Dutch/Shell Group to curtail some operations there.
"These little factors are adding up," said George Ellis, a trader with the GSC Energy Corporation in Atlanta. Some traders said Iran, the second-largest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, might be producing less than its quota of OPEC's 24.52 million barrels a day, Mr. Ellis said.
Crude oil for June delivery soared 43 cents, to $18.28 a barrel, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. June unleaded gasoline gained 0.79 cent, to 50.53 cents a gallon, while June heating oil rose 0.37 cent, to 48.22 cents a gallon.
 
Drop in Output Seen
 The expiration of the June crude options contracts today also pushed up prices, traders said.
The loss of production at Piper Bravo comes as North Sea output over all is expected to drop as maintenance begins with warmer weather.
"People are viewing that as a little bit of a problem," said Tom Curtis, energy research director with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, speaking of the lower North Sea output. Even so, "It's adding up to a lot more than it really is," he said.
On other commodity markets, precious metals fell amid signs that a strengthening American economy had not yet caused increasing inflation.
Producer prices declined one-tenth of 1 percent in April, the first drop since last December, the Labor Department said.
"There's no indication of inflation yet," said Daniel Weissman, head trader for MTB Bank in New York. "Companies are very resistant to raising prices."
 
Gold and Silver Fall
 June gold fell to as low as $378.40 an ounce before recovering to settle down $1.90, at $380.80 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. July silver lost 7.5 cents, to $5.395 an ounce.
July platinum fell $2.60, to $398.50 an ounce, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold prices follow movements in the bond market, because bonds and gold are both sensitive to inflation. Investors tend to buy gold when inflation threatens the value of stocks and bonds. Yesterday, prices of both bonds and stocks rose, although they ended the day off their highs.
"The gold market has been pretty much a bond market," Mr. Weissman said.

HEADLINE: Profit Up 17% At Grand Met

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12

 BODY:
Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. said today that its first-half earnings rose 17 percent amid economic recoveries in the United States and Britain.
Grand Met owns Burger King restaurants, Pillsbury foods, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Alpo pet foods. 
 It earned 318 million, or $473.8 million, in the six months that ended on March 31, compared with 272 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue slipped 4 percent, to 3.92 billion ($5.84 billion), from 4.09 billion a year earlier.
The company raised its dividends by 6.2 percent, to 5.15 pence (7.7 cents) a share.
Operating profit rose 19 percent at its food business in North America and 16 percent at Burger King, where comparable-store sales rose 5 percent despite the introduction of a value-priced menu in the United States.
In trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Grand Met's American depository receipts fell $1, to $27.25.

HEADLINE: More Downs Than Ups at Spring Art Auctions

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Nothing has underscored the art market's fragility better than the auctions of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art over the last two weeks in New York. Six months ago, auction-house experts said they felt confident that the market was making a slow but steady climb up the track. Then came an unexpected derailment.
Several forces worked against both Sotheby's and Christie's. The world economic outlook has worsened in the last few months, meaning that buyers from Latin America and Asia, on whom the auction houses were counting, disappeared; American collectors led the buying. Other buyers, even if their piggy banks were full, apparently didn't feel psychologically confident enough to spend money this spring, always a factor in the auction room. 
 It didn't seem to matter that both houses showed higher-quality art than they have in years. The number of buyers simply had not grown in proportion to the increased number of works up for sale.
Neither auction house performed up to its expectations in either segment of the market: contemporary art, or Impressionist and modern art. Sotheby's sales of Impressionist and modern art on Wednesday night made $66.9 million, compared with the estimate of $90 million to $120 million. Christie's sales in that category brought in $66.62 million, way below the estimate of $104.4 million to $141.7 million.
Last week, in contemporary art, Sotheby's sales fetched $27.5 million, significantly less than its estimate of $41 million to $55 million. Christie's fared worse, with $18.2 million in sales after an estimate of $27.6 million to $37.4 million. Many experts said the houses had been overly optimistic when figuring their estimates.
 
A Demand for Perfection
 "Generalizations about the art market are no longer appropriate," said Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's in North America. "What is appropriate is to realize that the art market is the relationship of the sellers to a small handful of buyers. It's different with each work of art."
Diana D. Brooks, who heads Sotheby's auction operations worldwide, added: "We no longer have a marketplace where you can sell anything at any price. We are in an unpredictable but refined art market."
The impulse shoppers of the 1980's have been replaced by a discerning, disciplined breed of collector. Only the best will do. "If you've got something very expensive, it's got to be perfect," Mr. Burge said. "If there's the slightest thing wrong with it, it simply won't sell."
This proved to be true in every sale in the last two weeks. Either bidders fought hard to buy something, or there were no takers at all.
Two collectors competed with a vengeance for Klimt's "Lady With a Fan" (circa 1917-1918), which Sotheby's sold on Wednesday night for $11.6 million, far exceeding its estimate of $7 million to $9 million. There was also a lot of excitement when Sotheby's sold Mondrian's "Composition No. 8" (1939-42), a rare painting in perfect condition, to an unidentified telephone bidder. The $5.6 million price far exceeded Sotheby's estimate of more than $3 million. Several big spenders came forward to bid for Vlaminck's "Landscape of a Parisian Suburb" (1905-06), a brightly colored Fauvist work. It became the highest-price picture at Christie's on Tuesday night, selling to a telephone bidder for $6.8 million, more than double Christie's low estimate of $3 million.
 
Why Some Failed
 But each auction had its share of failures. Works by artists including Cezanne, Renoir, Monet, Matisse, Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein went unsold. In each case, there was a reason. One surprise for Christie's on Tuesday night was Cezanne's "Still Life With Open Drawer" (1879-82): after an estimate of $4 million to $5 million, bidding never rose above $2.6 million. Several dealers said after the sale that the estimate was too high. Mr. Burge said the painting failed to sell because it appealed to a very "specialized collector," and no one that night was willing to step up to the plate.
Modigliani's "Portrait of Annie Bjarne" (1919) also sank that night. The reason, several dealers said, was that the painting is not recorded in the historian Ambrogio Ceroni's book on Modigliani, considered the definitive work on the artist. One telephone bidder was willing to pay $3.5 million, but that wasn't enough for the seller. The estimate had been $5 million to $6 million.
Sotheby's had its share of unsold art, too, and that house's disappointments also held no mystery. Bidding on the sale's cover picture, Monet's "Grand Canal and the Santa Maria Della Salute" (1908), never climbed higher than $5.7 million. The painting carried an estimate of $7 million to $8 million, obviously too high for today's collector. Mrs. Brooks said she thought that as lot 12, it came too early in the sale, "before buyers' confidence had built." Brancusi's "Bird" (1923-47), a blue-gray marble sculpture with an estimate of $8 million to $10 million, also didn't sell; bidding never rose above $6 million. Even before the sale, dealers had predicted the disaster, noting that the sculpture had been shopped around by its owner before the auction.
 
A Time to Hold On
 For several years now, it has appeared that the 1990's buyer is reluctant to spend gigantic sums. "The $300,000-to-$1 million range is stronger than it was six months ago, but the market for $4 million and above is thin," Mrs. Brooks said.
And the market for second-tier works, which fared well when Asian collectors played a bigger role in the market, has fallen flat. "These paintings were overpriced," Thomas Gibson, the London dealer, said of the middle portion of the market. "The true value of them, and the one which has always found a broad audience, is around $300,000, not $800,000."
"In the old days, most people sold when there was a death," Mr. Gibson added. "Today, living collectors subconsciously remember the high prices of the 80's, and since they don't need the money, they don't sell."
Which explains why estate property was the cream of the auctions this spring. Christie's had a small but impressive collection for sale, seven works identified only as coming from "a European estate." Showcased in their own hardbound catalogue were works from the estate of Jacques Koerfer, a German businessman who lived in Switzerland. Sotheby's had the coveted estate property this spring: the modern and contemporary art collected by H. Gates Lloyd, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, who died in November, and his wife, Eleanor, the founder of the Washington Gallery of Modern Art, who died eight years ago. The couple had been serious collectors for 25 years, acquiring many of their contemporary works directly from the artists.
The Lloyd works were the unquestioned highlights of Sotheby's contemporary sale. The highest-priced work, David Smith's "Cubi V," 1 of 28 polished stainless-steel sculptures the artist began creating in 1961, was estimated to bring $2.5 million, but it actually fetched $4 million. Another winner from the Lloyd estate, Gerhard Richter's "Candle," caused a bidding war between four people in the salesroom and two on the telephone. The painting was finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $607,500, more than twice its estimate of $250,000 to $300,000.
 
A Weak Contemporary Front
 But that's not to say Sotheby's contemporary-art sale was a smashing success. Far from it. Jasper Johns's "Highway" (1959), a colorful abstract painting from one of the artist's most desirable periods, failed to sell, undermining confidence for the rest of the evening. Once again, experts said the estimate was too high. One bidder was willing to pay as much as $7.2 million, but the seller, Peter Brant, the newsprint manufacturer who owns Interview magazine, wanted more.
Christie's contemporary-art sale had even bigger problems. Its offerings, for the most part, were weak. There were some exceptions, like Jackson Pollock's "No. 22," a 1949 drip painting that was sold to Thomas H. Lee, the owner of the Snapple beverage company, for $1.7 million, just under its estimate of $2 million to $3 million. Another exception was Tom Wesselmann's "Great American Nude No. 52" (1963), which went to a telephone bidder for $244,500, well above its estimate of $150,000 to $200,000.
In analyzing the contemporary-art market, both auction houses stressed, comparisons shouldn't be made to the market for Impressionist and modern art. "The two have nothing to do with each other," Mr. Burge said. "The contemporary market is more shifting sand, and it always will be. It's driven by different forces and by a different group of people."
Both houses agree that in planning the next round of sales in New York, for November, they will have to start being as selective as their buyers. "The message is clear," Mr. Burge said. "We'll have to look carefully at one picture at a time and think how will it perform, even if it means putting together smaller sales."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton's Honor Saved!

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Somebody once asked Art Buchwald whether it was hard to keep coming up with great ideas for his humor columns. Why, not at all, he said, not in a country that sends a cake to Ayatollah Khomeini.
That's all there is to it. These humor fellows just loll around. Now and then they reach out for a piece of real-life wackiness nobody could possibly make up. No research, no interviews, no nothing. For this they get paid huge amounts of money. 
 So I have to assume Art Buchwald or Russell Baker have already spotted the lead editorial in The Wall Street Journal of May 11. But in case they haven't I offer it to them in gratitude for columns past and favors expected.
The Journal comes up with a really terrific idea for President Clinton. The editorial tells him how to tear up the promises in his own executive order linking continuation of low tariffs to China with some human rights progress by the Communist Government, and still come out looking shiny with honor, a regular hero.
Golf. Just one round of golf.
The Journal wants the President to forget all about that linkage stuff, which it thinks is a lot of nonsense that would hurt trade with China and damage China's "entrepreneurial class." Lots of Americans in the China trade have been putting pressure on the President to walk, run or wiggle out of the official promises he made to Congress and the American and Chinese people last May.
Mr. Clinton has until June 3 to make up his mind. The Journal is happily confident he will not live up to his commitments to use economic pressure as a way of getting the Chinese Communists to go a little easy on torturing prisoners or allow dissidents to speak up a bit.
The Journal reports approvingly and correctly that that is the word out of Washington "notwithstanding China's continuing disdain for minimal human rights norms." But it does seem concerned that changing his mind and breaking his word on China might make the President look bad.
So the editorial says that all the President has to do is to play a round of golf with two Asians not admired by Beijing -- the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, and a feisty Hong Kong legislator, Martin Lee -- and make sure there are plenty of photographers around.
Flanked by these two, Mr. Clinton can announce that he is renewing China's low-tariff trade privilege for the good of the Chinese people. Their presence will be a "rebuke" to the Beijing Communist leaders that presumably will make tears rise to their pretty eyes as they continue exporting their goods to the U.S -- four dollars' worth for every one they buy from the U.S.
But if he makes a decision to break his word without a gesture toward Asia's democrats, The Journal fears "Mr. Clinton will appear to be capitulating to China's dictators." The golf game will prevent that, it says.
Now, I read The Journal with respect. I think its business coverage is coming along fine and is a potential challenger to that of The New York Times. Generally I have a high rate of approval-nods about its editorials.
So I was struck by the thought that maybe the editorial was some kind of joke, a piece of irony. I called The Journal and was told pleasantly enough that no -- they meant it. A round of golf was indeed their proposal -- a glistening New World Order of appeasement through sport.
But somehow I don't think it will work. My problem may be that after having spent nine years associating with Asians in my reporting days at the early U.N. and then six years living among them as a foreign correspondent I did not find them the intellectual dolts, spineless fools and malleable wood-headed puppets The Journal takes them to be.
How in Heaven can usually intelligent people become so insultingly condescending, so sorrowfully insensitive as even to think that Asians or any other people are so dense and unaware of truth as to take a photo-op golf game as the moral equivalent of standing by a human rights pledge made by the U.S. President?
No, it will not and cannot be seen that way in Asia, all nicey-nicey. If Mr. Clinton breaks this promise he will, of course, be seen as a man who is neither to be honored nor considered of consequence -- all through Asia and nowhere more clearly and contemptuously than in the government chambers of Beijing.

HEADLINE: School Board Will Recognize Other Cultures, but as Inferior

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: TAVARES, Fla., May 12

 BODY:
They said the pledge of Allegiance, heard grade-school children sing "It's a Grand Old Flag," then the school board here voted to teach all students in Lake County that American culture is superior to all others.
The conservative Christian members of the Lake County School Board, who have held a majority here for nearly two years, said that as part of a state-mandated program on teaching about other cultures, the schools should also teach that American values are the best. 
 The policy, written by the board's chairwoman, Pat Hart, says, "This instruction shall also include and instill in our students an appreciation of our American heritage and culture such as: our republican form of government, capitalism, a free-enterprise system, patriotism, strong family values, freedom of religion and other basic values that are superior to other foreign or historic cultures."
While two board members dissented, the teachers' union threatened a suit and the superintendent of schools urged a delay, Mrs. Hart and the two other conservatives on the board Tuesday night passed the measure.
The teachers' union says the policy violates the intent of the state law, passed in 1991, mandating that students learn about other cultures. The state law says students need to appreciate other cultures and "eliminate personal and national ethnocentrism so that they understand that a specific culture is not intrinsically superior or inferior to another."
Tavares, home to the Lake County School Board office, is the county seat of a rural, rolling Central Florida area about 50 miles northwest of Orlando. Since freezes in the 1980's devastated the citrus crops that were the economic staple, Lake County has attracted retirees and those who cannot afford to live on the coasts.
The composition of the school board changed in September 1992, with the election of Judy Pearson and Claudia Ramsey, who joined Mrs. Hart to form a new majority that follows the tenets of Pat Buchanan's Christian Coalition and Citizen's for Excellence in Education.
Since then, the majority has decided to cut Head Start programs and eliminate a sex-education program for mentally handicapped students.
It was unclear whether the new policy would affect all 22,526 students in Lake County's 38 schools, or what grades would be affected, said the school superintendent, Tom Sanders. "There's a lot of unanswered questions about it," he said. "I guess according to the policy it could be one grade."
He said that curriculum committees would look at the policy this summer as they write teaching plans, but he added that the schools have always taught the values that the policy enumerated. "A number of people are calling saying it's great we're going to be teaching Americanism," he said. "That's what we've been teaching."
Since the vote, he said, the superintendent's office has been swamped with calls, with half the callers supporting the policy and half disagreeing.
Those in favor say it will enhance students' pride in America. But critics, including several teachers, complained the policy was vague and opened the door to a lawsuit.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a Florida school board's decision to teach children that American culture is superior misidentified the president of the Christian Coalition, which has influenced some board members. He is Pat Robertson. (Pat Buchanan, the conservative newspaper columnist, was not involved in the situation.)

HEADLINE: A Top Executive's Puzzling Death

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
The death of Wardell R. Lazard, chairman of W. R. Lazard & Company, one of Wall Street's top minority-owned firms, contrasted starkly with what his many friends and admirers knew of his life. To them, Mr. Lazard was accomplished, highly regarded, well liked and, seemingly, thriving.
But on Wednesday, less than two weeks before his 45th birthday, Mr. Lazard died, apparently of a drug overdose, naked and alone in a hotel room in Pittsburgh. Next to his bed, the police said they found a vodka bottle and a tray with white powder on it. 
 Although a death certificate will not be issued for six to eight weeks, an autopsy yesterday ruled out most causes of death other than drugs and alcohol. And the Pittsburgh police have virtually ruled out suicide. No note was found in the hotel room.
Mr. Lazard was in Pittsburgh on business and had scheduled a lunch with Dwight White, a former Pittsburgh Steelers football player who is a principal in Mr. Lazard's investment banking firm. Mr. Lazard and his firm were sought after by many local governments that wanted to do business with a minority-run investment firm with a track record.
Marianne Camille Spraggins, a former investment banker with Smith Barney and an old friend of Mr. Lazard, lamented that Mr. Lazard might now be remembered just for the way he died. "There are so few black men on Wall Street," she said. "Most people outside Wall Street do not know him. The idea that this will be in their thoughts overwhelms me."
None of a dozen or so friends and colleagues said they had seen any signs of impending disaster. "Was he under strain?" asked Melvin L. Eubanks, a vice chairman of the firm who was appointed acting chairman on Wednesday night. "Absolutely, yes. The pressure doesn't cease. You're on the road a lot, and as the senior manager of the firm you are always on the line."
"But," he added, "I don't think anything unusual was going on."
And other friends said the notion that Mr. Lazard would die from a drug overdose was almost unbelievable.
"He was a black man trying to make it in a most difficult environment and, in doing so, thriving," Ms. Spraggins said. "He didn't have the time for that kind of thing. He was always in airplanes, always making presentations, always on. Anyway, it was abhorrent to him."
To his friends and associates, Mr. Lazard, 6 feet 6 inches tall, with a baby face, was a gentle giant with considerable vision and unrelenting drive. He worked hard, was good-natured, and became a master of his business.
They said he was completely committed to building an investment firm that would outlive him. He had overcome many obstacles, including overly rapid growth of his firm and a recession in municipal finance, the firm's primary business.
"Business was going well," said Kenneth E. Glover, a former investment banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert who joined Mr. Lazard's firm a year ago. "It seemed like we had the map."
Gedale B. Horowitz, a member of the board of Salomon Brothers, who hired Mr. Lazard fresh out of law school in 1980, said W. R. Lazard's business had started to recover in the last couple of years.
"He really had to take extreme measures to stay in business," Mr. Horowitz said. But recently Mr. Lazard had begun to hire new people and his business had started to turn around.
W. R. Lazard specializes in investment banking, financial advisory services and asset management. One of the first black investment firms, it ranks among the top minority-run firms.
Its headquarters are in New York City, and the firm operates offices in Washington, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles.
 
A Pledge of Service
 "Wardell's idea was to deliver quality service and that we would be chosen for that and not because of our minority status," said Mr. Eubanks of Lazard.
Yet without Mr. Lazard, who brought in most of the business, the future of the 70-member firm -- which is not related to the much older and larger Lazard Freres -- is very much up in the air. Mr. Lazard's wife, Betty, who now will own more than 90 percent of the firm, has told the principals that she wants the firm to go forward.
The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau, has been investigating Mr. Lazard's firm for several months.
Officials close to Mr. Morgenthau's inquiry said W. R. Lazard was a middleman between investment firms like Morgan Stanley and Sumitomo Bank and the city's job development authority. The firm arranged transactions and collected commissions.
"Mr. Lazard himself wasn't a target of our investigation, but his company and its relationship to some Wall Street investment banks is under inquiry," Mr. Morgenthau said. The investigation had been under way for six or seven months.
 
Feeling 'Very Comfortable'
 "The question that should be asked is why a middleman was needed to broker these deals," said an official in the District Attorney's office.
Mr. Glover said the investigation had not been weighing particularly heavily on Mr. Lazard's mind. "Every investment banking firm spends a lot of time under scrutiny," he said. "We feel very comfortable. Until Wardell's death, our attorneys hadn't talked to anybody for six months."
One thing is certain. To Mr. Lazard, his firm was his greatest achievement, his finest work.
By all accounts, he was a self-made man. An Army brat, he grew up mainly in California. He earned a journalism degree from California State University in Los Angeles. But instead of joining a newspaper, he went to work as a bond trader for California's state pension fund.
Married, with children on the way and eager to get ahead, he slogged his way through law school at night. By 1980, he had earned a degree from the University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law.
In the early 1980's, Mr. Lazard did what many hungry young men with good credentials did: He headed for Wall Street. He joined the municipal finance group at Salomon Brothers, which was then hiring, as were its competitors, young black professionals in a race to get business from the growing number of city governments run by mayors who were members of minority groups.
 
'A Very Good Banker'
 Mr. Lazard's mentor at Salomon, Bani Bose, who has since retired, remembered him as "very smart and very eager to learn the business." She added, "He had a chance at Salomon to do more than he could have elsewhere, and he took advantage of it." And Mr. Horowitz, senior managing director of Salomon Brothers and for many years the head of its municipal bond department, said Mr. Lazard was "a very good banker, brought in a lot of business, knew the business."
Mr. Lazard proved to be not only very good at forging relationships, but also at the technical aspects of the business, which enabled him to act as a financial adviser to local governments.
"I thought of Wall Street as another stage of the civil-rights struggle," said Ms. Spraggins, Mr. Lazard's friend. "For him, it was pure business."
Although top investment bankers could earn several hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Lazard had bigger visions than climbing through Salomon's ranks: He wanted to start his own firm. Not only did he wish to take advantage of new opportunities open to minority-owned firms, but he was intent on building a first-rate, minority-owned investment firm that handled a broad range of business.
Maria Day-Marshall, the treasurer for the District of Columbia, described Mr. Lazard as "a pioneer."
"His firm emerged at a time when there were very few minority investment banking firms," she said. "It took a lot of strength and foresight."
Mr. Lazard made his own success look easy, but it was the product of intense dedication. "He worked 7 A.M. to 8 at night," Mr. Eubanks said. "He worked weekends and holidays and called people, did all the homework. It's not all backslapping and conviviality and then the business comes in. The things that seem to be serendipity are the result of intense preparation."
Over time, especially after the firm's crisis in the early 1990's, Mr. Lazard also devoted time to the community. Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough president, described Mr. Lazard as "a class act."
"He was constantly involved in community activities," Mr. Sutton said. "You could get money from him for about anything in the community."
Mr. Lazard lived in Battery Park City in lower Manhattan. Besides his wife, who lives in Morristown, N.J., Mr. Lazard is survived by three children, Miandre, Michelle and Marcell.

 CORRECTION:
(May 16, 1994, Monday) An article in Business Day on Friday about the death of Wardell R. Lazard, chairman of W. R. Lazard & Company, misidentified an investment firm for which that company acted as middleman in dealings with New York City's job development authority. It was J. P. Morgan & Company, not Morgan Stanley & Company.
An article in Business Day on Friday about the death of Wardell R. Lazard, the chairman of W. R. Lazard & Company, included an erroneous reference to Morgan Stanley & Company. Morgan Stanley was not among the firms that used W. R. Lazard as a middleman in dealings with the New York Job Development Authority.
 A correction on that subject in this space yesterday misstated the relationship of J. P. Morgan & Company with the Job Development Authority. Although J. P. Morgan has conducted business with the authority, it says it has not used W. R. Lazard as a middleman in these dealings.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS: THE SUPREME COURT;
Scholarly Consensus Builder: Stephen Gerald Breyer

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK 

 BODY:
By nature and personality, Judge Stephen G. Breyer, whom President Clinton named yesterday to the United States Supreme Court, is professorial. But rather than become enmeshed solely in ideas, Judge Breyer has chosen to harness his considerable intelligence to solve problems, to clean up messes.
Rather than stake out fixed positions, he has built coalitions and achieved consensus. As generously endowed with political savvy, pragmatism, personal charm and energy as intelligence -- and unencumbered by any overarching ideology -- he has won a reputation for doing as well as thinking. 
 While serving on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where Judge Breyer has been chief judge since 1990, he used the same combination of skills to put together something as complicated as the Federal sentencing guidelines, as three-dimensional as a plan for an environmentally correct Federal courthouse on Boston Harbor and as crucial as coalitions of his fellow judges. He hates dissenting opinions, whether his own or others, and his court produces few of them.
Admirers see for him a moderate, consensus-building role like that of the man for whom he once clerked, Justice Arthur J. Goldberg, reaching out to Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy, the High Court's current middle, as Justice Goldberg once reached out to Justices Tom C. Clark and Potter Stewart.
"There are different kinds of intelligence, and his is the kind that tries to take complicated issues, cut to the core and explain them to people who are not nearly so intelligent," said Prof. Akhil Amar of Yale Law School, one of Judge Breyer's former law clerks. "He's always been smarter than most of those around him, so he's had to learn how to get along with other people."
But for liberals seeking a kindred spirit on the Court after a generation of conservatives and moderate appointees -- and a fitting replacement for Justice Harry A. Blackmun, the current Court's most liberal member -- Judge Breyer could disappoint.
"Breyer's basic social instincts are conservative," said Morton Horwitz, a legal historian and former faculty colleague at Harvard Law School. "His legal culture is more liberal, and his very flexible pragmatism will enable him to give things a gentle spin in a liberal direction. But he's a person without deep roots of any kind. He won't develop a vision."
 
Raw Brain Power
 Judge Breyer is Jewish, but Mr. Horwitz said he had little in common with Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo, Felix Frankfurter and other Jews who have served on the High Court. "If we still believe there is this social justice strand in the best version of the American judiciary, and that's what all these Jewish Justices stood for, Breyer doesn't stand for that," he said. "The words 'social justice' would somewhat embarrass him."
As intellectually acute and agile as he is energetic, a man who writes his own opinions and selects as his law clerks not those he can most easily lean on but those who are most interesting to talk to, Judge Breyer possesses one trait that Democrats and liberals starved of High Court appointments for a generation still seek: the raw brain power to match Justice Antonin Scalia, commonly acknowledged to be the Rehnquist Court's intellectual leader.
"He's smarter than Scalia, but not nearly as bombastic," said Alan Dershowitz, who has taught with Judge Breyer at Harvard Law School and argued before him. "He will dominate the Court by his quiet intellect, not by brashy, noisy intrusions. He doesn't need to prove he's the smartest person in the courthouse."
But while an intellectual counterweight to Judge Scalia, Judge Breyer is not necessarily a philosophical one. The labels most often used to describe him are "centrist" and "technocrat." His critics consider him brilliant but bloodless, more gamesman than statesman, more clever than humane. They say he lacks passion and compassion, is too centered on economic efficiency and a cost-benefit view of life, and prefers tidying up things, be it the airline industry or sentencing or the way judges choose their clerks, over articulating a sweeping constitutional vision.
 
Satisfying Solutions
 Others maintain, however, that Judge Breyer's moderation stems as much from institutional constraints as from his character. They note the limited role of appellate judges and the pallid, technical caseload of the First Circuit, which encompasses Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Maine and Puerto Rico and produces few of the nettling constitutional cases from which great law and rhetoric are made.
Freed from those handicaps, they say, a deeply seated libertarian streak could emerge. Moreover, they speculate that a moderate with Judge Breyer's intellectual and personal gifts is better equipped to move the court leftward than a more abrasive activist.
"It's not yet been his assignment to generate a constitutional philosophy, for as a lower Federal judge he takes his marching orders from the Supreme Court," said Professor Amar. "Now, you'll see a guy with fundamentally moderate to liberal instincts, who understands how conservatives think and can talk their talk. He'll come up with solutions that the liberals will like and conservatives will accept and respect."
President Clinton first met Judge Breyer last year, when he was a front-runner for the court seat vacated by Justice Byron White. Judge Breyer hobbled to Washington for a job interview, nursing broken ribs and a punctured lung suffered when struck by a car as he bicycled across Harvard Square. When Mr. Clinton tapped Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg instead, there was speculation the two men had not hit it off.
There are those who find him snippy and snooty, caustic or condescending to those he considers not quite as smart as he, but they are a distinct minority. A good listener and able negotiator, he has won over almost everyone else. He may have won over even President Clinton with his conspicuous chipperness and grace after Judge Ginsburg beat him out. "A great pick," he called her.
 
The Intellect
Mixing Theory And Practice
 From an early age, Judge Breyer blended the theoretical and the practical. At Stanford University -- his mother discouraged him from attending Harvard, for fear that he would bury himself there in books -- he played Secretary General at a model United Nations. At Harvard, where he went on to study law and has taught for nearly 30 years, he planted himself where legal principles and politics merged, specializing in the law of administrative agencies and economic regulation.
By design, he periodically left his Cambridge cocoon for Washington, where he worked as a Watergate prosecutor, played a pivotal role in airline deregulation and became chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the process, he cemented his ties to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who in 1980, in the waning days of the Carter Administration, shepherded him into his seat on the appellate court.
Judge Breyer remained on the bench despite an offer of the deanship of Harvard Law School, a job that might have been better preparation for the similarly fractious institution he could soon join than the comparatively congenial court where he now sits. He was also a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University.
"He is close to an ideal colleague: bright, intellectually curious and honest, an indefatigable worker, respectful of the views of others," said Judge Bruce M. Selya of Providence, R.I., whom President Ronald Reagan named to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986. "It's a hackneyed phrase, but he has a mind like a steel trap.
"On a couple of occasions I've had to lean over and say, 'Steve, it would be nice if you let the lawyers get a word in edgewise.' Not that what he's saying doesn't make perfect sense, but he does play the teacher."
Joseph L. Tauro, chief judge of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, said Judge Breyer had allayed all of his original fears. "My impression was that he was a Harvard egghead professor, and then I got to know him, and I found that my impression was 180 degrees wrong," he said. "He's from Harvard and he's an egghead, but he's one of the straightest, nicest guys I've ever met, absolutely devoid of any arrogance or attitude."
 
Relentless Interrogator
 Some of the judges with whom he has sat, however, find his intellectually nimble, facile ways a bit disconcerting. "He's able because of his brilliance to support any position," said one, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He has to guard against that, and we, his colleagues, have to, too. We, his colleagues, have to count to 10 before we buy what he's selling."
This judge called Judge Breyer "more liberal than conservative," but added, "I can't say whether he's writing out of conviction or not."
Displaying what Senior Judge Hugh Bownes called a "professorial hangover," Judge Breyer is known as a rigorous, even relentless interrogator from the bench, with an ability to cut to the heart of a case. He is extremely industrious, willing to burrow into even the most voluminous record to understand the issue before him. Even losing advocates say they got a good hearing.
"He never rules in my favor, but I find him to be brilliant and a totally decent human being," said Robert Sheketoff, a criminal defense lawyer in Boston. "He's someone who's not stretching to help the defendant, but I've always found him to be intellectually honest."
 
The Decisions
Erudite And Methodical
 Judge Breyer is a man of great range. He served on a Federal judicial study committee contemplating the relationship between law and science, read all of Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past" in French a year ago and studied the Italian architect Borromini to pick up ideas for the new Federal courthouse, on which construction is to start this summer. Judge Breyer's decisions, narrowly tailored and generally deferential to lower courts, are less notable for their content than for their style: methodical, lucid, with no footnotes and little lofty rhetoric -- what Professor Amar called "Hemingwayesque."
They bear the marks of two judges. One is Judge John Minor Wisdom of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, who once advised Judge Breyer that whenever he was tempted to write a purple phrase, he should write it, then read it, then throw it in the waste basket. The other was Justice Goldberg. "I want to extend my congratulations on your recent opinions," the Justice wrote his former clerk in 1983. "However, with all due respect, I still believe that your opinions are too long."
In them are things to please and displease women's groups, civil libertarians, civil rights advocates and criminal defense lawyers. Judge Breyer wrote an opinion upholding the right of Americans to travel to Cuba, a decision later reversed by the Supreme Court (with Justice Blackmun dissenting), but another approving a Boston redistricting plan that civil rights lawyers said diluted minority voting power.
He ruled in favor of an affirmative action plan for the Boston Police Department in 1991, but writing for a divided court two years earlier, he reversed a lower court ruling granting scholars access under the Freedom of Information Act to certain McCarthy-era papers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 1989 he wrote an opinion holding that the State of Massachusetts could regulate parts of the curriculum of a fundamentalist Baptist school in East Longmeadow, Mass., without violating the First Amendment. But in a 1991 decision that he wrote, the court barred the Internal Revenue Service from examining records of the Church of Scientology.
In a 1984 opinion by Judge Breyer, the court struck down on First Amendment grounds an executive order requiring candidates for positions in the World Health Organization to undergo loyalty investigations.
He joined in one opinion striking down prohibitions on abortion counseling at federally financed clinics, and in another upholding a Massachusetts law requiring minors to obtain the consent of both parents before undergoing an abortion. He helped establish the right to a jury trial in discrimination cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but joined in other decisions increasing the burden civil rights plaintiffs must bear to win. Earlier this year, he wrote an opinion upholding the constitutionality of the Federal law prohibiting the distribution and receipt of child pornography. The Supreme Court has agreed to consider that issue next term.
Judge Breyer has his detractors. "He's very interested in your case, engages you in an intellectually challenging discussion of the points, and then the opinion comes out, and you're history," said Michael Avery, a civil rights lawyer in Boston.
More than any ruling, however, it is Judge Breyer's role in helping to devise the intricate Federal sentencing guidelines, then defending them against accusations that they are rigid, mechanical and unduly harsh, that his critics find alarming. Both as architect and apologist, they contend, Judge Breyer provided liberal legitimacy to a cornerstone of Reagan-era law-and-order forces.
"You scratch the guidelines anywhere, and you get a horror story, and Breyer is as responsible for the mess as anyone else," said Albert Alschuler of the University of Chicago Law School.
His defenders counter that he kept the system from being even worse. Moreover, in a ruling last year, Judge Breyer conceded that the appellate courts, including his own, had enforced them too strictly, and he encouraged trial courts to be more flexible. In the case, a single mother with no prior record received 33 months in prison for carrying a pound of cocaine from New York to Providence in order, she said, to buy Christmas presents for her three small children.
The group that seems most positive about Judge Breyer's record is environmentalists. He has established what Douglas Foy, executive director of Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, called a "terrific" record in environmental cases, involving such issues as offshore oil and gas drilling, the use of dune buggies on the Cape Cod National Seashore, the cleanup of Boston Harbor and the risk to endangered species posed by a proposed oil refinery in Northern Maine.
"I don't think he's a card-carrying member of the Wilderness Society, but he cares about these issues," Mr. Foy said. "You've got to like a judge who gets hit by a car bicycling in Cambridge."
Judge Breyer has earned particular praise from environmentalists and community activists for his work on the new Federal Courthouse in Boston. Though, as a Federal building, the courthouse is technically exempt from state and local legal requirements, Judge Breyer has consulted with local groups and deferred to them. Everyone agrees he has devoted himself to the task prodigiously.
 
The Personality
A Man of Wealth In Frayed Collars
 Judge Breyer is a bit of an Anglophile, with English clothes and what some say is a hint of an English accent. But in other aspects of his personal life, he seems almost determinedly down-to-earth. He bicycles not only around Cambridge, where he lives, but across the Charles River to his chambers each morning, usually in a sweat suit, usually without mishap. The ride helps burn off the Hershey's Kisses and M&M's he filches from the jar his law clerks keep, partly to lure him over and into conversations, partly to slow him down.
He can be quirky, flip, distracted, or simply off-the-wall. At one law school faculty meeting, one unorthodox comment met with complete silence, broken only by Judge Breyer himself. "Well, I have tenure," he said. He can also be absent-minded.
While working for the Senate Judiciary Committee, he once wore the same suit, torn under the armpit, for six weeks running. His sweaters have holes in them and his collars are frayed, even though his net worth is at least $3.6 million. Most of that comes from his wife, Joanna, a clinical psychologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston whose father, Lord John Blankenham, once led Britain's Conservative Party. They have three children.
And Judge Breyer has a self-deprecating wit. It was was very much in evidence last year, as he awaited word from the White House over the first court vacancy. "I know all of you are curious about how I'm holding up," he declared at a meeting with his fellow judges. "It's not affecting me at all except in one small way: I'm hysterical 100 percent of the time." To another judge, he remarked: "There's only two people who aren't convinced I'm going to be on the Supreme Court. One is me and the other is Clinton."
He is a man who loves being loved, who told a friend that because intellect is innate and niceness is not, he would as soon be well-liked as highly respected. At his 50th birthday party, he went around around the table, one person after another, saying something flattering about each of dozens of guests.
Stephen Gerald Breyer was born in San Francisco on Aug. 15, 1938. His father, Irving, was a lawyer and administrator with the school board. He starred debating at Lowell High School -- one of his rivals was Edmund G. Brown Jr., later Governor of California -- and was voted most likely to succeed in the Class of 1955.
"He was always sort of a peacemaker," said Stuart Pollock, a high school and college classmate, and now a Municipal Court judge in San Francisco. "He was not anyone you'd expect to see on the steps of Sproul Hall."
Judge Breyer graduated from Stanford in 1958, then spent two years studying philosophy, politics and economics as a Marshall Scholar at Oxford. He then enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude and was articles editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then clerked for Justice Goldberg.
In 1967 he returned to Harvard Law School, where he taught and wrote on antitrust, administrative law, and economic regulation. Interested in policy matters, he developed ties to the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He started teaching a course on law and economics, which led to his interest in regulatory reform.
He saw Harvard as congenial but a bit remote. "Life there is important but doesn't affect 99.9999 percent of the people who get up, go to work, have to educate their children, and get their health insurance," he said in an interview.
His third and longest foray to Washington came in 1979, as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, then headed by Senator Kennedy. There, he worked on a Federal criminal code, the F.B.I. charter, fair housing law and legislation to deregulate the trucking industry. He also helped select judges and get them confirmed. In addition, he had the politically sensitive task of drafting a policy barring Federal judges them from belonging to private clubs that discriminated.
In 1979, after the Carter Administration balked at naming Archibald Cox, the former Watergate prosecutor, to a newly created seat on the First Circuit, Judge Breyer got the nod. His nomination was pending on Election Day, 1980, and appeared doomed once Ronald Reagan won. With help from, among others, various Republican members of the Committee, his nomination was salvaged, the only Democratic choice to do so. On Dec. 18, 1980, he was sworn in.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Executive's Hidden Drug Problem

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
The mystery surrounding the death of Wardell R. Lazard deepened yesterday as some of his closest confidants and co-workers said they were unaware of his drug abuse and financial problems.
The three senior principals of the firm, W. R. Lazard & Company, and the firm's outside lawyer said yesterday that they were unaware before this week that Mr. Lazard had been arrested for drug use or been in treatment. 
 Nearly three years before he was found dead on Wednesday from an apparent drug overdose, Mr. Lazard had been arrested for possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia. He had completed 11 months of closely monitored treatment as a condition of having the charges dismissed.
But he was apparently able to conceal his problems. He did not disclose his own stint in a drug rehabilitation program last year, even as he helped another executive of the firm who had a drug problem get into a treatment program.
"I didn't know anything about it," Robert Plotkin, the firm's outside counsel, said of Mr. Lazard's arrest in 1991. Melvin L. Eubanks, Kenneth E. Glover and Thomas M. Mead, the three principals of the firm, also said they were in the dark.
Mr. Plotkin also said he was unaware of Mr. Lazard's personal tax problems, including a recent lien by the Internal Revenue Service.
"Just because he was the 90 percent owner of the firm, it doesn't mean the company lawyer gets involved in his personal finances," Mr. Plotkin said.
Mr. Lazard, who was 44, was well known among New York's financial elite as the creator of one of the most successful black-owned investment banks. The firm he founded nine years ago after leaving Salomon Brothers quickly found a niche as more municipalities elected members of minorities to office. W. R. Lazard has since expanded into other lines of business, and now has 70 employees and $2.7 billion of assets under management.
New Jersey law enforcement officials said yesterday that the arrest of Mr. Lazard was made on July 23, 1991, one month and a day after the police were summoned by a family member to the home Mr. Lazard rented at 31 Sheepfield Farms Drive in Harding Township, N.J. The police said Mr. Lazard had overdosed and they called an ambulance to take him to Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J.
"He overdosed, and that led to his arrest," one enforcement official said yesterday, on condition of anonymity.
The episode occurred at the end of a two-year period during which Mr. Lazard's firm had overexpanded and was in a financial crisis that has since been solved.
Mr. Lazard's naked body was discovered on Wednesday in a hotel room in Pittsburgh. Not far away were a bottle of vodka, a tray with a white powdery substance that the coroner said yesterday was powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Though laboratory tests will not be completed for several weeks, the police said they believed his death was accidental.
Law enforcement officials in New Jersey refused to divulge much about Mr. Lazard's arrest in 1991 because they said Mr. Lazard had successfully completed a pretrial intervention program that expunged any trace of the arrest from his record. The New Jersey program, which precludes an indictment and trial, seeks to get first-time offenders who are substance abusers into recovery programs.
As a participant in the program from Sept. 26, 1991, to Aug. 26, 1992, Mr. Lazard was expected to attend a drug rehabilitation center in Morristown weekly as an outpatient and submit to random urine testing and drug counseling. He was also expected to pay $133 in administrative costs for the program and a $1,000 penalty.
 
'Negative' Testing
 Officials said he had abided by all the terms of the program and as a result, all the charges were dismissed by Stephen Smith, the presiding judge of the New Jersey Superior Court in Morris County. "All drug testing during the period of supervision was negative," said Jude Del Preore, chief probationary officer for Morris County.
But as Mr. Lazard wrestled with his drug problem, his legal and financial problems were mounting.
On March 9 of this year, the Federal Government filed a lien against the two-acre property and house at 102 Skyline Drive in Morris Township that Mr. Lazard and his wife, Betty, had purchased in 1985 for $410,000, not far from the rented home in Harding Township where he had overdosed, court documents in Morris County show.
The Government sought the lien because of $68,047.71 it said Mr. Lazard owed in back taxes from 1991.
Mr. Lazard had borrowed heavily against the house for purposes that remain unclear. On the day he bought the house, he recorded a loan of $118,000 from the couple who had sold him the property, Timothy L. Arnold and Jane S. Arnold.
Almost three years later, in May 1988, he got a second mortgage of $75,000 from Midlantic Bank in Bloomfield, N.J. Four months later, a third mortgage for $475,000 was recorded as being issued by the Broadway Management Company, an agent for Fourteen Wall Street Associates. W. R. Lazard's headquarters are at 14 Wall Street.
 
A Personal Guarantee
 The first two mortgages have been canceled, presumably because they have been repaid. But the third, larger one remains open.
Roy R. Bumsted, an outside spokesman for W. R. Lazard, said the large mortgage had resulted from a personal guarantee Mr. Lazard had provided for a loan made to the firm. "It's very common," Mr. Bumsted said.
Mr. Bumsted also confirmed that W. R. Lazard had dismissed one of its senior executives who had a substance-abuse problem to "bring home to him the severity of the problem and the urgency of dealing with it." The company then paid for the employee's rehabilitation and rehired him.
David Shay, the addiction counselor who said he was hired by W. R. Lazard to help the senior executive, praised Mr. Lazard and Mr. Glover, a vice chairman of the firm. "They didn't want to fire the guy," he said. "They were very generous. They really wanted to help. One of the human resources people called to say if the insurance won't pay, the firm will."
Of Mr. Lazard, Mr. Shay added, "He was so concerned, so compassionate." Now, Mr. Shay said, "One of the reasons was that Wardell himself had had this problem."

 
 
'Drugs are Catching Up'
 Robert J. Strang, president of Strang Hayes Consulting, an investigative management firm in New York that advises companies about prevention programs, said, "Some of the incidents we're seeing involve very successful older people who have apparently been using drugs for years. They've been able to function, but the drugs are catching up with them."
In Mr. Lazard's case, Mr. Strang said, it may have been especially difficult to prevent the tragedy that occurred because continuing monitoring is a necessary part of recovery. And as the head of his own firm, Mr. Lazard might have been hard-pressed to submit his private problems to the scrutiny of underlings or outsiders.
When Mr. Lazard died, he was known to have been aware that his firm was being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau, in connection with the fees it collected by acting as a middleman in several financings involving the New York State Job Development Authority. People familiar with the investigation said the inquiry had nothing to do with Mr. Lazard's drug use.
Mr. Plotkin, the Washington lawyer representing W. R. Lazard, said he believed the investigation, which started last year, began because of allegations made in a lawsuit brought by a disgruntled employee of the job development authority,
Until Mr. Lazard's puzzling death, "this was not a high priority for Mr. Morgenthau's office and the investigation was not terribly active," he said.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise Gesture, China Releases a Major Dissident

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, May 14

 BODY:
In an important gesture to the Clinton administration, China today released on medical parole the second of two major figures still serving long prison terms for leading the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989.
 A brief dispatch this morning on the New China News Agency said that Chen Ziming, 42, "has been released on bail for medical treatment" under an order from "Chinese judicial authorities." 
 Mr. Chen, a social scientist and publisher, is a veteran of China's democracy movement. He was branded along with Wang Juntao as the "black hands" behind the political demonstrations that paralyzed the Chinese capital five years ago. Each man received a 13-year prison term in February 1991.
 
An Unexpected Move
 The release came as a surprise to China's dissidents, many of whom have been predicting that with the April 23 release of Mr. Wang, the Chinese leaders would make no more concessions to Washington in order to win renewal of China's "most favored nation" trade status.
 Today's decision follows a steady trickle of actions in recent days that appeared timed to influence President Clinton's decision on whether to renew the trade privileges.
 On Friday, five religious activists were released from labor camps because of their "good behavior," China said. On Thursday, a 54-year-old woman imprisoned for four years for religious activities was released in southern China's Fujian Province.
 Earlier in the week, China issued a passport after ten refusals to a constitutional scholar, Yu Haocheng, 66, who will leave China for an academic year at Columbia University.
 A longtime associate of Mr. Chen's, reached this morning, said this series of releases demonstrates the determination of the Chinese leadership to avoid a trade confrontation with the Clinton administration.
 "Even if releasing Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming involves a great risk for the Chinese government, today's action shows that the Chinese Government is willing to take this risk in order to win" renewal of its low tariff privileges in the American market, the associate said.
 In fact, he added, the risk of losing these trade privileges on $30 billion in exports to the United States, is greater than the risk of releasing two ardent democracy campaigners. "China's politics and economy cannot bear this loss," said the associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 When Mr. Wang was released he was put on a plane to New York, where he is receiving treatment for hepatitis.
 In an interview a week ago, Mr. Chen's wife, Wang Zhihong, 38, expressed pessimism that she would see her husband released this year. She said one of her hopes has been that they could have a child. "I'm afraid that perhaps I will be too old to have one" by the time he would be released, she said.
 Today, she was reported to have accompanied her husband out of Beijing for medical treatment. The Reuters news agency quoted Mr. Chen's sister, Chen Zihua, as saying Chinese authorities "originally wanted to send them abroad" for treatment but relented when Mr. Chen said he wanted to stay in China.
 Mr. Chen's wife said she had made dozens of petitions to the authorities to release her husband on medical grounds. She said he was suffering from a skin ailment that was spreading all over his body, gastrointestinal problems and a diet so poor that his teeth were loosening.
 "In 1993 for a whole year, he was not able to take a single shower," she said.
 Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang, whose prodemocracy activism began during the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing, founded the Social Economic Research Institute and were publishers of a newspaper called Economics Weekly.

HEADLINE: Prices Rise For Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended moderately higher yesterday after a roller-coaster session that epitomized the trading activity throughout the week.
The market initially rallied after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose a tenth of a percent in April. The increase was less than had been expected in many forecasts and was another sign that inflation was still in check. 
 But the market was quickly tripped up by rumors that a leading Wall Street firm was in financial trouble and was selling mortgage-backed securities and Treasury issues to raise capital. Later, the rumor expanded to include at least half a dozen firms or hedge funds. Although these were only rumors, they did affect the market by raising concerns, traders said.
Then Market News Service quoted a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, as saying that personal consumption, a key ingredient in the economic expansion, remained strong and that consumers were showing a growing willingness to borrow to finance purchases.
For traders and investors, the comments were another indication that there was still reason for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again, despite the good news on inflation. But by the afternoon, the positive inflation data appeared to be winning out and giving the market a lift, as prices rose and yields fell.
The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to 8510/32 , for a yield of 7.49 percent, down from 7.56 percent on Thursday and at the level of Tuesday.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said there was no sign yet of any upward trend in price inflation. "In fact, if we look at the trend of the last few months annualized and compare it to the past 12 months, you can see that the latest data remain benign," he said. "This should help ease investor fears about inflation as a near-term risk.
"However, neither should it dissuade the Fed from continuing its tightening policy. Critics who complain that the Fed is responding to inflation now, when everyone else sees none, are missing the point. Fed policy is responding to the continuing strength of economic growth, rather than some ghost of inflation."
The monetary policy-making committee of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet Tuesday, and many analysts expect the central bank to raise its short-term interest rate target by a quarter to a half of a percentage point. The target is now 3.75 percent; it has been raised three times since February by a quarter of a percentage point each time.
"There are substantial reasons for a more aggressive move soon -- for example, 50 basis points," Mr. Lipsky said. "But there are also good arguments in favor of a two-step process."
Some traders and dealers say that an aggressive move by the Fed of more than 25 basis points would be a golden opportunity for the central bank to get out ahead of the market and complete its work sooner.
In other data released yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories fell in March for the first time in three months as sales continued to rise strongly. Total business inventories decreased by two-tenths of a percent, to $869.5 billion -- the first drop since a decline of a tenth of a percent in December.

HEADLINE: California Loses Top Spot In Japanese Tourist Trade

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 13

 BODY:
As California struggles to climb out of its long recession, more bad news has emerged: the state has lost its dominant share of the lucrative Japanese tourist market and may be hard-pressed to recover it.
 As other destinations compete with new attractions and more aggressive marketing, the state's share of the $14 billion Japanese tourist market has shrunk from 44 percent in 1987 to a projected 18 percent this year, California Division of Tourism figures show. The decline has meant a loss of $658 million a year. 
 Despite the declining numbers caused by Japan's continuing recession, Hawaii in recent years has captured the largest share of Japanese visitors, rising to more than 47 percent last year.
 Other destinations, as well as California, have suffered serious declines in Japanese tourism because of the recession, which has cut into travel and made cheaper, nearby Pacific destinations more popular.
 
Decline in New York, Too
 From 1987 to 1993, New York City saw its share of the Japanese tourist market fall from 16.9 percent to 10.2 percent, and New York State's fell from 18.9 percent to 10.6 percent in the same period.
 But California's position has been most seriously shaken.
 Both Japanese and American tour operators say violent crimes and the 1992 riot here, which have been widely publicized in Japan, are factors in California's reduced tourism, although fears of violence tend to generalize to the United States as a whole.
 "Many things have happened, and security is actually very bad compared with other destinations," said Ryo Okura, vice president of Japan Travel Bureau International, a major travel agency based in Los Angeles. "Honeymooners try to avoid this area. It used to be that this destination was very popular among honeymooners."
 He said most now go to Florida, where several foreign tourists have been killed, but no Japanese.
 
More British and Germans
 About 3.7 million Japanese traveled to the United States in 1992, 785,000 of them to California, said Tiffany Urness, a researcher with the California Division of Tourism. Each spent about $116 a day, nearly double that of British or German tourists, whose numbers have been rising as those of the Japanese decline.
 Japan remains the largest overseas tourist market for California, where 8.3 million overseas visitors spent $12 billion in 1992. But Ms. Urness said the loss is more important than its dollar figure would suggest.
 "California's largest market is itself," she said. "The international markets are important because they bring in foreign currency and enhance California's international stature and trade."
 In recent years, Miami, Orlando, Fla., Las Vegas, Nev., and other cities and areas around the country have gone after the Japanese dollar with new attractions and expensive advertising campaigns. As California's share of the Japanese tourist market has declined sharply, these destinations have fared better.
 
Only Hawaii Shows a Gain
 The overall decline in Japanese travel to the United States, and its increasing diversification among destinations, has affected most states and cities. Only Hawaii has seen significant growth among major destinations, from 41 percent of the market share to 47.2 percent in the period from 1987 to 1993.
 Illinois fell from 8.9 percent to 4.8 percent; Washington, D.C., fell from 6.6 percent to 3.6 percent.
 John Poimiroo, director of the California Division of Tourism, said that the problem had been identified here over the last two years or more but that few resources were available to combat it.
 California now spends only $300,000 a year on tourist promotion in Japan, part of overall promotional spending that is 16th among the states and about the same level as Montana's.
 A bill now before the California Legislature would budget $32.5 million for tourism promotion, of which Mr. Poimiroo estimated that about $1 million would be spent in Japan. "This is a great way to balance trade," he said. "Sending 10 Japanese tourists to California is the equivalent of sending one American car to Japan."
 
A 'Worn-Out Destination'
 Addison Schonland, manager of new business development for C.I.C. Research Inc., a travel research company, called parts of California a "worn-out destination" in comparison with places like Las Vegas that are "always reinventing themselves."
 "They have already been to Los Angeles and San Diego five or more times," she said of the Japanese. "They want to go somewhere else. There is only one Golden Gate Bridge, and nobody is building any new ones."
 Anecdotal reports from airlines and tour operators indicate a 28 percent decline in Japanese tourist visits to California in recent years, he said, while visits to Florida are up 40 percent and visits to Hawaii are up 30 percent.
 
Frightened by Violence
 "When you have more products on the shelf, people will buy less of your product," he said.
 Other factors, Mr. Poimiroo said, were the fear of crime and violence and the lack of new destinations "to keep us trendy."
 As with other foreign visitors, the Japanese have been most frightened by reports of violence to their own citizens. The killing of German and British tourists in Florida has had less of an impact in Japan than the recent killing of two Japanese students in a car-jacking incident in the Los Angeles area, Mr. Okura said.
 Robert Fisher, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Southern California, said: "It's like the Michael Fay incident in Singapore. People get caned all the time in Singapore, but when it is one of your citizens the people tend to look at it and the media tend to exploit it."

HEADLINE: U.S. Hopes To Revive Japan Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Senior American and Japanese officials agreed today to try to revive their stalled negotiations on opening Japanese markets to more American imports, but privately American officials remained wary about the prospects for a deal.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa of Japan telephoned Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, this morning and they spoke for 30 minutes about the need to have preliminary contacts about resuming their trade talks before the economic summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations in July. 
 The previous talks were broken off Feb. 11 by the Clinton Administration after Tokyo refused to accede to American demands for "numerical indicators" that would determine whether Japan really was opening markets in autos, auto parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance.
 
Trade Office Statement
 "Ambassador Kantor agreed with the suggestion of Foreign Minister Kakizawa on the need for preliminary contact between both sides to explore the basis for resumption of the framework talks," a statement by Mr. Kantor's office said. "They both shared the hope that a basis will emerge for a resumption of the framework talks before the July G-7 meeting in Naples."
American officials are cautious about the prospects for several reasons. To begin with, before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, he had promised to offer some Japanese steps to open markets and stimulate his sluggish economy. He said he hoped these would go a long way toward satisfying the American side.
The Clinton Administration was dubious about the Japanese proposals, which were scheduled to be delivered in June, but told the Japanese to come ahead. The Hosokawa resignation and subsequent political turmoil, however, overtook that effort and now the two sides are back to trying to resolve their differences through negotiations instead.
American officials also note that the Japanese side has gone out of its way to publicize these latest overtures. Some American officials believe that the fragile new Government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is eager, maybe even desperate, to cut a deal with the Clinton Administration on trade, to prove to the Japanese public and political realm that the Hata Cabinet is serious, can get things done and can manage the most important foreign relationship Japan has today.
But American officials express the fear that while the Hata Government may have the will, it does not have the way. Not only does it carry little weight with the Japanese finance bureaucracy, which has been manning the barricades of opposition to the sort of trade pact the United States has been demanding, but it also does not even have a majority in Parliament.
 
'A There There?'
 The big question with Japan today, as one senior American policy maker put it, is: "Is there a there there?" Is there a real interlocutor with whom the United States can strike a deal that will be delivered by the Japanese side, or is Japan now so politically divided at the top that no serious deal is possible?
American officials do not want to go to the Group of Seven meeting with United States-Japan relations still an open sore, and neither do the Japanese. But the Americans also do not want to resume negotiations with Japan, knowing that in the end they may have to choose between accepting a watered-down deal -- the only deal Japan very likely will be able to strike -- or a second breakdown in the negotiations, which would worsen tensions between the world's two largest economies and further rattle global financial markets.
One reason for the decline in the value of the dollar since February was a feeling in financial markets that in the absence of a trade agreement between the United States and Japan, the Clinton Administration would either actively, or by benign neglect, allow the dollar to depreciate against the Japanese yen. That would make American exports cheaper and easier to penetrate the Japanese market and Japanese exports more expensive and more difficult to sell abroad.
That feeling became so prevalant in recent weeks that the dollar dropped significantly against major currencies, and the Federal Reserve and Treasury had to buy dollars in international markets to prop it up. They also had to declare publicly that the United States did not want to solve its trade problems with Japan through currency manipulation.
This helped to stabilize the dollar, particularly after it was accompanied by reports suggesting that the Clinton Administration might have to change its negotiating policy vis-a-vis Japan -- either to accept a weak deal or to drop the focus on opening particular Japanese markets and emphasize instead the need to get Japan to stimulate its overall economy so that it will import more from abroad.
Consequently, American officials want to be careful that there is no new breakdown with Tokyo. Given the dollar's fragile state, a renewal of trade conflict between Washington and Tokyo would hammer the American currency and add pressures on the Fed to raise American interest rates to keep the dollar's value up. After an initial few months of talking about Japan in very tough language, Clinton Administration officials now choose their words carefully when talking about the relationship with Tokyo, so as not to set off the currency markets inadvertently.
The main stumbling block in the talks is that the United States wants fixed yardsticks to gauge whether Japan's economy is being opened to more foreign goods and services. For instance, they have asked Tokyo to measure each month the number of auto showrooms that are displaying foreign cars. For their part, Japanese officials says such indicators are really just import targets and quotas that will put undue pressure on them and be in violation of world free trade norms.

HEADLINE: Russia Joins the West in a Push to End the Bosnian War

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 13

 BODY:
Russia formally joined the United States and the European Union today in a reinvigorated international effort to end the two-year-old war in Bosnia, supporting a plan that calls on the Bosnian Serbs to cede nearly a third of the land they control to the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government.
 Under the plan backed today, that Government, now federated with the Bosnian Croats, would be given control of 51 percent of the country, while the Bosnian Serbs, who now control more than 70 percent, would receive 49 percent. 
 At today's meeting, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of Russia, Britain, France, Germany and several other European countries also called on the warring parties to agree to a four-month cease-fire, and urged the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs to resume peace talks within two weeks.
 
Show of Unity
 The show of unity by the governments with the greatest influence with Bosnia's Muslims, Serbs and Croats seemed likely to increase pressure on the warring parties to accept the peace plan.
 The foreign ministers also supported efforts in the United Nations Security Council that threaten to punish any parties that takes offensive action near Brcko, a Serbian-held town in northern Bosnia where Western diplomats fear an outburst of fighting.
 But otherwise, the meeting produced no new threats or inducements to the Bosnian factions, and it is unclear whether the increased diplomatic pressure will produce a settlement.
 "This is the first time since the beginning of the war," said Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France, "that the Europeans, Americans and Russians have agreed not on a vague formula, but on numerous details for an overall settlement."
 One senior American official was so optimistic about the unity among the major powers that he predicted a cessation of hostilities in four to six weeks.
 But the ministers acknowledged that after two years of bitter strife that has left an estimated 200,000 people dead, Bosnia's warring parties might not agree to resume negotiations or accept the details of the peace plan.
 "All of this is very fragile, very delicate, and can easily founder," said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany.
 
Confidence in Jawboning
 The ministers voiced confidence that through jawboning by the major powers and maintaining the existing array of carrots and sticks -- like continuing economic sanctions against Serbia or renewing old threats to pull out United Nations peacekeepers -- the parties would get down to serious peace talks.
 For example, to pressure the Bosnian Government to get serious about a peace settlement, Mr. Juppe renewed a threat to withdraw France's 6,000 peacekeepers from the Balkans if there was no concrete movement toward peace soon. Mr. Christopher repeated suggestions that the United States might push for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia if the war continued indefinitely.
 American officials also repeated threats to more strictly enforce the economic embargo against Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs, who are supplied by Serbia, rejected new negotiations.
 The proposed 51-49 division of land would require concessions by both sides. The Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs tentatively endorsed such a division last fall as part of a European-led peace effort, but they have since retreated from that compromise and are demanding far more land for themselves. The Government now insists on 58 pecent, while the Serbs are demanding 60 percent.
 As an inducement to the Bosnian Serbs, the Europeans, who have long called for phasing out sanctions on Serbia if they move toward peace, won United States backing for gradually lifting the sanctions.
 
Russia Urges Lifting Sanctions
 Russia's Parliament voted today in favor of immediate lifting of the sanctions on Serbia, but Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, endorsed the European proposal to phase out the sanctions once the Serbs began to comply in good faith with a peace plan.
 American officials say the time is ripe for a settlement. Serbia, they say, is being strangled by economic sanctions and is tired of being viewed as an international pariah. The Bosnian Serbs also see that the Bosnian Government, thanks in part to a new federation with Croatia, is in the strongest military position it has held in two years.
 American officials asserted that the Bosnian Government, which now controls less than 30 percent of the country, should look longingly at a plan offering them 51 percent.
A senior American official said today's communique offered the Muslims not just quantity of land, but also quality. The official said it was important that Russia had endorsed a plan saying the final arrangement for Bosnia should provide the country "with viable, realistic and reasonable territory."
 With such a formula and with 51 percent of the land, the official said, the Bosnian Government should be able to regain much of the conquered territory in the east and north that it so eagerly wants back.
 "We have to get the best possible solution for the Bosnian Government," the American official said. But no proposal for actual boundaries was made today.

Iran Said to Violate Embargo
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 13 (AP) -- Iran has smuggled material for making weapons to the Bosnian Government in violation of a 1991 United Nations arms embargo on all sides in the war, a senior Bosnian Army official confirmed today.
 The Bosnian Army also received a large shipment of antitank rockets delivered to Croatia by a Brazilian ship, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official could not say whether the rockets had come from Iran or another source. He said further weapons shipments were expected.
 Four convoys carried the rockets and explosives to central Bosnia in the last few days after Bosnian Croats took a one-third cut of the arms, he said.
 He said the Bosnian Army previously lacked good antitank rockets in fighting Bosnian Serb troops, who had received heavy weapons from the Yugoslav Army when the Bosnian war broke out more than two years ago.
 The Washington Post reported today that Iran had delivered about 60 tons of explosives and materials for making ammunition to Croatia's capital, Zagreb, last week.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Clinton's Remarks Announcing His Selection for Top Court

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's remarks announcing his selection of Judge Stephen G. Breyer for the Supreme Court, as recorded by The New York Times:
 Today I am proud to nominate Judge Stephen Breyer to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
 I believe a President can best serve our country by nominating a candidate to the Supreme Court whose experience manifests the qualities in a Justice that matter most: Excellence. Excellence in knowledge, excellence in judgment, excellence in devotion to the Constitution, to the country and to the real people.
 It is a duty best exercised wisely and not in haste.
I have reflected on this decision now for the last several weeks, about 37 days. I have been well served by the White House counsel, Lloyd Cutler, and the other members of our legal staff, who have worked very hard; by our chief of staff, Mr. McLarty, who has kept the process going in an orderly way, and by others who worked on it. We have worked hard to achieve the pursuit of excellence.
 In that pursuit, I came again to Judge Breyer, who serves today, as most of you know, as the chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. And I will nominate him to be the Supreme Court's 108th Justice.
 Without dispute he is one of the outstanding jurists of our age. He has a clear grasp of the law, a boundless respect for the constitutional and legal rights of the American people, a searching and restless intellect and a remarkable ability to explain complex subjects in understandable terms. He has proven that he can build an effective consensus and get people of diverse views to work together for justice's sake. He's a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford, a graduate of Oxford University, a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School. He served the late Justice Goldberg as a law clerk, spent two years in the antitrust division of the Justice Department and served as chief counsel of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where he had the opportunity to work with senators of both parties.
 Judge Breyer has had a private law practice, has written dozens of scholarly articles published in distinguished law reviews and legal texts, and he's been a member of the Federal Sentencing Commission. For more than a decade, he's served with true distinction on the U.S. Court of Appeals in the First Circuit. His writings, in areas ranging from the interpretation of legislation and analysis of the sentencing guidelines to the underpinnings of regulation and the interplay of economics and the law, reveal a keen and vital mind. His record displays a thirst for justice. His career personifies both public service and patriotism.
 As you know, I had a wealth of talent to choose from in making this nomination. In addition to Judge Breyer, whom I considered very seriously for this position the last time I had a Supreme Court appointment, I'd like to take just a moment to comment on two of the gentlemen who made this decision a difficult one for me.
 Secretary Babbitt was Attorney General and Governor of his state, during that time a colleague of mine. He was a candidate for the Presidency in a race which, everyone acknowledged, raised the serious and substantive issues of the day. He has been a very effective Secretary of the Interior for me, one of the most sensitive, complex and difficult posts in this Administration. He would bring to the Court the responsibility and discipline of service in public life. He would bring forth a feel for law at the state level and, most important, perhaps, for life at the grass roots.
 Although I know he would be a good addition -- indeed, a superb addition -- to the Court, frankly I came to the same conclusion I have every time I've thought about him: I couldn't bear to lose him from the Cabinet, from his service at Interior, from his service as an adviser to me and a vital and leading member of our domestic policy team.
 Judge Richard Arnold, the chief judge of the Eighth Circuit, has been a friend of mine for a long time. I have the greatest respect for his intellect, for his role as a jurist and for his extraordinary character. I think a measure of the devotion and the admiration in which he is held is evidenced by the fact that somewhere around 100 judges, one-eighth of the entire Federal bench, wrote me endorsing his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
 But, as has been widely reported in the press, Judge Arnold has cancer and is now undergoing a course of treatment. I have every confidence that that treatment will be successful. And if I am fortunate enough to have other opportunities to make appointments to the Court, I know I will be able to consider Judge Arnold at the top of the list.
 Five decades ago Judge Learned Hand defined the spirit of liberty as the spirit which seeks to understand the mind of other men and women, the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own bias, the spirit which lies hidden in the aspirations of us all. When our citizens hear about Judge Breyer's nomination and learn about his background and beliefs, I believe they will join me in saying, Here is someone touched by that spirit of liberty, who believes in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, who is graced with the intellectual capacity and the good judgment a Supreme Court Justice ought to have, and whose background and temperament clearly qualify him to be an outstanding Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
 So I will send his nomination to the Senate for confirmation with great pride and high hopes.
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, when you had foregone the opportunity to name someone with greater political experience, such as Secretary Babbitt, what makes you think that Judge Breyer will be able to reshape the Court or forge a new consensus?
 A. I think Judge Breyer actually has quite a lot of political savvy, and I would say two things:
 First of all, as you know, in our talks about Senator Mitchell, I would not have offered the position to Senator Mitchell if he were running for re-election and were willing to stay as majority leader of the Senate. And I felt the same way in the end about Secretary Babbitt. I mean, here's a man that is dealing with issues of incredible magnitude, especially in the West, a very important part of our country. And so I just couldn't bear to think about that.
 And then the more I thought about Steve Breyer and the time I spent with him last time I had a vacancy on the Court, the more I realized he had proved that he had the kind of political capacity and judgment we need, because he'd been exposed to the full range of issues working here as the chief of staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He obviously has a lot of political skills because of his reputation as a consensus builder on a court where most of the appointees were made by Republican Presidents. And look at the people supporting his nomination. He's got Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch together. I wish I had that kind of political skill.
 
. . .
 Q. In the end, why do you think that there was so much -- maybe it's our fault as much as it is your aides' fault -- so much confusion in which direction you were leaning? Earlier in the week, we thought Secretary Babbitt had the best choice. Then later it was Judge Arnold. Now, of course, you've made your decision.
 A. Because you all didn't talk to me. When we have these appointments that only I make, especially for something -- with all respect to my aides -- I think I know as much or more about it as they do. And I told you all, they work hard for me, and they do a wonderful job. There's an enormous amount of work to do.
 But one of the best jobs I ever had was teaching the Constitution of the United States to law students. I care a lot about the Supreme Court. I read people's opinions. I read articles. I read letters that people send me about the respective candidates. I think about this a lot, and I care very deeply about it. And I was going to take whatever time I had to take to think this through. In the course of those conversations with my staff, I always tried to take -- when we get down to the finals, where I'm down to three or four finals -- I try to take every strong suit I can about a candidate and work through every weakness. We worked through it.
 But I think -- you know, on these Supreme Court cases, we may never get another appointment -- but if I get another one, you're just going to have to ride along with me, because in the end I'm going to make the decision.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up vs. Yen on Move To Resume Talks on Trade

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday amid new efforts by the United States and Japan to resume trade talks.
Contributing to the dollar's rise were a modest rally in the bond market and speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. 
 The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa of Japan agreed during a phone call to try to resume formal trade talks, which broke off in February. They also agreed that preliminary talks should start before the leaders from the Group of Seven industrial nations met in Naples in July.
Many traders bought dollars after Mr. Kantor's office issued a statement on the developments, betting that the Clinton Administration would no longer favor a policy of allowing the yen to strengthen in currency markets as a way to curb Japanese exports.
 
Up Against Mark, Too
 "Kantor's announcement gave the market a clearer idea of the Clinton Administration's plans for trade with Japan," said Jack Stapleton, senior corporate foreign-exchange dealer at the Standard Chartered Bank. "That really helped the dollar."
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 104.95 yen, from 104.32 yen late Thursday. The dollar also rose to 1.6700 German marks, from 1.6656 marks.
Mr. Kantor's comments are the latest sign that the United States is done with its tacit strong-yen policy, traders said. A stronger yen would help curb Japan's trade surplus by making the country's exports more expensive.
"Optimism about trade helped the dollar rise against the yen," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, who remains skeptical about the dollar's prospects. She said the dollar would not sustain gains against the yen unless the Japanese economy rebounded, spurring demand for American exports.
The dollar was also buoyed by gains in the bond market. Bond prices rose after the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in April, suggesting inflation was under control.
The dollar is likely to record further gains if the Federal Reserve, as expected, raises interest rates next week by a large enough margin to assuage some investors' concern about inflation, said Michael Faust, international portfolio manager for Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif.

HEADLINE: Aging Dept. Privatizes 4 Contracts For Services

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has given a national for-profit company four contracts to provide city services to elderly people, saying the company can do the work cheaper than the four nonprofit groups that have been offering those services.
The decision has prompted protests from some elderly residents and City Council members, who say the four neighborhood-based organizations will now be forced to lay off dozens of employees and scale back the other services they provide. 
 The $1 million contract was awarded to Personal-Touch, a for-profit company with 23 offices across the country, by the Department of Aging. While the decision affects just four local organizations and involves a relatively small amount of money in the city's $31 billion budget, the controversy illustrates the difficult choices -- and consequences -- of trying to balance the city's budget and scale back government spending by opening up the competition for providing services..
 
Campaign Cornerstone
 The Giuliani administration, facing a projected $2.3 billion deficit in the budget for the next fiscal year, says it has been looking for ways to shave costs in every quarter of municipal spending. Moreover, the concept of widening the competition for functions performed on behalf of government was a cornerstone of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign last year.
Herbert W. Stupp, the Commissioner of the Department of Aging, said that the decision to award the contract to a corporation operating for profit resulted from an analysis that the company could provide the same services for 12.5 percent less than the four neighborhood nonprofit groups.
But several City Council members and officials of the organizations that are now losing those contracts say the decision will hurt not only their agencies, but also the level of service received by their elderly clients.
The four contracts cover a number of home care services currently provided by four centers for the elderly in Brooklyn and Queens to enable elderly people to remain independent -- from helping with shopping to assisting with chores. The nonprofit groups will continue to provide other services, including operating the centers for the elderly and providing meals there.
Mr. Stupp said that the department had no ideological preference for for-profit companies and that of eight contracts that had been awarded recently, four went to nonprofit organizations. But he said Personal-Touch was selected for its contracts because it could provide equal service at a savings of 12.5 percent.
Cheryl Heiberg, executive director of the Bay Ridge Center for Older Adults, said her agency will lose a $270,000 contract to provide home care services for the elderly. "We have had contracts with the city for 15 years," she said. "This action takes the services out of the community so that seniors can't come to our center and address all their needs."
Ms. Heiberg added that the loss of the contract will mean that her organization will have to lay off 15 of its 42 employees. "And these are older women who are not all that well off and probably won't get rehired because of their ages," she said.
Councilman Sal Albanese of Brooklyn said, "It is outrageous that community-based senior providers with excellent records of service to their communities have been perfunctorily terminated."
Mr. Albanese and several officials of the nonprofit health care organizations said the savings were not worth the inconvenience for elderly people and the pain that would be created for the groups' employees.
David N. Slifkin, chief financial officer of the Personal-Touch Home Care Corporation, said that as a larger company with 12,000 employees and 23 offices in 12 states, Personal-Touch had been able to achieve economies of scale and lower overhead costs.
The company, which has its headquarters in Jamaica, Queens, already has several contracts with New York City, most of them with the Human Resources Administration. The new contracts become effective on July 1.

HEADLINE: Watershed Police Protect What New York City Drinks

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y.

 BODY:
The facade of the Mount Pleasant Corporate Center, all silver walls and mirrored windows, was sleek and futuristic, and the lush lawn in front led down to a pretty little pond with heather draped over the stone walls around the water.
But floating on the surface, right under a drainage pipe, was a white sudsy substance that Ronald A. Gatto didn't like the looks of, especially when he considered where it was going: from the pond into Malcolm Brook, then to the Kensico Reservoir, and from there to the taps of nearly nine million people in New York City and Westchester County. 
 Mr. Gatto is the Lieutenant of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's Watershed Police, a small band of scouts posted by the city to watch a 2,000-square-mile area that collects more than a billion gallons of water a day. The police work cooperatively with a force of civilian inspectors, walking or driving every highway, street, fire road and cow path in the watershed, looking for trouble.
 
Septic Systems and Road Salt
 From the emissions of office buildings, septic systems and industrial plants to such suburban staples as tree cutting and road salting, human activity increasingly threatens water. As warm weather approaches, the worry becomes greater: last summer the city had to tell residents of several neighborhoods to boil their drinking water because of bacteria.
Lieutenant Gatto, the senior uniformed officer of the 29-member force, is at the heart of a systematic inspection program begun last year, part of a sometimes ambivalent struggle by the city to watch what it drinks. The reasons are driven by economics as much as health: if the water is not clean enough, the Federal Government will require the city to build a filtration plant, which would drive up water bills throughout the city.
The force was originally set up in 1906, at twice the size it is now, to protect the dams, gate houses and other property of the water systems. Now its mission also includes protecting the environment, and that, some critics say, is where it is not doing enough.
 
Stepping on Toes
 In its first 84 years, it made no environmental arrests at all, and Lieutenant Gatto testified before city officials three years ago that he was told by superiors in the city's Department of Environmental Protection to go easy on polluters dumping sewage into tributaries of the reservoirs.
In some cases, enforcing the rules can mean stepping on the toes of upstate legislators, whose help in Albany is essential on other city issues. The police also know that some polluters are not venal robber barons, just homeowners, often hard up for cash, whose septic systems need fixing.
But John Melia, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said that the city was tough when appropriate. "As a matter of philosophy, we are gung ho on enforcement and will not tolerate criminal activity or civil violations," he said. "That is our hard and fast stand."
Since 1990 there have been 185 "major pollution arrests," said Michael Collins, the Commissioner of the watershed police, all resulting in fines or penalties, even if criminal citations are often knocked down to civil violations.
 
One Person Imprisoned
 Only one person has gone to jail, a Bronx man who was working as a home improvement contractor in Ossining, and was caught early one Sunday in October 1990 by Mr. Gatto, then a detective sergeant, as he was tossing wallboard, tile and plumbing fixtures from his van down an embankment into a reservoir in Cortland.
The man laughed at a judge when told what he was being charged with, Lieutenant Gatto said; he served five days until he came up with $5,000 in bail, and was eventually fined $2,500.
"Gatto probably today has arrested more polluters than any other police officer in the world," said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who specializes in water issues. "He can smell a leaking septic tank from a moving car. He arrests everyone; he's arrested his friends."
This is true.
Mr. Gatto once arrested an old friend of his family, the owner of the Katonah Restaurant, in Katonah, who had rigged his septic holding tanks to flood into the street when it rained -- sending 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of raw sewage each month heading for the Muscoot Reservoir 175 feet away.
The police got complaints of the smell, but the real tip-off was the records supplied by the company that pumped his septic tanks, which showed that the tanks had been pumped four to six times a month for years, at a cost of $300 to $400 each time, but suddenly were being pumped only once or twice a month.
The man pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and paid $20,000 in fines, Lieutenant Gatto said.
That was a major find, but mostly the battle is gallon by gallon.
For instance, at the corporate center in Mount Pleasant, there were the suds, and the building manager insisted that they were in fact just that: suds, from cars being washed in a parking lot.
Lieutenant Gatto was unconvinced. "We should take a sample; who knows what he dumped in there?" he said.
(The material turned out to be soap suds, but the laboratory also found a coliform bacteria count that was unusually high. Lieutenant Gatto decided to take additional samples in the future.)
 
Help From Fishermen
 The police say that fishermen are their allies, often providing the first reports of pollution.
Tipped off by Trout Unlimited, a fishing group, about a smelly, milky substance intermittently appearing in the Croton River, a tributary to the Croton Reservoir, Lieutenant Gatto eventually found the source, an eight-inch cement pipe. That led to Brewster Honda, where new cars were being washed with a solvent to remove a protective coating.
"What is this chemical?" Lieutenant Gatto asked the manager.
"It's O.K.," was the answer.
"But what's this chemical?" Lieutenant Gatto said.
"It's O.K.," the manager said again.
Sure enough, it was a liquid called It's Okay Solvent, but it was not O.K.
A check with the manufacturer, Ardex Laboratories of Philadelphia, showed that the solvent is an eye and skin irritant, which can cause convulsions and severe nausea in high enough doses. The building owner paid a $5,000 fine.

HEADLINE: Positive Inflation Report Fails to Inspire Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The Government further underscored its good economic news of Thursday with another favorable inflation report yesterday, this time involving consumer prices.
But traders reacted as if it was old news, and the leading stock indexes barely budged in trading volume that was below average.
The exception was the over-the-counter market, where high-technology stocks were hurt by a troubled industry outlook for computers. Cisco Systems, a big producer of equipment that allows computers to talk to each other, said its backlog of orders had fallen sharply. Shares of Cisco fell 5 3/4, to 23 1/4, in Nasdaq trading yesterday. 
 Don Hays, an investment strategist for Wheat First Butcher & Singer in Richmond, said the sharp downturn for Cisco and other computer-networking stocks signaled the "beginning of the end" of the down market.
Cisco and others had been among the last of the strong market performers, and their rout meant the market was about to turn. "It could be as soon as next week," Mr. Hays said.
 
Computer Stocks Active
 The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 2.69 points, to 716.92, and the computer-related stocks saw the most active trading. Cisco, Intel, Microsoft and Wellfleet were the top four stocks in terms of trading volume.
The problems began on Thursday when Cisco reported its third-quarter earnings after the markets closed. The profits of the company, while healthy, did not exceed analysts' estimates and its backlog had shrunk, casting a pall on the outlook for much of the industry. About 45 million shares of Cisco -- nearly a fifth of its total shares -- changed hands yesterday.
Traders continued to look ahead to Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates in an effort to slow down an economy that shows some signs of speeding up, but few signs of inflation.
Alan R. Ackerman, stock market strategist with Reich & Company, said the reaction of the market yesterday "was so mild because people are waiting for the Fed to meet."
 
Strong Economic Growth
 The Consumer Price Index yesterday confirmed what the Producer Price Index had indicated a day earlier. The message is that the economy continues to grow strongly, but without inflation, especially in a month without snowstorms, earthquakes or other events to distort the numbers.
The Labor Department reported that April consumer prices rose by one-tenth of 1 percent, while Wall Street economists had expected a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent. The more closely watched core rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was two-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the anticipated three-tenths of 1 percent.
Inflation hurts the value of current bonds and raises the borrowing costs for corporations, thus undermining the value of their stocks. Both markets should have rallied strongly with the new data, and the markets did at first, but then sank, and struggled to close at their opening levels.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.84 points, to 3,659.68, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.39 point, to 444.14.
 
G.E. Stock Rises
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.21 point, to 245.76, on volume of 252.1 million shares, about 17 percent less than this year's average volume of 304 million shares. Declining stocks barely outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,091 to 1,033. The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.78 point, to 432.57.
Of the 30 component stocks of the Dow industrials, only 12 rose in price, led by General Electric, which rose 1 5/8, to 95 3/8. There was no big news, although Quaker State agreed to sell its Heritage Insurance Group to G.E. for $85 million.
Of the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, 224 rose, led by Philip Morris, which rose 1 5/8, to 52 1/8, on heavy volume of more than 3.7 million shares. Philip Morris was up for the second day, possibly because of traders' speculation that the company's directors may decide to spin off the tobacco business later this month.
Tokyo stocks traded higher yesterday. At the close, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 46.51 points, or 0.23 percent, at 20,270.75.11 points.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Confirming that inflation remains subdued, consumer prices scarcely budged in April. Nonetheless, the financial world is still bracing for an expected increase in interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday.
"These figures look very good," said Michael L. Penzer, senior economist at the Bank of America, referring to today's Government report showing that consumer prices rose just one-tenth of a percent last month. It is very hard, he added, to find evidence of acceleration. 
 Most analysts said they continued to think the Fed would raise short-term interest rates again next week, but some said that they thought today's price report, combined with Thursday's news of vanished inflation at the producer level and sluggish retail sales, might temper the Fed's action.
"It might now be difficult to push by 50 basis points" -- half a percentage point -- on the overnight private-sector lending rate, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation, a banking group based in Minneapolis. "The burden is on those who think inflation will be a problem."
Mr. Penzer, for his part, rated the choice between a half-point rise and another quarter-point increase "a tossup."
Bond prices ended moderately higher today after the inflation report was released, pushing interest rates lower. [Page 47.]
Economists recognize that the Fed is looking forward while the inflation data are history; the services component of the Consumer Price Index, in fact, is an official "lagging" indicator of the state of the economy.
Analysts also noted that the central bank would be evaluating figures on industrial production for last month, a statistical series that the Fed itself compiles and that will be published on Monday.
Some economists worry that the Fed's pre-emptive policy, aimed at preventing a resurgence of inflation many months from now, or perhaps a year in the future, threatens the well-being of the economy.
"At some point the Fed has to take a breather," a senior Congressional economist, a Democrat who insisted that he not be identified, said this evening. "Either right now or after their next increase the Fed should call it off for a while."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, a senior Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, was among the liberals who even before this week's batch of favorable figures was forcefully insisting that the Fed should not be raising rates in the absence of a visible threat of rising prices. An attempt to reach him tonight for comment was unsuccessful.
The Clinton Administration welcomed today's Labor Department report, which was more positive than nearly all analysts expected, but did not use it as an argument against further Fed tightening.
"I'm encouraged by what we see in the numbers," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen after addressing a meeting of the Business Council in Williamsburg, Va. When asked whether the surge in long-term interest rates had slowed the expansion, Mr. Bentsen said, "At this level, I don't see that."
In a briefing for reporters at the White House, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, called inflation "well contained" and noted that for the 12 months through April both the core Consumer Price Index and the core Producer Price Index had posted their slimmest advances in 20 years.
Core rates, which exclude the wide-swinging food and energy categories, are considered the best gauges of price trends.
 
No Change in Housing
 The April rise of one-tenth of a percent, which followed increases of three-tenths of a percent in March and February, reflected a downturn in energy prices and no change in the heavily weighted housing sector.
Moreover, grocery-store food prices were unchanged last month and have now declined so far this year by 1.7 percent at an annual rate.
On the other hand, medical costs climbed six-tenths of a percent last month, the biggest increase in almost a year and twice as big as any monthly rise since October. The hefty increase was spread across all major components -- drugs and supplies, services and hospitals -- but analysts said one month's results were not enough to tell whether a long downward trend in medical inflation might be ending.
In transportation, where the overall rise was a modest three-tenths of a percent, the costs of buying a car climbed substantially for a third month. Finance charges were the biggest factor, jumping 2.3 percent, the most in more than five years.
Used-car prices advanced eight-tenths of a percent and new vehicles rose four-tenths of a percent. Additional increases for new cars have been announced and will show up in later Consumer Price Index data.
 
Tyson Sees an 'Uptick'
 Another reason for expecting some rebound for the next index reading is an upward recent march in the price of oil.
Ms. Tyson today predicted a "gradual and small uptick" in the inflation rate as the business expansion continued and further shrank the gap between the economy's actual and potential growth. She estimated that this gap had been cut in half, to 1 percent, over the last year.
The rise in core prices for April was two-tenths of a percent, today's report also showed, with the 12-month rate edging down to 2.8 percent from 2.9 in March.
Services, which account for about 56 percent of the index, rose two-tenths of a percent last month, while commodities, the rest of the index, rose a tenth of a percent.
In a related report, average weekly earnings edged up one-tenth of a percent last month after adjustment for inflation and seasonality, the Labor Department said.
The Commerce Department also reported that business inventories eased two-tenths of a percent in March, as business sales jumped 1.1 percent, a second straight solid gain.
"With stock-to-sales ratios exceedingly low," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, "we should see higher production and employment in the coming months, assuming consumers keep reaching for their wallets."

HEADLINE: 3 in Senate Race Bank on Primary Upset

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 12

 BODY:
The June 7 primary election in New Jersey is just a blip on the screen for the two major candidates for United States Senator, but for three lesser-known and less affluent candidates it's the big show.
Frank R. Lautenberg, the Democratic incumbent who made it official Monday that he is seeking a third term, and Chuck Haytaian, the Republican who is Speaker of the State Assembly, are each expected to raise and spend $5 million to $10 million on their campaigns. Meanwhile, the candidates hoping to trip them up next month talk about raising enough to print some handbills and, if things break their way, to produce a radio commercial. 
 All three of those candidates admit they couldn't hope to win their party's nomination in a contest that depended on spending heavily, but they say they are banking on presenting ideas attractive enough to pull votes from the front-runners, whose campaigns thus far have consisted chiefly of ignoring the primary while they try to catch each another in political gaffes.
Mr. Haytaian's opponent for the Republican nomination is Brian T. Kennedy of Sea Girt, a lawyer who spent 10 years in the State Assembly and Senate through 1984. Mr. Lautenberg is being opposed by Bill Campbell of North Plainfield, an engineer, and Lynne A. Speed of Ridgefield Park, a follower of the political extremist and perennial Presidential candidate Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
Neither Mr. Campbell nor Mrs. Speed has held public office, although both have waged campaigns in the past. Mr. Campbell ran unsuccessfully for Congress as an independent in the Seventh District in Union County and Mrs. Speed lost a bid for the party's nomination to run for the State Assembly in Essex County. Mrs. Speed works as a coordinator of sales and distribution for Hamilton Distribution Systems Inc. in Ridgefield Park, which circulates two LaRouche publications.
Mr. Kennedy's campaign suffered something of a setback last month when the Republican State Committee endorsed Mr. Haytaian instead of adopting its usual neutral position in a party primary.
"They think he can raise the money he'll need on his own, and that's all they're interested in," Mr. Kennedy said of the state leadership's decision. "My problem is easy to define but difficult to do, get my message out to the 225,000 Republican voters who will pick the nominee."
The message is a call for reversing what Mr. Kennedy says is the deterioration of the quality of life in New Jersey and across the nation, which he attributes to crime, drugs and a loss of family values. "When I was in the Legislature the concern was 'why Johnny can't read or write,' " the 60- year-old former lawmaker said. "Now it's 'why Johnny can't tell right from wrong.' "
 
Industrial Program
 "This is a good time to be running," said Mr. Campbell, who is 39. "Being an incumbent these days is not the advantage it usually is.
"If government leaders had been doing a good job over the last 12 years we'd be in better shape," he said. "The public is tired of seeing people lose their jobs and their homes, and we have to ask, 'Are they getting good representation?' I don't think so."
Mr. Campbell said the Federal Government must reverse the decline in the country's manufacturing sector by assisting private companies without dictating to them. "It's a delicate balance, but we should adopt a team approach, like they have in Japan," Mr. Campbell said.
"When the auto companies had to clean up their exhaust systems because of clean-air standards, they had to do their research independently, and it put American Motors out of business and almost did the same to Chrysler," he said. "If they could have set up a separate corporation and shared the cost, it would have made more sense."
Mrs. Speed says the solution to the country's economic problems is to invest more in industrial technology. She also advocates putting the Federal Reserve System back under the control of Congress. "Then it could be directed to make credit available at low interest rates to small and medium-sized businesses and to finance infrastructure improvements, including highways, energy facilities and port development, which would be important to New Jersey," she said.
Mrs. Speed, who is 40, said she didn't know how much she would be able to spend on her campaign and was hoping that some organizations would set up public debates for the candidates.
 
Getting Attention
 "Today so many candidates are like cereal boxes: they have everything to do with packaging and nothing to do with content," she said. "We have many, many problems, and they exist because of the failure of the American people to look at certain key issues in more depth."
The three challengers to the front-runners plan to spend as much time as they can before June 7 on the streets with their handbills and their requests for support. Mr. Campbell said that if he can get more people interested in voting in the primary, or force public officials to work a little harder, he will consider his campaign a success.
Getting people's attention is the first hurdle. Mr. Kennedy, who believes schools must teach ethics and morals to help stop the rise in teen-age pregnancies and curb violence, and who favors tough prison sentences for habitual offenders, handed out campaign flyers at the Sea Girt Mall on a recent afternoon.
Mary Eichhorn of Sea Girt took the flyer and glanced at it. She said she might vote for Mr. Kennedy. "But I haven't made up my mind," she said. "I'm working more right now on putting a golf ball."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Low-Cost Ways to Tend Portfolios Over Time

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
NO one much likes the middle of things. Gardeners like to plant and harvest, but who wants to weed midseason? Investors are no different, and now they have a few low-cost aids, offered by mutual funds, to help tend assets as they grow.
The help is needed; neglect can be very risky in investing. Steven Janachowski, a financial adviser in San Francisco, tells of a retired couple, both doctors, with an $800,000 portfolio they need for income. Unmonitored for years, the assets are "about 70 percent in mostly speculative equities," he said. "Hardly an income portfolio." And because equities usually return more than other investments, unwatched portfolios tend to get stock-heavy -- the reverse of what experts advise as retirement or other goal nears. 
 "Inattention can wreak havoc," said Stuart Kessler, an accountant and planner with Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company in New York.
But George Markle, a retired executive for the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in Dallas, has no such havoc and pays nothing for it. While many investors -- if they can pony up $100,000 or $200,000 -- pay planners, brokers or funds up to 3 percent of assets each year to monitor and help adjust their holdings, Mr. Markle uses the free Stein Roe Counselor program, which has attracted $261 million since it began a year ago. It can be reached at (800) 322-8222.
For a $50,000 minimum, these investors get a personal representative to help apportion their assets among 15 of Stein Roe's no-load mutual funds. The representative will also track the holdings, call investors quarterly or monthly and recommend portfolio adjustments as markets move or as investors' needs change. With a personal "800" number, the adviser is easily reached.
When interest rates began to rise in February, Mr. Markle and his representative, Kelly Dehler, adjusted one of his accounts, a $102,000 holding. Municipal bonds made up 69 percent of the $102,000, but as rates began to climb the two reduced this tax-exempt portion to 55 percent.
For Mr. Markle, such timely adjustments are crucial. "Not to keep tabs on things is dumb," he said. But he finds the job impossible to do alone. Timothy K. Armour, president of Stein Roe Mutual Funds, is not surprised. "We researched our clients," he said. "What they wanted most was useful, ongoing guidance."
In March, the Wells Fargo Bank introduced five Lifepath Funds, which use fund design, not personal counseling, to aid in continuing portfolio adjustment. Each fund has a date -- from 2000 to 2040, in 10-year increments. An investor who must withdraw or begin to withdraw money in, say, 2030, would choose the Lifepath fund with that designation.
Some funds besides Lifepath are also time-limited, like the Benham Target Maturities series and the Scudder Zero Coupon 2000 fund. But most of them are bond-only investments with fixed portfolios.
Lifepath funds invest in stocks, bonds and cash through 14 different indexes. Most importantly, the funds adjust their holdings over time, focusing on growth in the early years and on safety later. (A fund will seek mainly income after its date passes.)
In other words, Lifepath funds, with $60 million so far, relieve investors of a major reason for monitoring investments: the passage of time. If Mr. Janachowski's doctors used Lifepath, the fund would have automatically toned down the risk in their go-go portfolio as they aged. And, like Stein Roe's Counselor, Lifepath has easy-to-meet requirements. The minimum investment is $1,000, and the funds are no-loads with a common expense ratio of 1.2 percent. The number is (800) 222-8222.
"It's financial planning for regular people," said Dudley Nigg, executive vice president of Wells Fargo.
Critics say Lifepath may be too simple. New jobs, marriage, parenthood, inheritances and other changes also affect portfolios, said John Markese of the American Association of Individual Investors. Lifepath can be "dangerous," he said, if it lulls investors into thinking "they can ignore the fund for 20 years."
Software, offered by many mutual funds, is another easy, low-cost way to update portfolios, Mr. Markese added. Investors need only punch in current data, and the computer model will adjust the recommended strategy. Two examples are Fidelity's Thinkware (800) 544-3703 and Vanguard's Retirement Planner (800) 876-1840. Both cost $15 and are available in I.B.M.-compatible form.
The trick, though, is to find a way to insure the software is used every year or two. A tip: Put it on top of your tax records.
Will the funds soon market other low-cost aids for the periodic pruning of assets? If Stein Roe and Wells Fargo succeed, "there'll be dozens," Mr. Janachowski said. "There's a hole in the market."
Indeed, many funds, including Fidelity, Dreyfus and Stein Roe, know investors want more service and already run programs that compete directly with many planners and, to some extent, with the pricier "wrap" programs offered by brokers. For accounts with at least $100,000 to $200,000, and maximum annual fees of 1 percent of assets, the funds actively manage holdings in light of changing markets and investor needs.
Like the new low-cost alternatives, these programs restrict investment choices to the offering family's funds. But, unlike the Stein Roe Counselor, these programs usually give fund managers the power to shift assets without investor approval.
The broader lesson in all this? Investment is not a clock, said Jay Schabacker of Schabacker Investment Management in Rockville, Md. "You can't set it and forget it."

HEADLINE: German Giant Sets Job Cuts

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 13

 BODY:
The troubled German conglomerate Metallgesellschaft A.G. will cut 7,500 jobs this year as part of its effort to save more than four billion marks ($2.4 billion) in costs.
The company's chairman, Karl-Josef Neukirchen, outlined the measures in a recent company newsletter. Metallgesellschaft, which has interests in natural resources, trading and engineering, will sell several subsidiaries in a bid to raise one billion marks. 
 Mr. Neukirchen said the payroll reductions should cut yearly labor costs by 550 million marks. As of Sept. 30, Metallgesellschaft, one of Germany's biggest companies, had 43,000 employees.
A financial crisis touched off by huge oil-trading losses at the company's New York-based Metallgesellschaft Corporation unit led to the dismissals in December of the former chairman, Heinz Schimmelbusch, and five executives. Mr. Neukirchen replaced Mr. Schimmelbusch.
In January, creditor banks approved a $2 billion package to keep the company out of bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:

Savings Bond Guarantee
I purchased Series EE Savings Bonds before Nov. 1, 1986, when the minimum guaranteed interest rate was 7.5 percent. If these bonds are kept beyond the 10-year maturity, do they retain the 7.5 percent guarantee? LOUIS MYERSON, Bronx, N.Y.
Since the original maturity of your United States Savings Bonds was 10 years, they are scheduled to enter a 10-year extended maturity period in 1996. During that period, the guaranteed minimum rate on the bonds will be the same as for new issues during that time. The guaranteed rate is now 4 percent. The actual rate on your bonds, however, may be higher than the guaranteed rate. 
 "Bonds held five years or longer receive the minimum rate or the market-based average rate, whichever is higher," said Peter Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of the Public Debt. "A comparison is made between the market-based average rate and the minimum rates in effect over the life of the bond in determining the yield."
This market-based rate changes every six months, and was reset the first of this month to 4.7 percent.
 
Exercising Stock Options
Will options that are in the money on the expiration date be automatically exercised? SIDNEY KRANE, Colonia, N.J.
A call option is in the money when the strike price -- the price at which the stock may be purchased if the option is exercised -- is less than the market price of the underlying security. A put option is in the money when the strike price -- the price at which the stock may be sold -- is greater than the market price.
"Options are not always exercised automatically at expiration," said Tom Curran, vice president of York Securities. "Equity options that are three-quarters of a point or more in the money will be automatically exercised. So will nonequity options that are one-quarter of a point or more in the money."
 
I.R.A.'s and Estates
Will the value placed on I.R.A. assets for estate tax purposes be reduced to take into account the fact that income taxes will be paid on these assets when distributed to the beneficiaries? EUGENE E. BEYER JR., Manhattan
The full value of an individual retirement account is included in someone's gross estate at the time of death. When the money in an inherited I.R.A. is distributed, it is reported on the beneficiary's income tax return for the year received.
"An itemized deduction is allowed for a portion of the estate tax paid on the I.R.A. account balance," following a complex formula, said Joel S. Isaacson, president of Joel Isaacson & Company, a New York financial planning firm. "The deduction is not subject to the 2 percent limit on miscellaneous itemized deductions."
He added, "If the beneficiary is the decedent's surviving spouse and that spouse rolls over the distribution into another I.R.A., the distribution is not currently income-taxed."

HEADLINE: Construction Below, Opposition Above

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
PERHAPS because land-use battles are tough to fight hundreds of feet underground, New York City's third water tunnel has faced little organized opposition as it has bored through the boroughs.
But an enterprise of such colossal scale was bound to get snagged somewhere. And at the Bulova Corporate Center in Jackson Heights, Queens, the tunnel's second stage has reached its first major impasse. More rough going can be expected in the West Village and lower Manhattan, too. 
 The tunnel's second stage has an 11-mile leg in Queens and Brooklyn and a 5-mile leg in Manhattan. It will cost about $1.5 billion. Tunneling began in 1986 and is to finish in 2002, according to the Department of Environmental Protection, which engineered and oversees the project. The $1.2 billion first stage, which runs 13 miles through the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens, was begun in 1970 and is nearing completion.
It is not the tunnel itself at issue. After all, in some places it is nearly as far below ground as the Woolworth Building is high. Also, since the need is almost universally acknowledged, a "Numby" movement -- not under my backyard -- has yet to coalesce.
Instead, what is at issue are the sites selected for the enormous shafts that rise from the tunnel. Although they leave little evidence behind when finished, the shafts take years to build and require construction staging areas that can spread over acres.
That is what angers the neighbors, tenants and owners of the Bulova center, a successful commercial development in what used to be the headquarters and factory of the Bulova Watch Company. They are protesting plans by the city to situate two shafts on the property, near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and across 25th Avenue from the Lexington School for the Deaf.
Opponents have been joined in their fight by Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens and by City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who represents the district. He would pose a formidable obstacle when the matter comes to the Council for approval, which it will do after the City Planning Commission votes on it next month.
Mr. Vallone said last week that the choice of a site in a neighborhood of small homes was "absurd on the face of it."
Marilyn Gelber, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said the agency was "very vigorously" examining other sites. But she will not withdraw the application from review by the planning commission.
"There may be, at the end of the day, no acceptable alternatives," Ms. Gelber said. "I'm hopeful we will find an alternate site. I'm not foreclosing any possibility. But I'm not about to pull the plug unless I understand that we have a good alternative."
Having visited the Bulova center recently, Commissioner Gelber said: "What they're doing out there is critical to the New York City economy and I'm not looking to jeopardize it. But I understand, from a technical basis, why we came to the conclusion that this site would have less impact than others."
"STAGE one went under a whole host of sensitive structures in Manhattan and they didn't know we were under them," said Glen E. Vogel, deputy commissioner of environmental protection and director of environmental engineering.
But residents of El Rosario, a complex of two-family homes in the East Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, definitely knew about Shaft 20B, at Seigel and White Streets. In 1990, a blowout about 500 feet below ground caused minor damage, like cracks in party walls, to several units. "For a couple of months, there was a lot of hysteria" among homeowners, said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, which helped develop the project. The problems have since been resolved, she said.
"If everything goes perfectly, there will be a minimal amount of disruption," said Shelly S. Friedman of Brown & Wood, a lawyer for the Bulova center. "But this is New York. And things don't go perfectly. And when things go sub-optimal, the price would be paid by corporate tenants, by homeowners and by children at the school."
"We believe their methodology for choosing this site is faulty," Mr. Friedman said, "and that there are other sites."
Alternate sites are being considered for two shafts planned in Manhattan. In one case, the Edison Parking Corporation is fighting the city's proposal to acquire its lot at 13th Street and Ninth Avenue.
There is an even more complicated search for a site for the southernmost Manhattan shaft. For now, the choice is between a development parcel owned by the Milstein family in the South Street Seaport Historic District or a small lot behind One Police Plaza where police vehicles are parked. To complicate matters, this site may encompass part of a venerable Jewish burial ground.
Heated as these fights might grow, disputes seem to be more the exception than the rule in the choice of locations for the 14 shafts along stage two of the water tunnel.
New York's third water tunnel, known officially as City Tunnel No. 3, is designed to supplement two existing tunnels, reduce peak flows and provide a backup source in case of disruption. It would also allow the older tunnels to be drained, examined and rehabilitated for the first time. Tunnel No. 1 has been operating continuously since it was put into service in 1917; Tunnel No. 2 has been in nonstop use since 1937.
The 16 shafts of the first stage have already been built. Five of the 14 shafts in the second stage are under construction, two more have been approved by the City Planning Commission, six are under review and one is still being planned.
(Shafts on the third tunnel carry a "B" designation -- 1B, 2B, 3B and so on -- to distinguish them from the shafts on the first tunnel, which are simply numbered 1, 2, 3, and the shafts on the second tunnel, which are numbered 1A, 2A, 3A.)
"The shaft sites haven't really generated much controversy," said James Merani, the team leader at the City Planning Department for site selection on all city projects. "That means that D.E.P. did a good job finding these locations. And it's not an easy job finding locations of this size."
Even in the dense precincts of Manhattan, the selection process has been "relatively free of complications," said Andrew C. Breslau, press secretary to Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan.
In situating the shafts, geological conditions are "extremely important," Ms. Gelber said. And obviously, the shafts must be near the tunnel route. "Beyond these two key points are the availability, the economics and the size of the site," she said. "Ideally, you like to be in a place where there is the least impact on residences, largely in industrial areas. On the other hand, the construction itself is so far below ground that there is little awareness of what's going on."
Shaft 17B, which is proposed for Jackson Heights, has unique demands because it is to connect the second stage of the tunnel with the fourth stage, scheduled in the next century for eastern areas of Queens and the Bronx. Water from these two legs of the tunnel will travel through enormous manifolds into pipes within a 135-by-40-foot valve chamber some 320 feet below the street.
Besides the 750-foot-deep distribution shaft that is to carry water to the mains, site 17B also requires an access shaft, with stairs and elevator, leading down to the valve chamber.
With two shafts to build, "we need as close to two acres as we can get," Mr. Vogel said. "The more room you have, the more you can keep out of the public's eye -- and hair."
Construction of the shafts and valve chamber is expected to take four and a half years. Construction of distribution and access chambers near the surface would take another two years, if all went according to plan.
Several sites were reviewed by the agency. One of the most promising from a logistical vantage was a triangular plot at 60th Street and 30th Avenue that sits between two rail lines. It is owned by P&F Trucking and is used as a garbage transfer station. Officials rejected it, however, because of the difficulties of soil testing, the possible presence of hazardous and contaminated materials and the need to relocate an existing business.
The search turned toward the Bulova center. Once the home of Bulova watches, the 23-acre parcel was purchased in 1985 by the Blumenfeld Development Group of Syosset, L.I. The next year, Blumenfeld began converting the old headquarters and factory into an attractive 483,000-square-foot office building with an airy, verdant atrium.
Today, the building is 90 percent leased, said Jonathan E. Cohen of the Blumenfeld group. Tenants include British Airways, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the Sanus division of New York Life and the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association.
A few steps from the existing building is an irregularly shaped open field on which Blumenfeld planned the second phase of the Bulova center. This would include a four-story, 400,000-square-foot office building; a 10-story, 200-room hotel; a shopping arcade and a 10-screen movie theater.
The second phase was "somewhat shelved on a short-term basis" after the real estate market deflated, Mr. Cohen said. At about the same time, two and a half years ago, the developers started hearing rumblings from community leaders about the selection of their property for Shaft 17B.
ENVIRONMENTAL officials were drawn to the open field for many of the things that made it an attractive development parcel: it is large, clear of existing structures, under single ownership and close to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
That was where Shaft 17B was first proposed. But then, Mr. Vogel said, borings indicated that the rock quality was not as good under the open field as it was under the Bulova center parking lot immediately to the east, which is lined with mature pin oak trees. Mr. Vogel said the proposed shaft site was moved eastward, in part to accommodate Blumenfeld's development plans.
But the shift of the shaft did nothing to mollify the owners, tenants or neighbors.
David Blumenfeld, one of the developers of the Bulova center, said the shafts would "severely impact" his project. Some tenants, he said, especially those with sensitive computer centers, had "serious concerns" about prolonged construction nearby.
At a hearing May 4 before city planners, James Weisman, a lawyer with the veterans association, said that about 30 of its 90 employees were in wheelchairs. "This construction will effectively undermine their ability to use this property," he said. "Parking and the ability to travel safely from the car to the building is fundamental."
At the same hearing, an aide to Mr. Vallone, Frances McDonald, said the location was "unacceptable," adding that the "re-arrangement of this site has brought it unnecessarily close to people's homes."
Mr. Vallone himself said: "There are priorities in this town. No. 1 is that you don't dig 500 feet under a home if you have a piece of vacant land or a junkyard available."
Residents are clearly angered by the possibility that while Shaft 17B is being excavated, the B.Q.E. may be under reconstruction, a runway may be extended at La Guardia Airport nearby and a rail link may be built from Kennedy International Airport to La Guardia and mid-Manhattan.
Neighbors who crowded the May 4 hearing unfurled banners reading "B.Q.E.! Monorail! LGA! The shaft too? Why us?" and "Don't shaft Jackson Heights!"
Borough President Shulman said in a report to the planning commission that elimination of on-site parking during construction "will severely affect the viability of existing businesses employing over 2,000 people, as well as future operations" at the center. She added that "this displacement will result in a significant loss of economic development opportunities in the Jackson Heights area."
Mr. Vogel responded that "we are not, in fact, eliminating but relocating parking, which in all probability would be closer to the building than the farthest extremity of the parking lot we'd be taking."
Except for Van Cortlandt Park and Central Park, Mr. Vogel said the Jackson Heights site was "probably the least impacted" in terms of the "congestion of the surrounding community." He contrasted it to Sackett Street and Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, where there are apartment buildings "right on the edge of the site" of Shaft 22B.
Whatever happens in Jackson Heights, it will not be the end of controversy.
The city has proposed using a parking lot at Ninth Avenue and 13th Street as the site for Shaft 27B. The 180-space lot is owned and operated by Edison Parking of Newark.
"Of course, we don't want to be condemned or lose our site for 10 years or so," said Douglas E. Sarini, Edison's vice president for public affairs. That is particularly true, he said, since there is another lot on 15th Street with an owner who is willing to sell.
Mr. Vogel said no final decision had been made, although city engineers were still leaning toward the Edison site since it is larger and closer to the line of the tunnel.
The borough president's office is also involved in the discussion, as are the community boards on either side of 14th Street.
This is not the first time that Edison Parking has tangled with the water tunnel and it is not surprising, either, since parking lots make tempting sites for shafts.
Edison is also the tenant of a lot owned by the Rudin family at 10th Avenue and 48th Street. The Rudins planned to sell it to St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center until city engineers identified it as the site for Shaft 25B. The planning commission has approved the location and a deal between the city and the Rudins is reportedly close at hand. St. Clare's, meanwhile, picked a site on Eighth Avenue, at 48th Street, for its new hospital.
Another Edison lot, at 10th Avenue and 17th Street, was the first choice for the Manhattan tunneling shaft, No. 26B, from which the horizontal boring is staged and through which the resulting debris and muck are brought to the surface for removal.
However, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration moved into the former Merchants Refrigerating Company Building on the other side of 17th Street. In deference to the agency's "sensitive equipment," Mr. Vogel said, the shaft site was changed to a city-owned parcel on Murray Street. But that was to have been the location of the New York Exchanges Headquarters, which would have had "greater positive impacts" than a shaft, Mr. Vogel said. So the site was moved again, to part of the John D. Caemmerer rail yard at 10th Avenue and 30th Street, west of Penn Station, a location being leased from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Construction is to begin this summer.
At the end of the line in Manhattan awaits another dilemma. Shaft 30B was tentatively situated on a large vacant lot at Water Street and Peck Slip, in the Seaport historic district.
BUT that lot is owned by the Milstein family, which spent eight years trying to win approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a large-scale development in the small-scale district. An 11-story office project was approved in 1991 and the Milsteins are looking for tenants.
Another possible site is a small triangular plot at Pearl and Madison Streets, behind police headquarters. It is known as James Madison Park, Ms. Gelber said, but is mainly used as a parking lot for police vehicles.
That is not its only potential liability. Borough President Messinger's press secretary, Mr. Breslau, said there "may be an old Jewish burial ground under that park."
There is a remnant some 600 feet to the north, at St. James Place and Oliver Street, of the burial ground used by Congregation Shearith Israel from 1682 to 1831. The cemetery was larger than its present confines. "If, indeed, the Shearith Israel plot extended underneath the park," Mr. Breslau said, "we would strenuously object" to the excavation and placement there of Shaft 30B.
A happy ending, at least for Lincoln Center, can be recorded in the case of Shaft 24B. It was planned at 62d Street and Amsterdam Avenue, near Damrosch Park, where the Big Apple Circus is staged. Lincoln Center executives feared a logistical "nightmare," recalled Jerry A. Hastings, the assistant director of operations. But they were resigned to it and did not openly oppose environmental officials. "We told them it would be a hassle and that we'd rather it wasn't there but that we'd work with them," Mr. Hastings said.
A month later, he said, it was learned that the city had moved the site two blocks south, to 60th Street. "We were tickled pink," Mr. Hastings said, "and closed the file."

HEADLINE: Conversion of Methane Gas To Energy Planned at Landfill

BYLINE: By TOM CALLAHAN 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
UNTIL 1984 the Croton Landfill was the dumping site of much of Westchester's garbage and solid waste. But beginning in 1996, what might once have been considered science fiction will become reality. A county program, now in the design stage, will convert the methane gas produced at the landfill into a source of revenue.
The program will use existing technology to capture the methane, a gas that is produced by the decomposition of vegetable matter, purify it and convert it to electricity and compressed natural gas. Methane at the landfill is now burned off and must be eliminated to prevent the possibility of fire. The county is also studying the possibility of taking another landfill gas, carbon dioxide, and capturing it for commercial sale. 
 The electricity generated by the program will be used at the 125-acre Croton Point Park, which is next to the landfill. The county spends $250,000 a year for electricity to light the park and heat buildings. Any excess electricity produced will be sold to Con Edison, which under state law must purchase it. The compressed natural gas will be used in the county's natural-gas-powered vehicles, with any surplus being sold to pipeline operators.
The gas-conversion system, including machinery and a building to house it, will cost the county $6.9 million. This will come from savings in the budget for capping the landfill. Once closed, a landfill must be capped, or covered and ventilated, to prevent buried waste and gases from leaking into the environment. That part of the job will be completed this fall.
 
Other Sites in Operation
 But even after capping, the landfill will continue to produce methane gas until the year 2031, according to preliminary estimates prepared by the county. Once in operation, the gas-conversion plant will pay back its capital costs in 4.3 years. During the 35-year life of the program, the county estimates electricity savings at the park and net earnings of $19.2 million.
"This program will work for everyone," said Anthony P. Trelewicz, Commissioner of the county's Department of Environmental Facilities based here. "The first benefit is to the environment. By creating electricity, methane gas is not released or burned into the atmosphere. The second benefit is to the taxpayers of Westchester. The money saved on electricity will reduce the park budget. The electricity and natural gas sold will be a revenue." In large concentrations, methane is regarded as an environmental pollutant.
Mr. Trelewicz said methane is being converted to electricity at landfills in Macedon and Oceanside, both in New York State, and in New Milford. Methane is being turned into natural gas in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisc., and Cleveland bottles and sells carbon dioxide from its landfill.
"The gas-extraction system already exists underground at the Croton Landfill," the Commissioner added. "The pipes and wells underground are usable and were put there as part of the capping of the landfill. When you cap a landfill, you must put in that underground system to vent the gases or there could be an explosion and fire."
Methane is now burned off at the Railroad 1 Landfill in Croton, an adjacent 20-acre municipal site, which was capped in 1986 and will be included in the gas-extraction program. While burning methane is considered safe for the environment, county officials feel that this program is a better way to eliminate the gas and provide income.
 
Contract to Be Awarded
 Within the next few months, the county will award a consulting contract for a design study, a job that Mr. Trelewicz estimates will take six to nine months. In addition to providing construction specifications, the study will determine how much methane the landfill can produce and how long it will last. When the study is completed, bids will be sought for the project.
As proposed, the gas-collection system will capture 1.5 million cubic feet of gas a day. One-third of the gas will be used to power a 740-kilowatt generator in a sound-deadening building, which will produce power for the park. The remaining gas will be used to create the natural gas equivalent of 700 gallons of gasoline a day. The building will be large enough, though, to allow a switch to total-electric production if desired.
"The compressed-natural-gas conversion is a pilot program that will last for one year," Mr. Trelewicz said. "During this time, we will study the market for compressed natural gas in the county. If we want to sell it, we have to make sure there are customers out there besides us. One possible customer would be the municipalities. But if we can't sell it, there is no use producing it. In that case, we can convert the plant to total generation of electricity."
The county is now operating five natural-gas-powered vehicles in a pilot program to test the economic and environmental benefits. The vehicles travel 150 to 200 miles on two cylinders of natural gas, approximately the equivalent of 16 gallons of gasoline. The county purchases fuel for these cars under a contract with Con Edison, which has a fueling station in Rye.
Mr. Trelewicz expects the gas-conversion plant to be operating by 1996. "This is an exciting project," he said. "We build waste-treatment plants, but this is different. We are using the byproducts of what was once waste to make fuel and energy."

THE ECONOMY
 
Inflation? It's Like Prosperity, Just Around the Corner
An old New Yorker cartoon pictured an eager homeowner, rake in hand, rushing to nab the first autumn leaf to invade his lawn. Those who keep crying "inflation" seem equally zealous, for the statistics just keep telling a different story. Look at last week's numbers: consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in April, while at the producer level inflation vanished altogether, with prices actually falling 0.1 percent. In addition, retail sales were down for the month, and initial jobless claims took an unexpected turn upward. But is all this going to stop the Federal Reserve from raising rates yet again when it meets on Tuesday? The financial markets don't seem to think so, for even though bond rates fell a bit and stocks rose on the price reports, there was no euphoria. The Fed, economists keep saying, is watching for inflation way out on the horizon. Those with a short view probably wouldn't even dig the rake out of the garage until the lawn was covered with leaves. 

Untimely Death of a 'Pioneer'
Here's how friends and colleagues described Wardell R. Lazard: "A class act." "A pioneer" for building a top minority-owned investment firm. A black man "thriving" in a difficult environment. A man who "didn't have the time" for drugs. Yet last week, at the age of 44, Mr. Lazard, head of W. R. Lazard & Company, died in a Pittsburgh hotel, apparently of a drug overdose. The shock left people groping for answers. "Was he under strain?" asked one. "Absolutely" -- but nothing to explain this. The firm was under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney, but that did not seem to be a factor. But it soon turned out that three years ago Mr. Lazard nearly died, apparently of a drug overdose, and was arrested for cocaine possession.
 
Just Another Littered Highway
If you haven't caught up with the Internet, you've blown a chance to see its "good old days." For a time, innocent tekkies roamed the electronic byways. By unwritten decree, there was nothing ugly. Those days vanished quickly. Among many recent abuses, two lawyers flooded the Internet with blatant ads. Purists rained digital abuse on them, but did they really think a million-lane highway could stay litter-free?
 
Real Lawmakers Don't Do Lunch
Yes, voters supposedly vote their pocketbooks, but when the voters are on the Senate floor (with the world watching) they're likely to do the opposite. Last week the Senate swept the cakes and ale right off their own lunch tables, voting to ban gifts and meals from lobbyists. The House passed a similar bill, so all that remains is for the two sides to thrash out the details in the back room -- buying their own beer and peanuts, of course.

A 'Safer' Cigarette, Unlit
In the early 1960's, documents now show, tobacco companies found ways to make "safer" cigarettes. But they apparently anticipated the obvious question, "Safer than what?" Because they've never admitted smoking's hazards, they couldn't come out and call cigarettes safer without sounding, well, a bit confused. Safer cigarettes never appeared.
 
Cookies for Later? A Bit More
At a corporate bash, the excess might prompt muttered comments like "I'd rather have a bit extra in my paycheck." If Kathleen Tompkins ever muttered this, she didn't mutter for long. Ms. Tompkins, a former party planner at Salomon Brothers, admitted last week that when she submitted bills, she padded things a bit -- to the tune of $1.1 million.
 
COMPANIES
 
G.M. Pays Some Pension Dues
General Motors has one distinction it would just as soon get rid of: of the additional $50 billion or so that American companies need to sock away to pay tomorrow's pensions, a huge chunk -- roughly $20 billion -- has G.M.'s name on it. So last week G.M. said it would chip in $10 billion in cash and stock to cut away at that shortfall. But there's more to this than G.M. simply putting money aside when times are good. Word has it that it wants to sell Electronic Data Systems, which is worth far more than when G.M. bought it a decade ago, and by giving roughly $6 billion worth of E.D.S.-linked stock to its pension plan, it might avoid having to pay some hefty capital-gains taxes.
 
The Inside Track at Time Warner
As a financial adviser to Time Warner, Oded Aboodi has been privy to a lot of inside stuff, and the S.E.C. says he profited handsomely from that information. In 1991, an S.E.C. complaint says, companies controlled by Mr. Aboodi sold $2.3 million worth of Time Warner common stock and bought preferred shares -- on the same day he'd learned of a stock plan that would batter the common and lift the preferred. Mr. Aboodi neither admits nor denies the charges, but last week he agreed to pay close to $1 million to settle the charges. And as of now, he is still a Time Warner adviser -- and a close associate of its chairman, Gerald Levin.
 
All the World's a CD
What next? The works of Shakespeare on the head of a pin? Of course, you doubters -- but who's Shakespeare, anyway? Did he write any software? Did he advance computer technology in any way? But there's no time for that. Onward and inward in the race to make things tinier and tinier and tinier. Here's the latest: I.B.M. unveiled a new technology last week that allows digital disks to hold more than 10 times as much data as they do now. The laser that "reads" a disk, it seems, can be made to read different levels of a multilayered, transparent disk. The result: several movies, or a million pages of text, on a single CD. Tomorrow's unemployed: bookshelf makers.
 
Valdez Skipper Tells His Story
Exxon has said it would never have put Joseph Hazelwood in command of the Exxon Valdez if it had known of his drinking problem. But last week, in his first public testimony since the 1989 Alaska oil spill, Mr. Hazelwood told a different story. He said he'd been treated for alcohol abuse in 1985 and Exxon was well aware of this when it put him squarely between the tanker's oil and the fragile world outside. Not only that, but he said he'd lied to the Coast Guard when he said he'd only had a beer before the spill; it was actually a fair amount of vodka. The stakes are big in deciding who's at fault: fishermen and others are seeking billions in a civil suit.
 
Real War Over 'Plastic' History
Virginia is so lush with real history that the idea of importing a huge load of freeze-dried history seems comparable to bringing sun lamps to a June picnic. Yet that's what Disney wants to do at a 3,000-acre Disney's America theme park, complete with faux Civil War village. For Virginia, the economics are clear: 19,000 jobs and six million big-spending visitors a year. But last week a group of historians and authors lambasted the idea, with David McCullough, of "Truman" fame, calling it "almost sacrilege" to "replace what we have with plastic, contrived history." Clearly, a new civil war is brewing.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
A Saudi Contract for AT&T
President Clinton may draw fire on some foreign-policy fronts, but he's effective in snagging business abroad for American companies. In February his lobbying helped Boeing and McDonnell Douglas get a big Saudi aircraft contract. And last week, again after a barrage of Administration lobbying, the Saudis gave AT&T a $4 billion contract to modernize Saudi Arabia's entire telecommunications system. We're still getting dividends, it seems, for taking on Iraq a few years ago.
 
Bribery at Honda (Updated)
Federal investigators recently charged 13 former American Honda employees with taking $10 million in bribes in return for giving dealers hard-to-get cars. Honda had cooperated, starting in October, but it now turns out that it already knew for some time that things were amiss. A Honda lawyer said last week that the company got on the case back in 1991 and started its own inquiry. More than historical truth is at stake: some dealers have sued Honda, saying the bribes hurt them. This disclosure could color those suits.
 
German Rates Keep Falling
German interest rates are heading steadily downward now that inflation has been tamed. Last week the German central bank sent key rates to five-year lows -- mainly, it seems, out of concern for currency volatility. The cuts could help push Europe out of recession, but there was also the sense that it is now the Fed's turn to raise rates again to strengthen the dollar. Clearly, the gods of global economics can't please all the people all the time.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Readers' Mail: Worries About Bonds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Question: My husband and I are retired schoolteachers in our 70's. We own 15 different California-insured municipal bonds that mature in 10 to 20 years. We bought them for the income and plan to hold them to maturity. You have warned that the value of bonds drops as interest rates rise. Can you tell us about a better investment?
Answer: Because you plan to hold the bonds to term, your principal amount will remain intact in spite of rising rates. But what you have is not the best deal because your income could be improving, said Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla. 
 One solution is to include shorter-term issues in your investments. To stay in munis, you could divide your portfolio, for example, among the Vanguard Short- , Limited- and Intermediate-Term Municipal Bond Funds, which strive, respectively, for average portfolio maturities of 1 to 2 years, 2 to 5 years, and 7 to 12 years. Yields on the shorter-term funds rise more quickly, and their share prices are less volatile. In exchange for the additional safety, however, you get a lower yield than in the Intermediate-Term Fund.
Mr. Evensky also advises that a portion of the portfolio be kept in equities because the value of bond income will be eroded by inflation over time. A simple, low-cost solution, he said, is to invest 20 to 40 percent of your portfolio in the Vanguard Index 500, which owns all the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Among diversified funds, he likes T. Rowe Price Equity-Income, Federated Stock, and Benham Income and Growth.
Q: On Sundays, The New York Times publishes three-year total return figures for funds. Why? Showcasing this particular period makes no sense because it does not include a substantial downturn in the stock market. Year-to-date or one-year figures would be more helpful.
A: The Times believes that three years is the shortest time period providing a reasonable view of how funds perform in various markets, even though it is true that the stock market has been rising for most of the last three years. Because so many funds are new, using five years as the benchmark would exclude more than half of the 3,800 funds in the data base provided by Morningstar Inc. But The Times does provide five-year figures in its quarterly mutual fund report.
No single figure, however, can provide a total picture. For example, the Vanguard S.& P. 500 fund, a proxy for the stock market, gained 14.5 percent a year, on average, for the decade ended April 30. But for the three years ended then, the fund returned 9.3 percent a year, on average, which is much closer to historical stock market returns.
The Times does publish shorter-term results for all funds, with the one-year return on Wednesdays, three-month on Thursdays and year-to-date on Fridays. But shorter-term results do not provide a complete picture. The average diversified United States stock fund lost 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 1994, but that is not representative of longer-term results.
Q: I own mutual funds in an individual retirement account to which I have contributed since 1982. In the prospectus for a new fund I recently bought for the account, I stumbled onto something called Form 8606 (Nondeductible I.R.A. Contributions), which is supposed to be filed annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Please advise.
A: Form 8606 is a record-keeping form that tracks the portion of your nondeductible I.R.A. contributions. When you start taking money from the account, the percentage of these contributions will be applied to the distribution, and you won't be taxed again on that amount.
A $50 penalty applies for every year in which Form 8606 is not filed. Filing amended returns for the relevant years, however, is probably not necessary, said Fred W. Haas, a tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand in Baltimore. Based on informal talks with the I.R.S., he suggests that the penalty may be waived or overlooked if you file Form 8606 with your next tax return and attach a schedule showing the annual buildup year by year.
Q: In a column on taxes, you advised using the "specific identification" method when shares are sold. To do so, the I.R.S. requires that the fund company identify the specific shares on the sale confirmation, which the Vanguard Group refuses to do.
A: A spokesman for Vanguard confirmed that the account statement issued after a redemption request does not list specific lots of shares sold. The company will only issue an acknowledgment that it has received an investor's written specific-share sale request, and keep a copy of that letter in its files. People who want that acknowledgment should send a detailed letter and keep their own careful records of the sale, although "taking these steps may not assure satisfaction of I.R.S. requirements," the Vanguard spokesman said.
Daniel P. Wiener, who edits the Boston-based Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, says he has used the specific-identification method for years. He follows up a sale with a letter to Vanguard detailing the transaction, including the name of the representative to whom he spoke and the transaction number. He hasn't run into trouble. "My advice is to use the method until told otherwise by the I.R.S," Mr. Wiener said.

HEADLINE: A Government-Industry Environmental Partnership

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Michael Silverstein completely missed what is happening in Washington and around the country to promote the environmental industry. A cluster of major policy initiatives to protect the global environment and promote this vital industry is in the final stage of development and many programs are already being implemented by the Clinton-Gore team. 
 In the last 10 months, our organization, the Environmental Business Council of the United States, has worked closely with members of the Administration and Congress to increase Government interest and participation in the environmental industry, including a focus on improved competitiveness in foreign markets. One result of the initiative is, in part, a program announced in November 1993 by the Administration to develop a cooperative export program with the environmental industry.
Beyond this initiative, the Administration has under development a comprehensive strategy to increase exports of environmental products and services and to develop innovative environmental technologies. Other important elements include:
* A new national export policy developed by the Commerce Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and other agencies as members of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee announced in September 1993.
* The E.P.A.'s environmental technologies initiative, which will aggressively promote new American technologies in a long-term, well-financed program.
* A program coordinated by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to promote development of environmental technologies for sustainable development.
* A reorganization of foreign aid programs, coordinated by the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, to emphasize environmentally sustainable development.
* Military conversion financing for hazardous-waste site cleanups and for technology development.
* Energy Department financing for technology in areas that include energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and transfer and commercialization of technologies developed in the Energy Department system.
In addition, significant legislative initiatives to implement elements of the strategy and to support the development of environmental technology and business are pending in Congress with the support of the Administration. All these initiatives offer the potential to advance the environmental industry, created by the rigorous United States environmental laws, toward leadership in the global movement for sustainable development.
The environmental industry has been challenged by the Clinton Administration to cooperate and improve its market opportunity. It can either participate or stand by and let the process proceed. A powerful partnership for global environmental protection and job creation is under way.

HEADLINE: The Lesson: M.B.A.'s and Engineers Need Each Other

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
IT was not a major project, just an effort to design new kinds of bicycle lights. But it says a lot about how graduate schools are trying to respond to the needs of American manufacturers.
The lights were designed last fall by teams of graduate students from Stanford University's schools of business and engineering in an innovative joint project. Afterward the students -- two engineers and two business students on each team -- built them in a machine shop on campus. The main goal of the project: to break down the barriers between engineers and business people, barriers that lead engineers to call their opposites "bean counters" and business types to call engineers "propellerheads." 
 "What we hoped to do in the class," said Professor William Lovejoy, who helps teach the class, "was to develop in M.B.A.'s an appreciation for the process of design and manufacture and to develop in engineers an appreciation of the constraints placed on design and manufacture by a competitive economic context."
Across the country, schools of business and engineering at universities like Stanford, Michigan and Carnegie Mellon are devising joint programs to enable their graduates to straddle the fields of business and technology. The hope is that the students will go on to help overcome the divisions between specialties that make American manufacturers less competitive.
Some universities are going further. This fall Carnegie Mellon will begin a master's program involving not only the engineering and business schools but also the schools of computer science and public policy.
One key goal is to train instructors to staff the 100 or so manufacturing assistance centers the Clinton Administration is planning to establish across the country. The centers are an effort to help smaller companies that are falling behind on technology and operating techniques. Small companies are considered important because they make up the supply base for big corporations, and the price and quality of the components they produce are reflected in the cars, appliances and airplanes the bigger companies assemble.
"We want to bring modern management and technical skills to small business," said Robert M. White, head of the electrical and computer engineering department at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. Professor White, who was Under Secretary of Commerce for technology in the Bush Administration, said that to help manufacturers at a practical level, the centers will need people who understand computer networks and the way the political system works, as well as business and engineering.
"This is a customer-driven program," said Robert Sullivan, dean of Carnegie Mellon's business school. "The area between Pittsburgh and Detroit has the greatest density of small manufacturers of anywhere in the country."
EACH joint program is different, and most are in their infancy. Some, like Carnegie Mellon's, grant just one degree, in this case a master of manufacturing. Others, like Stanford, award two -- an M.B.A. and a master of manufacturing systems.
"We developed the program to respond to the fact that American industry was not competitive in time-to-market, functionality and quality," said Charles A. Holloway, a Stanford business school professor who coordinates joint programs with the engineering school. "We looked at the product development process and found that it was very disjointed in many companies. People really did wrap designs around a rock and toss them over a wall into the next department."
One centerpiece of Stanford's program to break down those walls is the course it calls Integrated Design for Manufacturing and Marketability. The course is open to M.B.A. and engineering-only students, as well as those in the dual-degree program.
Each year a different, fairly simple product is chosen. In addition to bicycle lights, previous groups of students have designed and built can crushers and juicers.
The course simulates real life by having each team do a market survey to determine what product attributes are most valued by customers and what they would be willing to pay. Based on that information, the teams begin to make design decisions. For example, will a more sophisticated device at a higher price be more profitable than a simple, low-priced one that would sell in higher volume?
Later, each team's finished product is displayed to a group of the potential customers originally surveyed, and those customers are then asked which, if any, they would buy. A figure for the sales of each product can then be projected. Subtracting the cost of goods sold produces a bottom line for each product. The final grade is determined largely by that bottom line.
Going into a shop is a new experience for the students, business and engineering alike, Professor Holloway said. "It is difficult to impress them with anything to do with computers because they have grown up with them, but they haven't built stuff."
In addition to teaching students how to work in teams, Professor Holloway said, the course is intended to show them that the product development process is a complete cycle, not a series of unconnected steps. "You show them that the whole cycle has to be managed, from research to design, manufacturing, distribution, service and recycling. When you are thinking about distribution, you should be thinking about design, because design can help with distribution."
Kelli Kowaleski is a joint-degree candidate at Stanford who expects to graduate in June and return to Digital Equipment, where she worked for five years as a manufacturing engineer. She said that because the target market was the Stanford campus itself, her group decided to design the battery-powered light for simple functionality and low cost.
"We did really well in the customer survey and took third place in market share" out of 10 teams, she said. "We did not do as well in the judging on features -- it wasn't the brightest light, for instance -- but we knew that from the start." Higher-priced lights included those with both high and low beams and light-emitting diode displays.
Ms. Kowaleski said she anticipates that the principal value of the joint degree will be that "I can speak both languages," and she added: "You find situations where a manager has great people skills but makes bad decisions because he does not understand the engineering involved. I should be able to talk to him in terms he understands."
TOM LINEBARGER, who graduated from the Stanford program in December, is already busy translating. He works at Cummins Engine in Columbus, Ind., where he is officially on the staff of the group vice president for worldwide operations.
"I'm on loan to advanced manufacturing -- we do prototypes and low-volume manufacturing before products transfer to high-volume manufacturing," he said. "It's partly technical and partly business. I lead teams that try to solve problems and worry about the financial consequence."
He said he anticipates assignments in other areas of the company while he learns the engine business. He said that he had worked before in venture capital and entered the Stanford joint program "because I wanted to know how things actually work."
"That way," he added, "if I wind up as a C.E.O., I'll know how the business works."
Mr. Linebarger said the main value of Stanford's joint program was that it allowed him to straddle the worlds of business and technology. "I still keep some of the B-school materials in my files for reference," he said. "And I use the tech stuff every day."
One problem with the new business-technical programs, educators say, is that the graduates are more broadly trained than those of the past and do not fit well in traditional entry-level jobs in industry. They fear that the benefits of the program will be lost in narrowly defined jobs and the graduates will quickly become frustrated.
"That's absolutely a problem," said Craig Marks, co-director of the University of Michigan's Joint Manufacturing Initiative. "These students need a different career path."
He said the university is forming industry advisory boards and briefing them on the programs in an effort to persuade companies to redesign starting jobs for the graduates of the joint programs. This works well with smaller companies where the chief executive is on the advisory board and can make decisions on how to structure jobs.
Bigger corporations are more difficult, Mr. Marks said. "Typically, the vice president for manufacturing is on the board," he said. "The guy I want to reach is the plant manager, but he is three layers down."
"Some companies are changing to accommodate these graduates," Professor Holloway said. "Digital created a set of slots that allows people to cut across traditional disciplines." Others, he said, still have the narrowly focused jobs but move the more broadly trained executives rapidly into new positions. The Cummins tactic of keeping Mr. Linebarger on staff while he learns line operations is one such approach, he said.

HEADLINE: The World;
Asia's Having One Huge Nicotine Fit

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
THE Marlboro Man has found greener pastures.
The cigarette-hawking cowboy may be under siege back home in the United States from lawmakers and health advocates determined to put him out of business, but half a world away in Asia he is prospering, his craggy all-American mug slapped up on billboards and flickering across television screens. And Marlboro cigarettes have never been more popular on the continent that is home to 60 percent of the world's population. 
 For the world's cigarette-makers, Asia is the future. And it is probably their savior.
Industry critics who hope that the multinational tobacco companies are headed for extinction owe themselves a stroll down the tobacco-scented streets of almost any city in Asia. Almost everywhere here the air is thick with the swirling gray haze of cigarette smoke, the evidence of a booming Asian growth market that promises vast profits for the tobacco industry and a death toll measured in the tens of millions.
At lunchtime in Seoul, throngs of fashionably dressed young Korean women gather in a fast-food restaurant to enjoy a last cigarette before returning to work, a scene that draws distressed stares from older Koreans who remember a time when it would have been scandalous for women from respectable homes to smoke.
In Hong Kong, shoppers flock into the Salem Attitudes boutique, picking from among the racks of trendy sports clothes stamped with the logo of Salem cigarettes. In Phnom Penh, the war-shattered capital of Cambodia, visitors leaving an audience with King Sihanouk are greeted with a giant billboard planted across the street from his ornate gold-roofed palace. It advertises Lucky Strikes.
According to tobacco industry projections cited by the World Health Organization, the Asian cigarette market should grow by more than a third during the 1990's, with much of the bounty going to multinational tobacco giants eager for an alternative to the shrinking market in the United States.
American cigarette sales are expected to decline by about 15 percent by the end of the decade, a reflection of the move to ban smoking in most public places in the United States. And sales in Western Europe and other industrialized countries are also expected to drop.
But no matter how bad the news is in the West, the tobacco companies can find comfort in Asia and throughout the third world, markets so huge and so promising that they make the once all-important American market seem insignificant. Beyond Asia, cigarette consumption is also expected to grow in Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and in the nations of the former Soviet Union.
 
Status
 Smoking is not only tolerated in most of Asia, it is still fashionable. And for millions of smokers here, nothing confers greater status than a pack of American or European-brand cigarettes. No gift is more appreciated in Vietnam than British-made "555" cigarettes. In China, the choice is Marlboro. Among the gentry of Thailand, it is Dunhill.
Status appears to matter far more than taste. "There is not a great deal of evidence to suggest that smokers can taste any difference between the more expensive foreign brands and the indigenous cigarettes," said Simon Chapman, a specialist in community medicine at the University of Sydney, in Australia. "The difference appears to be in the packaging, the advertising."
He said that researchers had been unable to determine whether the foreign tobacco companies had adjusted the levels of tar, nicotine and other chemicals for cigarettes sold in the Asian market. "The tobacco industry fights tooth and nail to keep consumers away from that kind of information," he said.
Most governments in Asia have launched anti-smoking campaigns, but their efforts tend to be overwhelmed by the Madison Avenue glitz unleashed by the cigarette giants. Several Asian nations have banned cigarette advertising on television and radio in recent years, but the tobacco companies often find ways around the bans through indirect promotions that skirt the law -- sports events, glossy advertisements for clothing brands or travel agencies that bear that name and logo of a cigarette brand.
With 1.2 billion people and the world's fastest-growing economy, China is the most coveted target of the multinational tobacco companies. Cigarette consumption, calculated as the number of cigarettes smoked per adult, has increased by 7 percent each year over the last decade in China. There are 300 million smokers in China, more people than the entire population of the United States, and they buy 1.6 trillion cigarettes a year.
Competing in many cases with domestically produced brands, the multinational tobacco companies are moving quickly to get their cigarettes into China and emerging markets in the rest of the developing world. Their campaign has been bolstered by the efforts of American Government trade negotiators to force open tobacco markets overseas. Since the mid-1980's, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have all succumbed to pressure from Washington and allowed the sale of foreign-brand cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes, shut out of Japan in 1980, now make up nearly 20 percent of the market.
Anti-smoking groups in Asia, often critical of the Bush Administration for its aggressive pursuit of the tobacco industry's agenda abroad, say it is too early to judge the Clinton Administration on the issue.
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco has manufactured its Camel and Winston cigarettes in Chinese factories since the late 1980's. Last year the American company also opened plants in Poland and Turkey and took stakes in two state-owned tobacco companies in Ukraine. "Worldwide, hundreds of millions of smokers prefer American-blend cigarettes," James W. Johnston, chairman of Reynolds Tobacco Worldwide, wrote in his company's 1993 annual report. "Today, Reynolds has access to 90 percent of the world's markets; a decade ago, only 40 percent. Opportunities have never been better."
Last year, Philip Morris, the company behind the Marlboro Man, signed an agreement with the government-controlled China National Tobacco Corporation to make Marlboros and other Philip Morris brands in China. The company's foreign markets grew last year by more than 16 percent, with foreign operating profits up nearly 17 percent. Operating profits in the domestic American market fell by nearly half.
Physicians say the health implications of the tobacco boom in Asia are nothing less than terrifying, and there are frequent comparisons here to the Opium War of the mid-19th Century, when the British went to war to force the Chinese to accept imports of a dangerous, addictive drug -- opium, an important cash crop for British merchants.
Richard Peto, an Oxford University epidemiologist, has estimated that because of increasing tobacco consumption in Asia, the annual worldwide death toll from tobacco-related illnesses will more than triple over the next two or three decades, from about 3 million a year to 10 million a year, a fifth of them in China. His calculations suggest that 50 million Chinese children alive today will eventually die from diseases linked to cigarette smoking.
"If you look at the number of deaths, the tobacco problem in Asia is going to dwarf tuberculosis, it's going to dwarf malaria and it's going to dwarf AIDS, yet it's being totally ignored," said Judith Mackay, a British physician who is a consultant to the Chinese Government in developing an anti-smoking program.
The explosion of the Asian tobacco market is a result both of the increasing prosperity of large Asian nations -- suddenly, tens of millions of Asians can afford cigarettes, once a craved luxury -- and a shift in social customs. In many Asian countries, smoking was once taboo for women. Now, it is seen as a sign of their emancipation.
In explaining the boom in tobacco sales here, physicians and researchers also point to the cigarette companies' multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.
"Just four or five years ago, there wasn't a tobacco advertisement to be seen anywhere in Shanghai," said Dr. Mackay during a recent visit to China's most populous city. "Now, just as soon as you land at the airport, it's a bombardment, an absolute visual disgrace, with signs everywhere for Marlboro, Kent, all of them. On the streets, they've got a huge series of neon signs and billboards. Almost every telephone kiosk has a cigarette advertisement."
 
Targeting Women
 Much of the advertising is aimed at women, who smoke in far smaller numbers than Asian men, and at the young, and the ads often depict young, striking, stylishly dressed Asian models set in scenes of Western-style elegance. Some tobacco companies play up their American roots. Winston is advertised in the Philippines, a former American colony in which American culture still dominates, as "the Taste of the U.S.A."
Rosmarie Erben, Asian regional adviser for health promotion for the World Health Organization, said that "the tobacco industry is addressing women in a very aggressive way. There are still many cultures that do not accept the concept of women smoking, but that is changing."
Dr. Erben said that domestic tobacco companies in Asia have had to step up their own advertising targeted at women to meet the threat from foreign competitors. She said she was startled when she learned earlier this year that a Philippine cigarette maker was distributing free wall calendars decorated with a portrait of the Virgin Mary, an image of conspicuous power in a nation that is devoutly Roman Catholic, set above the logos of the company's cigarette brands. "I had never seen anything like it before," said Dr. Erben, who is based in Manila. "They were trying to link the icon motif to tobacco, to make Philippine women comfortable with the idea of smoking."
The global tobacco companies insist that they are not attempting to recruit new smokers in Asia. They say they are only trying to encourage smokers to switch to foreign brands. "The same number of cigarettes are consumed whether American cigarettes are present or not," said Elizabeth Cho, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris. "Whatever one may feel about the smoking and health controversy, the presence or absence of American cigarettes is not a cigarette consumption factor."
But some of the industry's advertising in Asia would suggest otherwise. Only about 2 percent of women in Hong Kong under the age of 40 smoke, so logic would suggest that a tobacco company interested only in encouraging smokers to switch brands would not introduce a cigarette there marketed specifically for women -- it is just too small a market. Yet that is precisely what Philip Morris did in Hong Kong several years ago by introducing Virginia Slims. As in the United States, the cigarettes were sold in Hong Kong with an advertising slogan that linked smoking to the liberation of women: "You've come a long way, baby."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Russia's New Dictatorship of Crime

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
WITHIN days of the murder of one member of Parliament in a gangland hit, another legislator kills a mobster in a shootout.
Two days later, the deputy head of the Interior Ministry's Criminal Investigation Department, Maj. Gen. Igor Shilov, and his son, a Police Academy cadet, are charged with corruption and possession of a large quantity of weapons. 
 A Mercedes is stopped in St. Petersburg for a towing violation; there are seven bodies inside, neatly wrapped in tarpaulins, the remains of a gang of racketeers.
The collapse of totalitarian order in Russia was bound to foster crime. But few foresaw crime this pervasive and organized, forging strong ties with a weak Government and raising the prospect of a mob-dominated superpower, a Sicily spread over two continents.
James Woolsey, the director of the C.I.A., last month described the potential for a "criminal politburo" that will be "a powerful and resourceful adversary."
Mr. Woolsey's concerns are widely shared. Rampant gangsterism in Russia, untrammeled by a wobbly central Government and poorly paid police, undermines support for economic and democratic reform. Domestically, it risks a political backlash favoring nationalist-populists like Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. Internationally, connections between the Russian mob and Italian and Colombian drug organizations, and the illegal sale of arms and even nuclear material, are alarming Russia's friends. Helsinki, New York, London, Munich and Tel Aviv already feel the impact of Russian criminal rivalries.
For many Russians living in ungenteel poverty, the sudden, visible wealth of the criminal class is an affront. The mobsters' brazen style could make a Bolshevik blush. Like the evil capitalist manikins of Communist propaganda come to life, the mobsters are seen by many Russians as proof of the pernicious influence of the libertine West.
Combining the corrupt habits of the Communist Party with Hollywood epics like "The Godfather," readily available on pirated, dubbed videos, Russian mobsters and their musclemen swagger through every Russian city like crude parodies of Jimmy Cagney.
While their lady friends have developed their own tarty fashion -- platinum hair, spandex microminis, Lycra leggings and an infinitely bored expression as cigarette smoke curls across the casino or nightclub table -- the mobsters have oddly Germanic predilections. They favor Hugo Boss suits and dark-blue Mercedes sedans, most of them stolen in Germany and driven onto former Soviet army bases, where they are "impounded" and shipped to Russia for a fee. (As Russian troops prepare to leave Germany, however, it may not be accidental that Lincolns are becoming more popular.)
Filled with muscular bodyguards smoking Marlboros, these glossy limousines swerve through the jumble of poky, rusty Zhigulis and Moskviches, often claiming the center lane reserved, in the old days, for the Kremlin elite. It's not uncommon to find two such mobmobiles smashed together in the center lane, a form of justice, many Muscovites feel, more effective than that available from their widely corrupted Government.
 
Crossing the Line
 In the transition to private property and a market economy, the laws have lagged behind the new ways of doing both business and crime. There is no conspiracy law, so mob bosses are hard to prosecute. Meager corporation laws don't yet cover responsibility for frauds, false bankruptcies or the misuse of credits. The line between business and crime is simply fuzzier here, while the inability to get redress through the courts leads to more crime, as businesses hire muscle to enforce deals otherwise unenforceable.
To a large degree, Russian mobsters feed off the corpse of the centralized state, where enormous riches and resources are available to anyone strong or rich enough to claim them. They deal in drugs, prostitutes, oil, minerals, aluminum, titanium, jewels, gold, arms and money-laundering across the former empire's still porous borders.
There are some 5,600 separate gangs, says Gen. Gennadi F. Chebotarev, First Deputy of the Interior Ministry's Organized Crime Department, with about 20 members each. Many are merely protection rackets, but they are consolidating and specializing. Some 160 of them are already large, financially sophisticated organizations with international connections, operating in the United States and most of Europe.
The Interior Ministry estimates that organized crime controlled about a third of all the turnover in goods and services in 1993, most of which was unregulated and untaxed. So crime is not only undermining new institutions, like stock exchanges, it is also raising prices, which include extortion and security costs.
Because crime lives off the market economy, the mafia has become associated in many minds with capitalism and democracy. Given the collapse of the old socialist morality -- steal from the state, but discreetly -- the vulgar mob style has tainted the very idea of private business. Its sheer Westernness feeds the nationalist tone now heard from every politician as it stokes the anger on which the ultranationalist right rides.
Politics aside, this is not just Russia's problem. To try to limit the foreign impact of organized crime, governments are working more closely with the Russian police; the Germans, Italians and Poles have offices here. While the F.B.I. says it will open one soon, its closest officer is still based in Berlin.
Enormous sums of mob money are moving abroad. Guy M. Dunn, a Russia analyst at Control Risks Group Limited in London, which advises Western businesses on security, suggests that most of the 2,000 new commercial banks licensed in Moscow in the last 18 months are fronts to transfer money. General Chebotarev thinks some $40 billion has been transferred abroad since 1992 and continues at $1 billion a month.
The main destinations are banks in Switzerland, Hungary, Belgium, Cyprus and Greece, where there are growing Russian emigre communities. Mr. Dunn said a major part of the luxury property market in the city is being bought by Russians with suitcases of cash for prices up to $3 million.
Last month, at the Moscow airport, customs was stalled for an hour while officials counted out $1 million in cash being taken to London by a passenger. Canadian officials say a popular means of illegal money transfer has been to buy hundreds of Air Canada tickets for cash, take them to Canada in a suitcase and then redeem them.
Organized crime is not merely imitative, but deeply rooted in the past. Stephen Handelman, who is writing a book on Russian crime, noted in the journal "Foreign Affairs" that the traditional Caucasus gang has strict rituals and codes that became a model for the Bolsheviks. Stalin used gangsters to rob banks for the revolution; some later joined the secret police. Under Brezhnev, a widespread black market flourished. The close ties between corrupt bureaucrats and black marketeers provided a model for today's pervasive corruption.
The sudden rise of the market has been an ideal way to launder all that money. "This is organized crime of a quite sophisticated nature," says Mr. Dunn. "The country's up for sale and the people with the most money are the criminals."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Some Indians See a Gamble With Future In Casinos

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

 BODY:
THE rise of gambling halls on Indian reservations from California to Connecticut has added a layer of confusion to what Americans think about the Indians among them, but to the tribes themselves, it has focused attention on a centuries-old question: survival.
Among the clan mothers and other traditional leaders of the Iroquois in Western New York, and among Oglala Sioux elders in the Black Hills of South Dakota, casinos are feared as a threat to the communal way of life they have struggled to preserve. 
 Among once nearly extinct tribes like the Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut, whose culture has been all but lost, the wealth generated by casinos is seen as the means to retrieve the past, rebuild the nation, and provide for its children's future.
What the casino riches have made clear to Indians of both views is that after 350 years of being demonized or romanticized by newcomers taking their land, Indians are still far from being accepted as who they are, rather than as what others would have them be.
The reaction in many states against Indian gaming, they say, shows how uncomfortable the country is with Indians who have the money and power to exercise their rights as sovereign peoples. A century after the Indian Wars ended at Wounded Knee, they suggest, General Sherman's notorious aphorism has merely been updated: The only good Indians are poor ones. "Some people feel that Indians can do anything they want as long as they're doing Indian stuff," said Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, an Indian-rights group. "When they go beyond that, somehow they're taking something away from the white people."
Some critics question whether many tribes pursuing gaming are even legitimately Indian. A cartoon in Connecticut's largest newspaper, The Hartford Courant, ridiculed the Golden Hill Paugussetts, a tiny tribe that has intermarried with blacks, by portraying them as posers named Chief Lottabull, Chief Running Joke and Chief So Sioux Me.
To many non-Indians, especially in states with small Indian populations, Indian casinos can seem fraught with cultural ambiguity, as commerce collides with their time-capsule images of Indians as spiritual, non-materialistic and very distant beings. At the Pequot casino in Ledyard, Conn., non-Indian waitresses in skimpy costumes carry cocktails past the statue of the Rainmaker, a massive urethane brave who shoots a laser arrow into the heavens. In nearby Montville, the drawings for a casino planned by the Mohegan Tribe show patrons entering through the mouth of a wolf, the tribe's symbol.
Virtually all of the 200-plus tribes that have opened bingo halls or casinos say their aim is to preserve their culture. But Ms. Harjo and others warn that the overwhelming success of the Pequots, a tribe of fewer than 300 members whose casino earns an estimated $600 million a year, is obscuring the reality of Indian tribes and Indian gaming across the country.
At the opposite extreme from the assimilated Pequots, who lost their language long ago, is the 220,000-member Navajo Nation, whose tribal council still conducts meetings in Navajo. In between are hundreds of tribes whose circumstances differ according to their traditions, when they encountered white settlers and the remoteness of their reservations.
Some are divided between Christians and traditionalists who maintain their native religion, between full-bloods and mixed-bloods, between elders who have known no other life and younger Indians who have recently returned to the tribe.
And for nearly all, the pot of gold is much smaller than the Pequots' while their needs are much greater. "For the most part it brings revenue to reservations that by most standards exist in third world poverty," said Paul Morehead, director of government affairs for the National Congress of American Indians. For most tribes, gambling raises the same kinds of questions that states face when they legalize lotteries or casinos: Will the financial benefits outweigh the social costs?
These concerns can be minimal for small tribes like the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota outside Minneapolis, whose Mystic Lake casino earns hundreds of millions from non-Indians. They are much greater for large tribes on remote reservations, where the nearest customers are the Indians themselves.
"The real concerns are not cultural," said Duane Beyal, an assistant to Peterson Zah, the president of the Navajo Nation. "Gambling is a part of Navajo culture.
"Our concern is the social impact," he continued. "When you have such a large population with high unemployment, all kinds of poverty and related problems like alcoholism, and you put a casino in the middle of it, what kinds of problems do you have?"
On the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, where divisions between traditionalist Oglala Sioux and mixed-bloods cooperating with the Bureau of Indian Affairs led to widespread violence in the 1970's, those divisions are evident again in a debate over opening three casinos. Sovereignty is an issue for some Oglalas who oppose the casino proposed for the White Clay District, because the gaming compact with the state gives South Dakota criminal jurisdiction over non-tribe members on the reservation. That, the traditionalists say, surrenders treaty rights Sioux warriors died for.
The Gray Eagle Society, a group of Oglala elders, fears the casino's social impact on isolated Pine Ridge, the poorest reservation in the United States. But they also say gambling is contrary to their way and will corrode their sense of community.
"We are people that live in the creation of God," said Marie Brush Breaker Randall, secretary of the society. "We use everything within the creation, and we have survived this long. When you gamble with something, you don't know what's ahead. We don't gamble with anything, because everything is sacred."
In New York, one of the six Iroquois nations, the Oneidas, have opened a casino under a compact with the state, but last week another, the Senecas, voted by a 2-to-1 ratio against allowing casinos.
"Most of the elders, the clan mothers, those we call the long house people, are opposed to gaming," said Richard Hill, a Tuscarora who teaches American studies at the State University of New York at Buffalo. "It's really a matter of profits versus prophecy."
 
Profit and Prophecy
 The prophecy is that of Handsome Lake, a Seneca who declared in 1799 that gambling would someday destroy the Iroquois Nation. Mr. Hill says he sees evidence of it coming true.
The revenue from gaming has helped some tribes, financing housing, health clinics and education, he acknowledges, but arguments over how to spend that revenue have also divided tribes. He also sees risks in opening reservations to crowds of non-Indians.
"The reservation has made possible a certain life style that doesn't provide the satellite dish and Cadillac and other outward trappings of success, but does give a sense of place that money can't buy," he said.
In Connecticut, the 970-member Mohegans are a traditional tribe, yet a modern one. A casino lies at the heart of their plans to buy land for a reservation, build a studies center and buy back sacred lands they lost years ago. "We have a lot of dreams, and this is the energy to fuel those dreams," said Jayne Fawcett, a member of the tribal council. "People don't expect Indians to change, but we're 20th-century Indians."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK MAY USE INDUSTRIAL ZONES AS SHELTER SITES

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
The chairman of the New York City Planning Commission proposed yesterday that zoning regulations be changed to allow increased placement of social-service centers -- including some kinds of homeless shelters and drug clinics -- in neighborhoods now zoned for light industry.
The official, Joseph B. Rose, said the Giuliani administration was "actively considering" the proposal. It could lead to a major change in the city's approach to equitably locating such services, an issue that has been a political lightning rod in neighborhoods across New York. 
 Some advocates for the homeless welcomed the idea, but others felt it would add a further stigma to poor people in need of social services.
Mr. Giuliani, who appointed Mr. Rose in January, has asked for an analysis of the concept within four weeks, his press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, said yesterday. And Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for Planning, is working with the 13-member Planning Commission to help draft the proposal.
Any change in the zoning would be subject to approval by a majority of the Planning Commission, and then the City Council. "This is something that Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter and I have discussed, and we will be presenting it to the Mayor within a month," Mr. Rose said.
Passage of the zoning changes by the Planning Commission is not assured; Mr. Rose is the only Giuliani appointee on the commission. And because of the way terms are staggered, he would not be able to appoint a majority until the summer of 1997.
Mr. Rose, a 34-year-old Democrat, is a member of a prominent New York real-estate family. Before his appointment to the planning post, he spent four years as executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit group devoted to issues of housing, planning and urban development.
Asked about Mr. Rose's proposal, Peter F. Vallone, the majority leader of the City Council, said he had not seen it and knew none of its details but added that the Council's land-use staff experts would examine it.
At a community meeting yesterday afternoon on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Rose told about 150 residents, "There are plenty of other social services facilities that would, perhaps, do better in areas that are now zoned light manufacturing."
And in an interview before the meeting, he said that, "obviously, facility-siting decisions are never going to be easy, and there will always be aggrieved parties."
Still, he said, "The record of government decision-making in this area has been poor, and the record of decisions has aggravated the problems and the tensions."
Among the factors adding to the problem, Mr. Rose said, are regulations that prohibit the location of some of the "most problematic kinds of facilities, like a residential facility for homeless, single substance abusers," in areas that would engender the least resistance from residents.
"In particular, there are many areas of the city in each borough currently zoned for light manufacturing which could well accommodate these kinds of facilities," Mr. Rose said. "Current regulations, though, prohibit them from being considered without a lengthy, expensive and uncertain land-use review process."
From 1985 to 1988, Mr. Rose was chairman of Community Board 5 in mid-Manhattan and more recently has headed its land-use committee.
Under the revised City Charter, adopted in 1989, the Planning Commission was required to adopt what is commonly called a fair-share policy to equitably distribute social-service agencies around the city.
Deputy Mayor Reiter said yesterday that the proposal to rezone industrial areas was part of the administration's review of all policies regarding the placement of social services, including the "fair share" concept. "We've got to start developing a rational approach," she said.
Last month, Mayor Giuliani was quoted in The New York Post as saying that the "fair share" program "deteriorates every neighborhood to bring it down to the lowest common denominator."
Yesterday, Mr. Rose said the policy "raised expectations of community protection, but many communities have been frustrated because facilities have continued to be located in the most saturated areas of the city." He particularly cited Harlem, East New York in Brooklyn, the South Bronx and Mott Haven in the Bronx as communities that had been "oversaturated."
Mr. Rose said the Giuliani administration was specifically looking at a revision of the Community Facility Text of the city's zoning regulations to make light-industry sites available. The Planning Department is studying the Community Facility regulations, he said, and plans to discuss them with the city's 59 community boards and the five borough presidents.
George McDonald, president of the Doe Fund, a group that aids the homeless, called the idea "a giant step towards rational siting policies for the delivery of social services."
Mr. McDonald, an author of a report during the Dinkins administration for a mayoral commission on the homeless, said: "The light-manufacturing areas are perfect because they are an under-utilized land resource. We've lost all these manufacturing jobs and the buildings are empty. And you couldn't use them for residential purposes. So this is a great alternative."
 
'Recipe for Failure'
 But Douglas Lasdon, director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, a private, nonprofit organization, said: "I don't think it's a good idea to ghettoize programs for poor people. I don't think it works. People don't want to go there and it's harder to resolve their problems. Sticking them in manufacturing zones is a recipe for failure."
"What we need is the funding for programs and the political will," Mr. Lasdon said. "We need the Mayor and Joe Rose to go take a look at some of the good programs, the ones that enhance their neighborhoods, and then act as moral leaders in the city."
 The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, raised another concern about the proposal. "You have to proceed with caution because many industrial areas are still home to light industry and the small manufacturers that are critical to the city's economy," she said.
Any change in zoning, Ms. Messinger continued, could open the door to incursions by a variety of enterprises, "so, too many changes could lead to driving out those businesses."
Mr. Rose said the commission had not compiled a list of what industrial neighborhoods might best be suited for social-service agencies, or what kinds of services would be appropriate for those neighborhoods. Between 7 and 10 percent of the city's land is zoned for heavy or light manufacturing use, he said, and at least a quarter of that could accommodate social services.
"This is not to say that all social service facilities belong in these kinds of areas," he said, "but the ability to have these options is a big step forward." As examples of services that might appropriately be placed in an industrial area, Mr. Rose cited a residential drug- or alcohol-treatment program that does not require its clients to be drug-free, and a shelter for single, homeless people.
 
State Agencies Exempted
 "Some kinds of programs can and should be absorbed into residential areas, such as transitional housing for homeless families with children," he added. Ultimately, he said, these decisions have to be made case by case.
State agencies that place social services in city neighborhoods, usually under contracts with private organizations, are not subject to the city's "fair share" policies. To deal with that problem, Deputy Mayor Reiter held a meeting three weeks ago with city and state social service agencies.
The state Commissioner of Social Services, Michael J. Dowling, attended that meeting. Yesterday, he said: "It was recognized that we have to coordinate our efforts in a much better way across all city and state agencies so we can assure that we can site facilities and find the balance, being very sensitive to community needs, and especially avoiding saturation." Further meetings on the problem are planned.
Commissioner Dowling said he would not comment on the proposal to use industrial sites until he had had a chance to study it in detail.

HEADLINE: North Koreans Say Nuclear Fuel Rods Are Being Removed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sunday, May 15

 BODY:
In a direct challenge to the Clinton Administration, North Korea said late Saturday that it has begun extracting nuclear fuel from its largest reactor without international inspectors present, a process that the Defense Department said could provide enough material for four or five nuclear bombs.
The move was announced despite repeated warnings from the Administration that any effort to harvest the fuel would immediately end talks and result in a call for the United Nations to impose economic sanctions. 
 A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, an arm of the United Nations, is headed to North Korea, primarily to finish an inspection that the North Koreans interrupted in March.
North Korea said on Thursday that the process of removing the fuel rods had not begun. On Friday, a harshly worded telex from Pyongyang told the agency that inspectors would not be permitted to closely sample or track the movement of fuel in the reactor, which is separate from the equipment the team was to inspect.
Mr. Clinton and his advisers are now faced with the decision of whether or not to make good on their threats and begin a more direct, and potentially more dangerous, confrontation. North Korea has repeatedly warned that it would view economic sanctions as the equivalent of a declaration of war.
While the North's warnings are often overblown, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said here several weeks ago that prudence would require Washington to improve military readiness on the Korean Peninsula before sanctions were imposed. Mr. Perry said again last week that if sanctions are required, "we will have to take seriously the risk of war."
On Friday night, addressing business leaders in Williamsburg, Va., he said that the removal of spent fuel had begun, but as late as Saturday other Administration officials were saying that they had no solid intelligence to back up his comments.
On the other hand, some Administration officials have suggested that the removal of the fuel rods, which take some time to be converted into bomb-grade plutonium, could be a ploy. North Korea could be hoping to win concessions quickly from the United States in return for granting inspectors the right to keep track of the new load of fuel.
 
Just a Pressure Tactic?
 "It may just be a pressure tactic," an Administration official involved in the issue said Saturday in Washington. "But there is no technical reason that they have to unload the reactor now. They are creating a crisis."
The North Korean statement issued Saturday seemed intended to anticipate the arrival of inspectors at the heavily guarded nuclear site in Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital in Pyongyang. As soon as the inspectors entered the reactor building, they would have seen that the seals the agency places on critical parts of the equipment had been broken so that fuel could be removed.
The announcement from the Korean Central News Agency, the Government's official mouthpiece, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying that the agency's demand to take samples from the fuel rods, which could reveal how much fuel North Korea has harvested in past years, was unreasonable.
"Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove seals and start taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman said. He added that once the process begins it cannot be stopped because it "may cause a new danger." The rods were removed, the spokesman said, within view of security cameras that the agency placed around the reactor, so inspectors should be able to review the operation on tape.
 
Rising International Anxiety
 Replacing spent fuel rods is a routine step at every nuclear reactor, and it usually takes several months to reload the reactor core with a fresh fuel supply. But in the case of North Korea, the routine move has become a source of high international anxiety.
While the spent fuel itself cannot be used to make a bomb, it contains plutonium that can be used to make a bomb core. Until now, the Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea extracted enough plutonium from the plant to make one or two nuclear weapons at most. It is unclear whether North Korea has the technology to build nuclear triggers or the capability of mounting a weapon on a homegrown missile.
Despite the suspicions about the North's weapons capability, the Clinton Administration has justified its continuing long talks by saying that the weapons project was "frozen," -- that is, that Pyongyang was making no progress on additional weapons.
If North Korea's statement on Saturday is true, that assumption is no longer valid. Combined with other activities reported by inspectors, the announcement makes it clear that the North is preparing to turn its spent fuel into plutonium quickly.
During the March trip, inspectors saw that rapid progress had been made on the construction of a second reprocessing line inside the football-field-size building that the North Koreans call their "radiochemical laboratory." That second line seemed intended to double the capability to convert spent fuel into plutonium, in anticipation of the new harvest of fuel that would soon be available.
Satellite imagery also shows that progress is being made on the construction of a new, far bigger nuclear reactor just outside of Yongbyon.
 
The Obstacle of China
 In his speech on Friday night, Mr. Perry said that intense discussions were under way "to insure the world community that the fuel that is taken out of that reactor will not be diverted into more nuclear bombs."
"If we are successful in these discussions," he said, "it will be a major step forward. If we are not successful, and we know that, which we would, then we will have to consider recommending sanctions against North Korea. North Korea has already stated that they would consider sanctions equivalent to a declaration of war."
Getting sanctions through the United Nations would not be easy. China, which has veto power, has repeatedly expressed its opposition to such pressure tactics. But the Administration is betting that the Chinese, after privately warning the North Koreans to back off, will not defend the extraction of the fuel rods.
"I suspect that, if the fuel is really being taken out, they would go along with us," an Administration official said Saturday.

HEADLINE: For East Europe Exiles, Lives in 2 Worlds

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Theirs is the emigre story with a post-cold war postscript. They came for freedom -- to think and write and speak. Some were visiting, but became stranded when things back home in Eastern Europe turned nasty. Others came for good, assuming they would never look back.
Time passed and they became Americans and New Yorkers. They found work in universities, theaters, journals. They made the leap, painful as it was, to writing in English. Their children grew up here, listening to Pearl Jam. 
 Then the unimaginable happened. Communism stumbled, and democracy began spreading through Eastern Europe. The New Yorkers filtered back, curious, to take a look. Suddenly, they were spending a lot of time on airplanes.
Now many Eastern European intellectuals who have lived in New York City for years are adopting bi-continental lives -- living and working in two worlds and finding unexpected pleasure and pain in belonging to neither and both.
Several professors are helping shape the transition of their home region to capitalism. Others are helping rebuild university departments. Emigre artists are working back home once again. A playwright's plays are again being produced.
For some of them, Eastern Europe after Communism is an antidote to much that is wearying in American life. It is a more intimate universe, familiar, and the place, at least for now, with a sense of possibility.
"Poland is a small country," said Ewa Kuryluk, a Polish-born artist, art historian and novelist living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan who has been in the United States since 1981. "Even after so many years of absence, people remember you. You are famous.
"So every time I go to Poland, I have this sense of being able to do something, of people coming to me with great enthusiasm," she said. Referring to the impact of the American recession on her field, she said, "Here, it is just the opposite."
On a recent visit to Warsaw to start work on a series about democracy and the free market for Polish television, Michael Kott, 40, a Polish-born writer and translator who emigrated with his family when he was 12 and now lives in the East Village, recalls repeatedly bumping into Polish friends from New York.
First came an actress, who was in Warsaw for a part in a production of "Six Degrees of Separation." Then came a jazz musician Mr. Kott knows from New York; both meetings occurred in the lobby of the Hotel Europejski.
"I would say that virtually everyone either has an aging mother or aunt or an article or an exhibit or a girlfriend in Poland," said Mr. Kott, who plans to spent most of the next 12 months there.
One of the largest groups of bi-continental Eastern European intellectuals in New York are the Polish, like Mr. Kott, Ms. Kuryluk and Andrzej Rapaczynski, a professor of law at Columbia University who was driven out of Poland in 1968 and, over the next 20 years, returned only twice.
Now he is constantly in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, working on a massive project on privatization. He is on the faculty of a university in Prague and, at times, has flown back and forth twice a month.
The experience has brought him both great joy and disappointment.
"I rediscovered my past, which was wonderful," Professor Rapaczynski said. "But in the meantime, I had had 20 years of my life. And that life was completely alien to many people who were close to me."
 
Viewing It Differently
 "I thought it was part of me, that I was enriched by it," he said. "But to them, it was simply what took me away from them. Somehow, there was no interest in that. So in some ways, those relationships turned out to be very painful."
Nevertheless, he said, his work in Eastern Europe has become "a huge part of my life now." He added, "Most of the adrenaline in my blood is somehow caused by things that are going on over there."
This generation of emigres, now in middle age, came to New York in waves -- the first group around the time of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the second in 1981, when Poles traveling abroad found themselves marooned by the imposition of martial law at home.
Roman Frydman was in the first group. Now an associate professor of economics at New York University, he left Poland in 1968, driven out by the government's anti-Semitic campaigns. A 20-year-old student, he left with few regrets and no intention to return.
Irena Grudzinska Gross left Poland the following year. A student advocate, she had been arrested and imprisoned. The invasion of Czechoslovakia represented to her the "ideological suicide" of the Socialist system. It was a signal that reform would never happen in her country either.
 
Home by Christmas
 The 1981 group was different. They were not thinking about emigration. Some were traveling, some were on academic fellowships, some were exhibiting their work. They would be home by Christmas, many figured. But martial law intervened. Phone lines were broken, flights were canceled. They got stuck.
"You can't just sit in front of the TV set and wait," said Rafal Olbinski, a Polish-born illustrator and painter. Like everyone else, Mr. Olbinski found work. When martial law was lifted a few years later, he had become too busy to go back. "I got Americanized," he said. "New York-ified."
Some stayed by default; there was no conscious moment of decision. For others, the choice became impossibly draining. Elzbieta Matynia, a Polish-born sociologist now at the New School for Social Research, became ill from the stress: "I came from a country where to make choices was not my business."
One way or another, they worked out their immigration status and settled. Some married Americans, some one another. Fellowships turned into teaching jobs that turned into tenure. Many fell into specialties that had little connection to their past. Some deliberately avoided becoming what Professor Matynia calls "professional Poles."
Professor Frydman became a specialist in what makes market economies work. Professor Rapaczynski taught philosophy at Yale and Princeton, then switched to law. Ms. Kuryluk and Janusz Glowacki, a Polish-born playwright, chose, in their 30's and 40's, to make the hard switch to writing in English.
 
Keeping in Touch
 They kept an eye on one another, as Mr. Kott puts it. They attended one another's birthdays and book parties and openings. They met at dinner parties and lectures and readings. Polish artists designed the posters for Mr. Glowacki's plays. They remained bound, if loosely, by shared history and sensibilities.
To illustrate, Mr. Glowacki tells a story: He was in Florida recently visiting friends when, he says, he heard Vice President Al Gore on the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour predicting that Russia would become the guardian of freedom in Eastern Europe. He immediately got on the phone.
"So I am calling Poles," he explains, "because very few Americans will understand the joke."
To many Eastern European emigres, the collapse of Communism came as a surprise -- if not the collapse itself, at least the speed with which it happened. In the spring of 1989, many Poles in New York headed home to witness what Mr. Glowacki calls the first "sort-of-free elections."
Since that time, many have built whole new additions onto their lives. They fly back and forth regularly, sometimes staying for months. If the new Marriott hotel in Warsaw had a frequent-visitor prize, Professor Rapaczynski believes he would have gotten it. .
 
Making Up Time
 Mr. Kott, the writer and translator, had visited Poland only a few times since leaving in childhood. But he spent two years working there between 1991 and 1993 and is returning later this month.
Professor Frydman, the economist, had never specialized in Eastern Europe before he went back to Poland as a consultant in 1989. But he became fascinated by the process of privatization and he and Professor Rapaczynski ended up spending much of 1990 in Warsaw advising the government.
Professor Frydman then organized an economics program at Central European University in Prague. Now he and Professor Rapaczynski are working in 12 countries in the region, heading a research project aimed at understanding and guiding the transition to capitalism.
Mr. Glowacki's play, "Antigone in New York," is being performed in eight theaters in Poland and is to open in Prague in June and in Leningrad in September. His book about the Solidarity political movement has finally been published in Poland, after being published during the 1980's all over the world.
Even "Hunting Cockroaches," his earlier play about two Polish emigres in New York, was finally performed in Poland. In a delectable example of the absurdity Mr. Glowacki savors, it was censored as anti-Polish in the 1980's -- only to be criticized in the 1990's as anti-American.
 
New School Pivotal
 One focus of trans-Atlantic flux in New York City is the New School for Social Research, which, earlier in the century, rescued 167 endangered scholars from Europe during the Nazi period, and which has been working quietly since the mid-1980's to support the democracy movement in Eastern and Central Europe.
Now scholars travel back and forth between New York and the region, participating in seminars on the transition to democracy. From a handful of clandestine meetings in Warsaw apartments in the mid-1980's, the project has grown to include hundreds of people from all over Eastern and Central Europe.
The head of the New School's East and Central Europe program is Professor Matynia, who arrived from Poland on a one-year fellowship in 1981, got stuck when martial law was declared, fell in love with an American film maker making a documentary about Solidarity and ended up deciding to stay.
In a way, she said recently, she is one of a new breed.
"We don't deny our backgrounds," she said. "We try to use them creatively. We also try to use that sense of the American experience. It's not that we are between cultures, meaning nowhere. I like to think that I'm a very good American when I'm in Poland or abroad."

JANUSZ GLOWACKI, the Polish playwright, was stranded abroad when martial law was declared in 1981. He did not return to visit until 1989. He now goes back regularly. His play, "Antigone in New York," is playing in eight theaters in Poland and is to open later this year in Prague and Leningrad.
 
IRENA GRUDZINSKA GROSS left Poland in 1969 after being imprisoned for political activities. For the next 20 years, she was unable to get a visa to return. She recently spent a sabbatical year in Poland, writing and doing television commentary. She runs a project on Eastern European constitutionalism for the American Council of Learned Societies in New York.
 
MICHAEL KOTT, a 40-year-old author and translator who came from Poland with his parents at age 12, spent much of 1991 to 1993 working in Poland. He intends to return later this month to spend a year developing a series for Polish television on democracy and the free market sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
 
ELZBIETA MATYNIA, a Polish-born sociologist, found herself stranded in New York City on a one-year academic fellowship when martial law was declared in Poland in 1981. She now runs the East and Central Europe Program at the New School for Social Research, organizing democracy seminars and other forms of academic and intellectual exchange between that region and the United States.

HEADLINE: Short on Soccer, U.S. Gears for Heavy Dose

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MISSION VIEJO, Calif., May 14

 BODY:
In a month, the world's largest sporting event will come to the country with the world's smallest interest in soccer.
The World Cup, soccer's quadrennial international tournament, is expected to attract a cumulative television audience of 32 billion during the monthlong event, which starts June 17. It will lure 1.2 million foreign visitors to the United States and pump $4 billion into the national economy. And the organizers' biggest hope is that it will relieve the United States of its status as soccer's biggest undeveloped outpost. 
 Will Americans sit up and take notice, or will the World Cup pass with the fleeting novelty of a solar eclipse?
Much of the American interest will likely depend on the performance on the young, inexperienced United States team, which as the host automatically qualified for the tournament. The 23 other teams, including players who are among the biggest celebrities in their countries, begin arriving in the United States on Tuesday. Checking in first will be Saudi Arabia at its training site in Rowan College in Glassboro, N.J. Saudi soccer officials, meanwhile, are expected to bivouac at an Atlantic City casino hotel, said a World Cup spokesman, John Griffin.
The United States training site in Mission Viejo is also waiting for overseas arrivals because several of America's important players have been competing in Europe.
Most of the world will watch the World Cup in rapt awareness, and a worldwide television audience of two billion is expected for the final match on July 17. But the tournament will have to compete for American viewers with the National Basketball Association playoffs, baseball's march toward the All-Star Game break and the opening of National Football League training camps. The World Cup fan base in the United States includes 16 million people who play soccer in the country and ethnic groups whose members grew up with the sport.
Of the 52 total games, 35 have already sold out, thanks in part to dream first-round matchups -- including Italy versus Ireland -- and the recently concluded individual ticket sales. Organizers expect all 3.6 million tickets will eventually be sold. But the anticipation of a successful, profitable World Cup is being tempered by concerns about security and the tournament's intended legacy -- the creation of a major domestic soccer league.
The 24 finalists have been divided into 6 groups of 4 teams. After each team plays the others in its group, the top 16 will advance to the second round, in which a single loss means elimination. Play begins on June 17 when the defending champion, Germany, takes on Bolivia, and concludes with the championship game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., on July 17.
 
No England, France or Japan
 Games will be played at nine venues from Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The failure of such tourist-intense countries as England, France and Japan to qualify for the World Cup finals, and the grouping of such popular teams as Italy and Ireland in New York, may diminish the expected economic impact at some venues. In Dallas and Chicago, blocks of hotel rooms set aside for the World Cup have gone unclaimed, though all games in Chicago are sold out.
Sales are also lagging in Dallas, which is host to a relatively unglamorous lineup of Spain, Nigeria, Korea and Bulgaria.
"I'm still holding to what I've said for a long time; we're going to sell out every game," said Alan Rothenberg, chairman of World Cup USA '94.
 
The Debate Over Fences
 Of greater concern than attendance at World Cup games is safety. Organizers were rebuffed in their initial request to have alcohol sales banned in and around stadiums on the day of games, as was done in Italy at the 1990 World Cup. Now the request is that beer not be sold in the stands or after halftime. Organizers and officials of FIFA, soccer's governing body, fear the potential of fans being crushed and strongly object to the placement of fences around the fields at the Cotton Bowl, RFK Stadium in Washington, and Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, Calif.
Authorities at each site determine their security arrangements. World Cup organizers and FIFA officials have accused police officials of panicking in overreaction to the threat of hooliganism.
"FIFA is of the opinion that the only things behind fences are prisoners and animals," Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, said recently while in New York.
As usual, anticipation of the World Cup elicits wild passion and fevered nuttiness, among participants as well as fans. The Swiss coach, Roy Hodgson, and the Italian coach, Arrigo Sacchi, have restricted their players to sex only after games, not before. Gheorghe Hagi, the tempestuous Romanian midfielder, is serving a two-game suspension for spitting at another player in an exhibition match against Northern Ireland.
 
Kidnapped Father Is Released
 Romario, the creative, Brazilian forward, can concentrate on soccer now that his kidnapped father was released unharmed a week ago. As kidnappers go, those who apprehended Edevair Souza de Faria were clumsy but sympathetic, providing a television for Romario's father to watch his son play a club match in Spain.
Diego Maradona, Argentina's star of past World Cups, fired at Argentine reporters with an air rifle earlier this year and has been barred from tuneup matches in Japan because several years ago he tested positive for cocaine and was arrested for cocaine possession. He has been granted a three-month visa to play in the World Cup in the United States.
All of these international stars, the Michael Jordans of the soccer set, could walk down most American streets with complete invisibility. Opinion polls taken last year showed that fewer than 30 percent of Americans even knew the World Cup was coming to the United States.
Although the evidence is anecdotal -- billboards, advertising on television and in newspapers, news coverage and the appearance of memorabilia in sporting goods stores -- awareness in the United States appears to be increasing. Still, organizers will be satisfied with a relatively modest 4.5 average rating for the 11 games to be broadcast on ABC.
A successful World Cup is being based on three requirements: a profit, advancement by the United States team to the second round and the creation of a major soccer league in the United States. Asked the chance of all three occurring, Rothenberg, realizing he might have to eat his words, said, "I think we're a lead-pipe cinch at all three of those."
 
Surplus Is Expected
 In fact, a surplus of $20 million is expected on a World Cup USA '94 budget of between $300 million and $400 million. As for the United States advancing to the second round, no host team has ever failed to do so in the 64-year history of the tournament. The soccer league is scheduled to begin on April 9, 1995, but as of now it has no players, teams or stadiums, and the asking price for investors has been lowered from $10 million to $5 million in a $100 million capitalization project.
Whether soccer in the United States remains primarily a youth sport or is tugged from ignored backwaters to the sport's mainstream may rest on a single game, the United States versus Switzerland on June 18 at the Pontiac Silverdome outside Detroit. This is the first game for the Americans. It will be played in an unusual setting, indoors, on natural grass that has been trucked in, and it will be broadcast nationally by ABC.
"A lot of people are going to be curious," Rothenberg said. "If we do well, I think we could start to catch lightning in a bottle. If we don't, I think we'll still have a great following and a great tournament, but we won't have the potential miracle that's out there to be performed."

HEADLINE: Hands Off Haiti, Say Dominicans

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 14

 BODY:
With the United States pressing new efforts to isolate Haiti's military junta, the leading candidates in the Dominican presidential elections scheduled for Monday are strongly opposed to any foreign intervention next door.
They are also critical of the international embargo against Haiti. The Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, has long been scornful in any case of international efforts to force Haiti's army to abandon power and allow the return from exile of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 When a rump group of Haitian lawmakers named a new President this week, a move strongly condemned by most other countries in the region, Mr. Balaguer's Government refused to take a position on the matter. The Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister, Fabio Herrera Cabral, called it "an internal problem of Haiti."
Relations between Mr. Balaguer and Father Aristide have been severely strained since the priest harshly criticized the Dominican Republic for its treatment of migrant workers from Haiti in his presidential campaign in 1990. Diplomats say the Balaguer Government's failure to enforce the embargo on oil sales to Haiti imposed by the United Nations in October has enabled the Haitian military to defy pressures for its removal from power.
 
Rival Silent on Issue
 Since the sanctions were widened to ban all trade and noncommercial air traffic to Haiti, the Dominican Government has continued to allow Haitian charter flights to land here.
Mr. Balaguer's chief rival here, 57-year-old Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who has narrowly led in most recent opinion polls, has been more supportive of Father Aristide's efforts to return to office. In his final news conference before the election, he said today that he would enforce any international sanctions taken against Haiti.
But aides to Mr. Pena Gomez say that with contraband fuel and other goods sold to Haiti now the biggest source of income for many Dominicans in areas near the border separating the two countries, stopping the trade would be impractical and highly unpopular.
The Clinton Administration has recently stepped up pressure on the Dominican Government to enforce the embargo and has begun to speak of a possible need for military intervention to unseat Haiti's military leaders. But senior aides to Mr. Pena Gomez say they would only support a new diplomatic initiative aimed at starting discussions between Father Aristide and the military that would require a compromise solution from both sides.
"We will have to encourage every sector in Haiti to undertake a dialogue that will require profound concessions from all," said Hugo Tolentino, a close adviser to Mr. Pena Gomez. "Any intervention would hurt Haiti, would hurt the Dominican Republic and would hurt all of Latin America."
Asked what these concessions might be, Mr. Tolentino said Father Aristide might have to remain out of office in exchange for a removal of Haiti's military leadership and for a round of new, internationally monitored elections.
 
A Focus of the Campaign
 The United States intervened in the Dominican Republic in 1965 after the outbreak of civil war. Because of their own experience, Mr. Tolentino said, most Dominicans would strongly oppose any armed intervention in Haiti.
Haiti has been the bitter focus of much of the campaigning between Mr. Pena Gomez and Mr. Balaguer, who is 87 and has served as President for six nonconsecutive terms in a political career that began in the 1930's.
Mr. Balaguer's partisans have frequently focused on Mr. Pena Gomez's black skin to exploit a deep-seated dislike of Haitians among many Dominicans. Through innuendo, they have sought to depict him as a closet Haitian bent on uniting the two countries and destroying the Dominican Republic's national identity.
"Pena Gomez has been pushed thoroughly on the defensive on the issue of Haiti," said a diplomat who was pessimistic about efforts to enlist the Dominican Republic's cooperation in efforts to unseat the Haitian military.

HEADLINE: Unfazed North Leads in Virginia G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan has criticized him. So have Colin L. Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senator John W. Warner, the dean of Virginia Republicans.
But with less than three weeks before the state Republican party picks a nominee to face Senator Charles S. Robb in the fall, Oliver N. North, the former Marine lieutenant colonel and central figure in the Iran-contra scandal, has pushed ahead with his conservative agenda, unfazed by his attackers and, evidently, unharmed. 
 Proclaiming love of God and country and disdain for the left-leaning ways of Congress, he remains the favorite among delegates who will choose the candidate -- even with independent polls suggesting that another candidate might have a better chance against Mr. Robb.
"This is the last lap of the first race in a two-race season," Mr. North said in an interview here this week. "I'm way out in front."
 
Referendum on Character
 Mr. North, who is 50, is being challenged for the nomination by another Reagan Administration alumnus, James C. Miller, a 52-year-old economist and former budget director.
But because their political views are virtually indistinguishable, the race has become something of a referendum on Mr. North's character and celebrity, for his role in the arms-for-hostages scandal, his admission that he lied to Congress and his 1989 conviction on three felony charges that were later overturned.
In a letter made public in March, Mr. Reagan wrote, "I do have to admit that I am getting getting pretty steamed about the statements coming from Oliver North."
Mr. Reagan was referring to assertions by Mr. North that his lies came on orders from the former President. "I never instructed him or anyone in my Administration to mislead," Mr. Reagan said.
Mr. North responded in a letter, telling Mr. Reagan that his comments had been used out of context.
Mr. Warner has called Mr. North "unfit" to serve in the Senate, and General Powell has said he would "not feel confident" with him.
 
Not Stung Badly
 Rebukes from such respected conservatives would seem to spell disaster for a candidate whose values and ardent patriotism otherwise mirror their own. But the private surveys of delegates conducted by each campaign show that Mr. North's past and the verbal attacks have not knocked him out of the lead. Campaign aides for Mr. North say the margin over Mr. Miller remains more than 20 points. Mr. Miller's staff members say their surveys show it is less.
Whatever the spread, the dispute over who said what has appeared to energize many North supporters, who say either that they believe Mr. North was telling the truth before Congress or that his testimony was appropriate because a good soldier is trained to protect his superiors. It also plays well to a conservative audience.
"It doesn't bother me at all," said Sannie Re Blomberg, an elderly housewife from Danville, Va., and a North delegate, referring to the contretemps with Mr. Reagan and the more recent criticism from Mr. Warner and others.
 
Shaking His Head
 It is that kind of loyalty that has Mr. North's hopes soaring and Mr. Miller shaking his head. Yet the loyalty has translated into a serious advantage for Mr. North, who has raised much of his $6 million war chest from sources outside of Virginia. Mr. Miller has struggled, by comparison, trying to convince delegates that his experience and lack of political baggage would make him a more viable candidate in the fall.
By this week, Mr. Miller had raised all of $540,000, most of it, his aides said, from within the state.
Even state party leaders acknowledge that Mr. North has not been damaged by President Reagan or others. "They might be bringing some people over to Miller," Patrick M. McSweeney, the Virginia Republican chairman, said of the critical remarks. "But a like number are going the other way."
 
'High Negatives Can Win'
 Citing other conservative Republican senators who overcame image problems, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and Jesse A. Helms of North Carolina, Mr. McSweeney added, "High negatives can win."
Rather than attack Mr. North in conversations with delegates, Mr. Miller emphasizes his own electability, constantly citing the independent polls that show he could defeat Mr. Robb in a two-way race and Mr. North could not.
But Mr. North dismisses such conclusions, not least because he expects that if he wins the Republican nomination other candidates might jump into the general election, splitting the votes against him. Currently, L. Douglas Wilder, Virginia's former Governor and Mr. Robb's biggest Democratic rival, is collecting the 15,000 signatures he would need to get onto the ballot as an independent.
 
'I Am More Qualified'
 Less colorful than Mr. North -- but also with no questions of character to defend -- Mr. Miller plays his former number-crunching job for President Reagan as a trump card.
"I am more qualified to do the job," Mr. Miller stressed to a group of state delegates. Because only delegates vote, not the general electorate, both candidates have been criss-crossing the state, meeting them at small receptions, lunches and other social functions. "Chuck Robb has got to go," Mr. Miller added. "We have two solid conservative candidates, but only one can beat him."
Mr. Miller has, at least, been heartened in recent weeks by his campaign surveys and by anecdotal evidence that delegates are switching. For that reason, his aides say, Mr. Miller has become more animated in meetings with delegates.
Some of his enthusiasm appeared to be rubbing off. Several delegates who identified themselves as North supporters upon arrival said they had been vacillating in recent weeks and after listening to Miller, were ready to abandon Mr. North.
"I have momentum," Mr. Miller said. "As we get closer to when delegates take a harder look at who the candidates are, they might really love Ollie and really want to stick it to Congress. But if they choose Ollie, they can't beat Chuck Robb."
 
Both Men Sought Help
 Mr. Miller's only apparent slip throughout the campaign was an acknowledgement that he sought psychiatric help for a mood disorder after the death of his father several years ago. Mr. Miller volunteered the information last month on the same day he challenged Mr. North to disclose his medical records, presumably to call attention to Mr. North's psychiatric treatment 20 years ago.
But the episode barely caused a blip, largely because Mr. Miller's problem was not perceived as serious and Mr. North had acknowledged his difficulties, in a general way, in an autobiography three years ago.
Mr. Miller readily concedes that to overtake Mr. North by the convention he will have to do a better job, convincing delegates that Mr. North's negative ratings would make him a sure loser to Mr. Robb in the fall, even though many political experts in Virginia cringe at the prospects of a North-Robb showdown for all the mud that could be slung.
 
Robb's Image Problem
 Mr. Robb is considered a strong front-runner in a race that includes State Senator Virgil H. Goode and a Richmond lawyer, Sylvia Clute.
In addition to acknowledging marital indiscretions, including acceptance of a massage from a former beauty queen, Mr. Robb has faced allegations -- which are unproved -- that he socialized with drug users. The charges were raised three years ago in a book, written by a private investigator who claimed Mr. Robb attended parties where cocaine was used. He has denied ever using drugs or being around drug users.
Unlike Virginia Democrats, who will select their candidate through a primary on June 14, the Republicans are staging a two-day convention, over the June 3-4 weekend. While anyone can become a delegate for a small contribution to the party, about $35 in most districts, the ballots of those attending, perhaps up to 14,500, will be compressed into fewer than 9,000 actual votes.
That number is determined by a weighted formula that takes into account the number of delegates, where they live and how their districts voted for George Bush in the 1992 Presidential election and for George F. Allen, the Republican who was elected governor last year.

HEADLINE: W. Graham Claytor, Architect Of Amtrak Growth, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS 

 BODY:
W. Graham Claytor Jr., who ended a long career in the railroad industry by guiding Amtrak to a measure of prosperity, died yesterday at the Blake Memorial Hospital in Bradenton, Fla. Mr. Claytor, who lived in Washington and Holmes Beach, Fla., was 82.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Claytor retired last year as president and chairman of the national passenger railroad, which expanded its ridership and revenues during his 11-year tenure.
He was credited with helping to revive the ailing railroad by many experts, and even some critics of its operations. By the time he retired, fares and other revenues covered 80 percent of Amtrak's expenses, up from 42 percent in 1980.
Before retiring, Mr. Claytor predicted that Amtrak might be able to cover all of its operating costs, something that no national railroad system in the world does now, by the year 2000. Amtrak, formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, was created by Congress to take over the nation's failing passenger lines.
Mr. Claytor and his managers patched together a network that eventually offered improved service, ticketing and reservations, and cut costs.
 
Turning Railroad Around
 Stephen Moore, an economist with the Heritage Foundation, which has opposed Federal subsidies for Amtrak, complimented Mr. Claytor and his team, saying: "They have really turned that railroad around."
The main hall at Washington's Union Station was named "Claytor Concourse" by Amtrak's board in recognition of Mr. Claytor's efforts to restore the historic station.
He handed over the leadership of Amtrak last year to Thomas Downs, who called it "kind of a miracle" that Mr. Claytor kept Amtrak alive during a decade of hostile Administrations.
Before joining Amtrak, Mr. Claytor had served from 1963 to 1977 as vice president, then president and finally chairman of the Southern Railway. At a time when many railroads were in financial straits, Southern thrived under Mr. Claytor's leadership. In 1982, Southern consolidated with the Norfolk and Western Railway to become Norfolk Southern.
After his retirement from Southern, Mr. Claytor served from 1977 to 1979 as Secretary of the Navy. He also served in the Carter Administration as Acting Secretary of Transportation in 1979, and as Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1979 to 1981.
He also practiced law in Washington with the firm of Covington & Burling from 1938 to 1967, and again from 1981 to 1982.
William Graham Claytor Jr. was born in 1912 in Roanoke, Va. He graduated from the University of Virginia, and in 1936 received a law degree from Harvard University, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review.
He also served as a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand and Justice Louis D. Brandeis. He served in the Pacific as a Navy lieutenant commander during World War II. As commander of the Cecil J. Doyle, he was instrumental in the rescue of almost 100 American sailors from the cruiser Indianapolis after it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.
Mr. Claytor is survived by his wife, Frances; a son, W. Graham 3d, of Alameda, Calif.; a daughter, Dr. Murray Claytor of Atlanta; a brother, Richard A., of Bethesda, Md., and two grandchildren. Another brother, Robert, the retired head of the Norfolk Southern railroad, died last year.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
The Nominee, in His Own Words: a 'Mandate of Equal Justice Under Law'

 BODY:
The speeches and writings of Judge Stephen G. Breyer, nominated by President Clinton for the United States Supreme Court on Friday, provide a glimpse into his intellect, passions and personality. His legal opinions for the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit are long on analysis and short on flourishes, reflecting his preference to be understood rather than to dazzle. He tries to use plain language and everyday examples, for instance using the need to fill a car with gas to make an argument of logic. He makes few appeals to emotion, but he is passionate about making the law available to people and cites a need for flexibility from the bench. While his opinions are dry, his personality, and self-deprecating wit, peek through clearly in his speeches and nonjudicial writing. Following are excerpts.
 
On His Motivation
 From his speech when he was sworn in to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston on Dec. 18, 1980: 
 Your support suggests that you have confidence that I'll be a good judge, that I'll be honest and capable in seeking to carry out the mandate of equal justice under law. That has been an aim of my life in the law, and I hope that future years will show that your faith in me was justified.
 
On Plain Writing
 From a 1994 speech about education to the Massachusetts Commission on the Common Core of Learning:
Isn't law, after all, simply a body of rules, standards and practices, developed by, and applied to, groups of human beings, as part of their inevitable effort to live together peacefully and productively, justly and with freedom?
As an appellate judge, I set for myself a goal of trying to write my opinions so that a high school student, if willing to take a little time, would understand that, in the circumstances, the law, as revealed in that opinion, makes sense -- both in terms of basic fairness and in terms of helping people live decent, productive lives.
 
On the Public's Ownership
 From a 1991 speech about the new Federal courthouse on Boston's Fan Pier:
This most beautiful site in Boston does not belong to the judges, it does not belong to the lawyers, it does not belong to the Federal Government, it does not belong to the litigants, it belongs to the public. And if the public cannot use that site and see it as theirs, if every man, woman and child in Boston cannot take a walk on that pier, and see it as theirs and use it so that they can look out across the city and enjoy that beautiful site, enjoy that public space, if they cannot do that, then we have failed to achieve an important function of this building.
 
On Religious Scruples
 From a dissent in Alexander v. Boston University, 1985, in which the majority found that students may be disqualified for financial aid for refusing to fill out forms they said conflicted with their religious principles:
I agree that the students have not checked the paper box on the proper form. As a general matter, the government has a strong administrative interest in insisting that applicants fill out forms properly. But are there not stronger reasons for the government simply to overlook so trifling a deviation from the bureaucratic norm, at least where the applicants have a genuine religious or ideological scruple that prohibits their supplying the information on one form but not on another, equally useful one? To deny this, in a nation as diverse as ours, housing so many strongly held but differing points of view, is to exacerbate conflict where it could be muted. It is also to threaten an unnecessary weakening of judicial authority insofar as that authority rests on judicial reluctance to intervene in ideological disputes unless and until they focus upon differences over matters of substance.
 
On Middle Ground
 From U.S. v. Church of Scientology of Boston Inc., 1991:
Therefore, Powell must have meant that an examination of relevant material was a "necessary" examination. Consequently, "to the extent necessary" means "to the extent relevant."
This argument sounds logical, but it is not. In ordinary English there is a "middle" set of circumstances that "necessary" and "unnecessary" do not completely distribute between them. For example, it is necessary that my car have gas if I am going to drive it; it is unnecessary that it have a new paint job; but, it is neither "necessary" nor "unnecessary" that I clean the windshields -- to do so would simply be a wise precaution. Similarly, an investigation of whatever documents "might throw light" on the matter is not an "unnecessary" investigation, but neither can one conclude that it is "necessary." It might, for example, simply be somewhat helpful.
 
On the Courts
 From a 1991 lecture at the University of Southern California Law School on the use of legislative history in statutory interpretation:
First, I assume that appellate courts are in part administrative institutions that aim to help resolve disputes and, while doing so, interpret, and thereby clarify, the law. Second, I assume that law itself is a human institution, serving basic human or societal needs. It is therefore properly subject to praise, or to criticism, in terms of certain pragmatic values, including both formal values, such as coherence and workability, and widely shared substantive values, such as helping to achieve justice by interpreting the law in accordance with the "reasonable expectations" of those to whom it applies.
 
On Sentencing Guidelines
 From U.S. v. Mirna Rivera, June 1993, on the Federal sentencing guidelines, which he had earlier help set:
Ultimately, however, the Guidelines cannot dictate how courts should sentence in such special, unusual or other-than-ordinary circumstances. And, that is as it should be. As we have said, [see pp. 4-5, supra] the very theory of the Guideline system is that when courts, drawing upon experience adn informed judgment in such cases, decide to depart, they will explain their departures. The courts of appeals and the Sentencing Commission, will examine, and learn from, those reasons. And, the resulting knowledge will help the Commission to change, to refine, and to improve, the Guidelines themselves. That is the theory of partnership that the guidelines imply.
 
On Economic Regulation
 From his review of "Private Choices and Public Health: The AIDS Epidemic in an Economic Perspective" by Tomas J. Philipson and Richard A. Posner (Harvard University Press, 1994), in The New York Times Book Review:
There is an important evaluative difference between health and safety policy, in which scientific, medical and practical as well as ethical and emotional factors must play an important role, and more purely economic regulation -- say, of transportation and energy -- in which public policy traditionally has recognized economic theory as telling at least a very large part of the entire story.
It was, for example, fairly easy for economists in the 60's and 70's to bring economic insight to bear on policy conclusions by first announcing that airline or trucking regulation would produce unnecessarily high prices and then skeptically challenging supporters of regulation to come forward with noneconomic arguments powerful enough to justify an economically faulty policy. But the same kind of skeptical challenge in the case of government-supported AIDS policy does not ring true.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Economics alone cannot prescribe how much a society should spend on health and safety. Even if, like the authors, we make the rather extraordinary assumption that choices about sexual behavior are rational (like mountain climbing), we must still recognize that society does provide massive relief for the California earthquake victims who "chose" to live on a fault line; it does help treat and pay for research for lung cancer, whose victims often "chose" to smoke; it has built a Social Security system around the concern that rational individuals may not properly save for old age, and it quite reasonably can and does spend money to rescue mountain climbers in distress. Economics can wisely inform our efforts to attain our goals; but ultimately, if we prefer John Donne to Adam Smith, economists cannot prove us wrong. Nor can the authors.
 
On Human Nature
 From a letter to The Boston Globe, Feb. 26, 1993:
Given the continuous criticism of Boston drivers, how probable is the following? Your car stops in the South Station Tunnel at 5:20 p.m. when you're on the way to give a lecture. Instead of honking and swerving around you, leaving you to create the traffic jam of the week, the driver of the next car in back gives a friendly wave, pushes you out of the tunnel and into Chinatown, leaving you near a phone booth and driving off before you can say "thank you."
Well, that's what happened on Feb. 22 (I gave the lecture on time), and this note is to say, "Faith in human nature is sometime restored. Thank you."

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
Listening to Voters: Proposal in Congress for Polls

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To help it serve the people, Congress already has barbers and garage attendants and elevator operators on automatic elevators. It has parliamentarians and sergeants-at-arms and even ordinary cops. For advice, it can turn to economists, scientists and accountants.
Even so, its work is widely viewed as imperfect. 
 So here's an idea. To overcome the impression that senators and representatives do not care what the people think, maybe Congress should hire a pollster.
That proposal is embodied in H.R. 4081, a bill introduced not long ago by Representative Ron Klink, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and ardently promoted by Alan Kay, a retired, wealthy businessman who established the Americans Talk Issues Foundation to do polls on issues he thinks are important.
Their arguments, though the bill is getting nowhere, are intriguing. They reflect both an acceptance of the public view of Congress as a trivial institution that serves itself and special interests and a proposed solution for that problem that only underscores the reasons for the public's distrust.
The Ross Perot view of what is wrong with Congress is that it is so caught up in itself that it does not care what the people think, that it won't vote for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget, or impose term limits on itself or stop wasting money.
A differing view is that Congress is already too much a weather vane whose careerist tendencies cause too slavish an effort to move every time the public wind shifts.
Mr. Klink's argument seeks to finesse that issue. Whether it is good or bad, he says, members of Congress already rely heavily on all sorts of faulty measures about what the nation thinks, from telephone tallies to deluges of postcards to what they read or hear about real public opinion polls. What troubles him is that they do not know whether their information is any good.
So he wants an office to do scientific public opinion polls on a regular basis to provide the authoritative answers. "If we are going to do it," the freshman Democrat from the Pittsburgh suburbs said recently, "and we are doing it, make sure the polling is for real."
Mr. Kay's argument is grander. At the recent 49th annual convention of the American Association for Public Opinion Research in Danvers, Mass., he maintained, "In every issue area no one is yet adequately researching what people want, majority or consensus, for national policy and legislation."
And the poll gap, he contended, doomed lawmakers to "failing to fulfill a constitutionally assigned responsibility, specifically the responsibility for representing their constituents."
"The public wants its voice heard just as loud as the lobbyist," Mr. Kay said.
He did not have an easy time of it. Other pollsters disagreed. Thad Cantril from Cambridge, Mass. argued from the back of the room that the public's voice was an uncertain beacon for legislators. "We would never have had a Marshall Plan if we had followed public opinion," Mr. Cantril said. "One of the reasons we don't have a serious foreign policy is because we pay too much attention to public opinion."
And Cliff Zukin, director of the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers, agreed and added the argument that "on most issues, there isn't public opinion" in any firm, definite sense. Any effort to denote an authoritative finding of what America thinks on an issue, Mr. Zukin said, "is probably dangerous."
Mr. Klink disagrees. He recently wrote: "I am not proposing government by polling, any more than we have government by polling with the current system of guessing the public will. However, there comes a time when leaders need to know the will of the nation on a given subject."
Mr. Kay offered another argument. He said the public's belief that Congress was unresponsive led it to make all sorts of drastic demands. His polling had found huge majorities for such extreme measures as Congressional pay cuts or term limits or binding national referendums on major issues, he said, and a polling office that would frame issues to find consensus would be a much simpler change.
One alternative he did not pose was raised by the 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke in his Speech to the Electors of Bristol. Even though a vote he cast in Parliament cost him re-election, he told the electors in November 1774, "Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion."

HEADLINE: 30 New High Schools Report First-Year Success

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
It is a small triumph of the Coalition School for Social Change, one of 30 experimental high schools begun in New York City last fall, that Shenelle Nolan has been swinging her bookbag under her desk and sitting down for her first-period math class on time in recent weeks.
Last fall, Shenelle was perpetually tardy. But for months, her teachers have been pressing her to rise earlier and spend less time buying candy in a corner bodega on her 10-block walk to school through East Harlem. They got her family's cooperation as well. 
 The attention appears to be paying off. Shenelle, a 15-year-old freshman, is doing better academically than in her eight previous years of school, though sometimes she still stays up so late playing Nintendo at home that she dozes off in class. That draws a quick response.
"Shenelle, are you with us?" said Charlene Jordan, her principal, during a recent social studies class she helps teach. "Pick your head up off your desk. I want you to concentrate."
 
Attendance and Grades Rise
 Shenelle is one of 2,800 students enrolled in the 30 small New York City high schools that opened last fall, aimed at giving teen-agers close personal attention. It was one of the largest school reorganizations anywhere, and as the 1993-94 school year nears an end, parents and educators are evaluating the early results.
Attendance in the small schools is higher than in other city high schools, and students are passing more courses, according to Board of Education statistics.
"The early reports indicate that these schools are doing well," said John Ferrandino, the board's chief executive for high schools. "We don't want to say that smallness is some miracle panacea, but they're showing some nice success."
The small schools' achievements have come despite adversities. They were a project of Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, and after his ouster last year, planning was often chaotic, officials said.
The board has still not found permanent homes for some; they are squatting in borrowed space in elementary schools and on college campuses. The Coalition School shares a dismal, windowless junior high school building at 127th Street and Madison Avenue in Harlem with three other small new schools.
 
21 More to Open
 Another, the Legacy School for Integrated Studies, has occupied four Manhattan sites since September. Middle College High School at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn is housed in portable classrooms.
Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines has embraced small schools and has approved plans to open an additional 21 in September. Mr. Cortines also announced last month that Deborah Meier, an award-winning principal whose nonprofit group founded 6 of the 30 schools, would join his staff next year, financed by a foundation, as an intermediary between the small schools and the bureaucracy.
In a recent interview Mr. Cortines criticized last year's rush. "We should not have opened many of these schools without more planning," he said. "I think we moved too fast."
Ms. Meier also expressed anguish over the schools' starting difficulties. "Most of our schools are doing well despite all the dislocation, but this has been my most frustrating year," Ms. Meier said. "Instead of spending our time on teaching, we're working on real estate. But if I sound discouraged, it's because of how much we want to get done and how fast we want to do it."
 
Community Groups Help
 Not everyone is enthusiastic. Some educators say small high schools limit the courses and equipment available for their students. Michael J. Petrides, a Board of Education member from Staten Island, voiced such criticisms last year when the board formally created the schools.
Some community groups have taken part in founding schools, as at El Puente Academy in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where students have helped to vaccinate residents and surveyed neighborhood trees.
But other collaborations have not fared as well. After a new president took over at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, that college's relations soured with the Benjamin Banneker Academy, the high school on Pratt's campus. Banneker students and staff said they had been made to feel unwelcome, and there was a dispute over renovation plans. School officials have been forced to seek new space for Banneker for fall.
Most new schools opened with ninth-grade classes and have about 100 students; they will grow to 500 or 600 students as they add new grades. Many of the city's 125 regular high schools have 4,000 or more students.
For most of this century, most high schools were like factories: schedules were regulated by clanging bells and economies of scale were attainable, school officials thought, by erecting larger buildings and expanding enrollments. But as dropout and violence rates have grown, some educational theorists have advocated a "small is beautiful" approach. The opening of the 30 schools last fall was the most extensive application of the new theory nationwide.
 
More Relevant Learning
 The schools are intended to be permanent and they share in the high school division's budget. They received extra start-up money under the last Fernandez budget, and some, but not all, received additional money from foundations and corporations.
The Fund for New York City Public Education, a private group, oversaw the development of 10, called the New Visions schools. Ms. Meier's organization, the Coalition for Essential Schools, founded six schools, drawing students from what would have been this year's ninth-grade class at Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. Several community school districts founded more than a dozen others.
The new schools aim to make learning more relevant by focusing academic subjects on community projects or vocational specialties. Several schools are participating in efforts to feed the homeless and visit hospital patients. At the School for Social Change in the Bronx, pioneered by Hospital Workers Union Local 1199, students have begun an organizing campaign to relocate a bus stop closer to their school.
Naomi Barber, the fund's New Visions director, said at least 100 delegations visited the schools this year.
Despite the nationwide attention, any evaluation of the small schools' performance was guesswork until the board released figures in late April. The data showed that students in the new schools passed an average of 79 percent of their courses in the fall term, while students in the rest of the city's high schools passed 62 percent. The students in the new schools were not specially selected for their academic performance.
 
'Feeling Cared For'
 The report showed that on an average day, 89 percent of students attended classes at the six new schools that are replacing Julia Richman, which is being phased out, compared with 64 percent of students who attended class at Julia Richman during the last four years.
"These numbers tell us that kids are feeling cared for," said David W. Zuckerman, a doctoral candidate at Columbia Teachers College who is studying the new schools. "Extended personal relationships are developing between students, staff and parents, and that's helping to keep kids in class."
Dragana Stojsic, a freshman at the School District 25 Collaborative School in Whitestone, Queens, said she decided to attend a small school partly because her mother and father separated when she was 2, and since then, her mother has worked two jobs, scrubbing offices and homes.
 
Giving Up Free Periods
 "Teen-agers need to be able to talk with someone, and sometimes our parents aren't there for us," Dragana said during a break in a band practice at the school recently. "It's important to be able to talk to my teachers."
Teachers at several schools said that they felt more motivated to work diligently than they had at larger schools. The seven-teacher staff at the Landmark High School, at 127th Street and Madison Avenue in Harlem, voted unanimously in August to give up their free periods to teach more classes, shrinking class sizes.
Many students have brought poor study habits with them from their junior high schools, teachers said. The School for Public Service in East New York, founded by the East Brooklyn Congregations, an alliance of churches and synagogues, has recruited parents to offer after-school tutoring.
"Kids can't fall through the cracks here, because we won't let them," said Genevieve Richards-Wright, the school's project director.

HEADLINE: A Government-Industry Environmental Partnership

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Michael Silverstein simply is incorrect in his assertions that the Clinton Administration "does not see a vibrant environmental industry as crucial to cleaning up the world or revitalizing our economy" ("Why No Help for the Cleanup Industry," Viewpoints, April 24). Fostering technology businesses, creating high-quality jobs for Americans and protecting the environment all go hand in hand; in fact, sustained economic growth requires a healthy environment. Building this environment-economy link is central to the President's environmental agenda, and in particular is a core mission of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. 
 The commercial demand for solutions to environmental problems is large (some estimate a $200 billion to $300 billion worldwide market) and predicted to double by the end of the decade. Much of this growth will come from developing countries, where United States industry has the opportunity to capture most of the growth. This growth supports an industry that consists of close to 60,000 businesses, and exemplifies the sort of civilian technology-based industries that provide good jobs for Americans.
But market size is not the only reason environmental technologies are critical to the United States. While Mr. Silverstein bemoans the recent financial performance of a small number of environmental clean-up businesses, much of the real future promise for environmental technologies is in developing pollution prevention technologies -- processes and products that drastically reduce or eliminate pollution altogether.
Last year in his Earth Day speech, President Clinton directed the Commerce Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department to develop a national strategy to increase exports of environmental technologies. The strategy rests on three legs: supporting and encouraging continuous technology development to provide new solutions for environmental challenges; providing focused export support for United States companies, and forging a strong business-Government partnership to make it happen.

HEADLINE: Save the Watershed

 BODY:
One of New York City's most precious capital assets is the 2,000-square-mile watershed that stretches northwest of the city for 100 miles on both sides of the Hudson River. For 150 years, the watershed and its reservoir system have supplied New Yorkers with cheap, high-quality drinking water. But decades of careless development and shoddy regulation have put the watershed at risk. If the system is not cleaned up in three years, the Federal Government will require New Yorkers to pay as much as $8 billion to build a filtration plant and $300 million annually to operate it.
This would be a ridiculous price to pay for something that New Yorkers now get virtually free. It is also an avoidable price, but only if city and state politicians are prepared to summon the energy -- through personal visits, town meetings and the like -- to woo upstate residents whose cooperation is crucial to the watershed's salvation. 
 New York City has long had the power to regulate development in the watershed. In 1909, the State Legislature gave the city authority to acquire property around its reservoirs and to regulate economic activity on adjacent lands. Basically, that meant control over sewage -- everything from barnyard manure to the effluents flowing from housing developments and office buildings.
Trouble is, the regulations were rarely enforced. Local residents got the idea that they could do what they liked with their property and development proceeded rapidly, first in Westchester County, later in Putnam County and now in the Catskills -- the three main watershed areas. Faced with the massive costs of filtration, the city has decided to enforce its powers, and upstaters are aggrieved.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani thus finds himself in a classic environmental struggle, pitting private interests against a larger public good. Like David Dinkins before him, he would be asking upstaters, many of them poor, to accept restrictions on their assumed right to develop their property to help city dwellers many miles away. The numbers are on the Mayor's side. The watershed serves one-half of the state's population -- 8 million in the city and 1 million in the watershed itself. But the watershed issue turns as much on emotion as on logic and Mr. Giuliani will need all powers of cajolery to win it.
The warning flags have been up since 1989, when the Environmental Protection Agency found rising levels of contaminants in the city's water supply and gave the Dinkins administration what seemed a simple choice: develop by December 1993 a plausible plan to protect the watersheds or be prepared to filter. Mr. Dinkins was slow to confront the problem, but last year he and his Environmental Commissioner, Al Appleton, devised new regulations, hired new people to enforce them and committed $439 million to upgrade septic tanks and sewage treatment plants and to purchase 80,000 acres of buffer zones around the reservoirs and the streams that feed them.
The E.P.A. then gave the city a three-year extension to carry out the plan. That sounds like a lot of time, but nothing in New York comes quickly or easily. Upstate residents complain that the new regulations on septic tanks and sewage treatment will soon make it prohibitively expensive to build new businesses and homes. Last month, a group of 45 Putnam County developers filed a $9 billion suit against the city, charging that their property had been prospectively devalued without compensation. But the city's plan to save the watershed is not the bad deal that many watershed residents think it is. Despite complaints about a "land grab," for example, the city will buy land only from willing sellers and will pay taxes on what it does buy -- indeed, New York City is already the largest taxpayer in the Catskills. Moreover, even though new businesses will have to build septic tanks instead of discharging their waste directly into streams, the city plans to spend more than $200 million on municipal waste treatment -- a considerable subsidy to hard-pressed localities.
Questions of fairness aside, what is at stake here is a larger issue of environmental stewardship. To give in to filtration is to concede that New Yorkers cannot strike a sensible compromise between man and nature.

HEADLINE: Europe's Next Giant Step

 BODY:
In an important vote the other day, the European Parliament opened the way to admitting Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway to the European Union. Thus what began in 1957 as a six-member common market can by next year grow into a European Union with 16 members and 370 million inhabitants. That would open frontiers for free movement of people and goods from the Adriatic to the Arctic Circle, from the Hebrides to the gates of Russia. Americans are only beginning to catch up with what this epochal change may imply.
It was widely predicted that the vote in the 517-seat parliament in Strasbourg would be close. In fact, it was a blowout: in the first of four votes, Norway was approved with 374 in favor, only 24 against and 58 abstentions; the approval margins were about the same for the other applicants. This bodes well for the next hurdles, four national referendums, beginning in Austria on June 12 and concluding in Norway on Nov. 26. 
 Polls show strong support for Austrian approval, and Finland, worried about its unsteady Russian neighbor, is expected to follow suit. Swedes are undecided, and the prickly Norwegians, who have quarreled with Europe over fishing rights, may again vote down membership, as they did in 1972. But in light of the Strasbourg vote, it is also possible that momentum and enthuasiasm may build, carrying the day for a 16-state Europe.
This would be more than a common market. All citizens in the Union would elect representatives to a parliament with limited but real legislative powers. All would share benefits (and some of the constraints) of an interconnected monetary system. All member states have votes, proportionate to their size, in a Council of Ministers that has final authority on common legislation and that can speak for the Union on foreign policy.
But moves to greater integration, embodied in the 1991 Maastricht treaty, have collided with popular fears of ceding too much power to bureaucrats in Brussels. As important, the unification of Germany increased Germany's population by a third, upsetting the old equilibrium with France and Britain, stirring fears of too much German influence in a too-united Europe.
Notwithstanding these disputes, there are sound reasons why present members would like to broaden the union by admitting Austria and the Nordic trio. The average per capita income of the four countries is 40 percent higher than the European Union average, so the newcomers will be net contributors to compensatory funds for poorer regions and subsidized farmers. More important, enlargement can restore sorely missed vitality to the campaign for European unity and prepare the way for future membership of four new candidates, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
Europe's self-confidence has skidded as its unpopular governments contend with stagnant economies. And long-buried nightmares were revived by Europe's inability to stop the ethnic slaughter in former Yugoslavia. In this fallow season for Europe, suddenly there is something to cheer about. The overwhelming parliamentary vote is good news for those who believe in open frontiers, free markets and democratic institutions. If for the moment Europe's political union cannot deepen, at least it might continue to widen.

HEADLINE: South Africa Sanctions Didn't Undo Apartheid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis notes in "Help From Outside," his May 6 column celebrating the role of sanctions in the victory over apartheid, the important part Sir Robin Renwick, now British Ambassador in Washington, played in encouraging President F. W. de Klerk to release Nelson Mandela and facilitating negotiations. 
 But Mr. Lewis misses the salient point behind Sir Robin's extraordinary effectiveness. He would never have been able to play this role had he not represented a government that steadfastly resisted sanctions. This is what allowed the British to retain the access and influence in Pretoria that United States diplomacy effectively lost the moment Congress overrode Ronald Reagan's sanctions veto in October 1986.
Up to that point, our opposition to sanctions had given us the necessary cover and running room to engage not only the South African Government, but also the South African public on internal and regional issues, much to the annoyance of the truculent P. W. Botha. As he saw it, once Congress had shot its arrow, the American quiver was empty.
Fortunately, the much maligned policy of constructive engagement lived on in Whitehall. Judging by the many expressions of esteem by Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress leadership for the roles played by Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Sir Robin, they understood this diplomatic dynamic.
Symbolism and domestic politics aside, the declared purpose of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act was to use economic pressure to force the South Africa Government to negotiate. But by the time Congress acted, the markets had already concluded that South Africa under P. W. Botha was not the place to put -- or keep -- your money.
As we kept warning, these sanctions of the financial market were the ones the South Africa Government had to fear most. It is now generally acknowledged that the 1985 decision of United States and other leading banks not to roll over short-term loans was far more consequential than any of the later legislated sanctions. (South Africa developed alternative markets and continued to run sizable trade surpluses.)
That year also marked the beginning of secret negotiations. With United States encouragement, Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee sought permission from P. W. Botha in 1985 to accept Nelson Mandela's offer to start talking. If anything, these talks were dealt a setback by the 1986 sanctions vote, since P. W. Botha never wanted to be seen to act from weakness and reverted to his repressive, counterrevolutionary mode.
In the end, two unpredictable events dramatically accelerated the timetable for South Africa's negotiated revolution. The first was that in 1989 P. W. Botha suffered a stroke, giving an increasingly restive National Party the chance to rid itself of his oppressive yoke, and to install F. W. de Klerk in his place.
The second was the Soviet empire's sudden implosion. This allowed Mr. de Klerk to remove the National Party's bogyman of the "total onslaught" as an obstacle to legalizing and negotiating with the A.N.C. and its formal ally, the South African Communist Party. Mercifully, it discredited the A.N.C.'s socialist role model.
Understandable as it is for sanctions supporters now to pat themselves on the back, the real credit belongs overwhelmingly to two remarkable leaders, Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk, and to the millions of South Africans of all races who supported their statesmanlike course.

HEADLINE: Administrative Costs Make Tuition Soar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Cost of 4-Year Degree Passes $100,000 Mark" (Education page, May 4) quotes Charles H. Long, Yale deputy provost, complaining of the costs of "scholarly periodicals, library books and scientific equipment, which rise in cost at a rate higher than inflation." 
 Figures from the Association of Research Libraries show that Yale cut its library expenditures 14 percent, from 5.42 percent to 4.65 percent of total educational and general expenditures, in the 1980's.
The growth of bureaucracy that Daniel S. Hamermesh notes in your article is more responsible for increased costs that affect tuition. The Digest of Educational Statistics 1993 states (page 167), "Administrative expenditures (institutional support and academic support, less libraries) have been rising more rapidly than most other types of college expenditures." Table 329 and its predecessors show higher education library funds dropping nearly a percentage point from the 1970's to 2.2 percent in 1992, the lowest since the Depression, a difference of $478 million.
Max Weber observed the nature of "the bureaucracy" to perpetuate itself, using its considerable power to do so. This includes a certain amount of secrecy and doubletalk to protect the bureaucracy from public criticism and control while it devises schemes that result in hiring more deputy provosts. Consider the cost of the busywork involved in the Ivy Overlap Group's annual retreat to standardize scholarship offers to multiple applicants (called "price fixing" by the Justice Department); in sharply rising cost of "compliance" with Government research grant administration; in marketing and orientation parties that didn't exist 30 years ago.
Meanwhile, the library collections essential to the research, education and public service missions of the university have been unfairly downgraded. It's time universities thought, like I.B.M., United Technologies and other large organizations, about downsizing. Cut the fat; build the bone.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE;
Broadway Business Blues? Well, Cross the Street.

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
For commercial real-estate brokers on the Upper West Side, it is an age-old debate: Is the west side of Broadway north of 72d Street really financially superior to the east side, a mere 80-foot stroll away?
Many say it was ever thus, calling the east side of the street a lonely "frontier" that has yet to be successfully settled, and citing west side commercial rents that are often 30 to 40 percent higher than equivalent space just across the pavement. 
 Others call it a myth. "If a merchant is a good one, he's going to do well no matter what side of the street he's on," said Benjamin Fox, executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services.
But for many merchants who have chosen to try the east side, the difference is real indeed and serves as an apt illustration of the often Byzantine difficulties of doing business in the heart of the Upper West Side. It is a neighborhood known for having the savviest of New York's savvy customers, a clientele that, despite its wide diversity, seems to operate as a solid buying bloc. They can be fiercely loyal to certain businesses while closing down others in months.
"I honestly believe that Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest is more actively at work there than any other place in the city," Mr. Fox said.
In the last year, Broadway has entered a renaissance, with the opening of the Barnes & Noble superstore at 83d Street and a Filene's Basement at 79th Street. Several chains, such as Banana Republic, Cosmetics Plus and Lechter's housewares, have also discovered the street in the last decade.
But while many retailers have poured considerable effort into trying to join the street's west-side success stories -- Zabar's, Fairway Fruits and Vegetables, Citarella fish and meats, H & H Bagels and Harry's Shoes -- few have held on for long, especially those who believed that customers drawn to these anchors would bother to cross the street.
The most publicized example was J. Bildner & Sons, an upscale food store, which opened in 1987 on the northeast corner of 74th Street across from Fairway. Although it tried to woo customers with mahogany counters and crisply uniformed attendants, it closed after about nine months.
And just last month, another east-side food store, Adriana's Bazaar, closed after less than three years in business. While its products, exotic spices and herbs and Moroccan pottery, seemed to fit the neighborhood, its owner, Rochelle Zabarkes, said it was simply too difficult to draw enough customers into her store. "I think it's just that people are creatures of habit, and here more so than anywhere else," Ms. Zabarkes said.
Theories abound about why the difference between the two sides exists. One is historical, attributing the west side's dominance to the fact that the neighborhood's more affluent residents have traditionally lived between Riverside Drive and Broadway. However, with the rejuvenation of commerce and housing on Columbus Avenue and, more recently, Amsterdam, that is changing, real estate experts say.
Another theory is that Broadway is simply too broad in the 70's and 80's, with four lanes of traffic and a grass divider with benches in the center, and customers drawn to the anchor stores tend not to cross the street.
Despite the disparity, real-estate brokers and store owners alike are quick to point out that no matter which side a store is on, it must survive the neighborhood's strict scrutiny and win its trust quickly to survive.
Even the best location and name do not guarantee success. For example, a diet food chain, the Muffin Lady, opened next to Zabar's, in what Mr. Fox calls "probably the best retail space in the country" in 1991. It lasted little more than a year. A Kiddie City at 79th Street was also short-lived.
"It might sound like a cliche, but Upper West Siders really try to get good quality for their money," said Bruce A. Rosen, a neighborhood resident and an associate planner with the City Planning Commission. "We are successful, but we are not as rich as the East Side, and so we're careful. If you don't give us something to cross the street for, we're probably not going to cross the street."<? RANDY KENNEDY

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
The Soul-Searching Downtown

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
DOWNTOWN Manhattan just cannot shake that empty feeling. Prozac won't help.
For all the money being made on Wall Street these days, the heart of New York's financial district is remarkably quiescent. Since the peak in 1987, lower Manhattan has lost 100,000 workers in a wave of corporate cutbacks and an exodus to newer and better-equipped offices in midtown, Jersey City and elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Coupled with the overbuilding of the 1980's, that has left a lot of the owners of downtown's office buildings crying the blues. 
 Many of downtown's pre-World War II buildings, proud stone monuments to a bygone era, are more than half vacant. Over all, almost a quarter of the space in older, unrenovated buildings is unoccupied. Lacking the extra height per floor needed for today's high-tech offices, and beset by woes like asbestos contamination that make renovation particularly expensive, perhaps dozens of buildings cannot generate enough rent even to cover their operating costs, let alone generate a profit on investment.
For the owners, as well as city officials, that vast empty space poses a stark quandary: Can those buildings be salvaged, or is their economic future so hopeless that they should be demolished?
Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, sees the future of downtown Manhattan as perhaps the greatest development question facing New York City. "We're committed to the revitalization of lower Manhattan, no question," he says. "The issues require immediate attention. Downtown has to adapt to a changing economy and a changing market."
But how?
Some real estate owners would love to see a number of older buildings torn down, helping to push up rents on those remaining by reducing the vast overhang of empty space downtown. They say the land can be converted into small parks, to be banked for years, even decades, until demand for new downtown office buildings returns. Many city, state and regional officials appear to be sympathetic to those concerns.
On the other side, preservationists believe that most of the buildings, particularly those with historic significance, are worth saving. They argue that as the recovery catches on, newer, smaller companies will look downtown if affordable space is available.
"Some ways of trying to revive downtown could end up destroying it," said Peg Breen, president of the Landmarks Conservancy. "In the longer run, we'll be better off if we re-use as much as we can."
Meanwhile, foreign investors -- particularly from China, India and elsewhere in Asia -- are seen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a dynamic market to be lured downtown as the city expands its role in the global economy.
Last fall, the City Planning Department proposed bolstering the downtown business community and tourist industry through tax breaks, city financing and zoning changes.
It also recommended a Business Improvement District, similar to those operating in midtown Manhattan. That is now moving much closer to reality. So is a renovation of the plaza in front of the World Trade Center and its underground shopping concourse.
But many of the other plans remain just that. Improvements in mass transit, including the long-discussed Second Avenue subway, are little more than dreams. Talk of luring more people to join the 7,000 people living in Battery Park City and the 7,000 others scattered throuhout the area has not translated into anything concrete.
"I wish I could give you the trigger event that will begin the turnaround downtown," said Barry F. Sullivan, chairman of the New York City Partnership, a business group. "But I can't do that."
 
STEVEN SPINOLA
President of the Real Estate Board of New York
 We're seeing a change in philosophy in City Hall. For years, we've been calling for programs to convert some of the obsolete buildings from office to residential space. We're clearly getting better feedback from the Giuliani administration.
As for demolition, it would be nice to get 3, 4, or 5 million square feet of office space off the market. Beyond that, demolition doesn't make sense. Still, many of the older buildings don't have the floor size or high enough ceilings or the ability to bring up the right amount of electricity for higher-tech tenants. They can't compete anymore.
One of the reasons they are not being torn down is because they have more square footage than the current zoning permits. Under the old zoning, the limit was a million square feet; if a landlord tore down a building and built a new one now, it would be half that. Owners are better off keeping the old buildings up. We should grandfather in old zoning requirements. It is a way to get some space off the market and open up some sites for public space for a number of years and still permit construction of buildings when the market rebounds.
 
ROBERT FITCH
Author of "The Assassination of New York"
 They've been trying to fix up downtown for the last 60 or 70 years. It's a continuing crisis. What's happened is that New York City got the notion that it needed two downtowns, or one comprehensive downtown from 59th to Battery Park. It was an exaggeration of how much downtown can maintain. It's not needed anymore. It can't compete. Transportation is too much of a problem. No one wants to get out at Penn Station and Grand Central and get on the subway and go downtown.
Downtown is the one place no one ever talks about the free market. The only way it has been made viable is through immense subsidy -- the World Trade Center and all its progeny. We should adopt the physician's motto, "do no harm." Fold your cards. Stop throwing more money in the pot. We should envision downtown as part of a comprehensive strategy to achieve economic diversity in New York City. Otherwise, we'll go in the same direction -- giving more subsidies to elite office people and driving out industry.
As for Giuliani, downtown represents his base. I don't see him kicking his base below the waist.
 
 
STANLEY BREZENOFF
Executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
 Lower Manhattan should be the gateway for New York to reach out to the rest of the world. Our goal is to make the World Trade Center the anchor for an reinvigorated downtown. With more restaurants and shops, if not a 24-hour community, at least we can have more than a 10-hour-a-day community. We're looking to foreign investment. We want to improve transportation, particularly with the greater use of ferries and express buses. Downtown should also be a tremendous tourist mecca, what with the Statue of Liberty, South Street Seaport, the observation deck of the Trade Center already here. But it's underutilized. It's time to get the word out.
Still, you have to be realistic. Some of the older office buildings are not easily adaptable, either to residential use or to current commercial demands. They have very limited futures. You may have to think about razing them and replacing them with mini-parks until it is time to rebuild.
In a pure economic sense, downtown is in a position to rebound. Rents are now competitive with those around the region and with those of most other cities in the country.

HEADLINE: HOME ENTERTAINMENT;
New Off-Ramps On Info Highway For Couch Potatoes

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL

 BODY:
THE INFORMATION superhighway, charted by the Clinton Administration as a main road to the American future, is likely to cut right through some familiar areas of home entertainment. At present, two different kinds of enterprises collaborate in the field: Content companies, like film studios and other production companies, provide the entertainment. And conduit companies, like television networks and cable broadcasters, distribute the goods.
Relations between the two have been quite cozy in the past. As long as relatively few channels were available, the studios could ration out their product to broadcasters under mutually protective agreements. 
 But with the coming of the communications superhighway, these distribution patterns will be radically undermined. With hundreds of channels available through fiber-optic telephone lines, direct broadcasting satellites and other alternative delivery systems, traditional broadcasting may be replaced by networks of quite a different sort.
Future entertainment networks are likely to resemble the world-spanning links that now connect computers. Moreover, the conventional television set is likely to give way to home computers linked to large screens. This will enable the home screen to serve both as an entertainment center and a display for interactive information services.
These prospects are widely discussed these days among long-range planners in the electronics trade. Some believe that what they call the telefuture will not be shaped by the widely publicized mergers of the electronics industry with film studios -- such as the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Sony and of Universal Studios by Matsushita, the parent company of Panasonic. Rather, they feel that an onrush of computer technology will alter the face of home entertainment.
The leading exponent of such iconoclastic ideas is George Gilder, who has been called a techno-visionary. This label doesn't quite fit, for Mr. Gilder is firmly enough rooted in the realities of the market to function as a management consultant in the communications industry, and parts of his new book, "Life After Television" -- to be published this month by Norton -- have been serialized in Forbes, a magazine for hard-nosed investors.
"The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse," declares Mr. Gilder.
But for all the apparent hyperbole, he musters impressive arguments. He points out that the 33 million personal computers already in place in American homes form a far better and more versatile base for distributing entertainment and information services than existing broadcast channels and conventional TV sets.
Interactivity is the key to the latest forms of entertainment and information services, allowing the viewer to respond to and influence the presentation on the screen. But "interactivity, almost by definition, is a computer function, not a television function," Mr. Gilder claims. "Making the boob tube into an interactive hive of theater, museum, classroom, banking system, shopping center, post office and communicator is contrary to the nature of the box."
Only the personal computer, says Mr. Gilder, holds out hope for realizing these multiple services that have been dangled before the public. And while present technology cannot yet fully answer these needs, chances are that the computer industry -- rather than the television industry -- can rise to the challenge.
In a recent interview at his octagonal home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, Mr. Gilder expanded on these ideas. His predictions are based on the computer industry's spectacular capabilities. According to Gordon Moore, chairman of the Intel Corporation, the number of transistors that can be placed on a single chip doubles every 18 months. Moreover, cost-effectiveness rises by the square of the number of transistors crammed onto the chip. Cost-effectiveness also rises sharply with the number of computers linked to communications networks. These combined economies point to a future in which computer networks will form the main distribution method for interactive services.
If telephone companies eventually make good their promise to bring fiber-optic lines to everyone's doorstep, they will create nearly unlimited access to entertainment programming and alphabetic and pictorial data bases. And since these new pathways can carry high-quality signals to be displayed on already extant high-resolution screens, high-definition television -- too long waiting in the wings -- will be a moot issue.
One reason Apple and Microsoft are not chasing the studios or networks with merger bids, Mr. Gilder believes, is that the computer companies know they already hold a winning hand.
"It doesn't matter that the studios own the movies," says Mr. Gilder. "With so many channels available on the information highway, the producing companies will not be able to maintain any form of monopolistic control. When the pipe is wide enough to carry everything, they won't be able to restrict their product to a few preferred outlets. The technology will force the market open."
LEGALLY THIS ARGUMENT leaks. After all, copyright remains in force no matter what the technology. But Mr. Gilder emphasizes that throughout economic history, monopolies have yielded to the pressure of broadening demand. This has been true from the royal monopolies on tobacco, sugar and spices in the 17th century to the more recent attempts to control the distribution of oil. Moreover, it often proved more profitable to serve a large open market than a narrowly controlled one. Mr. Gilder believes that in our time, under the prod of the new technology, entertainment and information services will ultimately follow the same historic pattern.
Profound changes are seldom abrupt, and the broadcasting industry will probably do everything in its considerable power to delay or derail any shift to other delivery methods.
The prevailing view at a recent New York conference under the aegis of the Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association was that traditional television will continue to serve the mass market while the new alternative methods will cultivate niche audiences.
As one participant put it: "We already have a fully operational, fully satisfactory and fully interactive communications medium. The telephone."

 BODY:
THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
By T. Coraghessan Boyle. Penguin, $10.95.
For the characters in this novel, the road begins in 1907 in Battle Creek, Mich., where they are guests at the sanitarium of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, the inventor of cornflakes and exponent of rigorous and purgative cures. The author's "prose is a marvel, enjoyable from beginning to end," Jane Smiley said here last year.
LENIN'S TOMB: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire
By David Remnick. Vintage, $14.
Winner of the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and named one of the best books of 1993 by the editors of The Times Book Review, this account captures the period from 1988 to 1991, when the Soviet Union -- and Communism itself -- was collapsing. Mr. Remnick gives detailed portraits of the people involved, from Soviet leaders and party functionaries to ordinary workers. Last year our reviewer, John Lloyd, said, " 'Lenin's Tomb' is an extraordinary confluence of observation, hard work, knowledge and reflection; a better book by a journalist on the withdrawing roar of the Soviet Union is hard to imagine." 

SO FAR FROM GOD
By Ana Castillo. Plume, $9.95.
In a small town in New Mexico, a Chicana woman and her four daughters undergo a series of trials including, but also transcending, death. In this novel of magic realism the mother, Sofi, "loves, she accepts; in the face of loss, she creates," Lisa Sandlin said here last year. "Not much in life is more miraculous." Ms. Castillo's earlier novel SAPOGONIA: An Anti-Romance in 3/8 Meter (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95) has been reissued as well. Revised since its original publication in 1990, the book concerns a pair of lovers who hail from the mythical country of the title: a place that is the homeland of all mestizos. One reviewer called it "both beautiful and lyrical." There is more of the Latin American experience in TO BURY OUR FATHERS: A Novel of Nicaragua, by Sergio Ramirez, translated by Nick Caistor (Readers International, $11.95). The author, a Sandinista leader and the country's former vice president, frames his nation's political struggles in terms of a friendship between two soldiers that ends in betrayal. Their story "continues today . . . fact and fiction virtually indistinguishable," Shirley Christian said here in 1985. Earlier history is the focus of MEXICAN VILLAGE, by Josephina Niggli (University of New Mexico, $16.95). First published in 1945, this collection of interrelated stories depicts life in postrevolutionary northern Mexico. The author is "a storyteller in the fine tradition," Mildred Adams said in The New York Times.
UNFRAMED ORIGINALS: Recollections
By W. S. Merwin. Owl/Holt, $12.95.
A poet celebrated for his use of words recalls a childhood in which there were few words at all. His father, a Presbyterian minister, presided over a household essentially devoid of books or meaningful conversation. In 1982 our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, said Mr. Merwin creates "a haunting and frequently disturbing portrait." The same publisher has also reissued Mr. Merwin's two books of prose poems, HOUSES AND TRAVELLERS and THE MINER'S PALE CHILDREN ($12.95 each). "I like the air of intelligence in the pieces, always ready to meet the unexpected," Robert Bly said of "Houses and Travellers," published in 1978. In 1970 our reviewer of "The Miner's Pale Children," Helen Vendler, said of these works, "Desolation and abandonment shading into terror are more common than any other feeling."
MAKING THE MUMMIES DANCE: Inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art
By Thomas Hoving. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.
Before the author became director of the Met in 1967, the museum's reputation was snobbish and staid. Through Mr. Hoving, the institution gained a gift shop, a glitzy temple, more contemporary art and, as he proudly notes, many more visitors. "His peppery, outspoken, at times gloating narrative . . . is astonishingly candid and unreserved," Arthur C. Danto said here last year.
PAST IMPERFECT: French Intellectuals, 1944-1956
By Tony Judt. University of California, $14.
Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and other left-wing philosophers are taken to task for being apologists for Stalinism and for failing to criticize the concrete forms their ideology was taking in postwar Eastern Europe. Last year our reviewer, John Sturrock, said Mr. Judt makes his case "with an admirable clarity, an economy of words and a command of his sources."
RIGHTEOUS DISCONTENT: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920
By Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham. Harvard University, $14.95.
At the turn of the century the Baptist Church was both the foundation of black American community life and an agent of social change. The author shows how a growing feminist thought helped not only the church's female members fight discrimination, but the entire black population as well. "The result is an important, sophisticated and richly instructive book," Suzanne Lebsock said here last year.
LISTENING TO PROZAC
By Peter D. Kramer. Penguin, $12.95.
The popular antidepressant mentioned in the title is the springboard for a meditation on nature versus nurture and the cultural implications of the use of drugs that may be able to alter personality as well as cure ills. Last year our reviewer, Daniel X. Freedman, said that the author, a psychiatrist, has written a book that is "entertaining, provocative, irritating and often originally insightful." Penguin has also reissued Dr. Kramer's MOMENTS OF ENGAGEMENT: Intimate Psychotherapy in a Technological Age ($10.95), an exploration of the relationship between the therapist and the patient. In 1989 one critic said, "His is a voice of earnest, unashamed speculation and reflection." LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: Broader Backing for the Buick Classic

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

DATELINE: HARRISON

 BODY:
IT is 8:30 on a bright May morning and several corporate outings are already in full swing at the venerable Westchester Country Club here. The club holds scores of similar golfing events a year, but none as prestigious as the Buick Classic, a premier event on the P.G.A. tour. Taking place at the peak of the golf season, June 6 to 12, it serves as a warmup for the United States Open a week later. The tournament, which has been a fixture at the Westchester Country Club for 27 years, has been sponsored for the last four years by the General Motors Buick Motor Division.
The Classic is also a strong fund-raiser for hospitals. Contributions are raised through the sale of various business-entertainment sponsorship packages like the Pro-Am tournament or corporate hospitality tents. For years, large corporations had an opportunity to dispense corporate hospitality by becoming a sponsor. 
 "That was the pattern," said Lawrence Dwyer, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group. "The Classic, which itself is a showcase for Westchester County, was always identified in people's minds with large corporations. Corporations recognized that there was nothing like the Classic for entertainment, corporate recognition and networking opportunities and for exposure. The event is always telecast and, for example, 50,000 people attend the Classic in one day alone." But society is changing.
Mr. Dwyer said that with the advent of the electronic age smaller businesses are being established and are able to do business with fewer employees. "Currently in Westchester 90 percent of the businesses have fewer than 20 employees and 80 percent have less than 10," Mr. Dwyer said. "They also would like a piece of the action of the Classic, and we felt it was time to find a way they could also participate at a price they could afford."
Now, he continued, for the first time, for the relatively modest sum of $1,500 any company can be associated with the county's No. 1 sporting event by buying a new product: a Classic 5000 corporate package, he said. The package is aimed at the 27,000 businesses in Westchester County that have never been able to afford to participate in the event before.
Frank Boccanfuso, head of F.M.B. Real Estate Services in Purchase and one of the founders of the Classic 5000 and a sponsor, said, "The concept behind the Classic 5000 package is to give smaller companies like mine the same advantages large corporations enjoy from being part of such a prestigious event."
 
The Effort to Broaden the Base
 The effort to broaden the base of participation of small and mid-size businesses -- defined as those generating sales of $2 million to $100 million yearly and employing 20 to 250 workers -- began with a meeting last fall with Mr. Dwyer and Thomas A. Williams, general chairman of the Buick Classic and chairman of United Hospital.
"Larry Dwyer wears two hats," Mr. Boccanfuso said. "In addition to heading the Westchester County Association, he is also an avid golfer, and he has a special interest in the Classic since he has been in charge of the marshals for four years. He and and Tom Williams realize that a new marketing strategy was needed to broaden the base of participation in the event. After Joe Armentano, who owns a mid-size business, Paraco Gas, and I talked to them, we contacted other businessmen and formed a committee to find ways to increase the opportunities for a company like ours to participate.
"We went out, and we literally sold them on the idea of the Classic, and the response was very good. We expect in future years it will even get better."
 
Similar Features
 To date 70 companies have bought the new Classic 5000 packages. Mr. Armentano, said: "These are companies that have never been able to participate in the Classic before. They bought packages that range from $1,500 for the bronze up to $10,000 for the gold.
"Basically, all the packages have the same features. They are just expanded at the higher end. The $1,500 package, for example, includes 10 hospitality tickets to the large air-conditioned Classic 5000 tent that will be especially erected and all food, which is lunch, snacks and an open bar, cocktails, plus 15 grounds admission tickets and two preferred parking passes, an invitation to a cocktail-orientation party, a business profile on a sponsor board listing and a listing in the spectator guide and pairing sheets. It's really a terrific deal."
Bennett Kielson Storch & Company, an accounting firm in White Plains, is one of the new participants. Nicholas DeSantis, a partner in the firm, said: "With the exception of the 'big six' accounting firms, we are the largest accounting firm in the Hudson Valley region. Yet although I personally love golf and we always bought spectator tickets to the Classic, we always felt it was too expensive for our firm to participate as a corporate sponsor, even though we knew how much we would gain by doing it: entertainments and exposure and networking opportunities. The Classic 5000 is a terrific concept. It makes it possible for us to have a piece of the action and make a contribution to the hospitals at the same time. We are really very excited about it."
Another new company is an architectural firm, A. R. Bacon of Purchase. Alex Bacon, head of the firm, said: "We have 12 employees. We do a lot of work, and we have some very prestigious clients, and it's very nice for a company like ours to be able to participate in this major golf event. I have been to the tournament as a guest of the large corporations in the past, and I certainly enjoyed myself and remembered it and the corporation that invited me fondly. Now I'm looking forward to inviting my clients and some of my employees. I think it's a great way to build good will at a price a firm like ours can afford."
 
One of the Top 3 Money Raisers
 Mr. Boccanfuso reported: "We still have space available for about 24 more companies. May 25 is the deadline for participating."
Annabelle Marvin, the Classic tournament director, said: "It is great to see the business community get behind this event. The net proceeds of the money raised through the Classic 5000 packages are an additional source of money for area hospitals."
Raising money for hospitals is more important this year than ever -- to allow hospitals to keep providing quality service, said United Hospital's Mr. Williams, who observed that the Westchester Classic perennially ranks among the top three of the 42 P.G.A. tour events in charitable dollars raised. Since 1967 more than $22 million has been raised by the Classic for United Hospital, 12 other hospitals in Westchester and the American Diabetes Association.
Mr. Armentano added: "In these hard economic times, we are really pleased that we have found a new marketable product in the Classic 5000. We have already raised more than $150,000 in new money and, within the next few years, we expect the Classic 5000 committee to be raising $1 million a year for community hospitals."
Those wishing information about Classic packages or other tournament opportunities should get in touch with Ms. Marvin at 967-5356.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Stamford and Norwalk Join to Revive Manufacturing

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IN a joint project, Stamford and Norwalk will try to revitalize manufacturing in southwestern Connecticut by renovating 240,000 square feet of industrial space.
Backers say the project, which involves one industrial building in each of the two cities, will be undertaken in cooperation with private businesses. And they say it could bring private investors back into the industrial real estate market. 
 The project will be financed by a combination of the state's Economic Diversification Fund, private investment and $200,000 in cash and/or services from each city. The state's $60 million fund was enacted last year as a onetime effort to address problems created by Federal defense cutbacks.
"There is no speculative cycle right now," said James E. Banks, director of marketing and business development for the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency. "The banks got burned and the developers got burned, so unless there's a tenant willing to sign a long-term lease and wait for construction, a project is not going to happen."
Joseph M. Ercolano, vice president of Sacia, The Business Council, said a recent survey by the organization had found 54 percent of the manufacturing companies contacted interested in expanding in the next few years. Sacia stands for the group's former name, Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association.
"When they talked about what was preventing them from staying in southwestern Connecticut, the lack of available space was a major consideration," Mr. Ercolano said.
Christopher L. Bergstrom, the Economic Development Director for Stamford, estimated that there was a demand for 200,000 to 300,000 square feet of industrial space among young companies that had outgrown their first buildings.
"The traditional sources of financing for developers have dried up," Mr. Bergstrom said. "There are niches like this one where there is clear evidence of demand. But the space isn't going to get built, because no one wants to finance these buildings without a firm commitment, and the companies that need the space aren't big enough or patient enough to wait for a speculative building."
The project is even more feasible because both buildings are in Federal Enterprise Zones, making manufacturers eligible for a variety of tax breaks and job-training grants.
"This capital-development project involves only the sites in Stamford and Norwalk, but it has the support of the entire region because of the impact it could have," said Richard C. Carpenter, executive director of the South Western Regional Planning Agency.
Jim Roberts, a spokesman for the state's Department of Economic Development, which will distribute the new state funds, said that while a final decision on the project would not be made until later this month, "I can say this is the kind of project we really want to see happen."
One advantage in the project, he said, is that it involves more than one city. When the Economic Diversification Fund was created last year, the legislature said that the money should be used for regional projects.
Janine Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Business Council, said that the South Western Regional Planning Agency had submitted a grant application to the state for the Stamford-Norwalk project.
"THERE are a lot of people who have become real believers in the regional approach to economic development," Ms. Johnson said.
She said the eight-town group was already looking into other regional projects, such as telecommunications links between the cities.
Stamford is proposing to use $2 million in its state allotment for renovating a 160,000-square-foot industrial building at 17 Amelia Place owned by General Electric Investment Corporation. The corporation will add $2 million for the task.
Mr. Bergstrom said there was a strong market in Stamford for "flex" space -- part office, part research and development laboratory, part manufacturing and part warehouse, usually renting for about $8 a square foot.
"The space we have of that type is virtually 100 percent occupied," he said.
Mr. Bergstrom said that 17 Amelia Place, formerly occupied by an engineering company, could be easily converted for four or five small users, companies that could generate a total of 300 to 350 jobs.
Once that project is rented the owner would get bank financing and the grant funds would be available again. Stamford has identified a 22-acre tract owned by Heyman Properties as a possible second project.
"We envision cycling these funds every one to two years," Mr. Bergstrom said.
Norwalk has proposed renovating an 80,000-square-foot building in the 500,000-square-foot Nash Engineering industrial complex on the waterfront.
Mr. Banks said that Nash, which makes industrial water pumps, had already moved its manufacturing operations to other states and announced recently it would move its corporate offices to Trumbull by the end of the summer. Two decades ago Nash employed about 750 people in the complex.
That will leave 500,000 square feet of vacant industrial space on Norwalk Harbor, which should be viewed as an opportunity, Mr. Banks said.
"I don't imagine we'll be able to create more than 1,000 jobs, but that's a lot better than the 75 there now or the zero we'll have there in August," Mr. Banks said.
Trafalgar Inc., which makes leather goods such as high-fashion Ghurka handbags, will put up $4 million to buy a third of the 21-acre property. A state grant of $2 million would go toward renovating the 80,000-square-foot building. Trafalgar has 250 employees and hopes to grow to 450 by the end of the decade "and we want them to grow here in Norwalk," Mr. Banks said.
DR. EDWARD J. DEAK, a professor at Fairfield University and an economist for the New England Economic Project, said opinion was divided on offering incentives to manufacturers.
"This kind of assistance is going to be available to companies if they move to the Southern states, and if Connecticut is not prepared to offer the same kind of inducement it can't compete," Dr. Deak said. "But it's not without its problems."
For instance, he said, when assistance is given to one manufacturer, other companies will want the same help. Also, with many states wooing manufacturing plants, the cost of the incentives package goes up.
"The bidding war for manufacturing jobs has escalated substantially over the last five years," Dr. Deak said. "But giving up on manufacturing jobs entirely doesn't make sense, either."
Still, despite a perception that manufacturers are abandoning Connecticut -- Dr. Deak said that since 1988 Connecticut's manufacturing jobs had dropped from 417,000 to 300,000 -- southwestern Connecticut continues to have many manufacturers.
Mr. Ercolano of the Business Council said that the Federal Commerce Department estimated that there were 1,700 manufacturers in Fairfield County, with some 100,000 employees.
"Manufacturing is still a pretty good proportion of our economy, about 25 percent of our employment base," Mr. Ercolano said. "And manufacturing means high-skilled, high-paying jobs."

HEADLINE: Island School Districts Bracing to Meet Increases in Expenses

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
SCHOOL districts planning for next year are facing rising expenses over which they have no control. Those costs are mainly a result of increasing enrollments, expired union contracts, necessary building repairs and state mandates that districts have to pay for.
For most districts, shrinking revenues from declining property values and lost state aid in recent years have led to rising budgets, translating into tax increases next year of 4 to 7 per cent across much of the Island. 
 Districts are continuing to wait to find out the state-aid package for next year. The aid is part of the budgets, which are now more than a month past their deadline of April 1.
In voting this month voters resisted school budget proposals. In the first week 15 of 41 were rejected, the highest rejection rate recorded since 1989 for the first week of balloting.
The president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association, Dr. Bruce Brodsky, said although school boards had been sensitive in trying to keep tax increases minimal, they had been burdened by the cost of state mandates without the financing for them.
Districts face, for example, mandates for handicapped students that may be quite costly. Last month the state revised its Least Restrictive Environment policy. According to a spokeswoman for the Education Department, Jennifer Sneed, the "least restrictive environment" means putting handicapped students in special classes or special schools only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that even with supplementary aids and services education cannot be satisfactorily achieved.
Placing a disabled student in such a situation provides that the special education that the student needs, preferably with students who do not have disabilities, is in a location as close as possible to the student's home.
For districts that formerly placed the handicapped in outside programs or schools, Ms. Sneed said, integration into regular classrooms may add significant expenses in personnel, equipment and services.
"The 'least restrictive environment' mandate," Dr. Brodsky said, "goes hand in hand with the philosophy of inclusion, which has become the new word in the education of the handicapped, to include these students in the regular classroom whenever possible. Aside from concerns that inclusion might cause a great deal of disruption to education and that special-education students might not have their needs best served by being in the regular classroom, a stricter enforcement of least-restrictive environment has the potential for tremendous costs to local districts.
"If special equipment is required for students with communication difficulties or additional personnel is needed to assist the students the burden of the expenses falls on the school district. Although New York State has not yet mandated full inclusion we're moving in that direction."
All districts have special-education committees to place disabled students.
The Federal American With Disabilities Act of 1992 adds to the burdens. That law requires all public buildings to be accessible to handicapped people, with wider doorways, restrooms, telephones, drinking fountains, elevators and full access for wheelchairs.
The Superintendent of Suffolk Boces 3, Dr. Daniel Domenech, said districts had been planning for two years to make the modifications and had acted to comply with the law. Most districts have made the required renovations or have plans for them this summer, he said, adding:
"But money has been a big problem for many districts on the Island. It's difficult to do major capital improvements when voters defeat the school budget. In this situation school districts are caught between a rock and a hard place, between complying with a Federal law and their inability to do it, because they don't have the money."
Many districts have included money in their budgets to comply with the Federal disabilities law. Long Beach allocated $50,000 to renovate the high school auditorium to make it accessible for the handicapped.
One of the biggest expenses can be elevators. South Huntington will install an elevator in one building at a cost of $130,000. The Interim Superintendent, George Jackson, said if handicapped students were unable to go to programs on the second floor, the programs were duplicated on the first floor. "If we couldn't bring the kids to the program," Mr. Jackson said, "we brought the program to the kids."
The Herricks School District in New Hyde Park says financing is not available for elevators in the high school and community center. Until the money is appropriated, a library and science laboratories with stations for handicapped students will be added on the first floor of the high school at a cost of $50,000. That would make all programs accessible to all students, said Superintendent Sidney Freund.
An elevator costing $140,000 will also be added in the Early Childhood Building of the Hewlett-Woodmere schools, with an additional $40,000 in the budget to review and analyze the provisions for the handicapped. Superintendent Bert Nelson said most districts were feeling financial pressures when they made costly changes to comply with laws on the handicapped. "The American Disabilities Act is much like oatmeal," Dr. Nelson said. "It's not always easy, but it's good for you and the right thing to do."
 
Requirement for Fingerprinting
 Aside from special-education mandates, districts face expenses from other state requirements, as well. The president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents and Superintendent of Rockville Centre Schools, Dr. William Johnson, said although each mandate was not significantly costly individually, "when you take them collectively they impact the school budgets."
He cited a new state requirement to fingerprint and train security workers. "This is an area of tremendous turnover in staff," Dr. Johnson said. "It may cost only $1,000 to $2,000 to train and fingerprint each employee, but when you multiply that by the number of people being hired it becomes a real burden."
Starting next year a breakfast program will be required. Superintendent Elliott Landon of Long Beach said although details had not been finalized many districts would have longer school days and higher costs for personnel, transportation and supervision.
Another mandate, under the Federal Clean Air Act, is to start car pools next year. Dr. Johnson said each district had to develop a plan that would go beyond encouraging employees to car pool. "School districts will be responsible and subject to penalties if their employees don't comply," he said, "which means more administrative costs for monitoring."
Car pooling could also cause other problems. "If teachers car pool together," Superintendent James Ruck of Sachem said, "a teacher who might have stayed late to work with students will have to leave because his ride is leaving. This mandate is a real Catch-22. We're school districts, not private businesses. We have no authority to force our staff to comply. Yet if we don't abide by the regulations we'll get fined, not the employees."
The New Compact for Learning, a state blueprint for education through the 21st century, also has many requirements for programs and staff development that districts have to support financially. The president of the Suffolk County Council of Superintendents and the Superintendent of Westhampton Beach schools, Dr. Ed Broderick, said the state did not back up its mandates with financing.
"If they mandate staff training, new programs or methods," he said, "they've got to keep their pocketbooks open, and they're not giving us enough help. It's especially unfair to districts that can't afford it."
Most districts also face the expense this year of catching up with building repairs and maintenance deferred since 1991, when the state drastically cut aid.
To prevent tax increases, Dr. Brodsky said, some districts used up their reserve funds to maintain buildings and purchase supplies. Dr. Johnson added that many districts were planning repairs that could no longer be ignored. In Rockville Centre, he said, brick work and roof repairs from damage in the winter are estimated to cost $300,000.
In Long Beach a $10 million bond issue has been approved for a 10-year program of repairs and renovations. Dr. Landon said the first phase, to repair roofs and replace windows, ceilings and rotted doors, would begin in the summer. Most districts have no choice but to begin similar repairs, he said.
In many districts, salary negotiations over expired teachers' contracts will also affect expenses next year. Dr. Broderick said that salaries had become a sensitive issue and that strong community reactions had led to stalemates in negotiations.
 
Pressures on School Boards
 In most districts, Dr. Landon said, 80 percent of the expenses are for personnel. Settlements have generally been authorizing salary increases of 3 to 4 percent.
"The public thinks that school boards have more control over salary negotiations than they really do," he said. "The pressure on boards from outside sources is tremendous, and they can't do what the public thinks they are able to."
Increased enrollments next year, particularly on the elementary level, may also require new hiring.
The state dictates that school districts have to provide personnel for students who do not speak English. Dr. Brodsky said the number of students on Long Island who spoke foreign languages and required special instruction had significantly increased in recent years, mostly with students from Central and South America, Asia and the Middle East. Dr. Johnson added that some districts would try to absorb the increased number of students and that others would have to add staff members. "School districts are trying to respond responsibly to tough economic times," he said. "There's a lot of pressure, but the bottom line is that many expenses are rising for reasons that school districts just can't control."

BEFORE THE SHOOTING BEGINS
Searching for Democracy
in America's Culture War.
By James Davison Hunter.
310 pp. New York:
The Free Press. $22.95. 
ANY serious effort to expand the common ground between the fissures in the American political landscape is worthy of attention, if for no other reason than that polarization over issues from prayer in the schools to homosexuality and abortion erodes our capacity to govern.
Division is so intense that it not only precludes fair solutions but also diverts us from constructing answers to other pressing concerns, from education to health care. One need only recall the barrage of protest against President Clinton's initial policy for inclusion of homosexuals in the military to be reminded of how divided we stand. The eventual compromise -- a politically acceptable, if not universally satisfactory, resolution -- is only one sign of how desperate we are for new mediating voices and fresh strategies to bring us together. And that is why James Davison Hunter's new book, "Before the Shooting Begins," offers a welcome reprieve from the ideological battleground.
Mr. Hunter, a professor of sociology at the University of Virginia, presents "Before the Shooting Begins" as a "companion and follow-up" to "Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America" (1991). In "Culture Wars" he described a fault line between "orthodox" and "progressive" visions that is fragmenting American society. In his new book, he uses the issue of abortion as a case study to analyze the sources of our national standoff. And as he says he did in "Culture Wars," he keeps himself at a safe distance from the conflict. The last thing that is needed is "the voice of one more activist," he says. "It is enough to see clearly."
"The deadlock over abortion and the problems it has created for the state in its claim to authority are repeated over and over again within the various issues of the culture war," Mr. Hunter writes. "Some are obviously more intense, enduring and far-reaching than others. In each, no matter what position the Government takes, its authority will be called into question by some. Cumulatively, then, the culture war posits a crisis of legitimacy for the modern state."
Mr. Hunter places his faith in the power of "serious civil reflection and argument" to unearth a new common ground, confident that substantive discussion will lead to deeper democracy. While commendable as sentiment, as strategy this is limited, because it lays too much of our division at the door of public ignorance and relies too much on the power of debate itself.
As is often the case, it is easier for the author to define the problem than to offer a solution. He dismisses as shallow the "pro-life" and "pro-choice" labels, which, he says, express a sentiment, not conviction or even a commitment. One could argue that it is precisely because the labels express a commitment that the divide exists.
"Democracy must be reinvented in every generation and for the circumstances in which each new generation finds itself," Mr. Hunter declares. Accepting the premise that a more thoughtful debate is crucial to that process, his reader is nevertheless prompted to ask: what practical ideas about their circumstances will emerge from his book to make it possible for Americans on either side of the abortion debate to believe that their sense of right and wrong is now protected and that it is time to lay down their arms? While it is admirable for Mr. Hunter not to reveal a thread of bias in his intricate weave of opposing positions, readers on either side may quibble with his interpretation of the facts or balk at the way he weighs every nuance of the arguments on an equal scale.
A section titled "Pro-Choice Tactical Interests" opens this way, for example: "A key tactical advantage of the pro-choice position is economic in nature. Abortion, in a word, is profitable." Yet a few sentences later Mr. Hunter notes that "fewer and fewer doctors are willing to enter the field." And it may be unfair to make the link summarized in this sentence in a section called "What Men Have at Stake": "Thus, when pro-life men refer to women seeking abortions as self-indulgent, they betray a broader discomfort with nontraditional views of sexuality, especially female sexuality."
Relying heavily on well-documented information in a narrative that is weighted with facts and figures, Mr. Hunter includes anecdotal stories about the consequences of abortion on two women in their 30's, both raised in Roman Catholic families. One turned to the church and became "very strongly pro-life in her views," and the other "tries to avoid talking about the abortion issue" and "copes by trying to forget the bad." Both women were deeply troubled, Mr. Hunter relates, as a result of their experience. These are, Mr. Hunter says, "only two of literally millions of stories that could be gathered." One wonders how they were selected at the expense of all the others.
The new common ground that the majority of Americans seek may indeed be emerging, but not where he thought it would, not from the middle of the abortion debate itself but rather from just a bit off center, around the issue of teen-age pregnancy. This is where the two sides have the greatest potential to converge, prompted by the recognition that neither women nor children will be protected if children continue to have children, dooming them equally to a life of poverty.
MR. HUNTER acknowledges these fledgling steps when he refers to the dialogue initiated between the director of Reproductive Health Services in St. Louis and the region's chief anti-abortion lawyer. Among other things, Reproductive Health Services and Missouri Citizens for Life cooperated on legislation to pay for drug treatment for pregnant addicts. Similar programs in Connecticut and Wisconsin are also cited.
Mr. Hunter is doubtful that local initiatives can be carried to the national level, and his skepticism may be justified. But concern over the high rate of teen-age pregnancy is increasingly part of the national debate, especially over changes in the welfare system. The discussion of abstinence, once dismissed as unrealistic by abortion rights advocates like myself, is now being given more serious attention as one option for some young girls.
Mr. Hunter opens "Before the Shooting Begins" with a chilling reminder of the rhetoric and the reality of violence that includes the continued threats of violence at abortion clinics; he closes with a call for "moral education," in schools, universities and the churches, to bring citizens to the point where they can respectfully live with disagreement.
"Alas, success," he writes, "is not measured in political terms but in social terms: in the de-escalation of tensions, in the development of a small measure of mutual understanding and in the outcomes of real people's lives." Would that not be progress?

HEADLINE: Failure of High-Flying Banks Shakes Venezuelan Economy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
In Latin America's worst banking crisis of the free-market 1990's, a string of failures since January has left half of Venezuela's banking industry in the hands of the Government.
Venezuelan taxpayers face a $6.1 billion bailout bill, as the Government props up nine banks, including Banco Latino, the nation's second largest. More banks may fail as inspectors unravel a five-year-long banking spree generated by deregulated interest rates and minimal Government supervision. This often resulted in banks offering rates for deposits that were far higher than were justified by loan demand. 
 "Eighty to 90 percent of the banking system is compromised in this catastrophe," said Oscar Garcia Mendoza, president of one of the strongest banks here, Banco Venezolano de Credito. "If you don't have policemen on street corners, bankers will run red lights."
The costly bailout is contributing to political instability. And while fugitive bank directors enjoy comfortable overseas exile, Venezuelans are paying for the bank failures with high inflation, reduced government services and shrinking economic activity.
For Venezuela's economy, today's financial crisis is roughly 10 times as severe as the failure of savings and loans institutions in the early 1990's was to the United States. The $105 billion savings and loans bailout represents 1.6 percent of the United States' gross domestic product and 7 percent of the projected 1995 Federal budget.
By contrast, Venezuela's $6.1 billion bailout represents 11 percent of Venezuela's gross national product and 75 percent of the Government's 1994 national budget. Banco Latino had 1.2 million depositors -- about 10 percent of Venezuela's adult population.
By setting interest rates far higher than sound banks, Banco Latino lured many depositors, then used the funds to build a lavish headquarters, charter jets for each director of the bank, throw lavish parties and make loans to insiders.
"There was absolutely no supervision," one American banker here said, reviewing the collapse. "The regulators weren't trained. They didn't have a budget."
Late last fall, when Banco Latino officials began to realize that their house of cards was collapsing, they started transferring hundreds of million of dollars overseas. In the final frenetic days, one bank director foresaw judicial orders on freezing assets and sold his million-dollar mansion, Another officer, Folco Falchi, the bank's coordinator for international investments, was reportedly seen loading suitcases stuffed with dollars into his corporate jet on the Caribbean island of Curacao.
After the authorities padlocked Banco Latino on Jan. 14, bank officers, operating from offshore refuges, entered the bank's computer elecronically with a modem and erased and altered thousands of records.
At the time, Venezuela's Superintendent of Banks, Roger Urbina, was buying race horses in Argentina. He decided not to come home.
 
Guidelines Ignored
 At the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Venezuela's equivalent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Esperanza Martino, the president, apparently got the job in 1990 because she was married to the chief bodyguard of President Carlos Andres Perez, who was impeached last year for misuse of Government funds. Despite her training as a lawyer, the director ignored guidelines and concentrated almost half of the money for banking emergencies in only two of Venezuela's 47 banks: Banco Latino and a bank that collapsed in February.
The two regulators resigned on Jan. 21. Without displaying any urgency, Venezuela's Senate waited for three months to ratify their replacements. One legislator, Pablo Medina, charged that Congress's reluctance to investigate Banco Latino stemmed from past generosity by the bank's public relations department. With a $3-million-a-month budget, the department reportedly paid the bills of Banco Latino credit cards furnished free of charge to 36 congressmen.
Venezuela has no tradition of punishing white-collar crime. Three bank failures in the late 1970's resulted in one officer being jailed for one year.
In the Banco Latino case, a criminal court judge issued 83 arrest warrants in early March. The list was apparently prepared by copying names out of the bank's most recent annual report. The following week, the judge excused herself from the case, but left the arrest warrants standing.
Four months later, only 6 of 83 suspects have surrendered. Virtually all the others are believed to be abroad.
Venezuelans, displaying little confidence in their banking, legal or political systems, keep some $50 billion in foreign banks. Deposits in Venezuelan banks total only $12.7 billion. Venezuela's dollar reserves have dropped by 25 percent since the start of this year, a hemorrhaging that was worsened by the Banco Latino crisis.
The gigantic problems in Venezuela's small banking sector have their roots in a free-market change adopted by Mr. Perez when he was president: the freeing of Government-regulated interest rates.
"Free interest rates were adopted in 1989, but banking supervision was not adopted until 1994," Tesalio Cadenas, Venezuela's new Superintendent of Banks, said in an interview here. "That gap was responsible for the Banco Latino crisis."
With a relationship between the Government and the bank, ministries moved their accounts to Latino. The army and the Government-owned oil company put their pension funds in the hands of Latino trust managers.
Flush with money, Latino built a lavish high-rise headquarters here and decorated it with expensive oil paintings and sculpture. Expanding aggressively, the bank became a ubiquitous presence in this country, operating 101 branches, including one in the United States Embassy here. Affiliate banks were opened in Colombia, in Curacao (Banco Latino N.V.) and in Miami (Banco Latino International).
When a Banco Latino representative office was opened in Paris, the bank filled a Concorde with guests for an expense-paid weekend in Paris. The bank also bought a corporate jet for virtually every bank director.
 
Lax Loan Policies
 Struggling to keep up with rocketing deposits, Latino bankers made increasingly poor-quality loans. The same collateral was used for multiple loans. Loans were made to bank officers.
"You cannot apply Swiss standards to Spain," one director, Ricardo Cisneros Rendiles, said from Miami in a telephone interview. "Venezuelans are like some regional banks in the U.S. 15 years ago; there is a lot of community interest, everybody knows each other."
Building a real estate empire, the bank bought 500 office buildings, only to see the market fall. Speculating in the stock market, it invested heavily in Caracas's state electricity company at $10 a share in 1992. Today, the stock sells for $2 a share.
Without informing their Venezuelan depositors, Latino officers transferred millions of dollars in deposits to the Curacao affiliate bank. There, the bank did not have to meet Venezuelan reserve requirements or pay deposit insurance taxes.
Eventually, Banco Latino became a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, a financial operation that could be maintained only by attracting more and more investors. Last year, the bank paid 105 percent interest on one-year certificates of deposit, more than double Venezuela's 1993 inflation rate of 46 percent. Depositors over 60 years of age received interest premiums of 3 percentage points.
But when Mr. Garcia of the Banco Venezolano de Credito publicly urged banking officials to investigate Banco Latino's high interest rates, the only reaction was a threat by the National Banking Council to expel him. (This industry group happens to be housed in Banco Latino's headquarters building.)
 
'Doing Dumb Things'
 "They were doing dumb things, but all the banks were," said Mr. Cisneros, a minority shareholder who said he was only actively involved in Banco Latino affairs when shareholders mounted a last-ditch attempt to save the bank in early January. "If it hadn't been Banco Latino, it would have been any other bank. The proof is that eight other banks are under receivership."
When the collapse came in mid-January, the Government suddenly had more than one million angry depositors on its hands. After one huge street demonstration, several depositors invaded a judge's legal chambers, where they waved toy guillotines.
Seeking to buy political peace, Venezuela's new President, Rafael Caldera, signed into law an emergency banking bill on March 10. This law retroactively raised depositors' insurance from $9,000 to $35,000. With 99.8 percent of savings accounts and 94.3 percent of checking accounts fully covered, Banco Latino reopened uneventfully on April 4 as a Government-run bank.
To placate some 2,000 depositors in Latino's Curacao branch, Government officials announced in early May that the Government would extend the $35,000 coverage to their previously uninsured deposits. The banks in Miami and Colombia are to be sold, and the Government hopes to sell Banco Latino, as well as the other eight other banks now under Government control: Banco de Amazonas, Bancor, Banco Barinas, Banco de la Construccion, Banco La Guaira, Banco Metropolitano, Banco de Maracaibo and Fiveca. To keep these banks afloat, the Government has pumped in $3.3 billion, more than the $2.8 billion in Government aid extended to Banco Latino.
"The idea is to privatize Banco Latino, the sooner the better," Edgar Dao, a member of the Government intervening board, said in an interview at Banco Latino's headquarters.
But many analysts believe that Venezuela's market needs only about 10 banks and that the rest will either have to be liquidated or merged with stronger banks. "They'll put Banco Latino on the block, but I doubt they will get a nibble," said Marco A. Gomez, president of the 78-member Foreign Bankers Association of Venezuela. "I don't know of anyone who wants a bank of that magnitude."
To prevent further bank frauds of Banco Latino's size, the Bank Superintendent's office is quadrupling its budget, is expanding its investigative team by one third and is seeking technical assistance from the United States Government.
As for the perpetrators of the multibillion-dollar collapse, prospects seem to be dim that they will ever be tried and convicted.
"I maintain that the presidents of many banks in Venezuela have signed many more balances with false figures than I ever have," Gustavo Gomez Lopez, Banco Latino's president until three weeks before the fall, wrote in March in a statement defending himself against charges of fraud, criminal conspiracy and undue appropriation.

HEADLINE: Plan for Siting Social Services Stirs Dispute

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
A proposal by New York City's top planning official to encourage placement of homeless shelters, drug clinics and other social service operations in sections zoned for light manufacturing could complicate efforts to redevelop these areas, officials and analysts said yesterday.
Although the chairman of the City Planning Commission, Joseph B. Rose, did not say which neighborhoods would be best suited for social service centers, many of the areas zoned for manufacturing are concentrated along the Harlem River waterfront in the South Bronx and waterfront sections of Brooklyn and Queens. Community leaders warned that placement of too many social service operations in these areas could upset the delicate balance in otherwise commercially viable areas. 
 "It sounds to me like he is looking for an easy answer for a difficult problem," said Stephen DiBrienza, a Council member from Brooklyn who represents Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and other neighborhoods. "I'm willing to hear more, but I'm very skeptical. I don't want to see any dumping grounds singled out so that other places can avoid their fair share."
Mr. Rose said, "We're not trying to just target particular manufacturing zones, but this gives us the option to consider a broader array of sites and lessen the pressure on residential neighborhoods."
 
Community Opposition
 Some advocates for the homeless have welcomed the idea of placing shelters and social service programs in manufacturing areas because it might make it easier to site them. But others have worried that placing them away from residential neighborhoods could add a further stigma to poor people in need of such services.
While the greatest controversy over the the siting of social service centers has occurred along the Upper West Side, previous plans to place new social service centers in mixed-use areas like Brooklyn's Red Hook -- where an extended-care center for victims of AIDS is planned -- have also aroused intense community opposition.
The proposal by Mr. Rose, which the Giuliani administration plans to outline in greater detail within a month, marks the confluence of two critical issues facing the city: how to locate equitably social service centers that are sometimes seen as a threat to neighborhood life, and how to make best use of industrial areas, many of which have been struggling to cope with the loss of manufacturers that were once their lifeblood.
Last year, under former Mayor David N. Dinkins, the City Planning Department recommended encouraging large stores common in the suburbs -- like Home Depot, Caldor and Pathmark supermarkets -- to expand in the city as a way of redeveloping declining industrial areas. That would be accomplished by raising the size limit on stores allowed in many light- and medium-industry zones.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, as a candidate for mayor, recognized community fears that large stores might undermine neighborhood merchants, but he never took a firm position. Now officials of his administration are looking more favorably at the idea.
Under current rules, any different use for a manufacturing area -- like large retailing, housing or social services -- needs a zoning variance, a process that can take years.
A handful of social service centers are already in industrial zones, including in Long Island City, Queens and in Red Hook. Nonetheless, a two-year planning department study of how best to make use of manufacturing zones did not seriously consider including social service centers, said officials involved in the plan.
 
'An Innovative Idea'
 Economic analysts generally welcomed Mr. Rose's proposal for encouraging the placement of social service centers in manufacturing areas, but said that it raised a number of new problems.
"This is an innovative idea," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "But you have to be careful how you go about it."
Professor Moss said that industrial zones are often cut off from mass transit, which would make it more difficult for homeless people to gain access to other services they require.
Isabel Hill, a former city planner and now a documentary film maker, said that New York City's remaining industrial areas are too important to be opened to other uses that are potentially harmful.
"Our manufacturing base is still a very important source of jobs for New Yorkers," said Ms. Hill, whose most recent film is titled "Made in Brooklyn."

HEADLINE: 2 Boys, a Debt, a Gun, a Victim: The Face of Violence

SERIES: When Trouble Starts Young: Second report in a periodic series

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
It was a wave of the hand from a 10-year-old boy with a Botticelli face and Dennis the Menace bangs that brought Elizabeth Alvarez to her death on a humid afternoon last August.
The boy, Jacob Gonzales, wheeled around a bank parking lot on the banana seat of a pink bicycle he had stolen and looked for a robbery victim. His accomplice, Damien Dorris, a 14-year-old drug dealer who owed the neighborhood kingpins $430, lay in wait near the automated teller machine. 
 Mrs. Alvarez, pregnant and the mother of three, was hurrying to get cash for a birthday party. She passed by little Jacob and smiled. "Isn't it a good day?" Jacob said she asked. Jacob nodded in agreement and watched her walk toward the machine. He signaled to Damien when their prey made her withdrawal.
But Mrs. Alvarez refused to hand over her $80, so Damien shot her in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. Jacob looked at the woman, then he backed away. The boys thought the bullet might explode.
They ran off to divide the proceeds. Jacob's take was $20. He bought a chili dog and some Batman toys. Both boys were arrested the next morning.
Damien pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. Jacob, whose detention garb had to be rolled up at the ankles and wrists and secured at the waist to keep from falling off, pleaded guilty to armed robbery. Both boys were sentenced to the maximum term, to remain in state custody until they are 21.
Sitting in an office at a children's home in Flint, Mich., recently, Jacob twirled a pen on a formica-top table, his feet dangling from a chair, not quite touching the floor, and tried to explain that violent day.
"Some stuff bad happened," he said, flipping the pen in the air and catching it before throwing it up again. "It was a game. It wasn't to kill the lady. It wasn't supposed to be like that. It was a game, right?"
The country is facing a crisis of violence among young people unlike any before, criminologists say. Even as overall violent crime has leveled off since 1990 and the number of teen-agers has declined, arrests of people under 18 for violent crime rose 47 percent from 1988 to 1992, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The rise in violence among the young crosses racial, class and geographic boundaries. From 1982 to 1992, F.B.I. statistics show, the rate of arrests for violent crimes rose twice as fast among young whites as among young blacks. Still, young blacks were arrested at five times the rate of young whites for violent crimes. Both groups accounted for an equal number of violent crimes. The white rate jumped to 126 arrests per 100,000 whites under the age of 18, from 82. The black rate increased to 677 arrests for every 100,000 blacks under 18, from 533. The high rate of violent crime among blacks is linked to their high rate of poverty, said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
"Race is not a cause," Dr. Rosenberg said. "This is an American problem." In studies that take poverty into account, he said, "the differences in the black rate of violent crime and the white rate almost go away."
One in six arrests for murder, rape, robbery or assault is of a suspect under 18, the F.B.I. statistics show, and slayings by these teen-agers have risen 124 percent from 1986 to 1991. In 1992, the F.B.I. said, young people killed 3,400 people nationwide.
 
Medical Advances 'Salvage People'
 The homicide numbers might well have been higher without the medical advances of the past 20 years, particularly improved training and technology that allow doctors and ambulance workers to quickly stop bleeding. "We've been able to salvage people who otherwise would have been killed," said Dr. Robert McAfee, president-elect of the American Medical Association, who plans to focus his tenure on efforts against violence.
A change in weaponry from the knives of the past to the guns of today has been a major factor in the rise in killings by juveniles, criminologists say. But there is also evidence that young people are more violent today than a decade ago, even without weapons. Bureau statistics show that young people committed twice as many assaults without a weapon in 1992 as in 1982, 143,368 to 73,987.
In Indianapolis, for example, two 7-year-old boys pulled a 6-year-old girl into the boys' restroom at school, tore off her clothes and raped her. One pleaded guilty to rape and the other was convicted. Both were put on probation, and their parents were ordered to remove their X-rated videos from the home.
 
'The Most Dangerous Out There'
 Violence among the young is growing at a time when a generation of children born to teen-age mothers is coming of age in neighborhoods already weakened by the addictive power of crack and the destructive force of the drug dealers. In many ways, this is the story of Jacob and Damien, each born to a woman on welfare who first gave birth at the age of 14.
Damien was abandoned by his father, and ran away from his mother because, he told court officials, she beat him. Jacob lived in a crack house. His father beat his mother and died violently himself.
Although adults, primarily those in their 20's and 30's, account for the majority of all crimes, criminologists say crimes committed by young people can escalate out of control because youngsters tend to act impulsively. "Kids are the most dangerous criminals out there," said Charles Patrick Ewing, a lawyer and forensic psychologist who is a professor of law at the State University of New York at Buffalo and author of "Kids Who Kill" (Lexington Books, 1990).
They may take a life over a jacket or a disdainful look, often without remorse or an understanding of the consequences.
"Many older armed robbers will say, 'Give up the money,' and let you go," Dr. Ewing said. "A kid may or may not kill you depending upon the whim of the moment. Many kids feel they don't have anything to lose. So taking someone's life is not that big a deal."
 
Violent Crimes in Suburbs
 While violent crime occurs at a disproportionately higher rate in cities than in suburbs and among blacks than among whites, youthful rampages that once seemed confined to inner cities are now striking suburbs and farm towns as well.
Last summer, in the affluent Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, Ga., three white teen-agers went to the home of a disabled man they knew, tied him in his wheelchair and tortured him for more than 12 hours before stabbing and clubbing him to death. In rural Indiana, three white teen-age girls lured a 12-year-old girl into a car, then beat and stabbed her before burning her alive.
In Davenport, Iowa, three white teen-age boys who the police say were gang members were recently convicted of shooting to death a 17-year-old girl when she refused to let them use her Ford Escort for a robbery.
 
'Obsessed With Easy Solutions'
 The teen-age population is expected to rise by as much as 20 percent in the next 10 years and to grow by an even greater percentage among poorer minority teen-agers. It is a demographic trend that criminologists say could mean a further increase in violence, and in the current climate of retribution, an increase in the number of states treating young criminals as adults.
"There will be trouble ahead," said James Alan Fox, dean of criminal justice at Northeastern University, "and the problem is, we're not planning for it. We are obsessed with quick, easy solutions that won't work, like waiving juveniles to adult court at the expense of difficult solutions."
The violence has had a profound effect on what it means to be a child. In some Chicago elementary schools, children play during recess with police patrol cars standing by to keep order. Some high schools in Iowa have full-time probation officers in their buildings to keep a watch on parolees.
Dogs trained to sniff out drugs and guns are brought in to search students at random in Blue Ridge, Ariz., and Savannah, Ga., and Emery, Utah, and to check lockers at night in Huber Heights, Ohio. High school students are scanned with metal detectors every morning in Oklahoma City and West Contra Costa, Calif. And metal detectors are used at all student activities in Thornton Township, Ill. Some schools have simply removed all lockers so teen-agers will not have a place to store weapons.
 
'Unthinkable 20 Years Ago'
 In city after city, town after town, there are nightmarish cases that make judges and prosecutors nostalgic for the truants and vandals that once filled their dockets.
The savagery astounds veterans in the legal system. "It is incredible -- the ability of the very young to commit the most horrendous crimes imaginable and not have a second thought about it," said Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles County District Attorney. "This was unthinkable 20 years ago."
 
The Growing Years
A Neighborhood Of Troubled Heroes
 Just about all that Jacob Gonzales has known in his short life is violence. His home on the southwest side of Detroit was a crack house. His father used to beat his mother. Jacob saw his sister shot in the face when he was 4 or 5. His father was shot to death in a bar fight about the same time. He can rattle off the names and calibers of guns as if they were baseball players and batting averages.
He has seen family friends pull guns on one another and knows the subtleties of detecting a pistol. "You can tell when somebody's carrying a gun," Jacob said. "They hold their side and limp a little."
He was 9 when he took his first drag of marijuana. An older sister gave it to him. His mother, Bonnie, who was raped in the seventh grade, is a welfare recipient with eight children; Jacob is her youngest. Court records show that Mrs. Gonzales drank heavily, used crack and once even sold her children's clothes for drug money.
She failed to show up at Jacob's first court hearings on the armed-robbery charge. She was drunk when she finally came to testify, said Michael Batchelor, the boy's lawyer, who added, "You could smell it." Her testimony was of little help, Mr. Batchelor said. She did not even know her son's birthday.
 
Drug Dealers as Role Models
 "Jake is a product of his environment," Mr. Batchelor said. "He comes from a dysfunctional family. The older neighborhood boys were his heroes. They sold drugs. They had guns. They were his role models. He wanted to be like them."
His heroes were troubled and neglected themselves. Damien Dorris, the 14-year-old who killed Mrs. Alvarez, was abandoned by his father, beaten by his mother and was essentially rearing himself. He had dropped out of school after the seventh grade and lived with an older teen-age brother. The brother was a drug dealer, the police said, and Damien picked up the trade.
He became a ward of the court for a time after his mother was accused of beating one of his brothers. His father, Saul Gainey, left the family "in order to deal with personal concerns of his own," according to court records.
 
Threatening to End His Life
 One March day two years ago, Damien reached a breaking point when he was told to leave school after refusing to take off his hat. He climbed atop a railing on a freeway overpass and was threatening to jump when the police pulled him off.
By last summer, he told the police, he had grown bored with drug dealing and was trying to get out. But he had to find a way to pay his $430 debt to his drug suppliers. He told court officials he had been given 24 hours to come up with the money or be killed.
He got his buddy Jacob and two other boys to help him. One left before the shooting, and the police said the other one did not take part. But Jacob carried out his role because, he said, he was hungry, he wanted some money and it was something exciting to do.
Damien told court officials he "didn't plan to shoot the lady," that he "just wanted to rob her." But in case something went wrong, Damien said, he had taken along a gun from his brother's house.
Jacob recalls with childish fascination the preparation for the attack. "He sharpened the bullet so it would go in real good," Jacob said. "It was real pointy."
 
The Legal Route
From Court Wards To Criminal Cases
 In a year's time, hundreds of budding criminals pass before Judge James E. Lacey of Wayne County Juvenile Court in Detroit, children and teen-agers charged with murder, rape, aggravated assault. Most of them he has seen before. They are already on file from his old docket of neglected children.
Many delinquents who appear before him today had been wards of the court years before and are before him again in what he has come to see as an expected outcome in young lives where everything has gone wrong.
"You have a one-parent family, probably below the poverty line," Judge Lacey said, describing the typical defendant's family life. "The mother does not have a high school diploma, no job skills, is young herself and has certain needs that are not being met. These are the common denominators of the great bulk of the cases."
The world has changed in the nearly 20 years Judge Lacey has been on the bench. There was a time when young men could look forward to a job on the automobile assembly line, when the majority of inner-city children were born to married women, not single mothers, when people fought with fists, not guns, and crack did not exist.
There was a time when Marine Corps recruiters would stand at the door of Juvenile Court and try to save wayward teen-agers by giving them an option other than jail or joblessness or early death. "You don't see that anymore," Judge Lacey said. "They haven't been here in years."
By the time Damien Dorris and Jacob Gonzales stood before Judge Lacey as accused criminals, they had been in the courts as victims of abuse or neglect by the adults who were supposed to care for them. Their mothers had lost custody of some of their children at one time or another. School was a part-time affair for the boys.
They were neither the youngest nor necessarily the worst Judge Lacey had seen. There are tens of thousands of children like them in Wayne County alone, he figures.
"The problem is of such magnitude," the judge said. "It's vast. It's mindboggling. You see the failure of the schools. You see the failure of the parents. You see the violence on the streets. You see the guns. You see the drugs.
"The children are being robbed of their childhood. They are afraid of going to school and getting shot. They're worried about day-to-day survival instead of enjoying football and the honors society and the debating club and the theater. They're worried about getting out alive at the end of the day. That should not be a consideration in childhood."
By now very little surprises Judge Lacey. But even he was struck by the outward innocence of Jacob, the third-grader who seemed not to comprehend what he had done to Mrs. Alvarez.
"I looked down there, and I saw this cherubic face staring up at me being guarded by a deputy sheriff," Judge Lacey said of the day he sentenced Jacob. "He looked like a choir boy. But I said, 'I don't know. You may have a very dark soul.' "
 
The Proposals
 Invest in Prisons; Invest in Lives
 How the country came to this point, where the youngest citizens are turning on themselves and on adults in cold blood, is the focus of intense study in nearly every academic and legal quarter.
The causes are complicated and involve social, moral and economic shifts in society that make it harder for parents to rear children and harder for children to grow up safely. The experts cite these factors:
A changed economy puts more pressure on families. More women are working and more children are in the care of others or at home unsupervised. There is more divorce. There are more single-parent families and more children being born to and reared by teen-age mothers. There is crack and everything that goes with it. In the last decade, child abuse and domestic violence have doubled, giving children their first lesson in conflict-resolution.
More guns are on the street, and guns are the most common weapon used by young killers, according to the F.B.I.
"Yesterday's adolescent fist fight is today's adolescent shootout," said Dr. Jay Winsten, associate dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. "Yesterday's black eye and injured pride is today's gaping exit wound with massive injuries. It's casting a pall of fear over the lives of American children."
All of this is happening in a culture that glorifies brutish behavior -- from decapitations in video games to chain-saw massacres in movies. There has been contradictory evidence about a direct link between violence in the media and violence in children. Some people can watch a lifetime of shootings on screen and never pick up a gun; others might kill regardless of what they see on television. But many social scientists are convinced that a diet of violent images -- particularly the simulated police dramas that can seem real to young minds -- plays a role.
"Most of these kids have not invented these tortures," said Dr. James Garbarino, a child psychologist who is president of the Erikson Institute for Advanced Study in Child Development in Chicago and who specializes in the effects of violence on children.
"Television gives them a script to use to play out their internal problems," Dr. Garbarino said. "They're like little sponges. They soak up everything around them. The little ones think, 'You shoot people, and they get up.' The others think, 'You shoot them and things are taken care of.' "
The real debate is over solutions. Should the country punish violent youths as it does adults? Should it try to rehabilitate them in boot camps and with counseling or focus on punishment, stiffer sentences and more prisons? Should it punish the parents? Should it focus on prevention with things like anti-violence education or midnight basketball leagues? Should it try to tackle the root causes, the poverty and joblessness that propel some people to violence? Should it look to biology and try to regulate the hormones of violence-prone children?
In earlier times, delinquent children were treated like most other criminals, tried and sometimes jailed with adults or condemned to workhouses or reformatories. By the turn of the century, compassion prevailed as separate juvenile courts were created to intervene in the lives of troubled children. Now, fear is swinging the pendulum back to the days when youth was no protection from stiff punishment.
Recent proposals range from abolishing juvenile courts and locking up young killers for the rest of their lives to punishing parents whose children go astray by docking welfare checks or making them perform community service or serve jail sentences themselves. Legislation making it easier to prosecute teen-agers as adults is pending in 14 states.
A new law in Florida, to be effective in January, requires young people of any age to be tried as adults if they had three previous felony convictions. Some legislators there have suggested that 13-year-old murderers be executed.
Already, some teen-age killers are receiving maximum sentences when tried in adult court, insuring that some offenders will grow up behind bars. In November, a 17-year-old boy who raped and stoned to death a 15-year-old girl in Milwaukee was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole in 2065 when he would be 90. The sentence came after the prosecutor, Mark Williams, argued that the boy should be locked up until he is "too weak to pick up a rock or swing a board."
"Many of these juveniles should be in prison because they can not be rehabilitated," Mr. Williams said. "They should be incarcerated until we are sure they're not going to hurt anyone else."
Outside the legal system, social scientists are debating the best way to prevent youngsters from becoming violent.
"People don't come into the world with a gun in their hand," said Dr. Robert T.M. Phillips, a forensic psychiatrist who is deputy medical director of the American Psychiatric Association. "They don't come into the world with rage and anger in their heart. They learn it."
Some professionals say young people turn to mischief and aggression because they have few other diversions and little supervision. The old police athletic leagues are gone, and recreation centers sit empty because of cities' fiscal troubles.
"The problem is idleness and hopelessness," said Professor Fox of Northeastern University. "If you don't have a sense that there's a future, you live for today, die for today and kill for today. These kids face death every day in the classroom. Do you think they care about the possibility of the death penalty that might be imposed maybe someday?"
The Harvard School of Public Health has begun a campaign to get young people to walk away from conflict with the slogan "Squash It," a term already fashionable among the young when they decide to let an incident pass.
The creators of the program say the idea is just a start. "We're inviting them to walk away from confrontation," said Dr. Winsten of the Harvard School of Public Health. "What are we asking them to walk up to instead? We have to create a whole superstructure of activities in which they can compete and win."
 
Searching for a Violence Gene
 A re-emerging area of study seeks to determine the biology of crime and the role of neurotransmitters in aggressive, antisocial and ultimately violent behavior. It is an extraordinarily sensitive undertaking that raises the possibility that children who might never become violent might be condemned as such because of their hormone levels. Recent work has linked fluctuations in the hormones seratonin and noradrenaline with aggression. These hormones rise or fall as a person is exposed to stress, like that inner-city children may experience in violent neighborhoods.
Some criminologists say that none of these ideas will work as long as children continue to grow up in social conditions that breed violence.
"We're fighting the wrong enemy," said Dr. Barry Krisberg, a criminologist and sociologist who is president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, a crime research organization in San Francisco. "We're blaming the kids. We should be fighting the gun lobby, the people pushing drugs and alcohol to kids and violence on television. We seem to think that with a little tinkering we can solve the structural displacement of an entire class of people. We're not doing anything about the family breakdown and economic marginality and hopelessness of the people."
A common theme is that solutions should start at conception. "Unless we are willing to invest in children early on," Attorney General Janet Reno told a convention of juvenile court officials in Boston recently, "we will never be able to build enough prisons ever to begin to cope with the problem 13, 15, 18 years from now."
 
The Punishment
Early Confinement, Early Release
 Six months after that bloody afternoon in Detroit, Jacob Gonzales looks like a typical little boy. He is 11 now. He likes the video game Sega Genesis and air hockey. At the Whaley Children's Home, where he is confined, his new best friend is Zach. Jacob laughs easily and still has his baby fat.
He is in therapy. His mother has yet to visit him. He does not appear to think much about the day Mrs. Alvarez died. But his past is still with him.
Sitting in an office at the Whaley home, on a campuslike setting in Flint, he played with a plastic toy that had gloppy red fluid inside. He shook it and watched the fluid ooze up and down. It looked like cherry Jell-O, but Jacob was reminded of something else. "It looks like blood," he said in wonderment.
In art class he made a papier-mache mask with horror-movie tears of blood flowing down the face. "It's a Jason mask," he said. "It's a Freddie Krueger mask."
What will happen to Jacob? "I'm not going to say that Jacob is going to come out and kill somebody or be a model citizen," Judge Lacey said. "Maybe he is not damaged beyond salvation. But he may be so lacking in moral values that the hundreds of thousands of dollars the State of Michigan may spend on him may not keep him from hurting other people."
Damien Dorris is now 15 and serving time in a maximum-security juvenile center. He, too, is in therapy. Described by social workers and a probation officer as emotionless, Damien has been visited once by his mother. He had to spend five months in detention waiting to get into the center because there were so many young killers and rapists ahead of him. It costs $200 a day to keep him locked up.
Because of the expense and backlog of delinquents waiting to serve time in Michigan, the authorities say both Jacob and Damien could be released in a couple of years.
"We can't keep them forever," Judge Lacey said. "Even if we throw all the good things we can at them, the system isn't designed to take them to adulthood."

HEADLINE: In a Sea of Praise, Discouraging Words

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Judge Stephen G. Breyer arrived in Washington today to the kind of bipartisan acclaim that was one of President Clinton's main reasons for nominating him to the Supreme Court.
But while both Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were praising the Boston judge, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat and longtime veteran of the Judiciary Committee, was expressing reservations about him, saying that he viewed Judge Breyer as someone who consistently favored corporate interests and a weakening of Government regulations. 
 The White House had prepared itself for criticism of the kind leveled by Mr. Metzenbaum. In fact when Mr. Clinton announced the nomination on Friday, he made a point of saying that he knew that some people disliked Judge Breyer's views about Government regulation.
"I know that some of his writings have been a little bit controversial in some quarters in analyzing the economic impacts of governmental actions and things of that kind," Mr. Clinton said. "But I think that he shows that he really understands them."
 
'An Easy Confirmation'
 White House aides said that Mr. Clinton included that remark to show he was familiar with Judge Breyer's writings and to pre-empt criticism on that subject, which one Administration official said today was expected from Senator Metzenbaum.
Both Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and Senator George S. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, showered praise on the Breyer nomination and said Judge Breyer would easily be confirmed.
"Unless something unforeseen happens it'll be an easy confirmation," Mr. Dole said. "Nobody's going to lay a glove on him."
Even Mr. Metzenbaum acknowledged that Judge Breyer would be confirmed with little difficulty but he said he intended to question the judge closely during confirmation hearings about his views on Government regulation. He also expressed sharp disappointment with Mr. Clinton for his selection, saying the President should be embarrassed because he chose Judge Breyer in part because he feared Republican opposition to his other choices.
Mr. Breyer, his wife, Joanna, and one of their three children, Chloe, flew here this afternoon and were driven to the White House in a van -- although they first climbed into a taxi and had to circle the parking lot to find their official transport. Once at the White House, they dined with the President and his wife, Hillary, and prepared to spend the night. Mr. Clinton is to formally present Judge Breyer to the public in a Rose Garden ceremony on Monday.
When Mr. Clinton announced his choice of Judge Breyer, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, he did so without the judge at his side, apparently because of the tumultuous selection process.
 
Focusing on Regulation
 During the 12 years of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Judge Breyer was one of the nation's most provocative commentators on the subject of Government regulation. A 1982 book titled "Regulation and Its Reform" (Harvard University Press) had the theme that problems with Government regulation were not the result of incompetent regulators but rather a mismatch of regulations to risk. Last year, Harvard University Press published a modified version of lectures he gave at its law school under the title, "Breaking the Vicious Circle, Toward Effective Risk Regulation."
In that book, Judge Breyer argued that a strong regulatory system was necessary and did not menace market forces, as some conservatives have complained. Yet at the same time, he sternly criticized how choices were made on which substances and practices to regulate.
He discussed at length a case in his own court that he said demonstrated distorted priorities. He said regulators had been pushed by public opinion to clean up the last 10 percent of toxic chemicals at a dump site in New Hampshire at a cost of $9.3 million. The site, he said, had so few toxic chemicals that scientists said children could eat small amounts of dirt from it daily for 70 days a year without harm. Cleaning it up completely would have made it clean enough for children to eat dirt for 245 consecutive days a year. But he said there were no dirt-eating children because the site was a swamp.
 
Role in Airline Deregulation
 Ralph Nader, who has debated Judge Breyer on regulation, said that while the book was not dogmatic, it was filled with what he called inaccurate studies used by conservatives to discredit Government regulation.
"When he wants to belittle the risks he cites right-wing think tanks for pro-corporate studies," Mr. Nader said in an interview today. "His thinking doesn't reflect any concern for the pain of the ordinary worker, the unequal distribution of death, injuries and contamination suffered by the ordinary worker."
Prof. Harold Bruff, a noted authority on regulatory law at the George Washington University law school, disagreed. "Stephen Breyer doesn't start out to defend or attack big business," Professor Bruff said. "I would say that he is a skeptical friend of Government regulation, someone who thinks Government can improve society but doesn't always do so."
In the 1970's, when Mr. Breyer was a senior aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is his principal political patron, he was the intellectual father of deregulating the airline and trucking industries. Experts still fiercely debate whether the deregulation of the airlines was wise.
 
Disappointed in Clinton
 Mr. Metzenbaum, among the Senate's most liberal members, said he had not yet decided if he would oppose the nomination, but he offered a critique of Judge Breyer similar to that of Mr. Nader.
"We know that Breyer is on the side of less competitiveness, not more, and that he's on the side of deregulating which too often helps those who have the wealth and resources and hurts the average American who needs some protection," the Senator said.
Mr. Metzenbaum, who is retiring from the Senate, offered his harshest criticism of the President for not nominating the man Mr. Clinton said was a leading candidate, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. He said Mr. Clinton chose Judge Breyer because Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, threatened a confirmation fight if Mr. Babbitt was nominated.
"This is so disappointing," Mr. Metzenbaum said. "We have so few opportunities to name someone to the Court, and for the President to have backed off naming someone who would have been a great credit because of Orrin Hatch's opposition is embarrassing."
But as Judge Breyer arrived at the White House today, Administration aides were delighted at the reception from Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Breyer himself told reporters that he viewed his nomination as "an opportunity to do something that will perhaps help in the lives of ordinary Americans."
The Judiciary Committee will probably begin confirmation hearings after Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess.

HEADLINE: Ex-Police Officer Kills 2 Teen-Agers and Himself

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Angry that someone had slashed his garden hose, a dismissed police officer in Rome, N.Y., strode out onto his driveway with a handgun concealed in a sweatshirt Saturday night and shot three teen-aged boys, two fatally as they rode by on bicycles. He also wounded an adult neighbor, then shot and killed himself.
The shootings stunned Rome, a blue-collar community of 45,000 residents, 35 miles east of Syracuse in Oneida County, where serious crime is relatively rare and a troubled local economy and a new Oneida Indian casino are usually the important news. 
 The Rome police declined yesterday to identify the gunman or the victims or to provide any details beyond a brief statement that said two people had been slain and two wounded by a suspect who committed suicide. But the Utica Observer-Dispatch said Dellon DiPasqua, 15, and Mike McSweeney, 14, had been killed, and James Nasci, 17, wounded.
And Rome's Mayor, Joseph A. Griffo, identified the assailant as Joseph Merola, a police officer in Rome for seven years until Mr. Griffo dismissed him last year for insubordination and violating police regulations. The Mayor said that Mr. Merola, in his early 30's, had not been accused of any criminal conduct and had not been regarded as a threat to the community.
Mr. Griffo said Mr. Merola had been upset after finding a garden hose slashed, noticed some neighborhood teen-agers in the area and called the police Saturday night to file a report. Mr. Griffo said the police took a criminal mischief report at his home and left.
About 20 minutes later, Mr. Griffo said, the police were summoned back by frantic neighbors who reported wild shooting outside Mr. Merola's home. Mr. Merola, armed with a 9-millimeter pistol for which he had a permit, walked out and began shooting at 9:23 P.M., the Mayor said.
 
Bursts of Gunfire
 He shot and killed two boys riding by on bikes, wounded the 17-year-old in the arm and grazed a male neighbor about 40 years old. He then shot himself, apparently through the heart, and fell dead in his driveway at Elwood and North Charles Streets on Rome's West Side.
There was no indication that those who were shot by Mr. Merola had anything to do with slashing his garden hose. The wounded adult was treated and released at a Rome hospital and the 17-year-old was in fair condition last night at a medical center in Syracuse.
Neighbors told of bursts of gunfire in the quiet suburban area of one-family homes, where Mr. Merola lived alone in a gray, two-story colonial-style house.
"There were three bursts of fire and two short pauses," said Patrick A. Kiedrowski, who was next door with his wife, Doreen, and three children. "We hit the floor. My wife was screaming. I scooted across the floor and punched the instant-dial for the police."
Mr. Kiedrowski did not see the shootings. But after the police pulled up, he said, he went out and saw two bodies in the street near a fallen bicycle and Mr. Merola, sprawled and apparently dead near the end of a 20-foot driveway.
Last night, as lights burned in Mr. Merola's home, the green garden hose lay tangled in the driveway, slashed almost through about 6 inches from its nozzle, and out at the corner, where the teen-agers had died, someone had put a bouquet of yellow flowers against a telephone pole. A note under the cellophane said, "God bless the children."
While Mr. Merola had lived on the street for a decade, several neighbors said they hardly knew and rarely spoke to him. They said his mother died in the 1980's and that he had lived alone, with a dog, since his father died last year.
"I saw him working in the yard, but he was never very sociable," said Larry Herbst, who lives across North Charles.
Rome's Police Chief, Merino J. Ciccone, said he would discuss the case at a news conference today, and he and other police officials were unavailable to amplify on the police statement. But Mayor Griffo, a Republican, provided some details in a phone interview last night.
 
Trouble With Neighbors
 He said Mr. Merola had been having trouble with some of his neighbors lately; among other things, neighbors had complained about the barking of Mr. Merola's dog. But, he said, there had been no hint of more serious problems.
"This is a very tragic episode in our community," Mayor Griffo said. "It's also a very rare kind of occurrence. These stories occur throughout the nation. You don't expect them in your own community. But unfortunately last night, Rome became a victim."

HEADLINE: John Swainson, 68, Michigan Governor And Perjured Judge

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
John B. Swainson, who was Governor of Michigan and then a Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court until he was convicted of perjury and resigned, died on Friday at his home in Manchester, Mich. He was 68.
The cause was a heart attack, said his son John Stephen. 
 Mr. Swainson, a Democrat, was elected Governor in 1960, served a two-year term and was narrowly defeated after a re-election campaign in which the state's economy was a major issue. He said he had been thwarted by Republican legislators in efforts to revamp the state's finances.
He later served as a Wayne County circuit judge, was elected to the state Supreme Court in 1970 and came to be seen as a prospective candidate for the United States Senate.
But his political career ended in 1975 after he was convicted, in Federal District Court in Detroit, of lying to a Federal grand jury in connection with accusations that he had accepted a bribe in 1972 to help a convicted burglar gain a review of his case. He was acquitted of conspiracy and served 60 days in a halfway house in Detroit.
Mr. Swainson was born in Windsor, Ontario, and moved with his family to Port Huron, Mich., as a toddler. He went to Port Huron schools, served in the infantry in World War II and lost both legs, just below the knees, in a land mine explosion in 1944 near Metz, France.
He earned bachelor's and law degrees in 1949 and 1951 from the University of North Carolina. He practiced law in Detroit and was a Michigan State Senator and then Lieutenant Governor before being elected Governor. Until last fall, he worked as a mediator and arbitrator.
In addition to his son John Stephen, of Santa Fe, N.M., he is survived by his wife, the former Alice Nielsen, whom he married in 1946; another son, Hans Peter, who lives near Groton, Conn.; a daughter, Kristina Ann Way of Manchester, Mich.; his father, John A. C. of Chelsea, Mich.; a brother, Thomas, who lives near Port Huron, a sister, Carol Whitehead of Okemos, Mich., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Goals Collide in Cable TV Rate Plan

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
As the newest Federal effort to reduce cable television prices nominally takes effect this week, Government regulators are struggling to navigate between two rather contradictory goals: bringing lower prices to consumers and encouraging a cornucopia of new electronic services.
Most consumers will not see any change on their bills until July, because so great is the uncertainty about the new rules that the Federal Communications Commission has given cable companies two months to figure out the regulations and reset their prices. 
 For the moment, the most notable change is the growing confusion about what cable rates will be. The rules are supposed to cut monthly cable bills as much as 17 percent, and most experts say they are confident that prices for many cable television services will decline. But the average bill is likely to drop much less than 17 percent, they say, and some bills may well go up.
"It's not really math as I knew it," said Barry Rosenblum, president of Time Warner Cable of New York City. "It's so complicated that you can't pick a single factor that gives you an indication of what the rates will be. Until you have every piece of the puzzle, you can't know what the answer will be."
 
'Find the Right Balance'
 In the meantime, the F.C.C. is issuing a steady stream of "clarifications" about particular issues, and top officials are meeting with cable industry executives to discuss policy changes that would offer more incentive to invest in new channels and technology.
"We have to find the right balance," Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, said. "We want to encourage new channels but also make sure that basic and enhanced service is not priced at an unreasonably high level."
The uncertainty partly reflects the inherent difficulty of regulating cable television prices, a problem that has bedeviled regulators for almost two years. An initial attempt at rate regulation, adopted in April 1993, led to unexpected price increases for many customers and was overhauled on Feb. 22.
But the difficulties also result from the competing goals at work. Mr. Hundt, a soul mate of Vice President Al Gore and an enthusiastic proponent of the so-called information highway, had come under a barrage of industry criticism for imposing lower prices at the expense of future networks.
Since the new rules were adopted, several big cable and telephone companies have called off proposed alliances, saying the regulations would reduce the capital available for investment in advanced networks. The biggest of those deals would have been a merger between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc.
Last week, the National Cable Television Association challenged the new regulations in the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, although the action does not stop the rules from taking effect.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hundt and senior commission lawyers have been looking for ways to refine the rules. They have been listening to cable executives and weighing different proposals to encourage investment in new network capacity and extra cable channels.
 
Reductions, With Exceptions
 Under the new rules, cable companies are generally required to reduce the prices for all but their premium and pay-per-view channels by 17 percent from their levels in September 1992, when Congress passed the law imposing cable television regulation.
But that general reduction does not affect several components of an average monthly bill, including the franchise fees that cable operators pay to municipalities or the price for premium channels and pay-per-view programs sold on an individual basis.
In addition, the precise prices will be determined by formulas that weigh factors like the number of channels on a system and even the wealth of the city being served. Cable companies can also raise prices to account for inflation. While the companies will be responsible for making these calculations, the F.C.C. has added dozens of employees to oversee the process and to check that the formulas are followed.
The regulations also include a general framework for encouraging new services. For example, a cable operator that adds channels to its basic package of programming can increase the price of that package by the cost of that service and an additional markup of 7.5 percent.
But nothing in cable television regulation is ever simple. Companies like Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable television company, argue that they need more than a 7.5 percent profit margin on new channels before they will have any motivation to add them to their lineups of basic service.
Companies that produce programming have argued that they often choose to charge cable operators as little as possible, hoping to gain more viewers and earn their real money on advertising. Under that kind of pricing, the cable operators have told commission officials they have little incentive to add channels because they will reap only an extra penny or two for each subscriber each month.
F.C.C. officials say they understand the industry concern, but they are torn. They do not want to give cable operators the chance to raise prices significantly by adding many services that customers do not want.
 
A la Carte Confusion
 The commission is also struggling to define the concept of premium or "a la carte" services, which are supposed to be free from price regulation. Congress included that provision on the theory that customers do not need rate protection for services they are not required to buy as part of a basic package.
But many cable systems responded to reregulation by switching what had been basic channels into the "a la carte" category, and they charged higher rates if the channels were selected individually rather than ordered as the package they had constituted as part of the basic service. The regulators are now trying to determine which services give consumers a real choice and which do not.
Some industry experts are skeptical that the commission's balancing act will be successful. "We understand their intentions, but their implementation went way overboard," said John Reidy, a cable industry analyst at Smith Barney Shearson. "The commission has forced these guys by saying 'You've got to invest to grow but you really don't know what the return is going to be.' "
Robert Thomson, a senior vice president at Tele-Communications, said the actual incentives would not be known until the commission clarified its policy considerably. "The upgrade incentives have to be genuine and they have to take full account of the risk associated with this project," he said.

HEADLINE: Big Insurers In Struggle Over Ratings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
A triple-A rating is a valuable commodity in the insurance world, valuable enough that some New York insurers that have it are trying to keep the coveted rating to themselves.
The New York Life Insurance Company and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, both rated AAA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, have so far managed to prevent a vote on a New York State Senate bill that would allow companies that specialize in insuring municipal bonds to also insure the investment contracts that insurers sell to pension funds. 
 Because the bond insurance companies are rated triple-A, the investment contracts they insure would automatically carry that rating, too, even if the insurance company that issued the investment contract had a lower rating, as most do. Ratings measure an insurance company's ability to pay its obligations.
Michael A. Zarcone, a specialist in government affairs for Metropolitan Life, said the availability of insurance for investment contracts would hurt insurers "by creating an image of weakness, that insurance is needed on top of the guarantee already provided by the insurance company."
 
A Vote Delayed
 Supporters of the bill had expected a vote in the Senate on Friday. But New York Life and Metropolitan Life, with the support of the Life Insurance Council of New York and the trade group representing life insurance agents, have won a delay.
The supporters of the bill include bond insurance companies led by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, some companies that buy investment contracts from insurance companies, and a few insurance companies that would like to buy the insurance to make their investment contracts rated triple-A.
Greg Serio, counsel to Senator Guy J. Velella, Republican of the Bronx, chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee and sponsor of the bill, said a vote on the bill was not likely for several weeks. "We want to do something to enhance the environment for insurance companies in New York, but we want to do it without hurting them in some other way," he said, noting that insurers' investment contracts had lost ground to other investments.
The contracts, called GIC's, for guaranteed investment contracts, are a promise by an insurance company to pay a specific interest rate for a certain period of time, and are widely bought by pension funds. Because the promise to pay interest is only as good as the company that makes it, large insurance companies with triple-A ratings have long enjoyed a significant advantage.
 
More Concern About Risk
 The importance of a top-notch credit rating has grown even more important in recent years, after the collapse of Executive Life in California and Mutual Benefit Life in New Jersey.
"After the failure of those two companies, pension plan sponsors became much more concerned about the default risk on guaranteed investment contracts," said Larry Mylnechuk, executive director of the Guaranteed Investment Contract Association, a trade group representing the buyers and issuers of the investment contracts. "There are a lot of major pension plan sponsors who would very much like to see the bill pass."
Kenneth L. Walker, an expert in investment contracts and president of T. Rowe Price Stable Asset Management, based in Baltimore, said the buyers of the contracts would benefit if the introduction of insurance increased the number of highly rated contracts available and allowed buyers of the contracts to diversify their investments more broadly.
A triple-A rating "is very important to investors," he said, adding that many pension funds "would be willing to pay, to accept a slightly lower yield, in order to get the triple-A quality."
 
GIC Competition
 The number of insurance companies with triple-A ratings has been shrinking, leaving Metropolitan Life and New York Life as the two largest insurance companies that are active sellers of investment contracts and have triple-A ratings.
Competition for the GIC's has come in recent years from an arrangement called a synthetic GIC, in which pension funds arrange for another company, often a bank, to guarantee the value of a pool of securities owned by the pension fund as pensioners withdraw money from the savings plan. The growth of synthetic GIC's has been rapid, and in the first half of 1993 they accounted for about 18 percent of the GIC market, compared with 7.5 percent in 1992.
In a letter to Mr. Velella supporting the bill, Deborah R. Iwig, vice president for retirement benefits at the Marriott Corporation in Washington, said many employees selected investment contracts for their retirement savings because they were low risk. The availability of insurance on the contracts would help keep risk low, she said.
 
'A Point of Saturation'
 Despite the support for the bill from investors and even a few insurance companies outside New York, including SunAmerica Life in Los Angeles and the Capital Holding Corporation in Louisville, Ky., Peter Flanagan, president of the Life Insurance Council, a trade group, said last week that there was no demand for the product from insurance companies or investors.
"The municipal bond insurers have reached a point of saturation in that market and now they are looking for a new product," Mr. Flanagan said. He added that the investment contracts they wanted to insure were beyond the expertise of bond insurers.
James E. Malling, executive vice president of Municipal Bond Investors, based in Armonk, N.Y., said his company was looking for new lines of business, but he insisted that it was capable of understanding the risks of insurance companies and their investment contracts.
"What we really have here is a case of two giant companies, Metropolitan Life and New York Life, which are extremely powerful in New York and are using their lobbying skills to prevent competition," Mr. Malling said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
ABC's ownership of big slices of its fall lineup is raising eyebrows in Hollywood studios.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

 BODY:
ABC fired the first shots in the annual onslaught of new prime-time television lineups last week -- and the shots hit home among many studio executives in Hollywood.
It wasn't that ABC was going for a bold new trend in programming. Far from it. The "family" network, as ABC has consciously styled itself, added six programs for the fall, and all but one center on family life. ABC now crowds more families onto its property than Disney World. 
 A similar pattern is found in the network's business plan. When it comes to ownership of shows on its prime-time schedule, ABC has clearly decided to keep it in the family.
The network has taken a financial stake in all but one of the six new shows on its docket. And even before the studios got a look at the other networks' schedules, the ABC announcement set off alarms in some executive suites.
"Our worst fears are coming true," said one senior studio executive. "Go past the new shows. Look at all the news and sports shows. It's just a huge chunk of the schedule."
ABC already owned the three news magazines it had on the air and the two hours of prime time occupied each week by "Monday Night Football," and it held a stake in three entertainment series: "America's Funniest Home Videos," "The Commish" and "Thunder Alley." If you throw out the four hours a week of movies, many of which are produced by ABC Productions, ABC has a financial interest in 10.5 hours of programs, more than half of the prime-time hours it will broadcast this fall.
The total offers clear evidence of how the end of the television industry's financial interest and syndication rules, struck down by the Federal Communications Commission last year, has changed the prime-time landscape. Five years ago, when the networks' ownership stakes in programming were severely limited, ABC's self-owned total in prime time was just four hours, consisting of "Monday Night Football" and two news magazines.
During a long fight with the networks over the rules, the studios endlessly argued that if the networks were freed to take pieces of the programs they broadcast, the studios would be all but forced to take on the networks as partners. Looking at the new ABC schedule -- as well as the NBC schedule announced on Friday -- some studio executives ruefully concluded the worst. NBC added three new network-owned shows to its schedule, bringing its total to three hours of prime time.
The networks are "proving us right," said the senior studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "And they're proving why two studios decided to start their own networks."
Both Paramount and Warner Brothers, which have churned out hundreds of series over the years, have announced plans to start networks. Warner explicitly cited its fear of losing available time periods to network-owned shows as one reason it needed a national distribution system for its own programs.
But David Westin, the president of production for ABC, dismissed the complaints of the studios. "Part of it is fear and part of it is jealousy," he said. "The flip side to their argument is that once they get their networks up and running, when they bring us a program the question will be: Are we getting their show because they don't want it for their own networks?"
For a television series, the economics works like this: a production entity -- whether a studio, network or independent production company -- backs the program by covering its weekly deficit. Typically, a half-hour comedy costs $450,000 an episode to produce. But the network license fee -- its payment to the studio for the privilege of showing the program -- is typically not more than $350,000. The production entity makes up the deficit in the hope that the program becomes a hit and its reruns can be sold in syndication for many millions of dollars. This is known as back-end profit.
Indeed, this system has produced some bonanzas for studios. Castle Rock, which owns "Seinfeld," stands to make several hundred million dollars in syndication revenues. It was this kind of windfall that the networks wanted when they pushed for an end to the syndication rules.
But Mr. Westin of ABC said the level of investment required for a series has become so great that many producers and even studios are looking for partners to share the risk. He said Universal Studios came to him in January with a plan for large-scale joint ventures of programs. He resisted, saying he would prefer deals on a show-by-show basis.
As it turned out, ABC made deals with Universal for two programs, "Blue Skies," which is on the fall schedule, and "Extreme," which is likely to show up later in the season. "We agreed to pay half the deficit," Mr. Westin said. "Then we split the back-end profits. I think you've been seeing, even with theatrical movies, that the studios have begun giving up some of the back end to get someone to share the upfront costs."
A spokesman for Universal, Robert Krutchfield, said, "This deal proves the farmers and the cowboys can get along."
For producers, as opposed to studios, the arrangements do not make too much difference, as long as their costs are paid. Indeed, some producers clearly have no concern about working directly with a network. Matt Williams, executive producer of ABC's "Home Improvement," which is owned by Walt Disney Studios, left the studio to become a partner with ABC on his next series, "Thunder Alley."
"I found that I really like working with the people at ABC," he said.
Other producers argue that an association with a network can also be beneficial when a network is making a tough decision on a series: if a network has a financial stake in a series, it is more likely to give the program the longest look possible.
Mr. Westin said ABC had proved that it would not hesitate to cancel a series it owned if the series was failing. "It's obviously not in our interest to keep a show on that isn't working," he said, citing examples like "Joe's Life" from last season.
But ABC does not deny that it has an overall strategy based on getting a piece of more and more of the programs on its schedule. Mr. Westin said that the chairman of Capital Cities/ABC, Thomas S. Murphy, and the former president and chief executive, Daniel B. Burke, "have been saying for years that the future of our business is in having more financial interest in our schedule."
"It shouldn't surprise anybody that we're trying to do it," Mr. Westin said.

HEADLINE: Extricate Foreign Aid From the Mire

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has proposed a long-overdue revamping of the legal framework for foreign aid that begins to address today's needs. But the legislation is mired in a backlog of bills in the Senate. It will take a firm push from President Clinton and George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, to enact it this year.
The current law governing foreign aid dates back to 1961, when the crisis over Berlin was threatening to heat up the cold war. Much of the aid was then directed at shoring up outmoded military alliances, often with unsavory regimes. 
 The Administration's bill, by addressing the causes of global insecurity, such as poverty, hunger, overpopulation, environmental degradation, dictatorial regimes and failed states, has much to recommend it. It sets clear goals and begins to redirect aid to approaches that show more promise of attaining those goals.
The Administration is seeking $20.9 billion in foreign aid. It wants to use $2.9 billion of that sum, a 3 percent increase from last year, to promote transitions to democracy in the former Soviet bloc countries. It is requesting $6.4 billion, up 4 percent from last year, to curb arms proliferation in the former Soviet Union and cover the U.S. contribution to peacekeeping in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Funding for agricultural aid in the form of surplus food, which often had the perverse effect of depressing agricultural production in the recipient countries, is trimmed by 21 percent.
Perhaps the most marked shift in resources is the most farsighted -- the 14 percent increase in funds for sustainable development. Included in the $5 billion request is small but significant support for programs, many of them run by indigenous non-governmental organizations, to nurture economic development, stabilize population growth, protect the environment and promote broader participation in development projects.
One such program tries to educate and empower women, an essential step in reducing birth rates and stimulating economic growth in many traditional societies. Another makes mini-loans at market rates to small farmers and entrepreneurs who cannot get bank credit. Such programs may do more to foster development, at less cost, than some large-scale government projects.
There is a 35 percent increase in the U.S. share of support for multilateral development banks, some of it to cover arrears. But Congress could do more to encourage the largest of these lending institutions, such as the World Bank, to follow the lead of the smaller regional banks and support programs that are socially and politically sustainable and focus on alleviating poverty.
Foreign aid has few enthusiasts in Congress, and some of the misgivings about lax management and misplaced priorities are well founded. But even skeptics recognize that carefully targeted aid can increase the well-being of billions of people, perhaps defusing violent explosions, like those in Rwanda and Somalia, that end up costing the world more. Moreover, nearly four out of five people live in the developing world. As their levels of income and education rise, they will buy more of what America has to sell.
The Administration has crafted a sound new approach to foreign aid. But it will not begin to work unless Congress is persuaded to act. Extricating the bill is a job for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mitchell.

HEADLINE: Make Haiti's Thugs Tremble

BYLINE: By John Kerry; John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Haiti's military rulers continue to thumb their noses at the United States and the rest of the world. Since the ouster of President Jean-Bertrande Aristide in September 1991, the international community has consistently tried to pressure the junta to step aside, but nothing has worked -- not diplomacy, not tighter sanctions, not a partial naval embargo. By tolerating their defiance and unrelenting brutality, we have empowered Haiti's military thugs.
As a result, our credibility as a world leader is at stake. Haiti's military leaders must now be put on notice that we're prepared to take all steps necessary to restore democracy and prove to all renegade elements that we mean what we say. We need to pursue an aggressive diplomatic course, to escalate sanctions and to impose a total naval blockade if necessary. But if those don't work, we must be willing to seek international approval to use military force. 
 My clear first choice is to pursue an aggressive diplomatic course of multilateral negotiations aimed at forcing the military leaders out within a short time. But precisely because there was no believable threat of force, our efforts have failed.
Opponents of force argue that President Aristide is so flawed that he does not deserve our help, that an invasion would be bloody and costly and could involve us in a long-term military quagmire. But the issue is not simply the return of an individual. It is the restoration of the democratic process in Haiti. Father Aristide may not be perfect (what elected leader is?), but we have never discarded whole democracies because of an individual leader. Moreover, he has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise, agreeing to share power with a broad-based coalition with safeguards for everyone's rights. Those assurances could be bolstered by international peacekeepers.
There is every reason to think an international invasion would succeed. Haiti's 7,000-man military is hardly a formidable opponent. It is an undisciplined collection of gun-wielding bullies with little training or experience other than terrorizing poor, unarmed civilians. In Iraq, we decimated the world's fifth-largest army in a couple of months. In Grenada and Panama, outlaw regimes were ousted in a matter of days. A show of determined resolve from a U.S.-led international force of professional soldiers, backed up with sufficient air power, could quickly subdue the Haitian military.
Haitian history is filled with coups and civil wars. There are deep-seated hatreds between the small, wealthy, ruling mulatto elite, which is in league with the military, and the poor, largely uneducated masses, which make up 90 percent of the population. That enmity is born of decades of repressive rule and irresponsible social policy.
The division is complicated by the presence of "attaches," the plainclothes military thugs who have replaced the hated Tonton Macoutes of the Duvalier regime. These attaches come from the masses but do the bidding of the elite. In a culture where revenge and retribution have played such prominent roles, healing the hatreds will not come easily.
But the prospect of a Vietnam-like quagmire can be avoided by guaranteeing at the outset that military action will under no circumstances lead to a U.S. occupation of Haiti. Any intervention should be followed with the immediate insertion of a large international peacekeeping force. The presence of a neutral, civilized power will allow Haiti to rebuild its political institutions, its schools and its health system, and provide some cooling-off time. This could be accomplished along the lines contemplated in the July 1993 accord at Governor's Island, which was supposed to have led to the return of Father Aristide.
Some will argue that the last time we went into Haiti, we stayed 19 years. But that invasion was in 1915 -- an age of colonialism that has long since been repudiated. In 1994, we would be going to wrest the nation from the grip of a tiny elite and return it to the vast majority of Haitians. The difference between occupation and liberation is dramatic.
Some argue that intervening in Haiti is not worth the loss of an American life. We should remember that American soldiers were at risk when we intervened in Grenada, Panama and Iraq. Those who supported Presidents Bush and Reagan ought to ask themselves why the Haitian situation is different. Is it simply that the President is of a different political party? What other facts are different?
Every individual reason given for those previous interventions is present in the plural in Haiti -- to protect innocent lives, to end chaos, to restore order, to root out drug traffickers. Most important, in Haiti, we would be restoring a stolen democracy, human dignity and hope to a country's brutalized masses.
In the absence of clear and present danger, the United States should not use force unilaterally. If ultimately needed, the force should be similar to the international one used in the Persian Gulf. It should consist of troops from the "four friends" -- the United States, France, Canada and Venezuela -- and from other nations in the region. The military power should be massive, to minimize casualties, and the intervention should be short. Granted, it will take leadership and persuasive power to build the coalition. But the United States succeeded in both regards in Grenada, Panama and Iraq, and there's no reason it can't accomplish the same for Haiti.
Some of those governments have expressed reluctance to commit to a military solution before the current diplomatic strategy has time to mature. They miss the point. Failure to threaten to use force now would significantly increase the probability that diplomacy will fail. In the end, we'd wind up where we are today: unprepared and with a weak hand.
If ultimately needed, any intervention should use vast military power to minimize casualties and the time commitment. Once the coup leaders were ousted and the allied forces replaced by peacekeepers under the United Nations, the technical assistance and financial aid promised in the Governor's Island accord should be expanded and undertaken to insure the restoration of democracy.
No one should ever casually entertain the use of military power. Certainly I do not; it is a most serious proposition. But it is imperative that we and other nations in the hemisphere put the option on the table now. It is the best means to avoid a unilateral response under emergency conditions later on. It's also the best means of putting teeth in our diplomacy now.
The people of Haiti cannot restore democracy -- cannot overthrow a drug-running, gun-wielding military regime -- by themselves. They need our help. If our stated goal of restoring democracy is real, if our concern for the Haitian people is genuine, if our credibility as a world leader is important, then we must confront the crisis in Haiti with the will to act.

HEADLINE: Cuban-Americans Open a Dialogue With Cuba;
In Tourism's Wake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A two-week news-gathering tour of Cuba last month left us deeply ashamed of the deprivations our country's punitive trade embargo is imposing on an innocent people. 
 Cubans place top priority on health and education. We were impressed by the availability and high quality of their hospitals, clinics, day-care centers, schools, summer camps, and centers for the elderly. They have drastically lowered infant and maternal mortality, increased literacy and extended the life span of their people. Health care, from family doctors to highly trained specialists, is freely available to all.
However, serious shortages of food, medicine, fuel, school supplies and factory parts are severely affecting the quality of life and causing suffering. In lieu of a vanishing supply of medicines, Cuba is turning to "green medicine," that is, natural remedies. Food is severely rationed, with only very young children still receiving a daily ration of milk. Farm children eat better, but lack shoes and adequate clothing. Urban families without access to tourist dollars lack adequate nutrition.
Cuba does not have problems of drugs or street violence, but increased tourist trade has led to a resurgence of prostitution, thievery and begging. Children leave school to beg from tourists.
Under the Torricelli Act, the United States prohibits selling even medicines to Cuba. We have alienated our trading partners and been humiliated at the United Nations because of the far-reaching terms of this act, which also punishes other countries that trade with Cuba. The embargo only caters to Jorge Mas Canosa's organization of right-wing Cuban-Americans, eager to return and to reclaim power. Congress and the Clinton Administration should immediately end it.

HEADLINE: New York Can't Afford To Lose Mostly Mozart

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A May 4 news article warns that New York City might soon see the end of a remarkable musical tradition. For 27 years Lincoln Center has been host to the Mostly Mozart Festival, one of the most popular presentations of classical music anywhere. As you note, the festival, "with its informal character and moderate ticket prices has become a pioneering example of successful musical programming." People come, enjoy the music and return year after year. 
 The festival is also an economic success for our city. In addition to musicians' jobs, it means hotel rooms are filled, restaurants are busy, taxis and public transit are used, and all this in the summer, when many other musical venues are dark.
The end of Mostly Mozart would be a cultural and economic loss to our city. We hope that fans of the festival, and those who understand the increasing importance of music to the economic life of our city, will do all they can to allow the festival to continue.

HEADLINE: Stowaways, Seeking Liberty, Are Caught in Limbo of Law

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 16

 BODY:
They were so desperate to reach the United States that they had themselves sealed into huge metal cargo containers, where they tossed about for more than a week as they were borne across the Atlantic by a 43,000-ton freighter named the Innovation.
But when the 20 or so Romanian stowaways landed in Boston harbor last month, their ordeal was not over. Shackled by the shipping company, they were banished to a hotel near Newark International Airport to await proceedings on their requests for asylum. And that is where most of them remained today -- still in chains because of an anomaly in Federal law that forces private transportation companies into the expensive and unwanted role of jailers, largely free of restrictions on how they treat their prisoners. 
 The Innovation's owner, Sea-Land Service Inc., said it is spending as much as $60,000 a week to keep the Romanians under heavy guard at the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel here. Under the Federal law, shipping and airline companies are responsible for the custody of stowaways, a regulation meant to insure the companies' vigilance in preventing stowaways.
"We are doing the best we can to see that they are treated nicely, but we are in a kind of a tough spot," said Christopher L. Koch, Sea-Land senior vice president. "The law says we have to keep them, and we get fined if we lose them. And frankly, we don't know who these people are, so we have to take our custodial responsibility seriously. What if we got some nutbag?"
The Immigration and Naturalization Service said it knew about the plight of the Romanians, who are being kept in leg shackles except when they shower and who are rarely allowed to leave their rooms. But the service said that no Federal regulations govern how a private company may detain stowaways, so there was almost nothing it could do.
"The I.N.S. does not have any legal responsibility as far as monitoring how these people are being held," said Duke Austin, the agency's senior spokesman in Washington. The Romanians' situation was first reported by The Journal of Commerce.
The practice is sowing concern among legal experts and Congress, which may hold hearings this summer on setting standards for detaining stowaways, who seem to be trying to enter the United States in growing numbers, driven by political turmoil and economic hardship.
 
Tough Measures
 The transportation companies say their legal bind compels them to take often draconian measures to avoid penalties or other liability. Sea-Land has already paid $9,000 in fines because three of the Romanians escaped through a bathroom window at another Newark hotel a few weeks ago, shortly before the stowaways were moved to the Howard Johnson hotel.
Tom Fitzhugh, executive director of the Maritime Security Council, a trade group, said that 3,000 to 5,000 stowaways tried to enter the United States last year on ships. The immigration agency's estimate is more conservative, about 830 people, probably because it counts mainly those who also applied for political asylum.
Those figures do not include people who arrived on airlines. The air carriers have less of a problem with stowaways than with passengers who were properly processed at foreign airports but then destroy their passports and other documents in flight and request asylum upon landing in the United States.
The Air Transport Association, a trade group, sued the Federal Government in 1992, maintaining that the immigration agency, not the airlines, should detain such people and pay the cost with proceeds from a tax on tickets first levied in the mid-1980's. Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the association, said the two sides were seeking a settlement under which the Government would assume some responsibility. But the case would not appear to affect ship stowaways.
 
Changing the Law
 Some advocates for immigrants' rights say Congress should change the law to relieve companies like Sea-Land of the burden. As one possibility, the Government could take custody of stowaways awaiting asylum proceedings and then bill the ship's owner for the cost.
The stowaways might be housed in Federal detention centers, where their treatment would be similar to that accorded to people caught coming into the country on vessels used specifically for smuggling like the Golden Venture, which ran aground off Queens last year.
"We are particularly troubled that there are no standards, and there is tremendous potential for abuse," said Stephanie Marks, coordinator of the asylum program at the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York City-based advocacy group.
"The quality of the custody situation depends to a large extent on which private security company is hired," she said. "Some have been decent, some are really bad. Sometimes you have babies and small children in detention. I have personally taken diapers and baby Tylenol to families when private security companies were not providing adequate supplies."
Sea-Land, a subsidiary of the CSX Corporation and one of the world's largest shipping companies, declined to allow a reporter to visit the Romanians, who were taken to Newark to be near the company's headquarters. Others who have spoken to them differed about their treatment.
 
Abuses Alleged
 Frank Schorn, a lawyer from the New York Association of New Americans, a nonprofit agency for immigrants, has accused guards from the Lansdell Protective Agency of Newark of abusing some of the Romanians by hitting them and preventing them from making phone calls. Mr. Schorn represents some of the stowaways in asylum proceedings.
Officials from the Romanian Consulate in New York said they were concerned but that the Romanians, nearly all of them men, appeared healthy. At the hotel, a Lansdell representative declined to comment, saying "too much has been made of this."
The Romanians apparently spend their days watching television in their rooms on the hotel's third floor. Sea-Land takes them food brought from outside. The stowaways cannot go outdoors.
Not all the Romanians came in on the Innovation, but all were apparently assisted by the same criminal ring. They were bolted into the 20-foot-long cargo containers near the port of Le Havre, France, and given food, water, clothing and tools -- chisels, hacksaws and drills -- to cut their way out upon arrival.
The stowaways generally choose ships from major companies, knowing that smaller outfits might treat them harshly because the owners do not want to pay for their custody.

HEADLINE: ACCORD OPENS WAY FOR ABORTION PILL IN U.S. IN 2 YEARS

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
After sustained political pressure from the Clinton Administration, the French manufacturer of the controversial abortion pill RU-486 today announced an agreement that is expected to pave the way for the pill to be available to American women by 1996.
The agreement calls for the manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, to turn over the pill's patent rights and all technology, free, to the Population Council, a nonprofit contraceptive research organization in New York. The council plans to find an American company to produce the pill, which can be used within seven weeks of conception to end a pregnancy; the group will also conduct clinical trials with 2,000 American women this fall. 
 In exchange for giving up its patent rights, the French company rids itself of product liability claims and, it hopes, the threat by anti-abortion organizations to boycott other products made by its parent company. Those threats had kept Roussel Uclaf from marketing the pill in the United States, though it has been available in France, Britain and Sweden.
One anti-abortion group repeated that threat today, saying it would boycott whatever American company is chosen to make and market the pill.
The Population Council will begin clinical trials in 10 to 12 American cities this fall, using pills donated by Roussel Uclaf, because it anticipates that choosing an American manufacturer and gearing up an assembly line will take longer. The trials will be the first time RU-486 will be used on a significant scale in the United States; a small trial was conducted in California in the 1980's.
The Deputy Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Mary Pendergast, said today that the Food and Drug Administration was hoping to complete the review of RU-486 "within six months."
"The part that will take longest," Ms. Pendergast said, "is finding a company that can manufacture the drug and getting them up to speed on the actual manufacturing." She added, "That might take longer than either the clinical trial or F.D.A. approval."
Abortions induced by RU-486 are painful because expelling the embryo can take several days. The procedure typically requires a women to visit a doctor three to four times. While the procedure can be done on an out-patient basis, the woman must remain within easy access of a hospital and must be examined by a doctor several days after her abortion in case of complications. [Story, page A16.]
In about one half of 1 percent of the cases so far, patients have had bleeding more severe than that of a heavy menstrual period. About 1 in 500 women need a transfusion after taking the pill.
RU-486 was first made available in France in 1989, and since then, 150,000 to 200,000 women have taken it in Europe. A company in China is producing a similar drug, which 10,000 to 20,000 Chinese have used.
Negotiations between Roussel Uclaf and the Population Council were under way for more than a year, and a pact was signed late Sunday.
On April 20, in a private meeting with company executives, Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of Food Drugs, and Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, set a May 15 deadline for concluding the negotiations.
Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has long championed the use of RU-486 in this country, threatened that if an agreement was not reached the United States might consider the extraordinary step of seizing the patent rights.
 
Praise and Condemnation
 Leaders of abortion-rights groups hailed the agreement. "The Clinton Administration has helped end the tyranny of anti-choice extremists who for too long have held science hostage to their religious and ideological views," said Marcy Wilder, legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
But opponents of abortion criticized the pact, with the American Life League calling the pill a "human pesticide." The Family Research Council warned that any company making the pill would be subject to boycotts and other economic attacks.
Nearly 1.6 million abortions are performed annually in the United States. Sandra Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Population Council, estimated that RU-486 might now be used instead of 25 percent to 40 percent of them.
The Population Council plans to begin clinical trials by having doctors ask women who are already seeking surgical abortions whether they want to try the pill instead. In France the pill is available to women who have been pregnant for no more than 49 days; in England, it is available to women who have been pregnant for no more than 63 days. A spokeswoman for the council said the American trials might use the 63-day period.
 
Interest in Manufacture
 Several small American companies have expressed interest in manufacturing RU-486, council officials said, adding that those companies had limited product lines that would be vulnerable to boycotts.
Barbara Ryan, a drug securities analyst in New York with Alex. Brown & Sons, said: "It is obviously a politically loaded product. The issue for the drug companies is the publicity and potential damage to their reputations. People who feel vehemently opposed to abortions of any kind will boycott the company that markets the drug."
The Population Council will assume liability claims for the trials. Once it picks a manufacturer, that company will assume the standard corporate liability.
While the Reagan and Bush Administrations were hostile to marketing RU-486 here, the Clinton Administration from the beginning sought its entry into the United States.
So closely was the Administration tied to the drug that when it appeared at one point that a deal was falling apart, there was speculation that Roussel Uclaf's parent company, Hoechst A.G. of Germany, was trying to stall the negotiations in the hope that Mr. Clinton would not be re-elected in 1996.
"A lot of people thought that Hoechst was thinking that if they could string it out another two years, they wouldn't have this problem anymore," an aide to one of the principals said today
The F.D.A. and Dr. Shalala contacted Roussel Uclaf officials in early 1993, leading to the April 1993 announcement by Dr. Kessler that the company would license the Population Council to bring RU-486 to the United States.
 
Snags in Negotiations
 Between April 1993 and last Sunday, the negotiations almost collapsed several times, snagged by various economic, political and legal considerations. Details of the final agreement were not fully disclosed.
"There was a whole range of issues," Ms. Waldman said. "It wasn't just the business and money stuff, but they really wanted to make sure that this pill, this tablet, is used properly, and that was one of their primary concerns. They wanted to make sure that the distribution was controlled and regulated so it couldn't be counterfeited."
Moreover, the aide to one of the principals said, Hoechst was under heavy pressure from Pope John Paul II to halt use of the drug. The aide said that one recent meeting between Hoechst officials and Clinton Administration officials was devoted almost entirely to discussions of the religious pressures being exerted on the company, whose leading officers are Roman Catholic.
"The company was worried that whatever it did here would be a model for the rest of the world," the aide said, "and it would have to deal with the Pope and countries that are much more Catholic than ours."

More than half the states have authorized their local governments to adopt this approach, in which a municipality prohibits the shipping of any solid waste that has not passed through the chosen plant. 
 Laws controlling the flow of garbage assure the economic viability of these expensive sorting and recycling plants by guaranteeing that they will have the business they were built for and will generate the revenue needed to pay off the billions of dollars in municipal bonds that cities have issued to finance the plants' construction.
The 6-to-3 ruling today, in a case from Rockland County, N.Y., held that flow control laws interfere with interstate commerce by permitting a local government to "hoard a local resource" and exclude others, even private haulers, from the interstate business of trash collection and disposal.
The decision overturned a 1992 ruling by a mid-level state appeals court. The lower court had upheld the Town of Clarkstown's flow control law against a challenge from a competing processor that tried to bypass the town's collection plant by shipping waste out of state at lower cost to its customers.
Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said a town could subsidize waste treatment through taxes or bonds, but not by capturing the market through "discriminatory regulation."
Clarkstown's arrangement is one of several common variants of the flow control approach. In 1990 the town, under pressure from New York State to close a substandard landfill and find a new way to handle its solid waste, contracted with a private company, Clarkstown Recycling Inc., to build a transfer station at which all trash collected in the town would be sorted and shipped to an appropriate destination -- either a recycling plant, incinerator or landfill.
Under the contract, the town guaranteed the contractor that the station would handle at least 120,000 tons of waste a year for five years at a fee of $81 a ton, with the town to make up any deficit. As an integral part of the arrangement, the town passed its flow control ordinance, Local Law 9. The contract provided that the cost of the $1.4 million station would be amortized with a profit in five years, and the contractor would then sell the transfer station to the town for $1.
Other municipalities have taken a different approach, issuing revenue bonds to pay for construction.
Murray N. Jacobson, Clarkstown's town attorney, said today that he could not yet assess the impact of the ruling because it was not clear how much trash the station would handle without flow control. The town's motive for entering into the arrangement in the first place, he said, was to save money for the taxpayers.
 
Enforcement Problems
 The case that the Court decided today, C. & A. Carbone Inc. v. Clarkstown, No. 92-1402, began in 1991 when the town tried to enforce its flow control law. The town sued Carbone, which operates a recycling plant in Clarkstown, after a truck containing 23 bales of solid waste traveling from the Carbone plant to an Indiana landfill hit an overpass on the Palisades Interstate Parkway. Carbone, which charged $71 a ton for the use of its plant, compared with the $81-a-ton rate for the new transfer station, was bypassing the station and shipping its customers' waste out of state.
In its defense, the company challenged the constitutionality of the flow control law. But two New York courts, the State Supreme Court in Rockland County and the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, upheld the law and ordered Carbone to comply with it. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court.
The case attracted great interest from the solid waste industry and its major industrial customers, as well as from state and local governments.
The industry groups argued that flow control laws are inefficient and anti-competitive, in effect imposing a hidden business tax through higher rates that subsidize favored plants.
 
Potential Financial Stakes
 Clarkstown and the other governments were supported by bond lawyers and investment houses. The National Association of Bond Lawyers said state and local jurisdictions had issued more than $5 billion in trash revenue bonds in the last two years.
Twenty-seven states, including Connecticut and New Jersey as well as New York, have passed laws authorizing their local governments to adopt flow control policies.
But Congress has not addressed the question, a fact that was central to the Supreme Court's analysis today. Justice Kennedy's opinion cited the Court's commerce clause interpretations dating to the 1890's that prohibit economic protectionism on the part of state and local governments. The regulation of interstate commerce is a power given exclusively to Congress by the Constitution.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor observed that Congress could authorize states to permit flow control legislation. "We will, of course, defer to that legislative judgment," she said.
In addition to recourse to Congress, the decision today left states and local governments with another potential way to avoid a severe impact from the ruling. Under the majority's reasoning, municipalities can keep their waste treatment plants viable by subsidizing their operations so that their fees, instead of being higher than the private sector's, are lower and can attract business without the need for flow control.
Michael D. Diederich Jr., an environmental lawyer who filed a brief in the case for Rockland County, said this element of the decision saved the ruling from being a "catastrophe" for local governments. Under flow control, residents subsidize the plants and services through the higher fees; a direct taxpayer subsidy should make little difference, he said.
Justice Kennedy's opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice O'Connor, who filed her own opinion supporting the judgment, did not join the majority opinion.
Justice David H. Souter filed a dissenting opinion that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun joined.
Justice Souter said the commerce clause precedents did not require invalidating the Clarkstown ordinance because it was not intended to favor local businesses, but rather to insure "that the job gets done." In this respect, he said, it was "unlike anything this Court has ever invalidated."

HEADLINE: Russian Rockets Finding Eager Customers in West

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In a nation brimming with advanced technology but sorely lacking in business acumen, one of the old Soviet Union's most impressive legacies, its space program, is shaping up to be one of the new Russia's rare economic success stories.
Unquestioned in their technological prowess, Russia's rocket and satellite makers and other space-oriented enterprises have also displayed a surprisingly deft capitalist touch in forging ties with Western partners and finding new markets for their products around the world. 
 During the last several years they have won orders valued at more than $1 billion from Western companies and governments, including contracts for launching rockets for Iridium, the global telephone system being set up by Motorola; satellite propulsion systems in a joint venture with the Loral Corporation, and research and development programs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as for European space agencies and aerospace companies.
"The market is the future and we have to learn to work in it," said Aleksandr I. Medvedchikov, the Russian Space Agency's deputy director general for international cooperation. "There are many things we don't know how to do yet, but we're learning fast."
The leader in the Russian space industry's transformation is the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow. While still owned by the Government, Khrunichev is managed much like a private business. Once best known as the maker of the SS-18 and SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missiles -- which the United States considered particularly dangerous because of their accuracy and explosive power -- Khrunichev took the audacious step in the late 1980's of turning away military orders and focusing on busi-nesses with long-term commercial prospects, particularly in space.
It was merged recently with the Salyut Design Bureau, the developer of many of Russia's spacecraft, and is now the country's leading supplier of space hardware, having built, among other things, the Mir space station.
In addition, it has developed close ties to American companies, including the Lockheed Corporation and Iridium. As a result, its managers said they were confident about the future of the enterprise.
"We will continue to grow," said Aleksandr V. Lebedev, the deputy director general.
The commercialization of Russia's space industry is an encouraging development in the nation's chaotic economic metamorphosis, and the revenues it generates should help maintain the nation's technology base.
What is happening among Russian enterprises mirrors similar trends in the industry in the United States and other countries, where the emphasis is shifting away from supplying government space programs, which are being reduced in scale because of budget pressures. Instead, the focus is increasingly on opportunities for private enterprise in areas like telecommunications, navigation, weather forecasting, earth imaging and producing materials in low gravity.
The Russian industry's transformation has also sharply increased competition in the rapidly growing worldwide market for rocket launchings, satellites and other space-oriented products and services. Russian officials said that by taking advantage of not just their technical expertise but also their ability to charge less in some cases than their Western rivals, they expected their share of the space business to grow in coming years, making Russia a pivotal competitor in an industry where rivalries among the United States, Europe and Asia are already intense.
Fearful that Russia might undercut the prices charged for rocket launchings by companies like the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation, the United States has imposed quotas and price restrictions on launchings by Russian rockets of satellites containing American technology.
But the end of the cold war has accelerated cooperation between Russia and the United States and other Western countries in their national space programs, paving the way for technology exchanges and closer personal ties. At the same time, the opening up of Russia's economy and the network of laboratories, design and production centers that make up the country's space industry has drawn widespread interest from Western aerospace and technology companies looking to do business.
"They have so many different enterprises involved, so many different capabilities, so many different ways of getting into space, that there's a lot to select from," said Bob Berry, the president of Space Systems/Loral, a division of Loral, the aerospace and electronics company based in New York. "If we find ways to utilize their people and expertise, it's going to provide a good basis for business and international trade."
In the last several years there has been a steady flow of deals. Khrunichev, the maker of Russia's workhorse Proton rocket, has sold launchings to Inmarsat, the 67-nation telecommunications satellite consortium, and to Iridium, which plans to launch 21 small satellites on three Proton rockets starting next year. Khrunichev has also spent $40 million for a 5 percent stake in Iridium, one of the first investments by a Russian enterprise in a Western company.
Through a joint venture it developed with Lockheed in the United States, Khrunichev, along with Energia, another rocket builder, has also contracted for launchings to the Societe Europeene des Satellites, a European satellite-television company, and to Loral.
Loral, having separately discovered a small Russian enterprise producing innovative lightweight, low-cost thrusters used by satellites to maneuver in orbit, has also created a joint venture to bring the technology to the West, possibly even for use in satellites made for the Pentagon. Rimsat, a provider of telecommunications satellite services based in Fort Wayne, Ind., has not only contracted for launchings from Russia, but is buying seven Russian-made satellites as well.
 
Even NASA Is Buying
 The business opportunities for the Russian space industry are not limited to the private sector.
As part of a program of increased cooperation between the American and Russian space programs, NASA plans to spend $400 million to buy products and services from Russia in the next four years. The bulk of the financing will go to flights by American astronauts on the Mir space station, but NASA officials said some of the money would also be used to develop and acquire technologies from Russian enterprises in areas like solar power systems.
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and Europe plan to cooperate in the building of a staffed space station, and Russian enterprises are expected to play a pivotal role in its design and manufacturing.
"Together we can do much more than separately," said Mr. Medvedchikov of the Russian Space Agency.
Khrunichev's prospects rest largely on the Proton rocket, which was developed in the 1960's. Its relatively simple design has made it the world's most reliable launch vehicle. In 218 launchings, the Proton has achieved a success rate of about 96 percent, above the rates of McDonnell Douglas's Delta, Martin Marietta's Atlas and Titan, and the European Ariane.
 
 
Almost Half the Price
 But it is the Proton's potential price advantage over Western launchers that has excited the biggest reaction. Khrunichev's first big commercial contract with the West was the deal it signed last year to launch a telecommunications satellite for Inmarsat for $35.5 million, compared with $60 million or more charged by American and European competitors.
Under pressure from the American launching industry, the United States subsequently imposed stiff restrictions on Russian launchings. Only eight Russian launchings of American satellites to geostationary orbits -- 22,300 miles above the Equator -- would be permitted through 1999. (The Lockheed-Khrunichev joint venture has already sold options for nine launchings, although not all of them are likely to become firm orders.)
In addition, if Russia charged less than 7.5 percent below the Western launching price, the deal would be referred to the United States Government for review, a provision that would effectively keep the price of a Proton launching close to current market rates.
Khrunichev and Lockheed said they expected the demand for launchings to outstrip the supply, even including the capacity offered by the Proton and rockets being built by other countries, including China and Japan. In the end, they said, they expect demand pressures to result in the loosening or elimination of the quotas.
"If we're right that the market is going to grow, there will be natural ways for the quota to be revisited," said Mel Brashears, a vice president of Lockheed.
Moreover, the quota is limited in its effect because it does not cover satellites sent into low-earth orbit, about 600 miles up. Low-earth-orbit satellites are shaping up as the biggest growth market in coming years as ventures like Iridium get started.
 
 
Lower Costs
 Whether it is dealing with geostationary or low-earth orbit launchings, Khrunichev's costs are clearly lower than those of Western competitors, though Mr. Lebedev argued that the costs of materials in Russia were rising rapidly and that any cost differential was disappearing rapidly.
In the meantime, Khrunichev appears quite happy to charge the market price for its launchings and avoid a price war and the risk that the United States would impose further quotas or price restrictions.
While most enterprises that once made up the Soviet military-industrial complex are reeling financially, Mr. Lebedev insisted that Khrunichev was sound. The enterprise has undoubtedly been helped by unspecified financial guarantees or backing provided through the venture with Lockheed, as well as by a $10 million loan last month from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The loan is to help finance work on the Proton that will launch the Inmarsat telecommunications satellite.
So sanguine is Mr. Lebedev that he said Khrunichev was considering making another investment in an American company, which he declined to identify.

HEADLINE: Fed Faces Decision Today on Rate Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
An unusual pattern of growth has emerged in the American economy in the last few years that poses a predicament for the Federal Reserve as its top officials gather here on Tuesday to decide whether to continue raising short-term interest rates.
For the first time since the late 1940's, the economy is growing strongly despite a sustained drop in purchasing by Federal, state and local governments. The private sector is the only engine of growth in this recovery, unlike every other recovery in the last four decades, in which government spending accounted for at least part of the expansion. 
 The Federal Reserve must decide whether to brake that engine by raising interest rates sharply on the theory that that will prevent future inflation, or whether to do little or nothing for fear that higher interest rates together with falling government spending could halt economic growth.
 
 
An Increase Is Expected
 The betting of many economists is that Fed officials will raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday, because concerns about the braking effect of lower government spending are balanced by a desire to reassure bond and foreign exchange markets that inflation is under control.
Higher rates would force consumers to pay more for adjustable-rate mortgages and car loans, although higher returns on bank deposits would partly offset this cost.
Through the boom of the Korean War years, the rising prosperity of the late 1960's and the prolonged growth of the mid-1980's, government spending was a big part of economic expansion. But primarily because of a sustained drop in military spending that began late in the Bush Administration and continues under President Clinton, as well as other budget cuts, total government purchases, adjusted for inflation, have edged down slightly each year since 1991.
During the first quarter of this year, the private sector, including consumer spending, investment and net exports, grew 4.3 percent, as interest rates, still relatively low by recent standards, helped produce strong sales of everything from bulldozers to cellular telephones. The overall economy, however, grew only 2.6 percent, dragged down by a 6.2 percent drop in government purchases of goods and services.
The first-quarter drop in government spending was particularly sharp because bad weather appears to have slowed state and local government construction severely, and because deliveries of some military goods were delayed. Yet the first quarter was not a fluke. Adjusted for inflation, government purchases shrank nearly 1 percent from 1991 to 1993.
 
The Fed's Focus
 Federal Reserve officials have indicated repeatedly in interviews and speeches over the last month that they are looking at the strong private sector growth rather than just the 2.6 percent overall growth. "I think that figure probably understates the economy's current strength," said Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a speech on Thursday.
Government purchasing figures are used to calculate the nation's economic output and exclude transfer programs like Social Security that redistribute income without actually producing goods or services. Government purchasing accounts for 18 percent of the nation's output, while the private sector accounts for the rest.
Including transfer programs, government spending has been roughly constant in inflation-adjusted terms for the last three years, edging down slightly in 1993 and climbing a little in 1992 and 1994.
Quarterly figures from the Commerce Department show that the Federal budget deficit has fallen as a percentage of the nation's economic output to 3.2 percent by the end of last year from 4.8 percent in the third quarter of 1992. The Clinton Administration is trying to cut the deficit to 2.5 percent of economic output in 1995.
As the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee meets on Tuesday -- its first meeting in two months -- one of the critical questions it faces is whether the slump in government spending by itself will prevent the economy from overheating, with little further action on interest rates.
In the latest sign that the economy may be approaching full capacity and may encounter inflationary pressures, the Fed announced today that the nation's industrial production rose three-tenths of a percent in April while factories and mines operated at 83.6 percent of capacity last month, the same as in March.
But some economists say that such figures no longer signal rising inflation very clearly, because more and more overseas factories can step in to make similar goods if American factories run out of spare capacity.
Many economists expect the Fed to raise the discount rate -- the interest rate that it charges banks for overnight loans -- for the first time in more than five years. Because the Fed actually lends very little money to banks -- just $46 million last week -- this would be a largely symbolic measure to show that it remains on guard against inflation.
 
 
Rise Seen in Rate Target
 Many economists think it fairly likely that the Fed may also push up its target for the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, as it has already done three times this year. Such a move would signify that the Fed is not satisfied that a contractional budget policy by itself is enough to prevent the economy from overheating.
The Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress warned in a report earlier this month that with only the private sector growing, further interest rate increases by the Fed could halt the nation's economic expansion.
But Fed officials have been concerned this spring that much of the effects of budget cuts may have already been felt, so that further interest rate increases may be needed to keep the private sector from growing too fast.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Posts Its 11th Monthly Rise

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
The nation's industrial production recorded its 11th consecutive monthly increase in April as it continued at the highest rate in nearly five years, the Federal Reserve Board said today. Output for the month rose by three-tenths of a percent after a gain of five-tenths of a percent in March.
Factories, mines and utilities ran at 83.6 percent of their capacity in April, the same rate as in March and the highest since June 1989, when they were at 83.9 percent of capacity. 
 Such high operating rates increase the likelihood of production and supply bottlenecks that can result in sudden price increases, both for goods used in production processes and for finished products. Major car makers have been pushing prices up in recent weeks as consumers flock to showrooms.
The Fed report said production increases were widespread in April, aside from car manufacturing. It said a decision by auto makers to cut production last month reduced overall industrial production by more than one-tenth of a percent.
 
Fed Cites Decline
 "The seasonally adjusted output of motor vehicles declined because manufacturers had pushed output to near capacity in February and were unable to achieve the further gains in the pace of average daily production normally expected for March and April," the Fed said.
Production rates for autos and light trucks hit 100 percent in February and then declined to 92.7 percent in March and to 88.8 percent in April.
The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday and expectations are widespread that it will vote to raise short-term interest rates by increasing the Federal funds rate for a fourth time this year. Some analysts also expect the first rise in the Fed's discount rate in more than five years.
The Federal funds rate is the rate charged by banks on overnight loans to each other. The discount rate, controlled directly by the central bank, is for loans the Fed makes to banks. It sets the tone for other rates, such as those charged on consumer loans and mortgages.

HEADLINE: Gains Seen in Real Estate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Real estate markets in the United States strengthened substantially for the second consecutive quarter, according to a survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Almost half the respondents to the survey reported improvements in commercial real estate, while only 3 percent observed worsening conditions. Views about California real estate were much more positive for the second consecutive quarter. 
 Since the survey began in April 1991, the agency has asked senior asset managers and examiners from Federal bank and savings agencies across the nation to report developments in their local real estate markets. More than 450 people were polled in late April on developments over the previous three months.
"Both recent surveys clearly suggest that the recovery in real estate is gaining strength and is widening geographically," said James Freund, chief of industry and financial analysis at the F.D.I.C.'s division of research and statistics. "Historically, low interest rates and the pick-up in the economy likely are important factors in the improvement."
More than 40 percent of the California respondents in April said housing markets there were improving, compared with only 12 percent six months earlier. Two-thirds of the California respondents said commercial real estate conditions had stabilized in their local markets and 23 percent reported improved conditions. Only 10 percent noted further deterioration, the agency said.

YOUNG, IMPRESSIONABLE AND ACCUSED
The most shocking thing about them is their ordinariness. Like so many young teen-agers, they are insecure, materialistic, impressionable and not always in command of their anger and aggressiveness. But what sets these few apart from other young teen-agers is that the state has called them killers. In New York City, 28 children 13 to 15 years old were indicted last year in adult courts for murder. A1. 

STOWAWAYS IMPRISONED BY BUREAUCRACY
They were so desperate to reach the United States that they sealed themselves into huge metal cargo containers. But when the Romanian stowaways landed, they were put in shackles by the shipping company and banished to a hotel near Newark International Airport, where they remain -- still in chains under a law that puts transport companies into the role of jailers, largely free of restrictions on how they treat their wards.

COURT EXPANSION PLANNED IN BROOKLYN
The last time the Federal courts had a proposal to expand in Brooklyn, the plan called for building a tower as high as 415 feet above a landmark post office dating to the 1890's. That idea roused such local resistance that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan used his clout to scuttle it. Now, a year and a half later, the planners have come up with a new approach. B3.

HEADLINE: Officials Keep a Hand In Business

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Several senior members of the Giuliani administration have continued to hold substantial outside business interests after joining the government, and at least two officials have continued to help manage their companies in their spare time, according to financial disclosure reports released by the City Conflicts of Interest Board yesterday.
The City Charter does not prohibit officials from holding an interest in real estate or a private company as long as the company does not do business with the city, officials of the conflicts board said. 
 The Charter does say that commissioners "shall give their whole time to the duties of their office and shall not engage in any other occupation, profession or employment." Like past mayors, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has interpreted the clause to allow a small amount of moonlighting in the evenings and on weekends, Paul A. Crotty, the Corporation Counsel, said.
 
Sojourn in Public Life
 The board's reports and city officials say that Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson has kept a hand in the management of an upstate winery his family owns and that the Fire Commissioner, Howard Safir, has continued to provide advice to a Virginia security company in which he has an ownership interest. Both men have said they spend about four or five hours a week on their businesses in the evening and on weekends.
"How do you attract people of ability and demonstrated competence if you're going to say that they have to devote all their services exclusively to the city?" Mr. Crotty said. "Their sojourn in public life will be two, three or four years."
Mr. Crotty said the administration had decided to "interpret whole time with some degree of practicality." He said the Mayor felt the provision meant commissioners should work for the city "full time, but not exclusively, and not at the expense of forcing them to strip themselves of their assets in order to perform a public service."
The City Buildings Commissioner, Joel A. Miele, has an interest in six rental and commercial properties in Queens and Brooklyn that are regulated by the Buildings Department, the reports show. He is also a partner in an engineering firm, Miele Associates, that must seek approvals from his department for projects, and he has retained an interest in an inactive construction company, Wilbay Church Construction.
Mr. Miele said yesterday that he did not participate in the management of the various real-estate businesses that he owns with family members. He added that he had turned over all regulatory decisions about his properties to his deputy, Richard Visconti. As a final precaution, Mr. Miele said, he has requested a ruling from the Conflicts of Interest Board about whether he must divest his holdings. The board has yet to consider the matter, he said.
 
Hands Off
 "I have insulated myself from any situation which might have the appearance of or the reality of a conflict of interest," Mr. Miele said. "I won't even know if an application comes through this office from one of these companies."
The chairman of the conflicts board, Sheldon Oliensis, said that in the past, the board had allowed officials to hold on to their assets as long as they removed themselves from regulatory decisions regarding their companies.
Mr. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, has extensive business holdings, including several wineries, the reports show.
Mr. Dyson said he left day-to-day management of his companies to executives he had hired, but he said he spent a few hours after work and on the weekends giving advice to his managers.
He reported at least $800,000 in earnings from investments last year, though he did not list them.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances 11.82 in Subdued Trading

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Wall Street sweated out the Federal Reserve Board's policy-setting meeting today by doing little yesterday in restrained trading.
The exception was the Nasdaq composite index, now in its third day of decline in a row and its fifth out of the last eight sessions. The Nasdaq composite index fell 5.01 points, to 711.91. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.82 points, to 3,671.50. 
 High-technology stocks like Intel, Microsoft and Wellfleet topped the Nasdaq list of decliners, but so did not-so-futuristic companies like US Health Care, which operates health maintenance organizations, and Worthington Industries, a metal- and plastic-parts maker.
For the most part, however, many stocks were little changed. Some traders say that if the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee votes to raise the Federal funds rate and the discount rate today, the Fed will only confirm expectations that the markets have built into bonds and stocks already. The markets may steady or even rally, traders say.
Other traders say the markets will decline, as they have either the day or the day after the Fed raised interest rates three earlier times this year. But what all traders wish for is that the Fed act soon, to reduce uncertainty.
Yesterday, the market was stirring little after another bit of favorable economic news --- the Fed reported that capacity utilization, a measure of how much of the country's manufacturing capacity is in use, came in at 83.6 percent in April.
That was what was expected by Wall Street economists. There was once widespread belief among traders that a level of 85 percent automatically indicated inflation, but economists say that with a growing fraction of United States factory capacity outside the United States, 85 percent probably says little about inflation.
Mondays are often slow trading days, but volume on the New York Stock Exchange was especially low, totaling just 234.7 million shares, or some 22 percent below this year's average volume of 302 million shares.
"A lot of people were just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the Fed," said Timothy G. Grazioso, manager for Nasdaq trading at Cantor Fitzgerald and Co.
"There was a slight selloff in technology stocks because of what happened to Cisco," he said, referring to Cisco Systems, the computer networking company that on Friday said its order book was not growing as rapidly as before. Since Cisco's products tie together groups of computers, Cisco's troubles cast a pall on makers of computers and computer parts.
Cisco, which was the most active stock of the day at 13.1 million shares, dropped 3/4, to 22 1/2. Intel, the semiconductor maker, fell 7/8, to 57 1/2, and Microsoft, the software developer, fell 1 1/2, to 95.
"When the aggressive growth funds finish getting out of Cisco, it'll bounce back and carry the rest of the stocks, too," Mr. Grazioso predicted.
Among other indexes, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.35 point, to 444.49. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.02 point, to 245.78, while declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,188 to 985. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.89 point, to 431.68.

TOYS "R" US INC. (TOY,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us Inc. said fiscal first-quarter net income rose 6 percent, in line with analysts' expectations, as strong domestic sales offset weak international results.
The Paramus, N.J., toy retailer said earnings for the quarter ended April 30 rose to $37.6 million, or 13 cents a share. Per-share net of 13 cents was one cent above Wall Street's mean estimate of 12 cents, according to a Zacks Investment Research poll of 13 analysts. 
 The retailer said domestic same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, increased 6.6 percent on strong sales of basic toys and a successful summer catalog.
Michael Goldstein, chief executive officer, said the company planned to open at least 10 new Kids "R" Us clothing stores in areas where the company had done well.
International toy stores were hurt by "local economic conditions" and posted same-store sales declines, Mr. Goldstein said.
