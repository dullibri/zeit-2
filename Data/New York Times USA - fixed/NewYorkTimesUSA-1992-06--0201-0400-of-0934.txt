HEADLINE: RUSSIAN BACKLASH IS FORCING A DELAY IN APPROVAL OF AID

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE with STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 6

 BODY:
A backlash against President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reforms is forcing a delay of several months, and perhaps much longer, in the approval of an aid package intended to give Russia at least $24 billion in Western assistance, Russian and American officials say.
The delay comes as there are strong signs in Washington that Congress has lost its enthusiasm for giving money to Russia to help finance the International Monetary Fund package that is threatened by the Moscow backlash. 
 Mr. Yeltsin is preparing for a summit meeting June 16-17 with President Bush in Washington, at which the intertwined questions of aid in Congress and Russian reform will be at the top of the agenda.
 
Glowing Predictions Fade
 Whatever his considerable troubles back home, Mr. Yeltsin almost certainly will try to put the best face he can on his stalled economic reforms, which he hopes will make possible a transition to a Western-style free-market system. But Western and Russian officials are backing away from their glowing predictions in early spring that Russia would soon qualify for $24 billion in Western loans and other aid.
The new delay in the efforts of Mr. Yeltsin to get Western financing means that the Government is likely to postpone another cherished goal: free convertibility of the ruble to hard currencies. The ruble is now traded at various rates artificially manipulated by the Government, and Mr. Yeltsin has made the switch to a system in which the rate is set by the free market -- a cornerstone of his effort to convert the Russian economy.
 
Two Top Officials Out
 Doubts about a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund surfaced last week as two top Russian officials left office, casualties of the stiff resistance in Parliament and among managers of giant state enterprises to the Yeltsin measures. These so-called conservatives managed to place some of their own candidates in the administration, where they are likely to oppose First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the economic reform program.
By limiting the budget deficit to hold down inflation, the reforms would cut back Government money for almost every aspect of Russian life, increasing economic hardship while prices are still rising faster than wages. The reforms have been painful for ordinary Russians and threaten the hold of the old bureaucratic and industrial elite over the wealth of the country.
"The extent of Yeltsin's popularity is amazing, given the situation," said Robert D. Strauss, the United States Ambassador in Moscow, who is throwing all his support behind Mr. Yeltsin in the battle with Parliament. "But I don't know how long Yeltsin's popularity can hold up. He can't seem to get anything through Parliament, which is one-third hard-liners against his reforms, one-third his allies and one-third floating in between."
"I think Yegor Gaidar is going to have to loosen up a bit and slow down a bit if Yeltsin is going to keep the consensus to govern," he said.
Mr. Strauss in Moscow and a senior Bush Administration official reached by telephone in Washington said that because of Parliament's opposition to Mr. Yeltsin's reforms, the Russian Government and the International Monetary Fund are not likely to sign an agreement in July, as scheduled, that would start the $24 billion in Western aid flowing. The new target date is likely to be September at the earliest.
"In my opinion, there will be an I.M.F. agreement," Mr. Strauss said. "But it will be later rather than earlier, and it will be one in which the I.M.F. will have to make compromises."
The reforms sought by the I.M.F. are intended to balance the budget by cutting subsidies, bank loans and other forms of easy credit to state enterprises. With the Government operating closer to the black, there would be money to repay Western funds needed now to support the economy. But the cutbacks would squeeze the giant state enterprises, which account for most of Russia's economic activity, forcing some into bankruptcy and others into laying off tens of thousands of workers.
Parliament has balked at passing the necessary legislation under pressure from lobbyists representing managers of state companies. The Government said Mr. Yeltsin would issue a presidential decree permitting bankruptcy, in effect overriding Parliament's rejection last week of a bankruptcy bill. He is preparing a similar decree on privatization, which Parliament has also blocked.
 
Yeltsin Threatens Elections
 Mr. Yeltsin has also warned that the political stalemate cannot continue, and he has threatened to hold a referendum on disbanding the Congress of People's Deputies altogether and holding new elections.
But Mr. Strauss calls Mr. Yeltsin a consummate negotiator, and last week Mr. Yeltsin gave some ground, dismissing Vladimir M. Lopukhin, the Fuel and Energy Minister, because Mr. Lopukhin had angered directors of state oil companies. The President also promised the oil executives 120 billion rubles in new subsidies to pay back salaries and get drilling rigs, idled for lack of money, operating again.
This sum is in addition to 200 billion rubles in new credits to state enterprises and collective farms announced in April, to try to quiet conservative criticism just before an important session of the legislature. Mr. Gaidar said then that this easy credit would be the last one.
Acknowledging the crisis, Aleksei Mozhin, a member of the Russian Government team negotiating with the I.M.F., said the talks were in danger of failing. "If the Government gives in to the pressure and extends hundreds of billions of rubles in new credit, then there will be no I.M.F. agreement," Mr. Mozhin said. "That is clear."
 
Several Rates, All Artificial
 On the issue of making the ruble convertible, there is another threat. The current system has several rates, all artificially manipulated, ranging from 55 rubles to the dollar -- the rate for most transactions involving trade -- to 120 rubles to the dollar on the black market and at weekly bank auctions of hard currencies.
Mr. Gaidar had promised that by August, the ruble would float freely at a single exchange rate and that any Russian could purchase all the dollars that he or she wished, although the money could not be kept in banks abroad. As insurance against a sharp drop in the ruble's value, the Government would use $6 billion of the $24 billion foreign-aid package as a reserve fund to buy rubles in an emergency, thus shoring up its value. Such an emergency could develop if Russians became panicky about their economy's prospects and tried to exchange too many rubles for dollars.
Currently, the Russian Government has less than $1 billion in foreign-currency reserves to support the ruble, Western bankers say.
Mr. Gaidar argues that until the ruble floats freely at a relatively stable exchange rate, trade will not flourish and foreign companies will not invest here -- two developments the Yeltsin Government considers essential for the transition to capitalism.
 
Limited Exchange Urged
 But now Western officials speak increasingly of an exchange rate that allows only exporters and importers to exchange rubles freely for dollars. That would reduce the risk of a run on the dollar, but it would also mean that a black market in hard currencies would flourish, creating a second exchange rate.
"It is expected that individuals will still be able to buy foreign currencies freely, but we could set certain limits," Mr. Mozhin said, confirming the reports. "It could be, say, $500 a year per person. I don't know what the amount would be."
Such diminished goals certainly did not surface in April at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Washington, when Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States were offered I.M.F. membership. The I.M.F., founded after World War II, serves the industrial nations as their arbiter of which countries are credit-worthy and deserving of foreign loans and investment.
But Western loans usually flow only after a nation like Russia, seeking money, signs a "standby agreement," in which a commitment is made to run the economy by I.M.F. rules. In at least two public statements at the I.M.F. meeting in April, Mr. Gaidar confidently announced that the standby agreement would be signed by July 1 and the ruble made freely convertible in August.
 
A Lack of Financial Data
 But a team of I.M.F. negotiators, which came here in early May, ran into major obstacles. One was a lack of data to measure the size of the budget deficit, the amount of rubles in circulation and the quantity of outstanding loans subsidized by the Central Bank. All these items are used to judge Russia's progress toward I.M.F. goals.
Another major obstacle is the I.M.F.'s insistence that the Russian Central Bank govern the supply of rubles throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States, or that the Commonwealth states agree to a single set of rules. In effect, this would be a supreme central bank that would set interest rates and print money for all the Commonwealth states, which now number 11 -- all the 15 former Soviet republics but the three Baltic nations and Georgia.
No progress has been made on this issue, Mr. Mozhin said. And the resignation last week of Georgi Matyukhin as chairman of Russia's Central Bank complicates the problem.
Mr. Matyukhin resigned rather than agree to a demand from Parliament that he reduce the rate at which the Central Bank lends money to commercial banks to 50 percent from 80 percent. The commercial banks, many of them former state institutions, lend in turn to state enterprises. The less these banks pay for money, the less they can charge the enterprises, and the managers have been clamoring for lower interest rates. Parliament rejected the resignation, but Mr. Matyukhin said on Friday that he would not return to the job if he were forced to cut the interest rate from 80 percent.
 
Broke, They Must Borrow
 Russia and the other Commonwealth states, because they are broke, must borrow abroad or attract foreign investment to pay the costs of modernizing industries and making them competitive in the world market. But before the I.M.F. will authorize the first loan, in Russia's case a $4.5 billion credit, it demands that the Yeltsin Government, with Parliament's support, at least begin to reduce the budget deficit and cut back on credits.
But an effort to do just that in the first quarter of this year was undermined by state enterprises. Kept short of cash, they gave credit to one another -- by not paying one another's bills -- and went weeks without paying salaries. Now they are in effect demanding that Mr. Yeltsin give them the money to cover these debts.
"Everything we hear from Yeltsin and Gaidar is that they are trying to hold the line," a senior Bush Administration official said. "This is the moment that is testing them."

HEADLINE: U.S. Documents Raise Questions Over Iraq Policy

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Newly declassified State Department documents provide further evidence that even as the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged ahead with a policy of conciliation toward Saddam Hussein, they were amassing evidence of Iraq's military capabilities and regional ambitions, its harboring of Palestinian terrorists and its eradication of political opponents.
While senior officials publicly portrayed the Iraqi President as having curbed his radical impulses, some privately characterized him as a totalitarian leader whose world view, in the words of one State Department memo in September 1988, "is that of a conspirator who believes that power comes from the barrel of a gun." 
 The documents, declassified this week in response to appeals by Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat, provide the fullest record to date of the relationship between the countries from 1984, when the Reagan Administration quietly discarded its official neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war, until August 1990, when the Bush Administration scrambled to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
 
Wealth of New Details
 While the policy of conciliation has been known, the declassified material provides a wealth of new details.
Mr. Gejdenson heads a House foreign affairs subcommittee that is investigating the Administration's policy toward Iraq before the gulf war. A growing number of lawmakers have argued that there might never have been a war had the United States pursued a harder line against Mr. Hussein.
The State Department memos, cablegrams and letters and interviews with senior Administration officials reveal fierce internal battles over issues like the transfer of high-technology equipment to Iraq, human rights violations, terrorism and American-backed agricultural loans to Iraq.
Despite ominous signs of aggressive behavior by Mr. Hussein in early 1990, the Bush Administration did not penalize him with measures like trade sanctions, a reduction of the American diplomatic presence in Baghdad, a cutoff of technology transfers or reinstatement of Iraq on the list of nations supporting terrorism. Instead, it sent a stream of private diplomatic messages of concern.
 
No 'Signal' of Outrage
 "These documents show that the U.S. Government took no action that would send a signal to Saddam that our outrage was so great when he gassed the Kurds, when he harbored terrorists, that it would cost him the friendship of the United States," Mr. Gejdenson said in a telephone interview. "It's worse than no one paying attention. Those paying attention at the highest levels were trying to coddle Saddam."
Among the revelations is that a State Department document apparently written shortly after the 1988 election of Mr. Bush warned that Iraq had emerged from its eight-year war with Iran as a "great military and political power, and is aiming higher," adding that it was using a "big-stick approach to the Kuwait border issue and in Lebanon." But a seven-page review of United States-Iraq policy recommended that the United States open a major campaign to push through technology transfers despite the objections of the Commerce and Defense Departments, calling technology "our most important asset" with Iraq.
The newly declassified documents also show that the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights concluded that Iraq showed a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights after it used chemical weapons against the Kurds in 1988 and therefore was subject to various economic sanctions under law, according to a November 1988 memo to George P. Shultz, then the Secretary of State. But the Administration overruled its human rights experts, deciding instead to oppose the sanctions on the grounds that they represented "Congressional micro-management of foreign policy."
 
State Department Skeptical
 The decision was made despite State Department skepticism that Iraq would keep its promises to refrain from future use of chemical weapons. "Having gotten away with the use of chemical weapons on a number of occasions, the Iraqis may very well use them again the next time they consider such use necessary," said the joint memo from the heads of three State Department bureaus.
The documents also show that the United States knew that Iraq was providing safe haven to Palestinian terrorists from 1982 to 1990, but repeatedly told Congress that the evidence did not warrant returning Iraq to the list of countries supporting terrorism.
An assessment by intelligence agencies in July 1990 concluded that Mr. Hussein "has strengthened his ties to terrorist groups and may use terrorism to intimidate his Arab and Western opponents."
But there was fierce opposition within the State Department and elsewhere in the Administration to labeling Iraq a supporter of terrorism, according to senior Administration officials, and the country was reinstated on the list only after the Kuwait invasion.
 
Weapons Got Through
 The documents also show that despite an official ban on the transfer of American-made military equipment to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, some weapons and weapons with American components did get through via third countries. Among them were 100,000 artillery shells produced in Greece with American-made fuses that were shipped in 1986.
Most of the documents discussing foreign policy recommendations and analyses date from the Reagan Administration, when Iraq was at war with Iran, a sworn enemy of the United States. Few of the documents bear the name of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and Mr. Gejdenson said that the State Department has thus far refused to declassify other important documents.
Some of the most interesting memos concern the State Department's intimate knowledge of terrorist activities by Palestinians based in Baghdad during the 1980's. The documents say three groups that the United States has blamed for terrorist incidents -- those led by Abu Nidal and Abul Abbas and one called the May 15 Group -- received safe haven in Baghdad or had links to groups there.
The 1982 removal of Iraq from the State Department list of sponsors of terrorism paved the way for billions of dollars in American trade with Iraq. When some members of Congress urged that Iraq be returned to the terrorism list, a letter from Mr. Schultz assured them that Iraq would be restored to the list if there was evidence that it had resumed support for these groups.
But a July 1986 survey of United States policy on Iraq's terrorism, provided to Mr. Shultz by the State Department's acting chief intelligence officer, said that "there have been developments that suggest that Iraq remains reluctant to cut completely its links to terrorist groups." It said that "Abul Abbas seems to have been permitted to take refuge in Iraq following the Achille Lauro hijacking," a notorious takeover of a cruise ship in which an American was killed.
 
A Warning in 1990
 The documents show that in June 1990, the American Ambassador to Iraq, April C. Glaspie, warned the Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister, Nizar Hamdoon, about the return to Iraq of Abu Nidal, who is held responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in the 1980's. The documents also illustrate a concerted State Department campaign to transfer high-technology goods to Iraq, involving frequent attacks on the Pentagon and the Commerce Departments for obstructing the improvement in relations by withholding licenses for goods that could be used by Iraq's military.
One April 1986 document written in the State Department's Bureau for Near eastern and South Asian Affairs, for example, said the Pentagon "has simply found a device for blocking legitimate high-tech sales to Iraq while appearing to take the high ground on proliferation issues."
In a later, undated memo during the Bush Administration, John H. Kelly, as Assistant Secretary of State responsible for the Middle East, characterized United States licensing procedures as "a drag on trade with Iraq," recommending that the State Department could play a more active role in curbing the authority of an interagency committee responsible for reviewing exports that could be used in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
 
Eager to Show Good Will
 So eager was the State Department to garner good will with Mr. Hussein that in a memo in July 1989, Mr. Kelly and another official recommended to his superior, Under Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew, that the United States approve the transfer of a system to protect Mr. Hussein's personal aircraft and helicopters form missile attack. The memo said the "sale of this system to the head-of-state would be a small good-will gesture" in line with United States policy.
Although the sale never went through, according to Administration officials, the memo says Mr. Hussein was allowed to buy communications security devices for his Presidential Palace.
The documents also illustrate the prevailing view that Mr. Hussein's moderate "tilt" during the Iran-Iraq war was a strategic change and not just a temporary tactical maneuver.
"Iraq's shift toward moderation, cooperation with neighbors, and mainline Arab positions on Palestine seems permanent and deepening," the State Department's top intelligence officer wrote in March 1988, five months before the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The memo continued, "Fears of Iraqi aggression seem exaggerated," adding that "Kuwait might have had cause to be anxious" only if Iraq had decisively and quickly won the war years before.

HEADLINE: MAY 31-JUNE 6: Haiti;
Choice of Prime Minister Won't Win Washington

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
Amid growing popular calls for the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the military-backed Government nominated Marc L. Bazin as Haiti's new Prime Minister last week. The action was widely seen as a bid by the Haitian Army to find a formula short of restoring Mr. Aristide that will persuade the international community to lift a crushing economic embargo.
For years, Haitian intellectuals and political activists, particularly those on the left, have referred to United States policy as the "American Plan," which they said was intended to prevent Haiti's development so as to preserve it as a cheap labor pool. To many of these Haitians, nobody was more associated with this supposed policy than the 60-year-old Mr. Bazin, a former World Bank official who is as fluent in conservative development theories as he is in accent-less English. If his long cozy relations with Washington were expected to obtain the United States' acquiescence in attempts to finally dispose of Father Aristide, however, initial signs suggest they have failed badly. 
 "We were really hoping they wouldn't do something so stupid," said one senior American diplomat of the army's decision. "There is no way we are going to recognize these people. But now that they are closing the door like this, what we really fear is a lot more violence in Haiti."

HEADLINE: All Russia Needs Now Is a Lot of Jelly

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 6

 BODY:
Of the many things that Russia lacks, peanut butter is one. To be sure, no one here knew they were missing it. But this week, in a gesture of self-interested humanitarian aid, the National Peanut Council of America presented this hungry nation with its first peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich.
The formal tasting took place at the Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, a centerpiece of gilded fountains, giant airships and other monuments of the Soviet era. The first verdict by a troupe from the Moscow Children's Theater was that peanut butter -- or arakhisovoye maslo -- was "on the salty side." No one complained about it sticking to the roof of his mouth. 
 The mission of American peanut farmers, shellers and producers here is double-edged. The delegation came here with enough peanut butter (30 tons) for 500,000 sandwiches, which will be donated to needy children through the Moscow Children's Fund. But they also brought another one and a half tons to be tested at stores around Moscow as a trial balloon to see if Russia could one day become a market for America's surplus peanuts.
"We thought it was a fortunate confluence of events," said Wayne Lord, president of Southco Commodities, of Georgia. "They have a need for food supplies, and if ever there was a market for peanut butter, it would be here, since it's a substitute for meat, at 25 percent of the cost."
 
98 Planeloads of Aid
 Since February, when the first C-5 transport planes unloaded military rations left over from the Persian Gulf war, the United States Government has sent in 57 planeloads of food, 41 planes of medical supplies for a total of 4,450 metric tons of humanitarian aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Now, the emphasis of United States help to Russia and the other former Soviet republics is shifting away from donations of food toward offers of technical support and assistance, aimed at creating a market economy, but also new markets for American investors.
"The humanitarian aid stage is now dropping off, and what we want to do now is create an atmosphere for future investment," said one aide to Richard Armitage, who is the deputy coordinator of aid to the old Soviet republics.
"What we hear from the Russians now is: 'Thanks for the sausage. Now we need help setting up a sausage factory,' " the aide, who asked not to be identified, said.
 
Food Not Now a Problem
 The initial batch of American aid was intended mainly as a show of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reform program. Now, after a closer look, Washington is coming to the conclusion that Russia's food shortages are not as acute as their perennial problems of distribution. "There are pockets of need, but our general assessment is that food right now is not a problem," the aide said.
Instead, the latest visitors to Moscow, ranging from Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to former President Richard M. Nixon, have emphasized the need to make the economic climate in Russia more amenable to long-term investment rather than outright government-to-government aid.
After the first rush of bulk donations of canned goods and used clothing, private aid projects have also become more focused. Several United States hospitals have set up relationships with Russian medical institutions, sending in American doctors and nurses to set up specialized clinics, and providing for Russian medical personnel to get advanced training in the United States. Business schools and other training courses are also offering to help prepare specialists in specific fields.
The National Peanut Council's trip here came, not coincidentally, after a record peanut crop in the United States last year produced a 75,000 metric ton surplus. If the peanut growers, with their Moscow market survey, can prove that Russians have a taste for peanut butter, then they will try to persuade Washington to include it on the list of surplus foods eligible to be sent overseas as aid.
Other American farm groups have been here recently. Besides the wheat and grain industries, which have been doing business here for years, the California Dry Bean Board has been through on an exploratory mission, armed with a donation of 30 tons of beans, while an American rice grower not long ago signed a contract to sell 15,000 tons of rice to a Central Asian republic, according to Agriculture Department officials.
Last year, Billy Hatcher, a peanut farmer from Baconton, Ga., went to Eastern Europe as part of delegation sent to examine the possibilities for American peanuts. Concluding that Western Europe had already sewed up that market, he advised the National Peanut Council to move further east.
"I told them, the Soviet Union, that's where we need to go because they are in need," he said. "It is a good time to get started. But first we have to find out if they like the product."

HEADLINE: SAUDIS USING OIL IN YEMENI DISPUTE

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 3

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia has warned oil companies from the United States, France, Britain and Canada to stop looking for oil in several thousand square miles along a disputed section of its border with Yemen, or face the possibility of retaliatory measures, including military action.
The Saudi warning, in letters to the companies, implied that they were operating without permission in Saudi territory. But industry executives said many of the operations are on land and in Red Sea offshore waters that have been under Yemeni control for years. 
 The warning, accompanied by increased Saudi patrols in the area and a campaign against Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni press, has significantly worsened an already deteriorating relationship between the two nations.
Over the last few days, unconfirmed Yemeni press reports have charged that Saudi intelligence agents working in northern Yemen are trying to destabilize the Government of Lieut. Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh by promising Saudi citizenship to border-area residents if they support Saudi territorial claims.
 
Patrols Move, as Do Prices
 Executives in oil companies operating in Yemen have confirmed that the Saudi Army has increased border patrols. Reports of the dispute, and of Saudi military moves, account for some of the increase in oil prices since the OPEC meeting in Vienna last month, oil analysts say. Prices have moved from about $20 a barrel to about $22 a barrel over the last two weeks.
A halt in oil exploration and production in the disputed area would deal a heavy blow to the fragile Yemeni economy. The companies active there spend hundreds of millions of dollars obtaining concessions and looking for oil even before they start producing it, contributing badly needed foreign currency to the poor country.
Yemen produces about 200,000 barrels of oil a day from newly discovered fields. Most of the oil being pumped comes from just south of the area claimed by Saudi Arabia, but most of the area being explored lies within it. Of 20 concessions granted by the Yemenis for exploration, 12 are in the area claimed by the Saudis.
The Yemeni Government is counting on output from the fields now being explored to increase production to 800,000 barrels a day within five years -- with help and capital investment from foreign oil companies operating in joint ventures in the country.
With a population of about 13 million -- larger but much poorer than Saudi Arabia's 8 million to 10 million -- Yemen could, if its straitened economic situation improved, challenge Saudi dominance on the Arabian peninsula.
Differences between the nations over borders go back to the 1930's, when they fought a war over the Asir region.
 
How Relations Got Worse
 Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Yemen joined Iraq, Jordan and Egypt in forming the Arab Cooperation Council, an alliance created to balance the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is headed by the Saudis in alliance with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. The Saudis, however, have expressed fear that the Arab Cooperation Council was set up to encircle and eventually dominate them.
Yemeni-Saudi relations worsened further after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Yemen appeared to back Iraq throughout the crisis.
The Saudi Government retaliated by evicting 700,000 to a million Yemeni workers, people sending home hundreds of millions of dollars in remittances a year. This money was essential to Yemen's currency reserves.
The Saudi letters to the oil companies, which were identical in tone, signaled to top managers that authorities in Riyadh considered their prospecting for oil in a large but ill-defined swath of land and sea between the 17th and 18th parallels "an intransigence." Saudi Arabia "will take any necessary action to protect the sanctity of its borders," one of the letters said.
Several companies have responded by suspending or ending their activity in Yemen, although one, the Hunt Oil Company of Texas, politely rejected the warning, continuing to pump about 180,000 barrels a day in the Marib area. Others -- including British Petroleum, Elf Aquitaine of France and Atlantic Richfield and Phillips from the United States -- seem to be cutting operations.
"No international oil company can afford to defy the world's largest producer," a senior Arab oil executive based here, "even if they are not buying a single barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia. You never know when you might need to, and how far Saudi displeasure can reach."

HEADLINE: U.S., Trying to Buff Its Image, Defends the Forests

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 6

 BODY:
The United States, under fire at the Earth Summit for perceived foot-dragging on treaties intended to protect the planet's climate and its biological diversity, is trying to restore its standing, at least partly, by leading a drive to save the world's forests.
But opponents of the forests initiative are suspicious of the Bush Administration's motives, and the prospects that the initiative will advance at the summit, or that it will do much to repair Washington's environmental reputation, are in doubt. 
 Coming into Rio, the Administration found itself at odds with much of the rest of the world over treaties to control global warming and preserve the world's plant, animal and microbial species. On forests, however, the Administration has taken the lead in pushing a position that is endorsed by many environmental groups and by other industrialized nations.
But in doing so, it has fallen afoul of the vehement opposition of developing countries for which forests are a major economic asset. These countries assert that while they believe in protecting forests, they are theirs to do with as they please. They accuse the United States and other industrialized countries of attempting to coerce them on the issue for domestic political gain. And they bridle at what they see as an attempt to abridge their sovereignty by countries that long ago cut down their own trees for profit but now want to place the main burden of global forest conservation on countries struggling for economic survival.
"We are certainly not holding our forests in custody for those who have destroyed their own forests and now try to claim ours as part of the heritage of mankind," Ting Wen Lian, a Malaysian diplomat who has emerged as the developing countries' chief spokeswoman on the issue, said as the forest negotiations began this week. Her country and the United States are the two largest timber-exporting nations in the world.
 
Forests as Global Asset
 The United States argues that forests, especially tropical forests, are being destroyed at an alarming rate in the developing world and that the planet as a whole will be the loser. Forests, it argues, are a global asset that help regulate the climate by absorbing heat-trapping carbon dioxide and are the repository of a major portion of the world's living species.
William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and chief of the United States delegation to the Earth Summit, has announced that "the principal priority of the United States at this conference is better management and conservation of the world's forests." Armed with a commitment from President Bush to step up foreign aid for forest protection and an announcement that the United States was abandoning clear-cutting in its national forests, Mr. Reilly attempted to put new weight behind longstanding Administration efforts to secure agreement here that an international treaty on forests be negotiated and signed after the Rio summit.
But Ambassador Ting dismissed President Bush's offer of new money as irrelevant to the forest negotiations here.
Despite the developing world's opposition, Britain and Germany have been leading an effort to integrate President Bush's announcement of $150 million a year in new funds for forest preservation into a broader initiative involving a number of countries.
 
U.S. Seen as Obstructionist
 The United States has been seen by much of the rest of the world as an obstructionist on the key issues of global warming and biological diversity. The Bush Administration successfully sought the adoption of commitments to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases that is weaker than most other industrialized countries wanted, although Administration officials contend that the resulting treaty is a prudent first step in view of the scientific uncertainties over global warming.
The United States plans to sign the climate treaty, but not the treaty on protection of species. While it supports the central conservation features of the biodiversity treaty, it opposes other aspects relating to patent protection, regulation of biotechnology and the mechanism for transferring funds from rich to poor nations for conservation purposes.
Earlier, in pre-summit negotiations, it had been hoped that a forest treaty could be signed here along with those on global warming and protection of species. But developing countries would not hear of it, and now environmental groups fear that even the statement on forest principles may not survive Rio.
"They're really in trouble on this document," said William Mankin, a forestry expert for the Sierra Club. "They don't have enough time to do this."
Negotiators working on a wide range of summit issues, including forests, must complete work by Wednesday so that documents may be prepared for the three-day summit phase of the conference beginning on Friday.
 
Defending Forestry Record
 Mr. Reilly argues that despite such high-profile issues as the cutting of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest, the United States record on forestry in the last century is good, if not a model.
As in many other industrialized countries, Americans cut down their forests at a rapid rate and in an uncontrolled fashion until about a century ago. Since then, the Americans argue, the United States has built up a vast body of expertise on how to manage forests so that they can be exploited economically while maintaining an extensive forest cover. There are more forests in the United States now than a century ago, and their total volume has increased markedly, through growth and reforestation, in the last decade.
One goal of the Americans and Canadians is the adoption of the principle that the sustainable use of forests should be governed by international guidelines on forest management.
"We want to be measured by internationally accepted standards," said Jagmohan Maini, a forest official in the Canadian Government. "We will meet or exceed any such standards."
Canada is a principal ally of the United States on the forestry issue. Many developing countries, said Mr. Maini, "are reluctant to recognize the global role of forests." Moreover, he said, "some of them are suspicious of our motives, which is very unfortunate. It shows we have failed."
Indeed, Ambassador Ting said in a statement here this week that she understood that "the almost obsessional anxiety to have a forest convention" is driven by concerns that have nothing to do with forests or trees, but rather mainly by the desire of developed countries "to appease their public opinion and thus get electoral mileage out of forests."
Environmentalists said the present draft of the statement of forest principles is so weak as to constitute a step backward. It falls far short, they say, of a 1991 World Bank prohibition on providing funds for logging in primary tropical rain forests and an international agreement recently reached to confine the trade in tropical timber, by the year 2000, to materials derived from sustainably managed forests.

HEADLINE: Freight Line To Restore Passengers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POMPTON LAKES, N.J.

 BODY:
Even in its glory days as a commuter train in the first half of this century, the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway was an innovator.
Tim Stuy, head of the railroad's historical society, says that in 1943 it was first to switch from coal-fired to diesel-powered commuter trains. Seven years later, it was the first to provide air-conditioned coaches. In its waning days a generation ago, it broke new ground again, offering its last handful of passengers $1,000 each to stop riding so it could become a profitable, freight-only hauler. 
 Now the line is involved in another precedent -- it would be the first new commuter line in New Jersey since the 1930's, railroad buffs say. By 1997, N.J. Transit officials plan to have two six-car commuter trains operating on the Susquehanna's existing freight tracks, hauling 1,200 passengers a day between the transit agency's major rail hub in Hoboken and parts of four northern New Jersey counties that have grown since the Susquehanna dropped commuter service in June 1966.
"That would be fantastic," Tim Dudgeon, a data-base specialist for Shearson-Lehman in lower Manhattan, said recently after an hourlong bus ride from Manhattan's Port Authority bus terminal to the old stone railroad station here. "Trains are more consistent and a lot more comfortable. The Port Authority's a mess right now. Trying to squeeze all the buses through the Lincoln Tunnel every night is ridiculous."
 
Major Train Changes Planned
 A restored Susquehanna line is one element in a multimillion dollar N.J. Transit plan that could, if fully financed, reshape commuter train service in New Jersey by the turn of the century. It would create new rail lines in developing parts of the state, connect some old ones, and, planners say, attract thousands of people who commute now by car and bus now on congested highways.
In addition to the Susquehanna, the proposed lines would run along the Hudson waterfront from Bayonne through Jersey City and Hoboken to Edgewater, near the George Washington Bridge; link Newark and Elizabeth and provide rail access to Newark International Airport; cut through the middle of Ocean, Monmouth and Middlesex Counties; link Philadelphia with growing southern New Jersey suburbs in Gloucester and Burlington Counties, and extend existing service in Morris County into Hackettstown in Warren County, on the far western edge of suburban north New Jersey.
Near Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, a major new track connection in Kearny and a new station in Secaucus would, for the first time, link existing commuter lines in Bergen, Passaic, Morris, Essex, Somerset and Union Counties with Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.
"All of these projects will more than double rail ridership in New Jersey," said Alfred H. Harf, N.J. Transit's assistant executive director for planning.
 
Trying to Reverse a Trend
 Since 1988, N.J. Transit has lost 4.4 million train passengers, the agency said. Annual ridership peaked at 45.3 million four years ago and has fallen to 40.9 million now, the agency said. Officials attribute the decrease to the recession and fare increases of 9.7 percent in 1989, 12.5 percent in 1990, and 9 percent in 1991.
Annual ridership on the transit agency's buses has also declined, from a peak of 140 million in 1986 to 119.4 million now.
Mr. Harf said agency planners were confident the proposed rail changes would win back train passengers. "I don't think we're taking a gamble," he said.
He said an eventual economic rebound, new development in urban areas and tighter Federal controls on vehicle emissions all boded well for public transit in the region.
Major financial questions still hover over much of the statewide rail expansion plan. The price tag is about $750 million for trains and tracks, improved signal and electrical systems, park-and-ride lots and small stations, and continued engineering and environmental studies.
About $688 million is earmarked under a new Federal transportation bill -- the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, sponsored by Representative Robert Roe, a Democrat from Wayne and the head of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. But the spending must be formally approved in annual installments through 1997. And it is unclear whether Congress and the Bush Administration will do so.
And in a potential problem building in Trenton, Republicans who control the Legislature have started talking about cutting $34.6 million from Gov. Jim Florio's proposed $67.1 million increase in N.J. Transit's operating subsidy.
The Susquehanna restoration has been spared the fiscal uncertainties of the rest of the plan. About $35 million of the projected $46 million cost has already been approved by Congress and the White House.
"It's a relatively low cost for new commuter railroad service," said Frank T. Reilly, executive director of Morris County's Department of Transportation. "The tracks are already in existence and being used every day for freight. They're in good condition."
N.J. Transit would use the tracks under an agreement with the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway Corporation of Cooperstown, N.Y.
 
Possible New York Link
 The new line would veer from the existing Bergen County Main Line in Hawthorne and run for about 30 miles through Midland Park, Wyckoff, Franklin Lakes and Oakland in western Bergen County; Pompton Lakes, Riverdale, Butler, Bloomingdale, Newfoundland and Oak Ridge in Passaic and Morris County, and then into Stockholm and Beaver Lake, two hamlets in eastern Sussex County, about an hour's ride from Hoboken.
N.J. Transit's buses in the area now carry about 3,700 passengers a day, the agency said.
Under the Federal transportation plan, the line is to end in Warwick, N.Y., just across the state line. But before they commit to that destination, New Jersey officials said they planned to ask New York State to pay some of the line's operating costs.

HEADLINE: Mexican Women, Doffing Old Ways, Join Exodus

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, June 1

 BODY:
When the husband of Esther Alvarez left their home in the northern city of Hermosillo to look for work in the United States, she took her first job, as a janitor, and told her two young children to expect their father back soon.
"He was going to go and make some money," Mrs. Alvarez said. "I don't know if he ever did." 
 Mrs. Alvarez was sitting by the fetid Tijuana River, awaiting the night. After it fell, she planned to climb the high metal barrier that separates Mexico from San Ysidro, Calif., run the gantlet of bandits and Border Patrol agents, and follow her husband's path. She said that she was not planning to look for him and that he had probably found another woman a long time ago. Instead, she said, she was going to make good on his promise for her children.
With hundreds of thousands of other women, Mrs. Alvarez, 35 years old, is part of a fundamental change in the tide of undocumented Mexican migrants to the United States.
After decades in which the flow was made up overwhelmingly of men traveling for seasonal work, the number of Mexican women crossing into the United States has risen sharply in recent years. Census and immigration data indicate that women now account for about half of the Mexican immigrants who settle in the United States.
Partial records of the Mexican adults caught crossing the border illegally show that the proportion of women among them has nearly doubled, from 8 percent to about 15 percent, since 1987.
Many of the women have gone to join husbands and other family members who gained amnesty under the 1986 immigration-reform law. Others have been sent for by fathers, husbands or boyfriends who, even without residency papers, have become more settled or financially secure. But sociologists and anthropologists who have studied the phenomenon say it also reflects a steady evolution in the roles that women are playing in a society defined for centuries by its rigid patriarchy.
Over the last two decades especially, Mexican women have grown more independent of their families. They marry later and have fewer children. Though they have been working outside their homes in growing numbers since the 1950's, the economic crisis that began in 1982 has pushed many more into the labor force.
The experience of being left behind by migrant husbands has itself often transformed the lives of Mexican women. In tradition-bound communities in the countryside, the sudden responsibility for homes and children has been the catalyst for a new self-confidence and autonomy, researchers say. Women who might not previously have made decisions about where to live are now insisting on joining husbands in the United States or seeking lives of their own there.
"These women are more and more in control of their own lives," said Mercedes Gonzalez de la Rocha, an anthropologist who studied women leaving an isolated farming village in the western state of Jalisco.
 
The Cultures Clash At Mexican Fiestas
 For the time being, there are only hints of how Mexican society might be changed by the exposure of so many more women to a culture in which women's independence is comparatively matter-of-fact.
In the central state of Puebla, the annual fiestas of towns that have long sent their men to work in the United States have become parades of suddenly clashing cultures. Women who have stayed behind dress in the braided hair and embroidered skirts of their great-grandmothers; those back visiting from "the other side" wear nylons, punk haircuts and costume jewelry.
In San Francisco or Chicago, Mexican women say the situation is sometimes reversed: women whose independence in Mexico has led to their trips north find themselves back to cooking, cleaning and caring for their children in insular communities that resemble rural Mexico as much as they do the next neighborhood.
Yet from about three dozen Mexican women interviewed in the United States or as they crossed the border came story after story of experiences not easily forgotten and of people who it seemed would not be the same.
Guillermina Bautista, now a domestic worker in Los Angeles, told how in one of many beatings she received from her alcoholic husband in their poor village in Oaxaca State he broke her nose. She retaliated by scalding him with hot soup.
"My mother almost killed me," the 29-year-old Ms. Bautista recalled. "She said, 'You don't raise your hand to your husband.' And I forgave him. I had to live with him. He was the father of my children. And what would people say if you did anything?"
After her husband left her, Ms. Bautista took her two small boys and sneaked across the border at Tijuana as he had. She said she did not look for him when she arrived in Los Angeles; he eventually found her through a sister of hers who lived there. And when Ms. Bautista refused to stay with him, she said, he again beat her badly.
"I called my sister," Ms. Bautista said. "She said, 'If you want to be done with this problem, this is what you do.' I called the Santa Monica police, and in the end they deported him."
 
Migration Changes The Age-Old Ways
 Telling her story at a Roman Catholic Church center in West Los Angeles after a meeting of the fledgling domestic workers' cooperative that she and other Mexican and Central American women have joined, Ms. Bautista seemed at once proud and taken aback by what she had done.
Other members of the cooperative nodded when Juana Campos, a 25-year-old woman raised in the western Mexican town of Zacapu, said: "Yesterday, in Mexico, you did everything without thinking about it. Things were the way they always were. Here, you have to understand things, to try to make them like you want."
Like the men who preceded them, the women who come to the United States are predominantly poor or working-class natives of a handful of western Mexican states. Relatively few are middle class or professional, in deliberate pursuit of freedom from the rules and social pressures that shaped their Mexican lives.
Magdalena Grijalva, 30, was of the minority. A former army nurse from the state capital of Oaxaca, she said she had gone to Los Angeles "fleeing" her former husband, an army doctor.
"Once we got married, he wanted me to stop working and dedicate myself to him," she said. "I always thought it was important to have a profession."
A survey of 718 women crossing into the United States from Tijuana found that only 10 percent said they were going to join their families; 67 percent said they were seeking jobs. "The fact that they are going to work tells you a lot about what has changed in Mexican society," said Ofelia Woo, a fellow at the College of the Northern Border, the research institute just south of Tijuana that conducted the study.
 
Men's Machismo Stays Strong
 In many traditional villages, as the contribution of women to the family economy has grown, their submissiveness has eroded; the men's machismo, their masculine pride, generally has not. Orlando Centeno, a machinist from the western state of Nayarit, summarized the situation while waiting to cross with his wife through a remote canyon at Tijuana's edge: "The woman in Mexico does what the man says."
Men's migration to the United States has often been understood as an expression of that balance of powers. Yet social scientists who have studied migrant communities say the prolonged absences of so many men have in fact turned some of those villages into a locus of change.
In the western state of Michoacan, the arrival of strawberry-packing plants in the mid-1960's opened up jobs to young women whose fathers or husbands often were not around to object, said Gail Mummert, an anthropologist who has studied women's migration from the state. In northern Michoacan, women have gone into the hog-raising industry. In other places, they now work as agricultural day laborers.
"Now, single women working are just generally accepted," Dr. Mummert said of the village she studied. She added that for the strawberry packers, for the young women who qualify as "spinsters" by staying unmarried past their early 20's, and for women whose autonomy has surged in their husbands' absence, the thought of seeking jobs in Los Angeles or Chicago, if not the obvious step, is far less radical than it might have been for their mothers or older sisters.
Standing along the Tijuana-San Ysidro barrier late one night, Griselda Nava Hernandez, 17, described the change in her Michoacan family. Her four sisters "think differently," she said. "They have husbands."
In San Miguel Acuexcomac, a town near the city of Puebla, the shift appears to have somewhat less to do with women's independent action. Unlike the earlier generations of men who traveled alone to Los Angeles, young San Miguel men now "steal" girlfriends, as the local saying goes, and take them along.
In the past, Mexican men have typically objected to the presence of their wives or girlfriends in the United States. Part of what has changed, researchers said, is that as more women have settled in the United States, they have constituted networks of support for the new immigrants.
Novel as it may be for women to lend each other money for the trip, lobby one another's husbands for their assent, or find each other jobs, such obstacles often pale against that of the border itself.
Dr. Rodrigo A. Munoz, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, who has treated some 200 immigrant women, said about half suffered from depression and nearly a fourth from post traumatic stress disorder. That diagnosis is perhaps most familiar to Americans from veterans of the Vietnam War.
Dr. Munoz said his patients were usually reacting to having been beaten or raped by their own smugglers or by bandits, or having been stuffed for hours in the trunks of cars. "The image I got is of a war zone with many victims," he said, describing southern San Diego County.
 
2 Women Are Lured Into Bondage in U.S.
 In a Tijuana shelter, Araceli Lopez, 19, told how two Mexican-American women that she and her mother had met there had lured them to San Diego with a promise of well-paid jobs as maids. But after having entered the United States on a nightmarish journey through a sewer pipe, Miss Lopez said, the women virtually enslaved her and her mother as unpaid servants. "We were very afraid," she said, "but we could not find anyone to help us."
On a shopping trip, Miss Lopez said, she and her mother bolted from the women and, mistaking a mall security guard for an immigration agent, tried to have the man arrest them. Finally, they hitched a ride to the border and walked back across.
Estela Munoz, 29, who sat on the Tijuana River levee with her friend Esther Alvarez, said that though she had crossed the border once before, she was no less terrified the second time. But having been abandoned by her husband and with four children to feed, she said she saw no alternative.
"I never thought I would be doing something like this," she said. "But I believed that man."
Mrs. Alvarez looked across the levee at the crowd gathering before the tall, black metal fence. "I don't know what's there," she said. "But it has to be something better than here."

HEADLINE: Got a Perot Headache? 8-Way Relief: REPUBLICANS;
Be Like Boris

BYLINE: By Vin Weber; Vin Weber, a Republican Representative from Minnesota, is not running for re-election.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A heavy burden of proof is descending on the Bush campaign. Its task, in the last five months of this election year, is to portray an incumbent President as an agent of change. It is difficult to underestimate the enormous problems the President will have trying to convince the public that after 12 years of a Bush-Reagan White House a vote for him is a vote for change, but this is what he must do.
To accomplish this task, he must do three things.
First, he must make significant personnel changes in the Administration and the campaign. This will no doubt be resisted as a sign of panic, but when the car is headed off a cliff, panic is justified. 
 Second, he must tell Congress that this election cycle poses a threat to our two-party system. If we are to restore confidence in our Government, this cannot be a business-as-usual year on Capitol Hill. The President must insist that Congress cancel all recesses and he must meet with its leadership to hammer out an agenda. This agenda should include economic growth, enterprise zones, welfare and health care reform, educational choice, and agreements on GATT and North American free trade. Most important, the President must map out a week-by-week schedule for enacting this agenda, announce it in advance, and hold Congress to it.
Third, he should challenge Congress to join him in forgoing junkets, vacations and campaign swings until the entire agenda is carried out.
Daunting? To be sure. But Americans have seen radical change take place in the old Soviet Union and they want it to take place here. Right now they're seeing George Bush as Mikhail Gorbachev and Ross Perot as Boris Yeltsin.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Jails Lawyer for Links With American

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
At a time when the United States is moving steadily but slowly toward lifting an embargo and establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, Hanoi has chosen to send a strong if perplexing message to its people against fraternizing with Americans.
In mid-May, a southern Vietnamese lawyer who had aided homeless orphans with the backing of leaders of the American antiwar movement was sent to prison for 12 years for maintaining ties with United States citizens. His crime -- an "anti-socialist act" -- was trying to go into business with an American who advocates ending the embargo against the Vietnamese. He was arrested with another Vietnamese and Michael Morrow, a former American journalist who uncovered the story of the My Lai massacre. 
 The case might have gone unnoticed here if the lawyer had not been Doan Thanh Liem and the charity he assisted and later directed had not been the Shoeshine Boys project.
The project, begun in 1968 by an American conscientious objector, Richard Hughes, captured the imagination of Americans who were dismayed by the war. In Saigon and Danang, Mr. Hughes set up homes for boys, some of them severely handicapped, who had known nothing but rough life on the streets. After Mr. Hughes left Vietnam in 1976, the project was ended, and the balance of the money he had raised was used for another program for homeless children.
The official hounding of Mr. Liem after the fall of Saigon in 1975, culminating in his arrest in 1990 and his trial last month, has provoked in recent weeks a volley of letters to Hanoi from leading members of Congress and George S. McGovern, the former Senator and Presidential candidate who was an outspoken critic of the war.
A May 18 petition to the Vietnamese Communist Party's Secretary General, Do Muoi, from dozens of American intellectuals and celebrities reads like a who's who of the antiwar movement. Among the signers are Ed Asner, Daniel Berrigan, Noam Chomsky, Jane Fonda, Frances FitzGerald, Tom Hayden, Seymour Hersh, Ron Kovic, David Rabe, Oliver Stone and Cora Weiss.
"If nothing else, it is severely damaging to Vietnam's efforts to rebuild and finally join the international family," said the petition to Mr. Muoi. "It is time, Mr. Secretary, for all of us to realize our dream that the war be truly ended, that all the wounds be healed, here and in Vietnam, and that suspicion and misunderstanding become a thing of the past."
The cases of Mr. Liem and Do Ngoc Long, another former manager of the Shoeshine Boys project who is also under arrest, are painful for Americans who consider themselves friends of Vietnam, Mr. Hughes said in an interview Sunday from his home in Manhattan. He is now an actor with the Circle Repertory Company and other theaters.
Mr. Hughes, branded a Central Intelligence Agency spy by hard-liners in Hanoi who seem to fear Western influence more than they want economic liberalization, said that for years Americans who had been in the antiwar movement chose to ignore repressive actions by Hanoi by saying they had to be understood "in a political context."
"I've reached a point where I said to Vietnam, this is no longer acceptable," said Mr. Hughes, who was forced to leave the country in August 1976, a year after the fall of Saigon.
"Vietnam was never about Vietnam," he said. "Vietnam was the defining event of a generation, but it was something to service everyone else except the Vietnamese."
Mr. Hughes said Vietnamese had told him that some officials are embarrassed by the treatment of his former aides, Mr. Liem and Mr. Long.
The two men were arrested in April 1990 along with Mr. Morrow, who planned to set up a consulting company to advise American businesses in Vietnam. Mr. Long, an economist, and Mr. Liem, the lawyer, had hoped to become partners in the joint venture.
Mr. Morrow was released after three weeks of detention in Ho Chi Minh City.
A month later, Mr. Muoi was again pleading publicly for help from industrialized nations in rebuilding Vietnam.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Hispanic Officeholders to Oppose Redistricting

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

 BODY:
The loudest objections to the Congressional redistricting plan expected to pass the New York State Legislature this week have come from incumbents who stand to lose their seats. But there are also protests from other groups, including Hispanic elected officials and abortion rights proponents.
A coalition of 17 Hispanic officeholders, including Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer and Representative Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat, plans to hold a news conference in Manhattan today to lobby against the redistricting proposal. Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Serrano expect to be joined by Hispanic members of the Legislature and the City Council. 
 Their concern is that the plan, designed by a panel of experts appointed by a state Supreme Court justice, would create only one new district in New York City with a majority of Hispanic voters, the proposed 12th District. A competing proposal, which was drawn by a Federal court, would create two such districts. Mr. Serrano is the only Hispanic Representative in New York's 34-member House delegation.
After months of inaction, the leaders of both houses of the Legislature endorsed the state court plan last week because it was more protective of incumbents than the Federal plan. The Federal plan also worried black leaders because it would siphon minority voters from the districts of black incumbents and place them in the new Hispanic districts.
The state chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action League is also disturbed by the state court plan because each of the incumbents endangered by the new map supports abortion rights. Because of population changes, the state's House delegation will shrink from 34 members to 31 this year.
 
Both Sides Now
 Any successful politician knows a bit about how to straddle a fence. But Howard C. Nolan Jr., a State Senator from Albany County, seems to have taken the concept a step further by trying to stand squarely on both sides of one.
On May 28, Mr. Nolan wrote to Lee P. Brown, New York City Police Commissioner, thanking him for a letter in which Mr. Brown urged him to vote against the bill that would require the city to arm its police officers with semiautomatic weapons.
"I completely agree with your views in this matter," Senator Nolan assured the Commissioner. "The Legislature should not mandate the use of semiautomatic weapons by police officers." He promised to "oppose this legislation when it comes before the Senate."
It did come before the Senate -- on the very day Mr. Nolan sent the letter to Mr. Brown. And, like the overwhelming majority of his colleagues, Mr. Nolan went along with the entreaties of police officers' unions and voted "yes" on the measure.
A politician's vote is supposed to speak for itself. What happened here? For the moment, unfortunately, that remains a mystery.
Mr. Nolan is on an out-of-state trip. Repeated calls Friday and yesterday to a telephone number at which he said he could be reached went unanswered. Members of his staff declined to discuss the vote, saying they could not explain the discrepancy.
 
Getting Mad, Getting Even
 To the old adage that it's not nice to fool Mother Nature, you might add the observation that voting against Peter F. Vallone can have some pretty serious consequences as well.
In the past, Mr. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, has stripped a dissenting colleague from two subcommittee chairmanships. Last week he made an excision from the $29.5 billion city budget that punished one of the two Council members who had voted against the budget.
Mr. Vallone took out $45,000 from the $80,000 discretionary fund of Charles Millard, an Upper East Side Republican. The money, sometimes referred to as "member items," is typically used by the Council members to help community organizations like mental-health centers or housing agencies in their districts .
Mr. Millard said he was dissatisfied that the budget process had focused on the $88 million in restorations made by the City Council rather than on revising the budget. "We only considered the $88 million crust surrounding a $30 billion pie," he said. "We just didn't see why he really needed all his items," said Peg Breen, Mr. Vallone's spokeswoman.
Aides to Mr. Vallone said that because Mr. Millard was so opposed to the budget, there was no need to finance his member-item budget.
The Speaker has not announced whether he will take any action against the other Council member who cast a negative vote, Adam Clayton Powell 4th.
Mr. Millard said the Speaker's action "sends a chilling message." "Dissent is good for everybody," Mr. Millard said, "even if you don't like what I'm dissenting about."
Whatever his colleagues may feel about the incident, though, only two of them, Ronnie M. Eldridge of Manhattan and Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn, both Democrats, have publicly criticized Mr. Vallone for the maneuver.
 
Cuomo Coins a Word
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has coined a new word as he cautions fellow Democrats against running too much of an anti-government, anti-insider campaign this fall: "Perotanoia."
"We don't need this kind of 'Perotanoia' that says, 'I'm going to attack all the existing government because that seems to be popular,' " Mr. Cuomo said last week on Fox Television's "Good Day New York." "The American people are angry, no question. But let's not feed the anger."
Mr. Cuomo said his advice applied from Bill Clinton, his party's all-but-certain Presidential nominee, all the way down to candidates for local office.
Aside from dispensing advice, Mr. Cuomo has apparently sent something else to the Arkansas Governor: one of his top aides. Gene Sperling, who for the last two and a half years was assistant to the Governor, developing national policy and helping to write speeches, left the Cuomo staff last week and signed on as a director of economic policy for the Clinton Presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: Zaire Seizes the Assets of Foreign Oil Companies

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, June 6

 BODY:
The Government has announced that it is seizing the assets of all foreign oil companies in an effort to ease chronic fuel shortages.
Officials say that the measure is temporary, that the companies will be reimbursed for petroleum supplies taken and that the equipment and property will be returned, although no date has been given. 
 In a statement, the Government said it had taken the action "in order to prevent the already sick national economy from dying of suffocation." From now on, it said, all petroleum products will be distributed and sold through Petro-Zaire, which is owned by the Government.
But oil industry officials and diplomats here fear that the assets have been effectively nationalized. The companies include the Chevron Corporation and the Mobil Corporation of the United States, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Britain and the Netherlands and Petrofina of Italy.
"We have no idea what will happen once the Government takes control," said a Western diplomat. He said it was doubtful that there was enough hard currency in Zaire's treasury to repay the companies.
The companies were first told of the Government's decision on May 29, and it was announced publicly in a brief statement on Sunday. Since then, both sides are said to have held marathon meetings in an effort to avoid what is widely seen as a potentially catastrophic economic development.
[John Lord, a spokesman for Mobil in the United States, said: "We have received word here that the oil industry has been nationalized, the Government says temporarily. We understand the oil industry in Zaire, which we're part of, is protesting this unilateral action." Mobil distributes lubricants and fuel in Zaire.]
[At Chevron International Oil Company, Peter McCrea, senior vice president, said Chevron had been ordered by the Government to sell oil products, at market price, to the Government rather than to commercial buyers. The Government action started May 29, he said.]
Chevron operates the only oil wells in the country, and produced about 20,000 barrels a day of oil last year. Those operations have not been affected, Chevron said.
According to American figures, consumption of oil in Zaire in 1987 was about 800,000 gallons a day, most of it diesel oil.
Jerome Nelson, president of the Zaire-American Chamber of Commerce, said, "This is one of many misguided attempts to correct an already tragic situation, and it reflects the fact that some people here really don't understand how the corporate world really works."
The decision to "requisition" the assets of the oil companies, as Government officials are calling it, is reminiscent of President Mobutu Sese Seko's campaign in 1971 to "Zairianize" the economy. With few exceptions, dozens of foreign companies were nationalized or put under private Zairian control, often without compensation.
By most accounts, the 1971 nationalizations resulted in chaos. Corporate treasuries were emptied by their new owners, supplies were depleted and investment came to a virtual stop. Zairians took over missionary schools and hospitals and sold the equipment, even doors and windows.
Those measures were largely reversed in the late 1970's, and the properties returned to their previous owners. But many owners, disillusioned, sold their interests, and the memory of "Zairianization" has lingered as a major disincentive to foreign investment.
The current cynicism stems from Zaire's deepening economic morass.
Prices are rising fortyfold each year, partly because of a huge budget deficit that developed after the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund in early 1990 and increased spending.
The national currency, the zaire, has depreciated rapidly against the dollar. In January 1990, the zaire traded at about 300 to the dollar; now the official exchange rate hovers above 200,000 zaire to the dollar, and at more than 250,000 on the black market.

HEADLINE: After 12-Year Fight, Ohio Incinerator Is Set to Open

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio, June 5

 BODY:
For 12 years, citizens of this gritty Ohio River town of 14,000 have battled a consortium of American and European investors who planned and built one of the nation's largest hazardous-waste incinerators in their backyard.
Now the incinerator is about to open. It is awaiting a ruling from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency on whether its proposed plan for three months of test burning meet with the agency's approval; if it does, and the tests are judged successful, the plant can start operating. 
 The decision is being watched closely, not only here but around the nation, where 18 commercial incinerators are already in operation with more than a dozen are planned or close to opening.
Critics and supporters alike say the Federal decision will send a signal about the future of the bitterly disputed technology of toxic-waste incineration. Recent Congressional action has put a cloud over the plant here. A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee decided to investigate the Environmental Protection Agency's role in granting an operating permit to the incinerator.
Congressional critics say the E.P.A. ignored its own rules in accepting an application that omitted the name of the landowner, the Columbiana County Port Authority in Ohio, and by allowing the incinerator to be built on land already contaminated by oil.
West Virginia, just across the river, has filed a Federal suit seeking an injunction that would keep the plant from operating, contending that Ohio and E.P.A. officials did not follow the laws in granting an operating permit.
The E.P.A. says any violations of rules were minor technical ones.
Problems abound at the approximately 160 private hazardous-waste incinerators in the nation, many operated by hospitals and industry. Last year, the E.P.A. and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found 400 violations of standards and regulations at 29 plants.
By law, these incinerators must burn 99.99 percent of all waste, leaving hardly any toxic residue; but studies show that incinerators often burn less than the required amount and emit hundreds of times more pollutants than are allowed by law.
Regulators and the industry say there is no evidence that incinerator emissions cause ill effects.
The site of the Ohio plant frightens many in this town. An elementary school sits on an bluff above the smokestack, 400 yards away, while some homes are closer. The incinerator is 100 yards from the river, a source of drinking water, on ground already contaminated with oil that leaked from storage tanks. And it is in a flood plain over two underground sources of fresh water, and in a valley where air inversions can trap pollutants.
When they proposed the incinerator in 1980, officials of the builder, Waste Technologies Industries of Little Rock, Ark., heralded it as the industrial salvation of East Liverpool, which in recent years has seen unemployment rise as high as 20 percent. Waste Technologies' officials said at the time that only harmless emissions would come from the stack.
 
Huge Tax Benefit Forecast
 But some citizens were concerned from the outset. "I had done some research, and I felt we were being lied to," said Rebecca Tobin, the 41-year-old wife of a county judge who devotes full time to opposing the plant. "Their presentations sounded like a smooth sales pitch."
When it opens, the operators expect the incinerator to gross $60 million a year. Plant officials say the incinerator will contribute $4 million a year to the city in property tax, plus $600,000 in fees for waste that is dumped, at $10 a ton for the city. The incinerator is to burn 60,000 tons of waste a year, mostly of paint products, from as far away as New York and Virginia.
Waste Technologies was founded in 1975 by Jackson T. Stephens, chairman of Stephens Inc., of Little Rock, one of the nation's largest investment banking companies. Officials at Stephens Inc. say the company sold its interests in Waste Technologies in 1990. The plant is now owned by Von Roll Ohio Inc., the American subsidiary of Von Roll A.G., a Swiss company.

HEADLINE: The Way It Was at Radcliffe

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 6

 BODY:
The Acting New York State Supreme Court Justice was arguing rather vehemently with Manhattan's Borough President.
"Are you sure we weren't allowed to wear pants to class?" Acting Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder of State Supreme Court in Manhattan asked. She said she thought she could recall riding to Harvard Yard on a bicycle. 
 But Ruth Wyler Messinger hooted. Summoning reserves of three-decade-old indignation, the Borough President said: "You biked in a skirt. We could never wear pants."
The non-nostalgic discussion of the dress code was one of many intense, and at times personal and emotional, exchanges at the 30th reunion of the 1962 class of Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., which ended this morning.
Several of its members are prominent public figures and elected officials in New York, but the class as a whole has its own collective identity -- and reputation.
 
Last of Their Kind
 The 300 graduates of the Class of '62 -- which also includes Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Controller and Senate candidate; Frances Fitzgerald, a war correspondent who won a Pulitzer Prize, and Ann Swift, a State Department official who was an Iranian hostage in the 1970's -- were the last to receive Radcliffe diplomas. The classes that followed were awarded degrees from Harvard University.
They consider that they came of age on "the fault line" between the convention-bound 1950's and the era of feminism, and many say they are still haunted by their experience.
If there is a parallel among men, it is not among the Harvard alumni of the same generation, who, when they meet, tend to charter giddy boat rides up the Charles River here or schedule lectures by famous professors on the economy and world affairs. The women's events are closer in spirit to reunions of Vietnam veterans, where participants mainly seek solace and support.
Linda Greenberg Davidoff, now the executive director of the nonprofit Parks Council and a longtime political organizer in New York City, said she wrote on her college application that after college she planned to "give lovely dinner parties with wonderful conversations." When her classmate Ms. Holtzman confided during their senior year that she was applying to law school, Ms. Davidoff recalled thinking, "I didn't know women could be lawyers."
 
Time Out From Politics
 Ms. Holtzman took a detour from her Senate campaign on Friday and flew to Cambridge, where she was warmly received by her classmates. Not known for warmth or spontaneity as a candidate, she came close to both in an impromptu speech to her fellow alumnae.
"She is so relaxed and personal," said a somewhat surprised Elinor Bernstein Balka, a New Yorker who has attended functions for Ms. Holtzman since she was the Brooklyn District Attorney.
And Ms. Messinger, who was not close to Ms. Holtzman in college and has remained neutral in the Holtzman primary race against three other candidates, including Geraldine A. Ferraro, gave a brief speech on Ms. Holtzman's behalf.
Both Ms. Messinger and Ms. Holtzman, two of the highest-ranking elected officials in New York, were not politically engaged in college, nor were they ardent feminists. They were wonks.
"I remember vaguely being aware that Ruth was very competitive in a very upfront way," said Cecily Morse Orenstein, who was the host at one reunion dinner at her house in Brookline. "I admired it -- she wasn't afraid of asking people what they got on their exams."
 
'Self-Contained'

Ms. Messinger, who planned to be a social worker and got married after her junior year, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
Liz Holtzman, was "very smooth and self-contained." said Barbara Graf Meyer, who was in the same dorm. "She had herself 'finished' before a lot of us did."
Others described Ms. Holtzman as having been"reserved" and "driven," but Ms. Holtzman remembered lighter moments, like cruising around Harvard Square in a Radcliffe friend's 1939 Plymouth roadster equipped with a Bombay taxi horn and a rumble seat.
Ms. Holtzman said she was oblivious in those days of sexual discrimination.
"It's the way things were," she said. "Nobody protested. We didn't know yet what was unfair. I felt privileged to be getting a Harvard education."
She remains proud of her one prefeminist act -- persuading the administration to drop its strict curfew rules.
 
The Diploma Rebellion
 It was during the Class of '62's college days that John F. Kennedy was elected President, the Berlin Wall went up and Fidel Castro spoke at Harvard. But the political event the women recalled most clearly was the "Latin diploma riot," a series of demonstrations held by Harvard and Radcliffe students who opposed the school's decision to write diplomas in English instead of Latin. The protesters were so boisterous that the police, armed with tear gas, were summoned.
Both Ms. Messinger and Ms. Holtzman credited their mothers, who worked, with inspiring them to pursue careers. Ms. Holtzman, unlike Ms. Messinger, never married.
"I didn't feel any social pressure," She said. "I wanted to find myself first." In that she was almost alone.
Patricia Sullivan, a director of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Manhattan, admitted she did feel enormous social pressure in those days. Like Ms. Holtzman, she is single.
"If anybody had asked me to marry them between April and September of 1962, I would have said yes," she said. "It appeared to solve so many problems."
 
Lectures and Discussions
 It was those sorts of remiscences that consumed four days also spent at lectures, conferences and group discussions. On friday morning, Ms. Messinger, wearing a Clinton button, a red AIDS ribbon, and carrying her clothes on her back in a biker's garment bag/knapsack, joined other classmates who are parents of gay and lesbian children in an in-depth discussion that also embraced child molestation and AIDS.
These lawyers, doctors, college professors and club women, some of whom are grandmothers, talked about a feminist "insurrection," mixing terms like empowerment and patriarchy with references to Strindberg and Fra Angelico blue.
Ms. Messinger explained that "self-revelation" had become important to her and to many classmates and that they mostly felt "safe" discussing such issues only among themselves.
They have been scrutinized by others.
As the last women to receive Radcliffe degrees, they were the subject of an amused 1962 New York Times Magazine article by Michael J. Arlen, the New Yorker writer who was then a freelance writer, a recent Harvard graduate and husband of a member of that class, Alice Albright. He called them "Radcliffe girls" and wrote that "Like graduates of other women's colleges," they "don't DO (italics sic) much of anything beyond marrying and raising children."
Twenty years later, some things have changed. Before the dinner at Ms. Orenstein's home, husbands weresent off to have dinner at a restaurant so the women could be alone. Peter S. Scholl, who said he was the second husband of Thalassa Hencken Scholl, tiptoed onto the balcony after dinner and listened quietly to the women discussing the environment, the economy and the presidential campaign.
"I'm a trophy husband," he said. "Pay no attention to me."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
All Eyes (or None?) Are on St. Petersburg

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Maybe if they scheduled enough doubleheaders, all of the teams that are mentioned as prime candidates for moves to St. Petersburg's forlorn domed stadium could play there. The long-deprived fans of Florida's west coast could root for the St. Petersburg Giants on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, the St. Petersburg Mariners on Mondays and Tuesdays and -- why not? -- the St. Petersburg Astros on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
"We'll take them all," said Rick Dodge, St. Petersburg's assistant city manager, who has worked feverishly for years to lure just one team to the city. 
 But schedule makers, hopeful fans and the Suncoast Dome ground crew shouldn't make their plans just yet. While there may seem to be logical and economic reasons for several teams to relocate, none is packing its balls and bats in boxes marked "for 1993 delivery."
The reason is that no team qualifies in an irrefutable, clear-cut way under Commissioner Fay Vincent's requirements for relocation:
1. Declining attendance and lack of fan support.
2. Out-of-date stadium with no chance of improvement or replacement in the near term.
3. Loss of money over an extended period.
4. Demonstrated lack of community (corporate and political) commitment.
Dodge, whose hard sell has developed into a diplomatic approach, said it is not for him to judge each prospective mover against the guidelines. But, he added, "the commissioner indicated in his last visit to Houston the nature of support in Houston made him question that marketplace, and in a visit to California, prior to the referendum in San Jose, he said the Giants had extended every effort to stay in the area."
The Mariners, Dodge said, also seem to meet the criteria.
"They're losing $8 to $10 million a year," he said. "They've never been successful in the marketplace, they have a questionable level of corporate and financial support."
Because voters in San Jose rejected a stadium referendum last week, the Giants are today's team on the verge of moving.
"Bob Lurie is pretty unusual in sports," Dodge said, referring to the Giants' owner. "Here's a guy committed to his area. He was going to put $35 million into his area. He has stayed through four disappointments. My feeling is if he wanted to relocate, he could get permission."
Baseball officials view the San Jose defeat as another show of no-support in the community; three previous referendums, two in San Francisco itself, were also defeated.
Candlestick Park is considered a poor park. Attendance last year was the Giants' lowest in five years. But the total of 1,737,479 also was the seventh highest in the team's 34 years in San Francisco and attendance is up this season.
So, do the Giants have an obvious case for relocation? Lurie, for one, is not saying. The Giants' owner has refrained from discussing his future plans publicly, preferring to talk first with the commissioner and Bill White, the lame-duck National League president, in New York this week during the owners' quarterly meetings.
The Mariners are in limbo, waiting to learn if the owners will approve their sale to a group headed by the Nintendo people. Jerry Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner and member of the ownership committee, has effectively delayed the approval procedure, leaving the impression that the opposition stems from the Japanese involvement in the prospective purchase.
If the owners reject the Nintendo group, they would be hardpressed to allow the current owner, Jeff Smulyan, to move the team to St. Petersburg. Although the Mariners consistently lose money, they drew a record attendance of 2,147,905 last season and the stadium presents no problem. The matter of community support is questionable.
Permitting a move after a rejection could give the city and county good grounds for a lawsuit, which is just what the owners need.
John McMullen, who salvaged the Astros for Houston 13 years ago, has been trying to sell the team for more than a year. He has not tried to sell to someone who would try to move the team, although he would enthusiastically entertain the possibility if he were told he could.
The Astros have a good stadium, refurbished at the owner's expense, and they make money because they have one of the majors' smallest payrolls. But they have no community support, and last year they had their lowest attendance since 1978, 1,196,152.
An owner's desire to move could face a roadblock even if the commissioner were to approve the franchise shift. Each league's owners have reason to want to keep a team out of St. Petersburg.
The National League might not want an established team playing in Florida while its expansion team tries to establish itself in Miami. The American League might not want a National League team in St. Petersburg because it would leave the A.L. out of the state.
Dodge has heard those arguments, but he rejects them.
"The South Florida market is totally distinct and not connected to our market at all," the St. Petersburg official said. "No Bucs fans go to Miami to see the Dolphins. No Heat fans go to Orlando to see the Magic play. This is a large state. The Marlins are not a Tampa Bay team."
But will the Giants, the Mariners, the Astros or anyone else become a Tampa Bay team?
 
Fleming Makes a Difference
 The first third of the season has produced no more remarkable achievement than the 8-1 record of Dave Fleming, the Mariners' rookie pitcher. The 22-year-old left-hander has an .889 winning percentage compared with .318 (14-30) for the Mariners in games when he hasn't had a decision. That is a 571-point difference, the biggest for pitchers with six or more victories and their teams.
Next biggest difference is the 543 percentage points between Bill Swift's 1.000 (6-0) and the Giants' .457 (21-25), but after that, no one is close.
Roger Clemens, for example, has an 8-3 record and a .727 percentage while Boston, in other games, has a 16-21 record and a .432 percentage for a difference of 295 points. Kevin Brown (8-3) and Texas (24-22) have a 205-point difference, Tom Glavine (8-3) and Atlanta (18-25) 308 points, Ben McDonald (7-2) and Baltimore (25-18) 197 points and Rick Sutcliffe (8-4) and Baltimore (24-16) 67 points.
 
Van Slyke Is Hurting
 Andy Van Slyke, Pittsburgh's witty center fielder, was talking about the fuss made recently over Bobby Bonilla's use of earplugs at Shea Stadium. "You'd think he exposed himself in the bullpen," Van Slyke said.
Van Slyke wishes something as simple as earplugs could alleviate his back problem. It has limited his power -- he hit only his second home run Friday night -- and it has restricted his noted ability for making diving catches in the outfield.
"Jose Offerman hit a ball in front of me," he said, speaking of the Los Angeles shortstop. "In the past, I would have dived for it. Then Mitch Webster hit the ball out of the ball park. It devastated me. I didn't throw the pitch, but I felt just as responsible."
The only diving catch he has made this year, Van Slyke said, was in spring training.
"I was fishing on a river bank in Florida, and I got this 10-pound bass," he related. "It started to flip back. I couldn't let it get away so I tackled it. Then I threw it back."
 
Another Puckett Admirer
 Watching a replay of Kirby Puckett's second grand slam in the space of six games, Jim Leyland, the Pirates' manager, shook his head in admiration.
"How does he do that?" Leyland asked. "The bases are loaded, he walks up to the plate, the fans are screaming, he's real patient, he gets a pitch he likes and whacks it out. No way I could do that. My legs would be shaking."
In a six-year minor league career as a player, Leyland hit four home runs.
 
Not-So-Funny Reaction
 Maybe it's the money, maybe it's a reflection of the serious problems society has, but too many people in and around baseball seem to have lost their sense of humor.
A few weeks ago, Richard Moss, a veteran representative of players, was discussing the increase in the number of players on the disabled list this season.
"With recent history," Moss said, "everybody assumes players will be on the disabled list. If a player stays healthy all year, he should get a bonus on top of his salary."
Moss's tongue was lodged firmly in one of his cheeks, but some people who read his comment took him seriously and sharply criticized him for saying that players' salaries aren't enough, that they should get extra pay for the accomplishment of not getting hurt.
Moss has come up with some innovative contractual ideas, but extra pay for full-season play isn't one of them.

HEADLINE: Let's Disperse the Family Values Smokescreen

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing as a psychiatrist who has dedicated his life to working with inner city populations, in response to the President's misguided blaming of poor family values for the uprisings in the inner cities. 
 By the early 1970's it was apparent we were building a welfare population because we were not allocating resources to help people escape from welfare. Regulations that forced fathers to leave home if families were to receive financial assistance were destroying family structure.
Funds were not allocated to day care and Head Start programs to help the poor children learn necessary academic skills. Curriculums for older children did not stress ways to become economically self-sufficient. I coached barely literate nurses' aides at New York City's Bellevue Hospital so they could tutor their children, which brought home to me the difference between the advantaged and disadvantaged. It was heartbreaking to see dedicated parents worry about their children and recognize that they did not have the skills or resources to help their children as my wife and I could help ours.
The missing values were not family values, but social compassion to provide education and support. Bellevue mothers, after a decade of trying to establish a day care center, have found it impossible to obtain funds for a haven that would improve work efficiency and provide a safe, educational environment.
My work with former addicts who receive support from the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in their struggle to become trained for employment has opened my eyes to a family structure different from that typical for the middle and upper classes. While many former addicts came from intact families, a larger number did not. They were reared by aunts, grandmothers or half-sisters. Very few were in foster care or adopted. Most often, the surrogate parents, in contrast to the addict's parents, were not abusers or alcoholics and tried hard to be helpful.
A large number of those who became addicted were poor learners and did not have the supports to master basic learning skills. Many of the better students were bored with school and did not have hopes for the future. Many found relief for low self-esteem and depression among peers who had dropped out, who provided sex, drugs and denial of reality. For most of the clients, parental support was limited.
These problems are not going to be altered by paying lip service to family values. Most, whether the families were intact or not, came from large families. As long as America has a climate that does not educate people to birth control or provide resources to educate our poor, we are going to meet women, like one I spoke with a few days ago, who want to be good mothers, but feel overwhelmed. She had just given birth to her fifth child. She enjoys men, can't seem to get married and has had a different father for each of the children.
Condemning people for not having family values similar to ours will not solve any problems, especially when we created the system that limited the possibility for many to have a traditional family. The poor have family ties, mostly as extended families in which stepsisters, aunts and grandmothers care for children. Our President has not had the experience to know that the majority of people in the inner city are serious and struggling to make something of their lives in the face of innumerable obstacles. Condemning them because some turn to drugs and sex for relief does not help solve problems.
Unfortunately, it was quickly apparent from the vantage of New York City's public hospitals that AIDS was going to become an epidemic while Washington told us it was not a disease of moral people, leading many to believe they were safe. Unless our leaders address the problems of the inner cities, all of us will gradually become engulfed by poverty as well as AIDS.

Hope and Pride

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As one who helped develop poverty programs in Anacostia and other hard-pressed Washington neighborhoods in the 1960's, I was appalled by Marlin Fitzwater's unsubstantiated accusations about those helpful programs (front page, May 5). It is outrageous for the Administration spokesman to assert that these programs led to the Los Angeles tragedy. 
 If the Vietnam War had not brought an end to these modestly funded, promising beginnings, and if the last 12 years had not been almost totally lacking in responsive social-educational follow-up, the nation's capital, especially Anacostia, might not be the "war zone" it is today.
Those who participated in the Anacostia model programs were unemployed and underemployed young men and women, primarily African-Americans, many who were residents of public housing, eager to improve life in the community for themselves and their families. Among their roles were to link people in their neighborhoods to health, education, employment and other services and, where services did not exist, to become an organized voice for obtaining them. Some participants went on to professional education.
Characteristic of this effort was a hope and pride in what neighborhood workers and others were able to accomplish beginning in their own inner city neighborhoods. It was the antithesis of the pain, anger and destruction that we have witnessed this spring in Los Angeles.

When the Market Is Tough, the Tough Try Marketing

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
SITTING in the sparsely furnished leasing office on the 22d floor of the 42-story office tower at 650 Madison Avenue, Noriko Knox, president of the International Marketing Group, co-agent for the building, tried to explain one recent morning why the owners, the Hiro Real Estate Company of Japan, had found it so hard to lease.
The company bought the building, between 60th and 59th Streets, in 1987, then renovated and expanded it. The total cost was not disclosed, but brokers calculated it would push the leasing rates above prevailing market levels. The building remained virtually empty for two years and today half of its 520,000 square feet of space still is vacant. 
 At another Hiro property, 1 Grand Place, the former Mobil Oil Building at 150 East 42d Street, 90 percent of the 1.6 million square feet is vacant (Mobil finished moving out at the end of 1990). None of the planned renovations has even been started yet.
Asking rents at both Hiro buildings range from $30 to $50 a square foot.
The Hiro Company gained a reputation of being tardy in responding to prospective tenants' requests and proposals.
"The owners are not here, they're in Japan," said Mrs. Knox. "They must review certain things. And since they are not here, a lot has to be explained to them. And that's not easy because the marketplace is changing so rapidly."
"Please understand," she added. "It's not that they were ever trying to delay or make difficulties for anyone."
Hiro, a privately owned company run by the Honzawa family, is trying to change its image from that of a concern that is tough to deal with to one that is aggressively pursuing tenants and willing to be flexible. Its effort is indicative of the problems faced now by Japanese commercial real estate investors in New York.
Consider the troubles the Kumagai Gumi Company has had with the Americas Tower, a 50-story, million-square-foot building at 1177 Avenue of the Americas, between 45th and 46th Streets. Beset by financial and legal difficulties with a domestic joint-venture partner that halted construction for more than a year, the building was finally completed last month. Not one lease has been signed.
While some of the difficulties faced by the Japanese may indeed have stemmed from attempts to micro-manage from a distance -- compounded by cultural misunderstandings, according to Mrs. Knox -- brokers say that a lot of their current problems have just as much to do with the timing of their purchases and the excessive prices many of them paid.
A survey compiled by Cushman & Wakefield in cooperation with Mistubishi Trust and Banking Corporation shows that virtually all Manhattan commercial properties acquired by Japanese investors were bought between 1986 and 1988, when prices were at their highest. The survey lists 39 Manhattan buildings with 16 million square feet of space bought for a total of $5.9 billion. More than a dozen Japanese partnerships, companies and syndications were involved.
But the peak was not easy to see from across the ocean because the slide in the dollar had made even peak prices look relatively cheap, recalled Gary Barth, managing director in New York of Jones Lang Wootten, international commercial brokers and consultants. Moreover, with property prices still soaring in Japan, nobody worried because even a high price, it was calculated, would look in two or three years like it had been a bargain.
"They were also willing to pay more than the domestic buyer because they took a much longer view and had access to cheaper financing," added Mr. Barth.
And with a long history in their own country of demand constantly outstripping supply, "the object was to get the product at all costs," added Stephen B. Siegel, president of Edward S. Gordon, the commercial brokerage.
EVEN after overbuilding, recession-generated cutbacks in office space needs and the financial troubles of domestic owners began putting leasing rates into a free fall, Mr. Barth recalled, companies like Hiro held out for top dollar in the expectation that the market would quickly rebound.
"They were slower to adjust to the need to compromise than the domestic owner," he asserted.
But that strategy is changing. According to Mr. Siegel, the financial and liquidity difficulties many of these companies face in their own country -- plus the prolonged drain of a negative cash flow -- have created pressure to alter course.
"They've now been asked to get these buildings leased up as fast as possible and sell some of them to recapitalize the companies back home," he said. And no building in Manhattan is easily salable today unless it is fully leased, he said. (Mrs. Knox declined to comment on any plans Hiro might have to sell.)
A company that does sell today may not get even 50 percent of what it paid, said Darcy Stacom, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, who works with overseas investors. She cited as an example 1 East 57th Street, a 67,000-square-foot building bought by a Japanese investor in 1987 for $800 a square foot. A comparable building just opposite, 730 Fifth Avenue, she notes, was sold in 1991 for only $300 a square foot.
But not all the Japanese are suffering. An exception has been Mitsui Fudosan. The company, a giant in the field, bought the 1.9-million-square-foot former Exxon Building, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets, in 1986 and completed construction on 461 Fifth Avenue, a 205,000-square-foot building on the corner of East 40th Street, in 1989. Both buildings have been about 80 percent leased since Mitsui's involvement with them. Junichi Kogo, senior vice president for Mitsui Fudosan (New York), said that it helped to have been given a great deal of local autonomy.
"TO do business in New York you have to be able to make decisions quickly or you lose the tenants," he said. Another plus, Mr. Kogo said, has been the Mitsui approach to financing. The company either pays all cash or finances operations with corporate rather than project-based financing.
"This way we don't have anyone else making our decisions with us," he added, referring to the practice of some lenders of maintaining veto power over the terms of leases signed for space in buildings on which they hold mortgages. Mr. Kogo argued that this has helped the company adjust more rapidly to highly competitive conditions.
Nevertheless, brokers have found that the overall ride has been so bumpy for most Japanese investors in Manhattan that it has made all of them wary of bottom fishing even though they may have the resources to pick up some spectacular bargains in the coming months.
Even Mitsui is holding back.
"In the short term it's far too risky," said Gregory Sutherland, Mitsui's vice president of management and leasing. "But real estate is cyclical. And we could be ready to move on the right signals."

A picture caption in the Real Estate section last Sunday with an article about Japanese investors in Manhattan misstated the current occupancy of an office building constructed by Mitsui Fudosan at 461 Fifth Avenue. It is 97 percent leased, not 80 percent.

HEADLINE: A Tough Market For Summer Jobs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Ervin R. Schanes, then a product manager at General Foods in White Plains, was alarmed by the number of teen-age participants in the Watts riots in Los Angeles. He came up with an idea to help minority and disadvantaged young people in Westchester understand the workings of American business, by giving them a chance to work in the corporate world.
"The management of General Foods thought the idea was good and decided to develop it into a program called Operation Opportunity," said Deborah Shields, manager of community affairs for the company, which is now Kraft General Foods. "Since Operation Opportunity began a quarter of a century ago, more than 1,500 junior and senior high school students have gone through the program." 
 The program provides young people from low-income families with summer jobs. It also helps them go to college. "Every dollar they earn on the job is matched with a dollar from Kraft General Foods, which is put in an escrow account for them," Miss Shields said.
 
90 Companies Provide Jobs
 This summer, despite the worst job market in 50 years, 55 students from 8 Westchester high schools will be employed at Kraft General Foods in White Plains, in jobs ranging from working with computers and acting as sales and marketing assistants to serving as research laboratory helpers.
Ninety other companies are also committed to providing jobs for young people this summer, under the Summer Jobs for Youth program, a public-private partnership designed to provide young people from low-income Westchester families with summer work experience. Summer Jobs for Youth matches job openings with qualified high school graduates or college students 16 through 21 years old.
The program is a joint effort of the Westchester and Yonkers Private Industries Councils, with support each year from a different corporate sponsor. This year the lead organization is the New York Power Authority. Since its inception, the program has found summer jobs in Westchester companies for more than 6,500 students. The sponsors are responsible for recruiting corporate participants.
"Finding jobs for the students has been harder this year," said John C. Brons, president of the Power Authority. "But in these tough times, it's doubly important to give young people a chance."
 
Firms Asked to 'Dig Deeper'
 The program is one of the most successful in the nation, Mr. Brons said. "In the face of what has happened in Los Angeles, we have been urging companies to dig deeper and come up with the jobs," he added. "Education becomes more meaningful when students are able to use what they have learned in school on the job."
For some students in the Kraft General Foods program, the summer job may lead to full-time employment and a career with the company.
Allan Edgar is an example. Mr. Edgar, 24 years old and a graduate of Mercy College who majored in business administration, was a junior at Woodlands High School in Hartsdale when his adviser suggested that he apply for the Kraft General Foods program.
"I was lucky," Mr. Edgar said. "I had an interview, and I got a job maintaining equipment in the audio-visual department, which I had for two summers. The experience gave me a jump start. Working at General Foods opened my eyes to real life. I saw the value of an education. I come from a family of five kids, so without that money to get me started in college, I would probably have procrastinated and maybe never gone."
After graduating from college, Mr. Edgar, who lives in Greenburgh, said he explored various job possibilities by working as a temporary at General Foods. He feels that he has embarked on a good career as a members' service representative in the Kraft General Foods credit union.
 
At 18, Her Fourth Summer
 "I give members advice and counsel them and help them with loans," he said. "It's interesting and rewarding work."
Donna Catwell, 18 and a graduate of White Plains High School, has just finished her freshman year at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass. Ms. Catwell spent the last three summers working in the sales and promotion department of the dessert division, known for Jell-O, puddings, cheesecakes and similar Kraft General Foods products.
This year she is back at Kraft General Foods as a coordinator of the Operation Opportunity program. "Donna will be acting as my liaison with the students," Ms. Shields said.
As for Ms. Catwell, who said she wants to be a lawyer, her work experience at Kraft "gave me a great chance to earn a salary and save money besides," she said. "The money deposited for me by Kraft General Foods paid for my freshman year at college."
 
Employers Are Said to Benefit, Too
 Underscoring the importance of the summer jobs program are countless success stories, said Mr. Brons, at the New York Power Authority. "In our company, for instance, a student who was turned on to science after spending a summer in our nuclear engineering department, has gone on to a promising career."
And almost equally important, Mr. Brons said, the program benefits employers.
"One thing I feel strongly about is to dispel any perception of the program as an exercise in charity," he said. "We are not giving these kids make-work. They are all qualified and trained and pre-screened before they go out on an interview.
"What they are is a good source of employees for companies. And as a further inducement, the companies that hire them don't pay a cent in fees. Instead, they get a tax credit of $600 for hiring a student for a summer job, which goes up to $3,000 if a student is offered a permanent job."
 
Fewer Jobs Than Last Year
 Renee Guy, director of the Westchester County Private Industry Council, and Dr. Marvin W. Lewis, director of the Yonkers Private Industry Council, both said that finding more and more jobs was crucial to the program's success.
"In this economy it has been difficult," Dr. Lewis said. "Last year at this time we had 450 jobs committed. This year, 302. At the same time we have more young people, especially those of college age, who need jobs really badly this year."
Dr. Lewis said he has been doing a lot of cold canvassing in search of jobs. "This year I have been trying to sell the value of the program to smaller companies that have never been in it before. I was able to get commitments from several retail stores in Yonkers, and from the Philharmonic Office in Dobbs Ferry."
Raymond T. Murphy, general manager of the Westchester field division of the United States Postal Service in Mount Vernon, said the Postal Service has agreed to provide 20 jobs for the program.
"We have been participating in this since 1985, and as an employer I can honestly say that the caliber of the employee we get is very high," Mr. Murphy said. "The young people we get are qualified for work as summer replacements such as clerks and mail distributors throughout our offices. We have about a 50 percent repeat every year."
 
An Incentive for College
 The summer job she got through the program gave Claudette Anderson the incentive to go to college.
Ms. Anderson, a recent graduate of Hampton University in Virginia, said that working summers while she was in high school at the Fairview Country Club in Greenwich gave her more confidence in her own abilities.
"On the job, I found that I could handle responsibility, and I was pretty good at organization," she said. "I also realized the value of education if I wanted a career, not just a job."
Employers or students who are interested in the Summer Jobs for Youth program can contact the project director, Nancy Gold, at 285-3398 for additional information.

HEADLINE: Jones Beach, at 40, Rocks to a Young Sound

BYLINE: By NANCY HARRISON

 BODY:
NOTHING special is planned for the 40th anniversary of the Jones Beach Marine Theater this summer. Just a banner saying "40th Anniversary: Jones Beach Theater," which will hang between Sections 8 and 10, and a visit planned for tomorrow by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Otherwise, it will be business as usual at the amphitheater, which will continue its nine-year tradition of presenting concerts, a far cry from the lavish revivals of Broadway musicals for which the theater became widely known and that eventually became financial failures. 
 "We have never celebrated any of the theater's anniversaries," said the director of operations, John Norbeck.
 
3 Guitars and 3 Voices
 The folk-rock group Crosby, Stills and Nash will open the season on Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. "It will be three guitars, three voices and songs, and that's it," one of the singers, Graham Nash, said in a telephone interview. "We are going back to the basics. Audiences really like the simplicity. They really like that there are no girls in garter belts and tight leather and dwarfs' throwing food in slow motion."
Despite the recession, ticket sales are up 15 percent over last year, according to Ron Delsener, who produces the concert series. In the first week of ticket sales, he said, Rush, on June 20; John Mellencamp, July 13 and 14; Paula Abdul, July 17, and the New York Rock and Soul Revue, Aug. 23, sold out.
Additional dates were added. They are July 15 for Mr. Mellencamp, July 18 for Ms. Abdul and Aug. 24 for the revue.
The increase reflects the national trend at concert arenas, according to Amusement Business, a trade newspaper. "Amphitheaters tend to book the same acts," the editor, Tom Powell, said. "And this year they are presenting stronger acts like Paula Abdul who tend to attract larger audiences."
"Part of the reason we are doing so well this year is because bands are sharing the bill with other bands," Mr. Delsener said.
This year 13 concerts at Jones Beach feature more than one act. "What ends up happening," Mr. Delsener said, "is that each act brings in fans, filling the stadium.
On the morning that the box office opened, on May 16, thousands of fans lined up in the rain to buy tickets. Jonathan Sepplow, 27 years old, of East Meadow, waited three and a half hours to buy tickets to Crosby, Stills and Nash, James Taylor and Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
"It is worth the wait," he said. "This place is so small that no matter where you sit you have good seats."
With the addition of 500 orchestra seats this winter, the theater now has a capacity of 11,000. It also has a new concrete floor and drainage system and a larger stage, thanks to a two-year $6 million facelift that was completed this spring.
Last year, a food court, souvenir booth and new restrooms were constructed in the lobby area, and dressing rooms and a hospitality suite were added backstage. The renovations were paid by Mr. Delsener, who signed a 10-year lease with the state, which owns the theater, in 1990.
"One of the conditions was that whoever leased the stadium would have to spend at least $4.8 million on renovations," he said. "Some of the facilities were antiquated or falling apart."
Mr. Delsener made the investment because, he said, he hopes to extend his lease into the 21st century. Since he assumed the lease in 1983, Jones Beach has made a profit, having netted nearly $1.5 million in 1990 alone. The promoters pay the state a percentage of the ticket sales, which average about $1 million a year, Mr. Delsener said.
A decade ago, the theater was on the brink of financial ruin. The Broadway shows that Jones Beach had been presenting stopped drawing audiences. For 1982 alone, the state's Park and Recreation Commission reported a loss of $800,000 for the theater.
 
Wood Stadium Was Razed
 The state fought hard to find another use for the amphitheater, which was rebuilt in 1952 after the original wood stadium was razed.
Between 1954 and 1977, Guy Lombardo, a resident of Freeport, produced musicals like "South Pacific" and "The King and I" at Jones Beach. In the early 1980's, other producers experimented with other formats, including a bill featuring Phyllis Diller and John Davidson.
Mr. Delsener was the first to try rock-and-roll concerts at Jones Beach.
"Quite honestly," Mr. Norbeck said, "Ron Delsener took a risk, which paid off, because he knows the business he is in. And he knows what is going to work."
Mr. Delsener was reared in Queens and graduated in 1959 from New York University, where he majored in management. After working in advertising, he took a job with the promoters at the Forest Hills Stadium in 1964.
Mr. Delsener produced the Central Park Music Festival from 1966 to 1980, the Simon and Garfunkel reunion concert in 1980, the Rolling Stones at Shea Stadium in 1989, rock shows at Carnegie Hall in the 70's and concerts at Madison Square Garden.
"I knew rock concerts would work at Jones Beach," he said, "because music sells tickets. You know why? When young people go out on dates, they go to either concerts or the movies.
"The best time for concerts is the summer, because young people are off from school and adults are on vacation. Everyone has more leisure time."
 
Onward From Rock-and Roll
 Jones Beach has expanded, presenting country, jazz, dance and show music. The performers can use a speedboat, a hospitality suite, dine on gourmet food and play on basketball courts for recreation.
Crosby, Stills and Nash have appeared at Jones Beach more than 10 times in the last decade. "We've always had a good time at Jones Beach," Mr. Nash said. "I think it has something to do with New Yorkers, the outdoors and the nice weather."
Eric Clapton was the first rock star to appear at Jones Beach, and state officials were not prepared for the traffic or the rowdy crowds.
"We were used to older people," Mr. Norbeck said. "Now all of a sudden we had young people. We just assumed they would leave the theater in an orderly fashion, and there was a log jam in the parking lot."
To deal with the younger crowd, security agents were assigned to the stadium, and the park police were deployed in the parking lot. In addition, a traffic plan was instituted to ease congestion. The road leading to the amphitheater was closed to passing traffic so that customers could exit.
 
Alcohol Banned in 1985
 In 1985 the theater banned alcohol, Mr. Norbeck said, "because we had some problems with disruptions and rowdiness during concerts.
"There was skepticism that we couldn't have a rock concert series without alcohol," he added. "But I think part of the reason people come here is because they know there won't be any problems."
Last year Mr. Delsener donated all the leftover food from the concession stands to a soup kitchen in Rockaway. He plans to do that again this year. He also produces free children's shows and Shakespeare in other state parks on the Island.
"I want to give something back to the community," he said.

HEADLINE: Prompted by Recession, More Couples Are Choosing City Hall Weddings

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES

 BODY:
IN his 16 years as Mayor of Hamilton Township in Mercer County, John Rafferty has performed more than 3,000 weddings, by all accounts the most of any mayor in New Jersey. But his counterparts around the state are catching up.
Interviews with more than two dozen mayors indicate that they have been presiding over increasing numbers of marriages in recent years. In part, they say, that is a tribute to the recession: a simple ceremony at the town hall costs far less than the traditional church wedding. 
 But the growing call for the mayors' services, they say, also reflects cultural changes, like increased religious intermarriage. "Many people seek a civil ceremony to avoid a problem," said Clinton's Mayor, Robert Nulman. "They don't have to make a decision on which religious sect officiates."
Other mayors say the simplicity of the civil rite is particularly appealingto the ever-larger number of couples who are marrying for the second or third time and have no desire for an elaborate religious ceremony.
Today's mayors are also inclined to be more flexible about traveling away from the town hall to perform a ceremony. Thomas Dunn, the Mayor of Elizabeth, has married couples in hotels, pubs, housing projects and hospitals -- some of them the children of those he wed when he first took office 28 years ago.
Barbara Hill, the Mayor of Flemington, has set aside an autumn Saturday for a couple who want to be married on the Black River and Western Railroad train that runs from Flemington to Ringoes.
And Mayor William G. Gaffney of Cape May recalled: "One couple, wearing khakis and carrying telescopes, were joined on a nature trail by their bird-watching friends. As I pronounced them husband and wife, I remember some hawks flying overhead."
A 1910 state law vested mayors with the authority to tie the marriage knot, and just two mayors of major cities, Newark and Passaic, have refused to perform marriages and left the task to municipal judges.
Douglas Palmer, the Mayor of Trenton, who took office in 1990, broke with his predecessor's 29-year tradition of not officiating at weddings. Mayor Palmer, who averages four weddings a week, wears a black robe and an African scarf around his neck. He said he had memorized the marriage service so that he could look directly at the bride and the bridegroom.
By and large, mayors seem to view their marrying duties as among their favorite official acts. "It's an occasion where everyone is happy," Mayor Gaffney said. "People aren't pressuring you to do them a political favor, and at the end everyone is grateful."
Mayors also seem to take their responsibilities very seriously. For Robert Depue, who became Mayor of Boonton in January, his first ceremony was the hardest. Laughing, he said, "I had only seen the backs of brides and grooms at weddings, but this time I was face to face with the couple, and I was probably just as nervous as they were."
Upon pronouncing them husband and wife, the Mayor said, he thought: "This is incredible; I have just married someone. It is such a solemn, human act."
 
Redecorating the Office
 After the Mayor of Camden, Aaron Thompson, performed his first wedding ceremony in 1990, he decided that his fourth-floor office in City Hall was too barren a setting for matrimony, so he rearranged the furniture, put the lectern by a window and placed on it his mother's family Bible and fresh flowers.
Mayor Dunn of Elizabeth expects the bride and the bridegroom to view marriage seriously, and he says that attitude should be reflected in their demeanor before the ceremony. If he feels it is not -- if they are wearing T-shirts and jeans, for example -- he will suggest a waiting period. "When they return, they thank me," he said.
Mary Hamilton, the Mayor of Peapack-Gladstone for 14 years, requires that couples confer with her before the ceremony; she always asks if they have considered a religious service.
She recalled just one "failed marriage" she had officiated at, involving two young people she was sure were not ready for marriage. "They insisted that they were," she said, "and I couldn't say I would not marry them."
 
A Poodle at the Ceremony
 Once the mayors get talking about their marrying experiences, the tales come pouring out. Mayor Rafferty of Hamilton Township recalled the marriage of the owner of a Trenton tavern with a name based on that of a pet poodle, Bogart. "The poodle," he said, "wearing a little tuxedo, sat right by the groom. Like a good little poodle, for part of the ceremony, he stood on his hind legs."
Atlantic City's Mayor, James Whelan, told of the wedding of a man and a woman who pushed rolling chairs on the Boardwalk. They were wheeled in their individual chairs to the wedding ceremony he conducted outside Convention Hall. "Once they were married," the Mayor said, "they settled in one chair with the best man heading them toward the reception."
The Mayor of Princeton Township, Richard Woodbridge, recalled overhearing a couple he had just wed talking about their imminent church wedding. The Mayor took the bridegroom aside and questioned him about the double services.
"It was a backup marriage," Mayor Woodbridge said. "His reasoning was that he didn't want to get to the altar and experience a change of heart." The civil marriage removed that option.
 
Averting Near Chaos
 The Mayor of Paterson, William Pascrell Jr., said that his skills as a conciliator had sometimes averted near chaos. "The problem at one wedding," he said, "began with soccer balls and the couple's translators' inability to communicate."
The bride was Hispanic and the bridegroom was Arab, the Mayor said, and he finally put out a call in City Hall for more interpreting help. Finally, he started the ceremony in front of 35 guests, including eight children, and all went well until the children grabbed two soccer balls from the mantel in his office and started a game. Eventually the soccer balls were retrieved, the service was concluded and sandwiches were passed around.
Each mayor has his or her own style of presiding at the ceremonies. Mayor Janet Whitman of Summit, for example, uses the wording in the Book of Common Prayer, but because she believes that "who bringeth this woman" sounds too much like herding sheep, she said, she changed it to "who giveth."
Noting the increase in the number of weddings she was conducting, her family bought her a "marrying" suit.
"Black was too somber, white in competition with the bride, and red too flashy," she said. "We settled on a glen plaid."

 
Different Attitudes on Fees
 The mayors also have different attitudes about receiving fees for their marriage services and the disposition of those fees. Mayor Dunn of Elizabeth has never accepted a penny, he said. Many other mayors, when offered compensation, direct the money toward specific causes or tell the couple to donate to their own favorite charity.
Mayor Palmer of Trenton asks for a $25 stipend, which is passed along to the city's soup kitchens. Following in the tradition of the late Barbara Sigmund, the former Mayor of Princeton Borough, the present Mayor, Marvin Reed, suggests that a contribution be made to the Mercer County battered women's shelter, Womanspace, in Trenton.
Some mayors have strong feelings about the fees. On the day that Mayor Nulman of Clinton was to spread the ashes of his son, killed by a drunken driver, he was scheduled to perform a wedding. "The bride-to-be called and said they didn't expect me to do it," he recalled, "but I decided it would only take 15 minutes and I had a commitment to them."
Ever since, any wedding fees he has received have gone toward a scholarship fund in his son's name.
The Mayor of Cinnaminson, James Bristow, frequently donates marriage fees to the American Cancer Society in memory of his 10-year-old daughter, Suzanne, who succumbed to the disease.
Mayor Bristow said he charged no set fee. One couple, who arrived at the town hall in a limousine, presented the Mayor with a coupon for a free pizza after the ceremony. A 19-year-old bridegroom gave the Mayor $100, which was returned with the suggestion that he use the money to take his bride out to dinner after the honeymoon.
There are weekends when, after performing one wedding after another on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mayor Bristow has the sense that he has been neglecting his own wife, Diana. On such occasions, he said, he is likely to walk in the door and call out, "Let me treat you to dinner tonight."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Robert M. Ricard;
Coming to the Rescue of the City Tree

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AS Connecticut's forests break out into full spring glory, Robert M. Ricard is worried that the trees that need the most attention are being ignored.
Mr. Ricard is an urban and community forester in the University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension Service, charged with helping develop programs to protect city trees. 
 According to estimates by various professional forestry organizations, one tree over a 50-year lifetime produces $31,250 worth of oxygen, and provides $62,000 of air-pollution control by removing harmful particles and breaking down toxic compounds. In fact, court decisions have held that the average mature shade tree has a replacement value greater than $2,000.
Mr. Ricard has been with the extension service for a year. Before that he was executive director of the Massachusetts Forestry Association.
He studied environmental education at Linden State College in Vermont and earned a master's degree in forestry at the University of New Hampshire and another master's in silviculture at the University of New Brunswick in Canada.
Mr. Ricard was recently interviewed at his office in the Middlesex County Extension Office in Haddam about the plight of urban trees. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q: In general, how would you rank the health of Connecticut's urban trees? 
A: Poor, at best. In Connecticut, 64 percent of the state is forested. If you go out into the prairie states, where Arbor Day started, where they have aggressive city forestry programs, people wonder why we're focusing on city trees when there are so many in the forests.
But the trees in our cities aren't very healthy, and if we don't replace them when those trees go, there will be nothing in their place. The age structure of our urban forest is skewed towards very old trees.
Q: What Connecticut cities would you say have the best urban forests?
A: That's almost kind of unfair, because the resources vary so much. A town like Greenwich has a $600,000 budget, and they obviously are doing a good job. Then you have a town like Winsted, which is in dire need of new trees and has only a tiny budget, but they've done a tremendous job with volunteer citizen support, and they've been able to secure funding from various sources.
If there's any town that's done the best so far it's Middletown, because we were able to secure a grant for them from the U.S. Forest Service to set them up as a model for cities of 50,000-plus. They're doing very well. Madison is doing very well, almost entirely through citizen volunteers. Hartford is doing pretty well through its city forester and a private group, Hartford Trees.
Q: What cities are in the worst shape?
A: The mill towns are clearly in the worst shape, as well as the forests in housing projects. Through urban renewal in the 1960's and 1970's, landscaping trees were not a priority, and many of these communities are two-story apartment complexes that are not shaded. Merely because in the summer months they are ovens, the housing projects should be a priority for communities.
The urban forests in mill towns, in my estimation, are clearly in great need because they do not have the budgets, and most do not have qualified professionals, to care for their urban forests.
Q: Do urban trees provide any tangible benefits beyond oxygen recycling and pollution control?
A: Oh, absolutely. More than anything they provide an economic benefit. There has been research that has shown that trees on private property enhance the value by 10 or 20 percent. In a downtown situation, towns that are 'treed' enjoy better business, because it creates an environment in which people are more comfortable.
Q: Given that kind of value, why are trees abused or neglected in an urban setting?
A: People don't realize trees are, just like an animal, they are an organism. They are a biologically functioning unit, and they have needs just like an animal. They need to obtain food and water and light. People view trees as virtually indestructible, that they're there like a statue almost. People don't understand they grow, mature, rot and die, so they need aggressive management in stressed situations. In an urban setting, trees are placed in very man-constructed, man-abused situations, and it requires constant vigilance.
Q: How do the stresses differ for  an urban tree from a rural one?
 A: They're abused from a mechanical point of view, such as a car hitting them, or chains wrapped around the trunk. The cambium layer, right under the bark, can be very prone to damage. If the cambium is damaged it affects the transport system that brings water and nutrients from the soil to the leaves, and sugars down from the leaves into the roots. But one of the most striking problems in an urban environment is the ground. In a forested or suburban lawn setting, tree roots are able to grow out and find good soil. In an urban situation it's a concrete hell, and the roots are confined.
Q: There are so many diseases and pests such as white pine blight and hemlock woolly adelgid. Are these affecting urban trees differently?
A: One of the problems is many of these pests are brought over, they're not native to the trees here, so the tree species and these pests have not co-evolved and the tree has no resistance. The adelgid is a foreign pest, for instance. But any tree under stress is more likely to be severely injured from a pest attack or disease. Most species can withstand attack from a pest, but if it's under stress it's more likely to be damaged, and most trees in an urban setting are severely stressed.
Q: What are a few trees that do best in an urban setting?
A: In Connecticut, some of the trees that do best are exotics, non-native species. An Asian species called gingko is very hardy. Another that's been widely planted is the Norway maple, but that's resulted in a problem in that it's almost overplanted. From a biodiversity standpoint, we have too many Norway maples -- in some areas it's almost 50 percent. They have increasingly had insect problems, and they're aggressive growers, so if they're planted too near sidewalks they will rip them apart.
Q: How many towns make an effort to replace trees they take out?
A: We have done several surveys, and I would say upward of half the towns have some organization or allocate municipal funds for tree replacement. But the range of dollars available for that purpose is huge, from Greenwich, a fairly wealthy community with a healthy budget for its tree program, to a lot of smaller towns say, in Windham County, that allocate no dollars for tree planting. In a lot of towns the only money available for tree maintenance is for removal. Unfortunately, our trees are old in this state, from the rural forest to the city forest.
Q: Why isn't more emphasis put on replacement?
 A: That's another thing people have trouble understanding, that trees age and they have a lifespan, and that they at some point die. They don't die like an animal, they slowly die, people don't realize if they see leaves on a tree that it can be rotten inside and for all functional purposes it is dead, and from a town's perspective it's a hazard, it's a liability. If it was to fall and damage something, or injure someone, the town would be responsible, so the towns put their emphasis on removal, and not on restoration of the forest.
Q: Can an urban forest really have an impact on the environment, or are there too few trees to cope with an overwhelming problem?
A: From studies we do know that a tree in an urban setting can do more for the environment than a tree in a rural setting. A tree in a rural area is in competition with other trees, so the leaf surface area might not be as great as a tree grown in the open in an urban situation. The number of benefits people derive from an urban tree will be greater than from a rural tree, such as the cleaning of the air.
Q: Trees provide a certain amount of energy efficiency as well. How does that happen?
A: By the simple fact that they shade them, they can keep buildings cool in the summer. Any building can benefit for at least four or five months from shading, which is a great energy conservation technique. In the Southwest the power companies will offer subsidies for trees to be planted near the house as part of their energy conservation program. In the winter months, if trees are properly placed, they reduce the exposure to wind, which removes the heat shell from a building.
Q: Where can people find out what they can do in terms of urban forestry?
A: There are several opportunities. One is my office. I deal mostly with the volunteer aspect. The state Department of Environmental Protection has an urban forester. He and I work very closely. The division of forestry at D.E.P. has clearly stated that urban forestry is an important function. There are also a number of private groups, from shade tree committees to garden clubs to nonprofit organizations like Hartford Trees. We also have the Connecticut Urban Forest Council, which started about three or four years ago to advise the D.E.P. There is the Connecticut Agricultural Extension Service. Universities have experts in soils, pests and other subjects, and homeowners and town officials can go to them for specific information.

HEADLINE: In the Court of the King of Tonga

BYLINE: By Paul Theroux; Paul Theroux has been traveling in the Pacific with his collapsible kayak for the past three years. This article is an excerpt from "The Happy Isles of Oceania," published this month by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Copyright  1992 by Cape Cod Scriveners Company.

 BODY:
WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN TONGA?" asked a big square-headed official in a blue skirt with a hem below his chunky knees. We were standing in a wooden shed at the Fua'amotu Airport on the island of Tongatapu.
"Just looking around," I said. "A little paddling."
I want to see the King, I almost said. I intended to go to the northern archipelago, called Vava'u, and camp on a desert island. But what I wanted to do on this island was meet His Majesty, King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, the King of Tonga. 
 A Tongan friend of a friend, Afu Veikune, met me at the airport. I had been told that Afu and her husband, Salesi, and their friend Mrs. Vahu might be able to help. Like many Tongans, Afu had spent some years as a house servant for a family in Honolulu. Salesi had been a courtesy-van driver for Budget Rent-a-Car. Mrs. Vahu had worked for Budget in San Francisco. They were now all back in Tonga. Domestics and drivers they might have been in America, but in Tonga they were something else -- they had royal connections.
Afu had been the lady-in-waiting to the famous and much-loved Queen Salote of Tonga, the present king's mother. Afu's father was a tui, a chief, and a landowner. Afu and Salesi's son had married a royal cousin and the king had come to the wedding. They were closely acquainted with princes and princesses. The present Queen often visited their house.
"Maybe you talk to Mr. Mo'ungaloa," Afu said.
"Who is Mr. Mo'ungaloa?"
"The King's secretary."
We were traveling at 15 miles an hour. The road from the airport to Nuku'alofa ("Abode of Love"), the capital, was riddled with potholes. All the roads were appalling; the buildings were grim, too. Islanders on Tongatapu were personally neat and tidy, but they lived in a state of continuous disorder.
Nuku'alofa had no visible industry. It looked dusty and down at the heel. Even its singular building, the Royal Palace, resembled nothing so much as a rural Christian church, wooden and white, with a bulky steeple. Indeed, Christianity came into full flower in Tonga with the approval of the monarchy.
Nothing locally made was for sale in Nuku'alofa except postage stamps. What money it had came from the remittances of Tongans in Meganesia (my personal neologism for New Zealand and Australia) -- New Zealand in particular -- and in America, mainly Hawaii, where Tongans were employed as gardeners, car washers and tree trimmers.
Another source of revenue in Tonga has been the sale of Tongan passports. This was the brainchild of a Hong Kong Chinese man, one George Chen, who was asked by the Tongan King for advice on how to raise revenue. "Sell passports," Chen said, knowing that many would be sought after by Hong Kongers who were watching with horror the approach of the People's Republic takeover of the British colony in 1997. For $10,000, someone who was otherwise stateless could become a Tongan Protected Person (T.P.P.) and carry a Tonga passport, which conferred the freedom to travel to any country in the world except Tonga, where a T.P.P. was forbidden to settle.
When some countries rejected the validity of these passports, the King was informed and a new Tongan passport went on sale for $20,000 (or $35,000 for a family of four). This gave the holder Tongan nationality and a right to settle. South Africans and Libyans as well as hundreds of Hong Kong Chinese were quick to snap up these passports. Imelda Marcos bought one, and in the process became a Tongan citizen. In the past seven years this has produced $30 million for Tonga as well as a constitutional crisis. Angry Tongans demonstrated their opposition to the sale of Tongan nationality, called for limitations on the King's powers (he was the one to approve the whole thing) and demanded to know what had happened to the money.
Another source of wealth was the returning Tongans, like Afu and Salesi, who had made a few dollars overseas and who had come back to retire and sit under the trees and raise pigs.
"That is Queen Salote's grave," Afu said, pointing across a weedy field to what looked like a war memorial surrounded by a large iron fence. Queen Salote (Tongan for Charlotte) had more or less upstaged Queen Elizabeth at her own coronation in 1953. It rained hard that day. Tongan custom insists that in order to show respect you cannot imitate the actions of the person you are honoring. At the first sign of rain, Queen Elizabeth's footmen put up the hood on her carriage as it rolled toward Westminster Abbey. Hoods were raised on the rest of the carriages in the procession -- all but one, that of the Queen of Tonga. She sat, vast and majestic and drenched. And from that moment she earned the love and affection of every person in Britain.
"But what shall I tell Mr. Mo'ungaloa?"
"Tell him who you are," Afu said. "He wishes to check your background."
"What does he want to find in my background?"
"Nice things," Mrs. Vahu said.
The next day, we went to a small red-roofed building in another weedy field. This was outside the high fence of the Royal Palace and was the secretary's office. We entered the building together, and Afu and Salesi behaved like parents on their child's first day at school. There was an open room with some desks and perhaps 10 fat men sitting and bantering with each other in Tongan. You could almost determine a person's social status from his obesity -- these chunky men were all nobles. They also wore layers of fraying mats around their midriff.
Though they hardly knew me, Afu and Salesi energetically testified to my fine character, and at last Mo'ungaloa agreed to see me.
"Yes?" Mo'ungaloa was a small bespectacled man in a cramped side office. "You wish to see the King?"
"Very much," I said. I went on to say that about 15 years before I had met Crown Prince Tupou'toa in London. He was about my age. He had been to the Military Academy at Sandhurst. He played the piano and had formed his own jazz combo called the Straight Bananas.
"Prince Tupou'toa is now the Foreign Minister," Mo'ungaloa said. He had winced at my innocent mention of the Straight Bananas.
A photograph of the Prince showed him to be wearing a much larger size uniform than in his London days. There were also photographs of Queen Salote and old Tongan kings -- including George Tupou I, the first Christian king (baptized in 1831) -- and of the British royal family. There were framed letters. One was from the Queen of England.
"Sendeth Greeting! Our Good Friend!" it began. In this letter she was introducing a newly arrived British official, ending it with the usual flourish -- it was 1970 "in the 17th Year of Our Reign" -- and, "Your Good Friend, Elizabeth R."
Why frame that letter and not all the others she must have sent? But I didn't ask. I was busily trying to impress Mo'ungaloa with my seriousness.
I wrote books, I said. I was traveling in the Pacific. I was very interested in the peoples of Oceania, in their voyages (Mo'ungaloa stifled a yawn) and their arts and crafts. I had once been a university professor. Mo'ungaloa's eyes were glazing over. I had recently been to Fiji, I said, and before then, the Solomons.
"Which university do you teach at?"
"Used to teach," I said. "Oh, several."
"And you are presently working for?"
"I am unemployed at the moment," I said. "I mean, I write for a living, but I don't have a job. One with a salary, that is. This sounds much worse than it actually is." But I thought: an unemployed middle-aged foreigner in a sun-faded shirt shows up unannounced, claiming to be a writer and asks to see the King. If I had been the secretary, I would have sent me away.
Incredibly, he said the King would see me. What did I wish to discuss with His Majesty?
"Nuclear policy in the Pacific? Polynesian migration? The future of tourism?"
Mo'ungaloa seemed satisfied. "The King will talk freely," he said, with confidence, and we settled on a date and time for my royal audience.
WHILE I WAITED FOR MY AUDIENCE WITH THE King, I had time to get acquainted with the Tongans. The Veikunes and Mrs. Vahu told me that although they had spent many years in the United States they had always intended to return to Tonga. Of all the islanders in the Pacific, Tongans find it hardest to adapt to other cultures -- to the work, the stress, the deadlines, the moods and way of life of other lands -- and a high percentage return to Tonga.
A group of more than 150 Polynesian islands in the South Pacific, Tonga lies between Fiji and Samoa, and is about 3,000 miles southwest of Hawaii. Tonga (population: 108,000) has never been colonized or occupied. Its people have little understanding of and no interest in the outer world, apart from the worst of its popular culture -- rock music and violent videos (there is no television in Tonga). Tongans regard non-Tongans with a kind of pity and disdain, as though they are all sinners and suckers, people who foolishly work their heads off. Tonga has no investors, no immigrants. There are few expatriates and hardly any tourists. It has no desire to see strangers, and outsiders are actively discouraged from prolonging their visits. Tourist visas are not even issued to Fijian Indians (Fiji is only an hour away by jet) for fear they will stay and contaminate this Christian kingdom with Islam.
Tongans are an elegant people -- something to do with their posture, in their features. Many look noble; a prince here, a princess there. Of course, many are fat and jolly. Men and women, old and young, walk slowly and very erect.
There is a strict class system and each class has its own language. Royalty has its language, and a Tongan fortunate enough to speak to the King has to use an archaic tongue, which is totally dissimilar from the language spoken by the commoners. The nobles have their own language, which bears no resemblance to either of the other two languages.
I tried to make the most of being in Nuku'alofa. It is the sleepiest, the dustiest, the slowest and one of the poorest of the Pacific ports. There is something extraordinary and unmovable about Tongan torpor -- it is regal and sensual and languorous.
Tongans are renowned for their unhelpfulness, unless they know you, in which case they make you one of the family. Phones don't work. Offices are empty or locked when they should be open. It is a society used to dealing with beachcombers, who have all the time in the world.
I was trying to make arrangements to travel to Vava'u, a large archipelago about 170 miles north of this island, Tongatapu. There were 50 islands in the Vava'u group and many of them, I had been assured, were uninhabited. A boat left Nuku'alofa once a week for Vava'u.
"It is better you take plane," Salesi said.
"I want to catch the boat."
"Plane is better."
"I prefer the boat," I said.
"Boats make you seasick," Salesi said.
"I don't think so."
"I get sick every time."
That was a familiar refrain. In Polynesia, I rarely met anyone who did not claim to get horribly seasick on a boat, no matter how short the trip. Even on the brief inter-island ferry rides this race of ancient mariners puked their guts out.
A TONGAN Sunday begins at midnight Saturday, when everything shuts until Monday morning. At 5 A.M. on Sunday the church bells ring, and soon after a dirgelike harmonizing is heard from every Methodist chapel and every Free Wesleyan church. In the afternoon and again at 10 P.M. the voices are raised in song. Tongans go to church three times on Sunday, and they roundly condemn anyone who fails to do so.
"The Sabbath," an official Government handout stated, "from midnight Saturday until midnight Sunday, is a day of rest in Tonga. The law says it shall be kept holy and no person shall practice his trade or profession, or conduct any commercial undertaking on the Sabbath. Any agreement made or document witnessed on the Sabbath shall be counted null and void, of no legal effect. Please do not date your cheques on a Sunday. . . ."
No planes land or take off on a Tongan Sunday. No one is allowed to play games or to swim; Tongans are fined or given three months in jail for violating this law.
"Would it be appropriate for me to jog today?" an American asked at the hotel.
The answer was no: it was sacrilegious. If anyone is observed enjoying himself or herself on a Sunday, there is hell to pay.
Such is their religiosity that girls swim and thrash in the water with all their clothes on. It is unheard of -- because it is sinful -- for any girl to wear a bathing suit. And because wet clothes can be so revealing, the girls wear several layers -- two shirts, two soggy skirts, trousers. It is a wonder they don't drown.
Tongans claim to observe the proprieties. It is, for example, unthinkable (and illegal) in Tonga to be without a shirt in a public place. Yet, they spit, they swear, they shout, they razz outsiders. They threw my change at me in shops. They seemed to consider it an indignity to carry anything for me, and certainly not my heavy bags. They were usually late, unapologetic, envious, abrupt, mocking, quarrelsome.
"They often let air out of my tires," the captain of a sailboat told me. A New Zealander who had been in Nuku'alofa for a short time, this man presently made his living by ferrying people back and forth to the outer islands on Sunday. On these islands you could swim undisturbed. But the penalty for this was that he frequently came back to his van and found the tires flat. Who did it?
"Church people," he said.
"AND YOU NEED A SUIT to see the king," Afu said, the night before my audience.
"I don't have a suit." A virtue of traveling in the Pacific is that a suit and tie are never necessary.
"You try Salesi's jacket," Afu said.
Salesi was a short stout man. I am not a short stout man. The shiny ill-fitting jacket made me look like a bum. That jacket with a knotted tie made me look like a mentally defective bum. I tried on the tie and jacket for Afu's inspection. She was dissatisfied but resigned. They had invited me to their house for dinner. We spent an hour or so drinking Kool-Aid and going through their son's wedding pictures, all seven albums.
Salesi and Afu themselves had married against the wishes of their parents; their early married life had been made difficult by this disapproval.
"How did you meet?"
Afu said, "At the palace."
Salesi said, "I just sneak in and want to talk to her."
Afu was then 18, the lady-in-waiting to Queen Salote.
"The Queen was very cross when I marry Salesi. She did not know he was visiting me. I just say to her, 'I'm getting marry.' But she had another man picked out for me, with an education. And she had a girl picked for Salesi, a girl with an education."
I got the idea of Queen Salote as a meddler, an arranger, a manipulator -- and Afu confirmed this. She was, after all, an absolute monarch. She made a point of teaching Afu simple household chores: how to clean a room properly, how to dust shelves, how to sew, how to make dresses.
At last, quite late, we had dinner -- chicken and taro and cassava and a delicious bowl of soupy greens, which were taro leaves cooked with coconut milk. The chicken came from America. Most chicken eaten in the Pacific come from America -- from the Tyson chicken farms in Arkansas, to be precise. Even on the Marquesas in French Polynesia, which are among the most remote islands on earth, they are cheaper than the local birds.
ON THE MORNING of my royal audience I entered the office of the King's secretary and saw my name chalked on a board and after my name: "Author, former university professor." I heard footsteps.
"Mr. Paul?" It was an army officer. "I am the King's aide-de-camp. Call me Joe. How do you pronounce your name?"
I told him.
"Because I have to announce you," he explained.
We walked through the tall grass and the weeds that lay outside and inside the high palace fence.
The King's new Mercedes was parked in the portico out front. Joe led me past it to a ground-floor room on the right. With a buffet and a heavy refectory table, it had the look of having once been a dining room. It was strewn with gifts: an inscribed crystal punch bowl; a toy Thai temple; a silver-plated telescope; a lamp with a label on it; a samurai sword; a large framed photograph of Tonga's many islands, snapped from space, with a long laborious inscription and the signature of Ronald Reagan in wobbly handwriting.
A thronelike chair stood at the head of the table. Joe showed me to a chair next to it. There came a wheezing and a shuffling from the hallway. The King wore a black bombazine skirt, a smocklike shirt buttoned to his neck and a great braided mass of cords around his belly. He had an aluminum cane in each fist, in each breast pocket a pair of glasses, and a gold watch on each wrist -- two of everything. But the details of the King's person were overwhelmed by his size.
His actual weight seemed irrelevant to me. He was vast, he was slow, an enormous man whose heavy-lidded eyes and whopper jaw gave him the huge froglike face you sometimes see on ancient carved Polynesian tikis. A tiki is a statue, but Tiki is also a god -- the greatest in Oceania. A suggestion of divinity is attached to the Tongan monarch, as it is to the English one. Tonga is a kingdom of big men, and this man is the biggest of all. You would have known instantly that he is the King.
There was something Oriental in his aloofness, and at times when we were talking he seemed like an Eastern potentate. He put his big warm hand in mine and when he said, "Sit" (I heard it, though the sound was deformed by his jaw or by a possible speech defect), the word stayed in his mouth.
"He is known for his long silences," an Australian expatriate in Nuku'alofa had told me the day before.
I was close enough to see that both of his wristwatches showed the same time. To prove I was bona fide I had brought the King a book I had written. This I now handed him. He picked it up. His hands were big and plump, each one like a baseball mitt. His fingers were thick, his fingertips blunt -- too blunt to assist him in separating pages.
I made a short speech, saying how grateful I was that I had been welcomed so warmly in the kingdom. He seemed bored by what I was saying. "In the 1890's," I went on, "the Hawaiian King Kalakaua had the idea of uniting the Pacific into a large federation of island nations -- a great community of like-minded people. It never happened, of course. But does such an idea interest you, Your Majesty?"
"I have already started," he said, "though it is not the whole Pacific. It is Polynesia."
I had been right about the speech defect -- he had rather a slushy way with s's and with consonant clusters. He hardly opened his mouth. His words remained echoey in his mouth and some of them stuck to his tongue. It was a growly voice, exactly that of someone protesting as he swallows his mashed potatoes. Probably the greatest difficulty in his speech was that it often had no emotion in it. Emotion is probably superfluous to royal speech anyway. Kings and queens have the luxury of never having to persuade anyone of anything; they speak and are obeyed.
"The chairman was a minister from the Cook Islands," the King said. "But this man was voted out in the last election, so I am taking charge."
"What is the aim of your Polynesia group? Is it political, Your Highness?"
"It is not political. How could it be? The Cook Islands is a republic. Hawaii is a state. French Polynesia is a colony. Tonga is a monarchy. There are too many differences. No, it will be concerned with culture and society. With language and the arts." He took a deep breath. "We will publish a magazine."
"And Melanesia is not a part of it, Your Majesty?" I was thinking of Fiji, Vanuatu (New Hebrides), New Caledonia and the 800 islands in the Solomon group.
He was silent. At last, without opening his mouth, he produced the word "no" and it went on rumbling inside his body.
"Your Majesty," I said, "will you deal with questions such as nuclear testing?"
"That is a political matter."
Not only did he not move his mouth, he did not move his head either, nor his body. He simply sat, huge and immovable.
"But nuclear testing in the Pacific is very bad."
There came one of his silences.
"I have been to Moruroa," the King said after a while. "I saw the holes in the reef. They drilled down and put the bomb inside, and then filled the hole with cement. They had made so many holes they had very little room left on the reef to dig more. So they had started to dig into the bed of the lagoon, which is, of course, very dangerous."
On the King's face was something like a smile. "Nuclear testing must stop in the Pacific," he said. "The French must leave. They import everything from France. It is ridiculous. Although it will be hard financially for the people of those islands, they must decolonize French Polynesia."
"Do you mean soon or all in good time?"
"Soon," the King said, "soon." He was staring at me. "The atom bombs can be tested elsewhere. Testing is needed. And bombs are needed to stop people like Hussein. To frighten him. He is like Hitler."
"Are you saying, Your Majesty, that they should use an atom bomb on Saddam Hussein?"
"They should put a bomb under him," the King said.
"And you trust the French to test their nuclear devices elsewhere in the world?" (Some time after this conversation with the King, I read that the new French Prime Minister announced the suspension of nuclear testing in the South Pacific until the end of this year. He declared that the ban might be extended next year if other nuclear powers followed suit.)
"I don't trust the French at all!" he said, and saying so, he roared with laughter. The eruption was so unexpected I twitched with surprise.
Intending to exploit this sudden emotion, I said, "The French are usually self-interested, so they are -- in foreign policy at any rate -- insincere, unprincipled and unreliable."
"Totally unreliable!" he roared, and he laughed again. "I have been rereading the history of the Franco-Prussian War. Do you know how that war started?"
He summarized for me the events of 120 years ago that led to the outbreak of that war.
"The French make a detail into a principle," I said, "but they are just as likely to make a principle or a murderous event into a detail. Look at the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior and the murder of the photographer on board by the French saboteurs in New Zealand. The French Government said it was nothing -- they regarded it as nothing. Yet if it had happened to them they might have used it as a pretext for a war."
"But New Zealand can't go to war with France," the King said. "There was nothing that New Zealand could do."
"No one went to bat for New Zealand, though," I said. "The British have a rather ambiguous attitude toward the French. They like the food, they feel somewhat intimidated by the French people."
"The English overlook the French weaknesses," the King said, "and so do your people in the United States."
"SINCE WE ARE GENERalizing about national characteristics, what about the Japanese, Your Highness?"
"They are building a new terminal for us at the airport."
"Do they mention wanting to buy islands from you?"
"We will never give our land away," the King said. "That is the worst problem in Hawaii -- the loss of land. It now belongs to other people, and the Hawaiians have so little left."
Another silence.
"The Japanese work very hard," the King said. "It is strange -- they think they are pure but they are not pure at all. Their culture is derived from the Chinese. Their language is full of foreign words."
He gave me the foreign derivations of arigato and tempura and I gave him ka sutera (cake) and pagoda.
"Would you like to see Tonga develop into a great tourist destination?"
"Already we receive many tourists."
Twenty thousand a year -- nothing. Hawaii receives almost that number in a single day.
"But when the terminal is in place there will be many more." He clasped his hands. "We will soon have three television stations. And oil. We have oil in Tonga."
"Oil, Your Highness?"
"Yes, I have seen it myself -- gushing from the reef. We will soon have someone drilling."
And not a moment too soon: fuel oil was very expensive in Tonga and very scarce. We returned to the subject of Polynesia, and I asked whether he felt an affinity with other Polynesians.
"I do. The Samoans are very close. My second son is married to a Samoan. And of course we have a common origin. There is a fellow here at our university who is from Sumatra, and he has told me that there is a village in Sumatra where the language is very similar to Tongan."
I said: "The Polynesians have a sense of having come from a distant place. The Fijians are muddled about that. The Melanesians I've met speak of having come from sharks and snakes and birds; some people say they came out of the ground."
"We have a sense that our ancestors were voyagers and explorers, that is true."
"But of all the Polynesians you are the last absolute monarch, Your Highness."
He laughed his roaring laugh. "I am not an absolute monarch."
"With all respect, Your Highness, surely you are. In what way are you not?"
"I have a . . ." he said and produced a mashed-potato word.
"Excuse me, sir?"
He repeated the word three times. The word was "parliament." But of course the assembly was no more than a rubber stamp, and half of it was appointed by his allies, the Tongan nobles.
Soon after this I asked him whether he had committees that were looking into tourism and oil and television.
He said: "I am the committee!" and he laughed very hard. "We always have a majority!' Another laugh, and I, of course, obsequiously joined him. "No dissenting voices!"
He asked me -- it was his only question to me -- whether I had any news of the Persian Gulf war. The air war had just begun. I told him what I had heard on the BBC that morning.
The King said: "America could use this as a chance to put their resentment aside and make an ally of the Iranians. America needs allies in the Middle East. Iran is not the same country that humiliated America during the hostage crisis. They have a new Government -- a good one, I think."
I said: "The Israelis tend to dominate our thinking on the Middle East."
He responded: "America should be objective. And Israel has a big responsibility to be fair to the Palestinians. The Israelis should leave the occupied territories and stop killing Palestinians. Israel is strong and the Palestinians are weak. They are a problem because Israel has made them a problem."
We talked some more, about his children, about his liking for French food, about his exercise (he cycled up and down the runway at the airport -- he was trying to get his weight down). He then lowered his massive head and said, "I have another appointment."
I scrambled to my feet and thanked him, and then Joe was summoned to lead me away across the weedy lawn.
A day or so later, some friendly Tongans roasted a piglet in my honor. I was sitting with the Tongan men under a mango tree; the women were under a different, smaller tree.
"What you talking to the King?" a man asked me, hoisting his T-shirt to cool his belly.
"He told me you're going to have television."
"In his dreams," the man said. He translated this into Tongan and everyone laughed. "The King all the time dreaming."

HEADLINE: Japan Is Trying New Approach In Trade Battles

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, June 8

 BODY:
In what Japanese officials say will be the first step toward an aggressive strategy for confronting the United States on trade issues, a Government advisory council has turned the tables and attacked the United States for breaking a number of international trade rules.
In a report released this morning, the United States was described as having the most unfair trade among the world's industrialized nations. An official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the underlying aim of the council's report was to provide a blueprint for Japan's new strategy for handling trade disputes -- trying to move away from the past practice of negotiating directly with the United States over trade problems and instead referring them to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world organization that oversees trade.
 
'The Basis for Discussions'
 "The intention is to use GATT frequently," the official said. "This report will be a guideline for our approach to solving trade problems, the basis for discussions with our major trading partners."
Whether the full Japanese Government adopts this policy as a vigorous new approach, and how successful it might be, remain to be seen. However much Japan may prefer the multinational arena, it is likely to be forced to deal with Washington directly when members of Congress, the Administration or prominent American industries have major complaints.
But such a shift could have a big impact on Japan's often bitter relationship with its largest trading partner.
In Washington, Kathleen A. Lydon, the assistant United States trade representative for public affairs, said the United States believed that resolving trade disputes through GATT was "one of the best" approaches to take.
In its report, a subcommittee of the Industrial Sector Council, a private-sector advisory group to the trade ministry at the heart of Japanese policy-making, examined how closely Japan's trading partners adhered to rules governing international trade. It concluded that the United States failed in 9 of 10 areas.
The report accused the United States of these unfair trade practices:
*Washington too often imposes unilateral solutions on trade problems, instead of seeking to settle matters through international forums.
*The United States abuses rules that permit a country to halt the sale of other nations' products at prices below cost or below fair market value, a practice known as dumping.
*The United States arbitrarily alters tariffs and frequently resorts to negotiating "voluntary" restraints on another nation's exports, as it did with Japan on autos, steel and machine tools.
*"Buy American" laws, some of which were enacted after President Bush's trip to Japan in January, restrict Federal Government purchases to mostly American goods and services and discriminate against Japanese products. American trade officials have frequently made this complaint about Japan.
Ms. Lydon said she had not seen the report and could not respond to its specific complaints but added, "Everybody knows that the United States has the most open markets in the world, and our interest is in seeing that other nations follow suit."
As for the criticism of voluntary restraint agreements, she said, "We would much prefer to see them open their markets than to manage the number of items they export."
The report ranked the European Community next to last among Japan's trading partners, failing in six categories. Hong Kong and Singapore were cited as the fairest traders. Other countries examined were Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand.
The document comes as Japan is under pressure from a number of countries over its trade practices. Although Japan's trade surplus with the United States appears to have stabilized at about $40 billion a year, its surplus with Asia and the European Community has been rising sharply. Japan's overall surplus this year is expected to be more than $110 billion, the largest in the world.
Japan feels the GATT rules offer it a better forum, since they give far less weight to trade imbalances by themselves. The report dismissed such imbalances as meaningless.
"Although some point to Japan's large trade surplus as evidence of a closed market, this argument is refuted by basic lessons of economics," it insisted.
The United States conducts an annual trade survey in which it judges how open the markets of its trading partners are. Japanese officials said Tokyo's unfairness report would also be an annual exercise from now on.
Japan is negotiating with South Korea over the large Japanese trade surplus with Korea, and Japan's surplus with the European Community was a record $27.4 billion last year, a 48 percent increase from 1990. It appears likely to grow this year.
Nonetheless, Japan was angered when the European Community recently expressed its disappointment at the growing size of the trade gap. The Europeans issued a formal review of their relations with Japan that emphasized the trade problems.
That prompted the Japanese Government to say it was sending a tough letter in reply, expressing its unhappiness that the community chose to emphasize trade over political and other areas where Japan believes relations have improved.
The new report said it had three objectives. The first was to come up with a new definition of unfair trade, largely by referring to GATT rules. But it excluded trade in agricultural goods, an area in which Japan is often criticized because of its ban on the import of rice.
The second objective was to suggest that all countries deviated from the GATT rules to some extent.
And last, the report was an attempt to move away from direct discussions between countries for resolving trade disputes and toward taking them to GATT instead.

HEADLINE: For the Urban Young, Carpentry Skills and Hope

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The story of Rudolph Griffith's escape from the streets is much like those of some other young men in Boston's wasted inner city community of Roxbury. He left school in the 11th grade. His father, penniless and unemployed, left home. Mr. Griffith lived with his mother sometimes, sometimes with an aunt. Now 25 years old, he lost seven years to the streets, loitering, drinking, seeing his girl, becoming a father.
"I happened to keep away from drugs," he said. "but I came close."
He kept looking for a real job. "I knew I could work," he said. "But nothing worked out. They wouldn't even review your application." His girl took their two children and returned to her parents. 
 Mr. Griffith followed politics on television and in newspapers and bridled at the stereotype he saw of himself, a young black man. "Politicians have a system to make average people believe we are not to be trusted," he said. "It's a game they are playing with us. I was hot. I was very angry."
Luck threw Mr. Griffith a lifeline. In October 1990, he enrolled at a private, not-for-profit, largely foundation-financed school in Roxbury that was just getting started. It was called Youth Build Boston.
Eight months after completing the program, Mr. Griffith is one of its success stories, earning close to $10 an hour recording engineers' design changes at a huge water treatment plant under construction in Boston Harbor. He and his girlfriend are back together, with their children, three of them now, in an apartment of their own. And in September, Mr. Griffith plans to start college, part time, to study civil engineering.
Many members of Congress, educators, urban planners and public interest groups believe that his school, situated in a former factory, could hold the key to freeing thousands of other urban youths from the shackles of poverty and crime.
New as it is, the school is gaining recognition as a wellspring of human reclamation, a private program for training the hard core of unemployed urban youth, with a model that is usable in city after city.
Youth Build schools based on the Boston model have opened in San Francisco, Cleveland, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, and in Tallahassee and Gadsden County, Fla.
So far, just 300 students are enrolled in the schools together at any one time. But more schools are opening this year in six other cities, and after the riots in Los Angeles, similar schools are being planned there.
Bipartisan bills now in Congress would authorize $40 million next year and $80 million in 1994 to establish scores of other schools.
 
A Difficult Road To Success
 While job-training programs are widely seen as a basic step in helping undereducated inner-city youth into the economic mainstream, their task is daunting: Even at Youth Build, an expensive comprehensive program that takes only students who have actively sought training, a third of the students drop out. And because the program is small and new, its long-term success rate is not yet known.
Youth Build is the innovation of a 50-year-old educator, Dorothy Stoneman, who established two precursors of the Boston school, one 14 years ago in East Harlem, another eight years ago in the South Bronx, both still operating as part of the Youth Action Program, which she directed until 1988.
Her Youth Build schools are financed by the Ford Foundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, the Lilly Endowment, the Campaign for Human Development and local groups, both public and private.
The schools' No. 1 priority -- the thing that sets them apart from many youth development programs -- is building the students' self-respect, teaching them leadership and helping them take control of their lives. As part of the process, each class elects a policy advisory committee, which interviews candidates for teaching jobs and has the last word on whom to hire.
Youth Build schools take students aged 17 to 25; most are past 20. In an assessment of five of the schools, the Ford Foundation found that 80 percent of the students were male, 36 percent were parents, 53 percent were from families living on welfare, 88 percent were black and 24 percent had high school diplomas or the equivalent.
Students are paid about $500 a month and get raises and bonuses for good work and good attendance. They spend alternating weeks going to classes to catch up their lost time in high school and getting on-the-job training in a well-paid skill, carpentry, by renovating abandoned housing for the poor.
There is a purpose in the emphasis on carpentry. Students get the skills to get the jobs to build the homes the community needs. Once out of the program, they can keep up the work, taking jobs with contractors or becoming contractors on their own. Ms. Stoneman says the schools could eventually teach health-care skills, which are also needed in the community.
Ms. Stoneman says 60 percent of a class will stay through the 6 to 18 months of a program -- the duration depending on financing -- and get regular jobs paying an average of $8 an hour, or $16,000 a year. Depending on the location of a school, the program's cost per student is $15,800 a year to $21,500 -- less than a year in the Ivy League or in society's more common destination for wayward youth, jail.
Of the 28 members of Mr. Griffith's class, 19 graduated. Of those who did not, most were dismissed for absenteeism and drifting back to the streets. One was dismissed for stealing a school check.
Karen Fulbright, head of youth development programs at the Ford Foundation, said: "The general public impression of this group of kids is fear and that nothing works for them. It's a testament to the human spirit that they will flock to this. They want to improve their lives. It's inspiring to go into one of these schools and talk to these kids. You see major changes in two or three months."
Students are encouraged to remain in their communities. "I want to stay in Roxbury, to build it up a little bit," said Nigeria Johnson, 22, who dropped out of high school, pregnant, in her senior year, but now wins academic and leadership awards at the Boston school. "I want to give back."
Anthony Williams, a current student here, said that from the time he was 13, he had been fleeing foster homes. He left high school at 16 and found jobs hard to get.
"It's not like you want to sell drugs," Mr. Williams said. "It almost seems to me we were forced to do something like that. But it's a dead-end world. It ruins my community. It splits up your family. People look at you. 'How many people did he exploit today?' "
 
Sharing a Fear Of the Street
 Student after student said public schools had written them off. "I wasn't getting much attention," said Larry Blue, who left high school in the 10th grade. "They played me like I was slow. They wanted to put me in slow classes. I wanted the same chances as anybody else. I started running with people doing negative things."
Another common thread is fear of the street. A member of this year's class was shot and killed near a subway station when he rushed to defend a woman being attacked. Mr. Griffith's cousin, Dwayne Richard, who had applied to Youth Build Boston but was not admitted, was shot and killed at a party two months ago, not long after he had stopped selling drugs.
Nathan Young, 23, a current student, was luckier than most of his classmates in having a mentor in his family -- a brother, five years older, who left home at 16, and took a job in a supermarket. "He started going to church, and I started going," Mr. Young said. "He gave me a push about working hard."
Last year, the brother was stabbed and killed when he scuffled with a man breaking into his home.
While some students say their street friends have belittled their efforts at job training, others say they have received support for leaving the streets.
"They're pushing me to go through this," Mr. Blue said. "They're saying they want to get in the program, too. They feel real good for me."
Ms. Stoneman established the Youth Build organization four years ago, after moving from New York to her childhood home in the prosperous Boston suburb of Belmont, where she cared for her dying mother. Now, the Belmont office, with a staff of 13, helps other communities replicate the Boston model, providing training, organizational help, seed money from the foundations and guidance in selecting local management -- a critical consideration. The national office does not control the other schools.
The Youth Build program is too new to have established a track record, and evaluations of it are barely started. "But something is working there," said Ronald Ferguson, an associate professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who has begun an evaluation.
But the likelihood of replicating that success on a broad scale, he said, remains an open question. An uninspired local director or a sour economy can undermine a school.
Several graduates of the Boston school's first class are temporarily working for the school while they wait for the Massachusetts economy to recover and construction jobs to open. Some have had to settle for menial jobs because they are still working toward their equivalent of a high school diploma.
Still, Phillip Clay, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is also evaluating the program, said Youth Build was "off to a good start." Other programs to shepherd youth into the mainstream of the economy, too, show promise, including the Government's Job Corps and scores of smaller programs, like those linking employers' needs with students and school curriculums, and others that bring teen-age fathers back to their families and into jobs.
Experts say many different models are needed to respond to students' different needs. The best-known program, the Job Corps, is residential, and it primarily attracts younger students.
One thing they share is a need for more financing.
"What we have are a lot of programs that seem to be working," Ms. Fulbright said. "What we don't have is a public commitment. We don't see resources being directed to these programs that are working."
Youth Build cannot begin to accommodate all those who apply. Jackie Gelb, executive director of the Boston school, said she interviewed 150 serious candidates for this year's class of 36 -- now down to 24, who have made it through seven months of the program.
"We have to play Russian roulette," she said. "It's sick. You're looking at one person who needs a shot and another who needs a shot, and we have to choose."
 
Usual Criteria Do Not Apply
 The criteria that conventional schools or employers use to make those choices -- grades, work experience, police records -- do not apply. Indeed, having dropped out of school is almost a plus, since the admissions policy requires that 75 percent of the students have not finished high school.
"We try to target people at the fourth-to-eighth grade reading level, people who are trying to leave the streets, people who have gotten out of jail or have gotten off drugs," Ms. Gelb said.
The most important consideration is a half-hour interview and the staff's judgment of a candidate's commitment to a fresh start.
Surviving the school requires real commitment from people accustomed to the street. There are stiff penalties, ranging from loss of pay to dismissal, for disruptive behavior, absenteeism, or use of drugs or alcohol.
The first two weeks, students take an unpaid "mental toughness" course to help them decide if they have the stamina and self-confidence to stick with the program. At the end of each session, the students do "appreciations," going around the room saying what they appreciate about one another.
Those who stay with the program move on to classes in math and English. In a math class, one sucked a lollipop. One left the room without comment to go to the bathroom. Students often spoke up, uninvited. The teacher, Lea Campolo, showed no concern.
"They are like college students," Ms. Campolo said. "I encourage people to work out answers together. It's not cheating. It's helping one another. I encourage them to speak to one another as long as it's about what we're doing."
Acclimating to work can be difficult. Steve Perry, a union carpenter and instructor at the construction site in Roxbury, said: "The hardest thing is gaining their confidence, keeping their attention. They all come with a load: the pressure of the streets; they don't know where they're going to sleep tonight; they're going to be a father."
Most students say they want to go into business for themselves eventually. "I want to buy some land, make a store, design it," Larry Blue said. "A corner food store with everything in it. Someday, someday maybe. That's a real deep dream of mine."

HEADLINE: Blacks Reach a Milestone in Queens: Income Parity

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In the late 1980's, when Wall Street boomed and the rich got richer, Winston St. Kitts, a subway-car maintenance man who emigrated from Guyana 14 years ago, discovered the American Dream in Queens.
Mr. St. Kitts, who is 38 years old, moved to Queens two years ago from an apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He bought a two-family house in Jamaica, where he hopes to raise a family. 
 Like the Grimsleys of Cambria Heights, a schoolteacher, an auditor and their two children, and the Cooks of Far Rockaway, a retired nurse, a computer operator and their three children, Mr. St. Kitts helps personify a census statistic that some demographers say is nothing short of astonishing: the median income for black households in Queens has virtually matched that of white households.
 
Progress in a Long Struggle
 The finding, generated from a computer analysis of census records by The New York Times, represents a statistical milestone, at least, in the struggle of blacks to achieve economic parity with whites. Demographers say that while national comparisons are still incomplete, they believe that Queens is the largest political subdivision where blacks and whites have a common median income. Median income is that line at which half the group makes more and half the group makes less.
The 1990 census figures showed that, over the previous decade, the median income of black households in Queens rose 31 percent, adjusted for inflation, compared to 19 percent for white households. A decade ago, the median income of black households in Queens was 9.5 percent less than it was for white households. By 1990, that gap was only two-tenths of 1 percent.
Demographers say many factors contributed to the shift. Queens's growing population of Hispanic people, who can be of either race, tended statistically to hold down income gains of whites. About half of all the Hispanic people in Queens described themselves as white to the Census Bureau. And some affluent whites left the borough.
Black gains, the demographers say, may be a greater reflection of immigration from the Caribbean than of progress by American-born blacks. And many black families were able to enter the middle-income group by having more than one family member work. There were 1.14 workers per white household in Queens in 1980 and 1.15 in 1990. Among blacks, the number of workers per household rose from 1.32 in 1980 to 1.51 in 1990.
The figures signal the latest phase in the ethnic and racial evolution that has traditionally made Queens, now with nearly two million residents and 700,000 households in its 112 square miles, the city's largest middle-class borough. According to the census, the middle figure, or median, among all of the incomes reported by blacks and whites was nearly the same in Queens -- $34,600 for whites and $34,500 for blacks -- just above the statewide median of $32,965 and generally high enough to qualify those households as middle-income.
Blacks, who constitute about 20 percent of the borough's population, make up 18 percent of the Queens households that reported an income of $35,000 or more. Blacks who earn at least $35,000 make up 49 percent of the black population; whites earning at least that account for 49 percent of the white population.
"The black population of Queens -- mostly civil servants or people working in equal opportunity situations -- were making it in 1980 and more so in 1990, and that's the way the system is supposed to work," said Frank Vardy, a demographer with the Department of City Planning. "They make it to Queens because they want the American dream."
But statistical equality may be illusory. The gains mask lingering pockets of abject poverty in Queens. And many sections remain largely segregated. Middle-income black neighborhoods have often formed on the fringes of ghettos and have further isolated the poor blacks who have been left behind.
Moreover, median income represents only one measurement of success. Blacks have traditionally trailed whites in net worth, even among groups with comparable incomes, and have suffered discrimination grounded in race -- a more indelible characteristic than class.
In none of the other four boroughs or the surrounding counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut do the median household incomes of blacks and whites even approach parity, although middle-income blacks have made inroads in Nassau, Suffolk and Rockland Counties, in particular.
In New York City, the median income for whites was still higher than for blacks -- about $10,000 higher. In Chicago, it was nearly $12,000 higher; in Los Angeles, $15,000 higher.
 
Erosion of Gains
 Despite the income parity shown in the 1990 census figures, blacks, who traditionally have had less accumulated wealth than whites, remain more vulnerable to shifts in the economy. And interviews indicate that some gains recorded by the census have been eroded by the recession.
Allen Eley, for instance, lived in a public housing project in South Jamaica until he moved into a private home in Springfield Gardens. But in April, he was laid off as a shipping clerk for a Richmond Hill company that distributes machine parts. Since then, Mr. Eley, who is 24, has been looking for a job that will keep him in the middle class.
And many families in the middle-income range have found that two jobs are essential to staying there. "With two of us together, we're surviving," said Andrea Rattray, 31, a word processor for a temporary employment agency and the mother of an 11-year-old boy, who rents a house in Cambria Heights with her mother, who works in the United Nations personnel department. "If we went our separate ways it would be rough."
Patricia Henderson, a 40-year-old single mother of two, moved to an apartment in Astoria from a nearby public housing project four years ago. She makes $23,000 as a traffic-enforcement agent for the city -- no longer qualifying for the middle-income category since the man with whom she was living, a technician, moved out. She hopes to relocate to Virginia, where her daughter is studying child psychology in college, because, Ms. Henderson said, her Queens neighborhood "is really no place to be with a 10-year-old."
On average, black families are slightly larger, so their basic expenses are higher, too. Finally, demographers generally agree that the census undercounted poor black and Hispanic people more than any other group. And the poverty rate in Queens, half the citywide average, was still 1 in 10.
Even with all the qualifications, demographers say the parity recorded in Queens is remarkable.
"I would have anticipated that in any place you look, except perhaps in the most affluent suburbs, that the black income would be lower than the white income," said Dr. John Logan, a sociology professor at the State University of New York at Albany who studies population patterns by race and income.
 
Raw Data Analyzed
 The Census Bureau has not released statistics on median income by race but has made public raw numbers of black and white households in various income categories. The Times's analysis is based on those numbers.
Joycelyn Alexander embodies those statistics. An administrative sergeant stationed with the U.S. Army at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, she came to the United States from Trinidad in 1967. She lived on the base until she bought a two-family house in Jamaica, Queens, two years ago with her husband, who is Egyptian and an electrical engineer.
Ms. Alexander, who is 45 years old, is studying tourism at Kingsborough Community College and hopes to operate a travel agency from her home when she retires from the service in three years. She rents out the other apartment and has converted the basement into an art studio.
"People call this the ghetto," she said. "But people are moving in and taking pride in their property and the neighborhood has improved."
Blacks represent less than 7 percent of the middle-class in Nassau, Suffolk and Rockland Counties, but middle-income blacks constituted 61 percent of all blacks in Nassau, 56 percent in Suffolk and 54 percent in Rockland. The comparable figures for middle-income whites in those counties ranged from 10 to 17 percent higher.
White median income was about $11,000 higher than it was for blacks in Nassau, $9,000 higher in Suffolk and $16,000 higher in Rockland.
One of the nation's wealthiest counties, Fairfield in Connecticut, recorded the largest disparity of any major New York City suburb. White median income there was $53,300; black median income was $30,600. In Manhattan, the gap was even greater: $42,100 for whites and $18,100 for blacks.
The gap was narrower in other counties, but nowhere as dramatically as in Queens.
In 1979, 57.4 percent of whites made $15,000 or more; the median income was $17,400. So did 52.4 percent of blacks; the median income was $15,800 -- or 9.5 percent less than for whites. (Adjusted for inflation, the medians were $29,200 for whites and $26,400 for blacks.) Ten years later, the disparity had shrunk to two-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Confessions Of a Onetime Price Tamer

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
No one will ever mistake Paul A. Volcker's new book for "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again," but the former Federal Reserve chairman does let loose with more than a few barbs in a narrative of the ups and (mostly) downs of the dollar over the last five decades.
He mocks "starry-eyed Reaganauts" who believed tax cuts were a "magic elixir" that would make deficits go away. He calls John S. Reed, the Citicorp chairman, "young and rather brash." He faults former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan for being oblivious to the harmful effects of the soaring dollar in the early 1980's and for "being more than a little impolite"' to the finance ministers of the big industrial powers. 
 In the book, which was written with Toyoo Gyohten, who used to direct international affairs for Japan's Finance Ministry, Mr. Volcker even criticizes one of his predecessors as Fed chairman. He writes that Arthur Burns's monetary policy was too slack in the early 1970's, helping to create strong downward pressures against the dollar.
 
Explores the Breakdown
 Mr. Volcker, who is now chairman of J. D. Wolfensohn & Company, a New York investment bank, advises many of the firm's clients and has also served as an occasional adviser to the Russian Government.
In a rare interview last week in his sun-drenched 40th-floor office overlooking the East River from midtown Manhattan, Mr. Volcker made it clear that the book, "Changing Fortunes: The World's Money and the Threat to American Leadership," was not intended to settle old scores. Instead, it explores the breakdown of the system of fixed exchange rates, how the United States served as the fulcrum of the world's monetary system and how America's economic leadership has been hurt by the dollar's slide and the nation's failure to get its economic house in order.
Much of the book describes behind-the-scenes meetings in which central bankers and finance ministers struggle to cope with the dollar's recurring crises. Out of Mr. Volcker's text emerges a sadness that something has gone profoundly awry with the American economy.
 
Pressure to Consume
 In the interview, he said, "After having been rich and strong, people have begun losing sight of what's necessary to maintain efficiency and strength. We seem to be in a mood as a nation that consumption is the all-important thing. The more you consume and the less you invest, the less efficient and productive you're likely to be."
The book, published by Times Books, is based on lectures Mr. Volcker and Mr. Gyohten, who is scheduled to become president of the Bank of Tokyo, gave at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton.
After some editing and rewriting, the lectures produced a book that examines in colorful detail the crucial developments of the postwar monetary system. The book describes the 1944 conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., which set the rules for the monetary system; the breakdown of that fixed-rate system in the early 1970's, when the United States started running large trade deficits; the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's, and the Plaza Accord of 1985, which sought to bring the stratospheric dollar back to earth.
Mr. Volcker was at the heart of many of the events, joining the Treasury in 1961, rising to Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs, becoming head of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and serving as chairman of the Fed from 1979 to 1987.
"The book means to teach people who will someday be in government what it's like doing these things," said Lawrence Malkin, a New York-based correspondent for The International Herald Tribune whom Mr. Volcker asked to help edit the book. "The style was just to tell the story."
As Mr. Volcker describes how the dollar soared in the early 1980's and plunged later in the decade, he shows some nostalgia for fixed exchange rates. Many economists praise fixed rates because they enable companies to make investment decisions without concern for potential volatility in currencies and because fixed rates often force countries to act to eliminate trade deficits.
Mr. Volcker said the slowdown in the industrial world's economic growth and productivity growth after 1973 might just be tied to the end of fixed exchange rates in 1973, though he said oil shocks and other factors also played a role.
"It's hard for me to believe, when you get into the late 1970's and 1980's with these enormous fluctuations in exchange rates, that that doesn't distort investment decisons in some way," he said.
He acknowledges that it is virtually impossible to go back to fixed rates, but to reduce the volatility of exchange rates, he recommends developing a target range of rates between the United States, Europe and Japan. He said governments would not only have to intervene in currency markets to keep rates within those ranges, but would also use monetary and fiscal policy to the same end.
But if the book does anything, it demonstrates that governments are loath to alter domestic policies to foster rate stability. Germany often did not want to increase spending to stimulate growth and imports for fear of spurring inflation. Washington usually refused to reduce its budget deficit to help shore up the dollar.
 
Inflation Fighter
 Mr. Volcker devotes one chapter to domestic affairs, not coincidentally, the tense time a dozen years ago when the Volcker Fed pushed interest rates up to 20 percent to take the steam out of double-digit inflation. He acknowledges being irritated by the second-guessing of economists who said he should have eased several months earlier to make the 1981-82 recession shorter and shallower.
In the interview, he was eager to answer such criticism. "Professionals in the economics community say, 'All right, we really had to deal with inflation, but you really should have eased two or three months earlier,' " he said. "But in the large course of human events, it's hard to fine-tune yourself to that degree."
Mr. Volcker was reluctant to discuss the Fed under its current chairman, Alan Greenspan, though he said, "They've been doing a good job."
Regarding his nemesis -- inflation -- he said that although "you don't expect me ever to be satisfied," it was "under control."
"I don't lie awake at night thinking it's going to be reversed," he said. "But I don't think the job is finished."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Potent Mix Of Country Music and Good P.R.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRANSON, Mo.

 BODY:
If the name Branson makes you think of country music, don't be surprised.
This tiny Ozark town has been featured on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" twice in the last six months. "CBS This Morning" devoted its Memorial Day program to it. "Inside Edition" and "Entertainment Tonight" have been here, as have USA Today, Time, Entertainment Weekly and numerous travel and country music writers. 
 Why? Because in the 1980's, Branson was quite loudly transformed into the nation's capital of live country music entertainment.
The metamorphosis that turned Branson into "Mayberry meets Vegas," as the singer Mel Tillis likes to say, started in 1983, when Roy Clark began singing the town's praises as a mecca of family values and sold-out shows. Other country music stars followed as they found a natural audience. And as the stars came, so did even more visitors.
 
Plenty of Effort
 Still, the abundant media attention for Branson cannot be traced to one marketing plan, one public relations agent or even one event. It took plenty of effort by country music stars and local residents alike, as well as some luck, to put Branson in the spotlight.
It also took canny marketing and public relations to attract television, magazine and newspaper reporters to a small town (population 3,706) near the Arkansas border, about 200 miles south of Kansas City, Mo.
The rewards of fame are evident everywhere from restaurants with a 40-minute wait for breakfast to the early-morning ticket buyers at the 24 indoor theaters. In April, the number of overnight visitors to the area more than doubled to 292,837. Five million visitors are expected this year, up from 3.5 million in 1987.
Perhaps the real key to success is the emphasis everyone seems to place on selling the community. Andy Williams, whose $11 million Moon River Theater just opened, shares information on group tour sales with Mr. Tillis, who has built two theaters here. Silver Dollar City Inc., which owns the Ozark theme park of the same name, includes listings for all the theaters in brochures for its Grand Palace showplace.
Kenny Rogers, who recently announced a multimillion-dollar partnership with the owners of Silver Dollar City, plays down his status as an individual star. "When I work there, I take my share of promotion, but I want to be careful that what I do enhances Branson," he said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
 
Signing Autographs
 And Mr. Tillis often spends 45 minutes after a two-hour show in Branson signing autographs, providing close-up access to his fans that they cannot get anywhere else. Most other stars here do the same.
Branson has an active Chamber of Commerce that promotes the area, but the Ozark Marketing Council exemplifies the community approach to marketing. The council, a nonprofit economic development corporation, grew out of the area's response to the 1979 oil embargo.
Several local business owners banded together to reduce the negative impact the embargo would have on tourism in the area, which had long been known for its fishing, scenery and home-grown entertainment. They bought extra gasoline for area gas stations and advertised its availability on the radio. That summer, local tourism was off by about 2 percent, compared with a national decline of 15 percent.
The business owners then formed the Ozark Marketing Council in 1980. Now more than half of the area's 600 businesses belong to the council, which has a budget of $821,000.
The council's advertising campaign is aimed at families and country music fans. Commercials on the Nashville Network, the Family Channel and regional television stations reach the audiences most receptive to what Branson has to offer: low-cost family entertainment.
Advertising is important, but press coverage has been invaluable. USA Today first published an article on Branson last summer. Since then, the media coverage has snowballed.
When "60 Minutes" did a report on the town in December, the Chamber of Commerce received more than 1,500 calls. A repeat showing in late May brought 2,000 more calls.
Beth Wanser, the council's public relations manager, estimated the promotional value of the first "60 Minutes" segment alone at $7 million.
This is not the first time that media attention has brought business to the area. In the 1960's, several episodes of "The Beverly Hillbillies" were taped at Silver Dollar City. "It took the message to an audience that was highly receptive," said Ray Canady, vice president of marketing for Silver Dollar City.
 
More Events Are Planned
 The current blitz of attention shows no signs of slowing down and neither does the Branson marketing machine. More events like the "Ozark Mountain Christmas" are in the works. And recently, Mr. Tillis, Merle Haggard and other stars staged a show in Tulsa, Okla., to promote Branson to 1,500 tour operators.
Lin Garlick, the "CBS This Morning" broadcast producer responsible for coordinating the program done in Branson, was impressed by the effort to sell the area. "It's very simple but effective," she said.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Journal;
Talking in Vietnam, Few Now Use the Party Line

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
Old-guard Communists still wield power here in what remains a sternly ruled one-party capital. Red banners proclaiming fidelity to the legacy of the late President Ho Chi Minh are strung across the streets of this lovely city of traditional Vietnamese and French colonial architecture.
But after decades of reticence toward foreigners and uniformity of expressed views, people in Hanoi now speak in many and varied voices. 
 They engage visitors in open conversation in the streets, eager to practice their English, which young and old are earnestly studying as the key to a better future. And, in a practice unthinkable until recently, they invite foreigners into their small apartments in rundown buildings and disclose views that belie the image of single-minded heroism and austerity cultivated under Communist rule in northern Vietnam since 1954.
A scholar in his 60's, who fought against the French in the 1940's and has been a Communist Party member since then, laughed when asked how people squared Vietnam's new enthusiasm for capitalism with equally ringing affirmations, anchored in the Constitution revised this year, of the leading role of the Communist Party.
 
A Different Look at War
 "It reminds me of my grandfather, a very strict mandarin," he said in the melodious French of the old Indochina. "When I was a boy, he sent me letters, very severe letters. 'If you don't obey your father and teachers, I don't recognize you as my grandson,' he wrote. His strictness shocked me. But later I learned that he had mistresses in every town.
"This is just like the party speeches," he added. People laugh at them. With my friends, whenever somebody mentions the differences between what we say and what we practice, all we can do is burst out laughing. The people in the countryside feel the same way. They are even more practical than pragmatists. They expect politicians to make speeches they don't mean."
Bao Ninh is the 40-year-old author of a best-selling novel that for the first time describes the war between South and North not as a heroic struggle by noble Communists against American puppets but as bitter savagery between brothers, with the destructive participation of a foreign superpower.
The novel, "The Sorrow of War," won last year's national prize of the Writers Association despite criticism of its determinedly nonheroic character. The writer was spared personal attack largely because in the novel he drew on his own experience. Drafted at the age of 19 in 1971, he took part in heavy fighting as a member of a reconnaissance company until the end of the war in 1975.
"There was bitterness," Bao Ninh (that is a pen name for Hoang Phuong) said in an interview in his crowded apartment in a Soviet-style tenement block. "True, the Americans were fierce with their bombs and sophisticated weapons. And the latter part of the war took on the dark color of civil war.
"But today," he continued, "we feel no hatred toward the Americans -- that is the truth. And when I meet a corporal from the Saigon forces, I feel closer to him than to a captain from our side."
 
A View of Postwar Vietnam
 Bao Ninh, himself a corporal, spoke of postwar Vietnam.
"We soldiers from the North feel sad today," he said. "We struggled for the liberation of the whole nation, but we achieved the poverty of the whole nation. We feel sorry for the southerners who had to become boat people, and for the nation that has become tattered, and the soldiers from the South that could find no work. We feel sorry for those who spent years in re-education camps."
Bao Ninh and his father, Hoang Tue, a linguistics scholar, disagreed with the official view that the North's victory was a triumph of Communism.
"It was a victory of the national spirit," the writer said. "The soldiers' feeling was that the Saigon army belonged to the Americans. Our aim was not to smash them to bits but to gain victory for peace. The simple soldier never thought of Communism. Maybe that was in the minds of the leaders. We wanted to get the war over with."
Bao Ninh, who served after the fighting ended in a unit that gathered the remains of fallen North Vietnamese soldiers, spoke sympathetically of the desire of American families to retrieve the remains of those still missing in Vietnam. But father and son condemned what they called the political use of the issue in the United States to delay normalization of relations with Vietnam.
The writer spoke feelingly of the far greater number of Vietnamese families who do not know if or where their sons or husbands were buried.
"Our Government is so poor," he said. "We would like to demand that Vietnamese mothers, too, can go to burn incense sticks on their sons' graves. But we know the Government can't afford it."
In the bookstores of Hanoi, plaster busts of Ho and medallions with profiles of Marx and Lenin still make up the decor. But while this trinity accounted for most of the books on sale in the past, now not even the collected speeches of the father of the Vietnamese revolution are available.
 
'Scarlett' Is the Rage
 Instead, there are pirated translations, between garish covers, of American, British or French best sellers. "Scarlett" is the rage of Hanoi, but English language textbooks and computer manuals outsell all other categories.
Even in officially arranged interviews -- in the past no more informative than editorials in the party press -- candor is now the rule.
Le Dang Doanh, deputy director of an official economics research institute, went so far as to put Marx's teaching in doubt. "He elaborated an idyllic society, without motivation," he said. "Too nice to be true. I'm far from declaring Marx is dead, but I'm absolutely against accepting Marxism as the Holy Bible."
But asked whether he felt free to publish such heretical thoughts, Mr. Doanh thought briefly. "It would be unpopular to write this," he said with a smile.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Towns Question Impact of Rail Link to Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, Conn., June 4

 BODY:
When regional transit officials proposed building a 16-mile light-rail trolley line from downtown Hartford up through this suburb and eventually to Bradley International Airport, Bloomfield immediately embraced the idea. While the other three communities on the route hesitated, planners in Bloomfield pledged that if the rail line came, the town would rezone to allow higher-density housing and stores within walking distance of the stations, a proposal that would create a whole new town center.
Transportation planners here and across the country hailed the notion of a town willing to think beyond the car culture and quarter-acre zoning. But now Bloomfield is finding that its decision has raised insecurities in neighboring towns along the proposed Griffin Line -- Hartford, Windsor and East Granby -- and that what seemed a straightforward way to bolster the fortunes of the community has become wrapped up with questions of municipal rivalries, race and class. 
 Even though the line would not be built here until near the end of the century, if then, critics and supporters alike say that just thinking about mass transit has changed things in the towns of the Tobacco Valley, named for the once-dominant cash crop along the Connecticut and Farmington Rivers.
 
Old and New Tracks
 The line would be built on an existing state-owned track bed that extends 8.5 miles from Union Station in Hartford to the northern border of Bloomfield. Land to the north for a 7.5 mile extension would have to be obtained.
In Hartford, city officials say they are afraid that proposed real-estate development in Bloomfield and on the Griffin Line farther north could siphon potential economic growth out of Hartford's troubled city center, the line's southern terminus. To the north in Windsor, residents opposing the project say that Bloomfield has simply bought into what they believe is a $280 million developer-driven boondoggle designed to benefit big landowners at the expense of residents and taxpayers.
Officials at the Greater Hartford Transit District, which has spent $500,000 on planning so far -- mostly state and Federal grants, but also more than $33,000 in private donations -- have promised towns that the Griffin Line will be built with Federal and state money or not at all and have asked for nothing from local taxpayers except cooperation. Outside Bloomfield, there has been no stampede to give even that. The other towns, which are all studying the proposal, will make preliminary decisions by this fall on whether to authorize engineering and environmental studies.
"We need to make sure we know where it's going," said Patricia M. Williams, Hartford's director of planning. "In the suburban areas, the possible negative impact that can happen to them is not as great as the possible negative impact on the city -- here we could actually lose."
Swirling throughout the debate are also questions of race and class. In Hartford, the Griffin Line would extend through the city's North End, which has some of the poorest and most heavily concentrated minority neighborhoods in the region. At the other end, through Windsor and East Granby, are mostly white, semirural areas that in some cases have not changed for decades.
 
Catalyst for Integration
 And on that question again, Bloomfield -- racially mixed and proud of it -- is a catalyst. Some town officials, with a clear air of superiority, have cast the project in terms of willingness to accept the idea of giving residents of the inner city a convenient way to get out of their neighborhoods without a car. Of Bloomfield's 19,483 residents, 41.5 percent are black, according to the 1990 census, compared with 38.9 percent in Hartford, 17.2 percent in Windsor and 1.5 percent in East Granby. Hartford, alone among the Griffin Line towns, also has a large proportion of Hispanic residents, 31.6 percent.
"Clearly, if the line is developed and utilized to its full potential," said Bloomfield's Mayor, Joseph M. Suggs Jr., "it will make areas outside Hartford more accessible to Hartford residents -- that's just a fact."
Jonathan C. Colman, the chairman of Bloomfield's Planning and Zoning Commission, who said he moved to Bloomfield 21 years ago to raise his five children in an integrated public school system, said the town was "not afraid of having a mix of people; it's not afraid of having a mix of housing; it's not afraid of being a partner in solving regional problems," and that it is therefore no coincidence that it has been so far ahead in accepting the implications of the Griffin Line.
Opponents, Mr. Colman believes, are afraid of more than economic change. "They're concerned about who's going to get on the train in Hartford or Bloomfield and ride north, and I think they're crazy and I've told them," he said.
On Stone Road, just over the Bloomfield line in Windsor, William O'Brien, leader of a local Griffin Line opposition group that has collected more than 700 signatures against the idea in the nine months since it was first raised here, conceded that some people in early meetings had said that they feared black burglars would ride up the line to their homes. But he said that the real problem was not race, but simply that the line is too expensive and is unnecessary.
"It's not that we don't want the people," Mr. O'Brien said. "We don't want the train." At any rate, Mr. O'Brien added, "Just as many white people could come out to burglarize your home as black people."
Of the total projected daily ridership of nearly 10,000 in the year 2010, about 63 percent of the riders would board in Hartford and 20 percent in Bloomfield, according to a computer model prepared by the Capitol Region Council of Governments. Only 5 percent would board in East Granby, and 2 percent in Windsor. The model does not take into account any of the 900 new proposed housing units along the line in Bloomfield or any rezoning that could be approved in any of the other towns.

HEADLINE: To Protect Bush, U.N. Will Limit Access to Talks

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 7

 BODY:
Fearing demonstrations against President Bush, the United Nations has drawn up plans to close the Earth Summit conference center to representatives of private environmental groups and to sharply reduce credentials for official delegations, United Nations officials said today.
Starting Thursday, the day before President Bush and as many as 110 heads of state and government are to meet here, a new credential system will bar virtually all private sector environmentalists from the center and will limit official missions to four delegates from each country, a United Nations official who attended an emergency security meeting on Friday said. 
 The official said he expected that press credentials would also be restricted. United Nations credentials have been issued to about 1,500 environmentalists and to about 5,000 journalists.
 
150 Protest U.S. Policy
 Today, about 150 Americans marched down Copacabana Beach in the first public protest here against the Bush Administration's environmental policies.
"George Bush, you are embarrassing us," read one banner raised by American environmentalists protesting the President's announced refusal to sign a treaty to protect plants and animals.
Chip Barber, one of the protest organizers, said, "We are here to show Brazilians that we are ashamed that our country is acting like a ball and chain at the Earth Summit."
The anti-Bush mood in Rio was summed up Friday by a front-page headline in an English language newspaper here: "U.S. Singled Out as Eco Bad Guy."
Some of the Americans here say the Bush-bashing is not justified.
 
Leftist Ties Seen
 Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota, complained today that the Earth Summit reminded him of "a meeting of the international left."
"I don't think people give the U.S. proper credit on environmental protection," he said.
Hoping to ease American "isolation" at the Earth Summit, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, a spokesman for the European Community, cautioned Saturday at a press conference: "We don't want a slugging match of everybody against the United States."
There were new reports today that the United States would continue its a tough approach to a second treaty to be signed here, one to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases believed capable of warming the earth's temperature.
 
U.S. Opposing Timetables
 During treaty talks in April and May, the United States succeeded in removing from the treaty any targets or timetables for the reduction of gases. The United States has said that it opposes timetables, arguing that they could be costly and could hurt economic activity.
Last week, three European countries -- Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands -- started an initiative to commit signers to stabilize emissions immediately. In a separate move, Germany and other European nations are working to gain support for the rapid adoption of a treaty protocol to impose targets and timetables.
Fighting back, the United States sent a "threatening" letter to the Austrian Government in Vienna last week, according to one Austrian delegate here. He declined to give details of the letter.
In addition, William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said here over the weekend that the United States will move to block the German initiative.
 
A Different U.S. View
 Senator Albert Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who is leading a Congressional delegation here, said today, "I find it incomprehensible that we would object to other countries declaring that they want to meet targets and timetables."
More dissatisfaction with the Earth Summit came today from a group called Earth Parliament, a congress representing 220 groups from around the globe.
"At this moment governments of the rich nations are discussing how to exert even more control over the less favored nations," read a statement adopted by the assembly. "In doing so, they continue to ignore our unique knowledge and technical skill which have been perfected over millennia in our special relationship with the eco-systems which we inhabit."
But the relationship of one Brazilian Indian to his environment caused environmentalists to wince today.
Mario Juruna, a 49-year-old member of the Xavante ethnic group, displayed for sale at the Global Forum, an environmental fair here, the skin of a spotted jaguar, an endangered species.
"When Indians are free, we are going to sell snakes, caymans, and jaguars," Mr. Juruna, said to the dismay of assembled naturalists.

HEADLINE: Voices of Israel: To Many, the Fruits of the '67 War Taste Bitter

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 7

 BODY:
On the 25th anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War, Israelis are talking about the road their country has traveled since that June.
The war, from June 5 to June 10, was the most significant event for Israel since its war of independence in 1948, a dazzling victory over neighboring Arab countries that left the Israelis with far more territory and breathing room but also with many more domestic divisions and international disputes. 
 The evocations stand in sharp contrast to the almost total silence about the 10th anniversary of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which began in exactly the same period in 1982 and created a quagmire the Israelis would rather forget.
As Israelis observed the anniversary, Clyde Haberman and Joel Greenberg spoke with people of different backgrounds and political views. Here are their thoughts about the past and the present:
 
Shabtai Teveth
 
A historian; 66 years old; author of several books, including two accounts of the 1967 war and "The Cursed Blessing," on the occupation of the West Bank and its aftermath.
The blessing of 1967 was that Israel proved again that it was viable and not, as the Arabs imagined, something that could be wiped off the map without much effort. It was a return to the land of the Bible. Suddenly, Israel became the Land of Israel. The Zionist dream and the Biblical return were fused into one reality.
Then there was a change, whose agent was the success of Moshe Dayan's policy in the territories in the first 20 years after 1967. There was a feeling that the territories were neither a political nor a security burden, and that we can go on holding them. We were lulled by our success, and Israelis began thinking they could reap political fruits from military victory and create conditions for annexation.
This trend was joined by the rise to power of Likud, which always believed in obtaining Zionist political aims by force of arms. The 1982 Lebanon war testified to this new approach. That war split Israeli opinion, and later the intifada deepened the split.
Over the last 25 years, Israel has lost its consensus on acts of war. We lost one of the most important things needed for our existence, for our progress and for our future relations with the Arabs: That is the national consensus. The curse of the blessing of 1967 is that we are now a house divided against itself.
 
Zeev Chafets
 
A Government press officer under Prime Minister Menachem Begin; a writer, now 44 years old; born in Michigan; emigrated to Israel two months after the 1967 war.
Israel in 1967 was still very much dominated by Labor Zionist orthodoxy. It was dominated by the sabra elite and by an Eastern European parent generation. The parents were symbolized by Golda Meir and Levi Eshkol. Ben-Gurion was still alive. There was a correct answer to every issue, from when peace would come, to the right way to be an Israeli.
People put up with that very high-handed, very paternalistic, very exclusionary elite Government because of the incredible prestige that it enjoyed. That prestige hit its highest point with the 1967 war. And it was very difficult for anyone who was outside this "in" crowd -- Oriental Jews, new immigrants, Orthodox Jews or urban bourgeois types -- to quarrel with the incredible success that those people had had. No matter what you thought of them, you had to admit that at least they knew best.
All that broke down after the 1973 war. The prestige of the founders and of the sabra sons' generation was shattered. We almost lost that war. After 1973 it became clear that they didn't know what they were doing, or at least that they didn't know better than anyone else. And that opened the way for all sorts of change.
People think about Israel and they think about the Palestinian question. But what gets missed is that in the last large numbers of years, the Palestinian problem hasn't changed very much. All the change has taken place in the unobserved areas of Israeli life, in things that don't interest people too much but make up the fabric of the society.
Israel today is much more democratic than it was in 1967. It's much more pluralistic and culturally interesting. It's more realistic, less utopian, less naive. It's a much more tolerant country than it was. The notion that this was a little Eden in 1967 and has since degenerated into this terrible repressive society is utter nonsense.
 
Leah Shakdiel
 
A religious feminist; 41 years old; running for Parliament as a leader of Hatikva, or The Hope, a small party urging greater economic and social equality.
I was a high-school student during the Six-Day War, and I remember the incredible excitement in my family when we heard about the liberation of Jerusalem. It had profound national meaning, the liberation of our ancestral land. In the early 1970's I was very impressed by the idealism, spiritual values and sacrifices made by the [religious nationalist] Gush Emunim movement.
In the mid-70's I started having doubts. It seemed to me that the people of Israel were being neglected for the sake of hallowed ground, and spiritual energy was being spent on the "liberated territories."
It was clear as daylight that a revision was necessary in our traditional positions that identified nationalism with ignoring the Arabs: We were immersed in our own drama, and they were statistics somewhere, to be disregarded. Today this is impossible. The talk of "liberated territories" now looks absurd. Territories aren't liberated, people are. The Jewish people, while claiming to have liberated territories, is unable see it is enslaving people in the process. There's a dual morality.
After 1967 people started treating the occupation as a force of nature that can't be changed. We are in a paradox. On the one hand we have genuine security concerns, but we can't deal with them as long as we rule another population. An artificial doubling of territory gives people a false sense of security and prevents them from seeing problems in their correct proportions: We're terribly big and strong, but on the other hand we're terribly weak and threatened. We rule the Arabs, and at the same time we're scared to death of them.
 
Azmi Bishara
 
Describes himself as a Palestinian citizen of Israel; from the Israeli Arab town of Nazareth and now living in East Jerusalem; 35 years old; teaches Palestinians at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank and works at an Israeli research institute; proposes granting cultural autonomy to Israeli Arabs.
In 1967 we renewed contact with Palestinians in the territories, and with our cultural, religious and national continuity. It was a rediscovery of the Palestinian self after an isolation of 20 years. At the same time you discovered what distinguishes the Palestinian minority in Israel from the Palestinians under occupation: the status of being a citizen. There were two parallel processes: Palestinization and Israelization.
The Arabs in Israel became Israelis only after 1967. Before that they were a minority who had been defeated. They wanted to show loyalty, they were afraid, and so their Israelization was not real. It was not an internal process.
After 1967, two processes began: solidarity with the part of the Palestinian people under occupation, and at the same time discovering the distinctions. This is the real Israelization: You are a citizen and they are not, and this status brings with it some benefits, like freedom of speech and movement, and economic benefits. There is a contradiction here, and I am living the conflict all the time.
When soldiers came and started breaking chairs on the heads of my Bir Zeit students, I was not ashamed of "our soldiers," as my Israeli leftist friends were. I saw the soldiers as the enemy. It's not my state. I'm a Palestinian, and the state declares itself the state of the Jews, so I don't have the privilege of being ashamed of it. Neither the flag nor national anthem are mine.
But there are Israeli intellectuals who are my friends, people I love and care for, like the Palestinians I care for. It is really my society, but it is not Israeli society, it is a subculture. The most hostile phenomena to me are Israeli phenomena, but some of the closest people to me are Israelis. I'm very much a stranger here, and at the same time I belong here too much.
 
Yisrael Harel
 
A former newspaper editor; 51 years old; moved to the West Bank settlement of Ofra in 1976; heads the Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza.
We are full of memories, but maybe we neglect important conclusions from our past.
Everything was written on the wall before the Holocaust, and people didn't believe it. People went on the trains. They didn't want to believe they were being taken to concentration camps. It looks to me that in certain ways we continue it in Israel.
Of course we are not facing a Holocaust. But we refuse to see the signs on the wall. The biggest is the denial of what we can expect from those who live around us if we do not behave as a people who are in a state of constant war and an object of constant hatred. Who knows when it's going to stop, when you have against you people who are able to do all these impossible atrocities to their own people?
The elites in this county -- cultural, political, academic -- will tell you that if we were greater peace lovers, then we wouldn't need these defense budgets, that it's only because the Government doesn't want real peace. When they go on sabbatical or to a conference, they meet people from a different world and they are asked hard questions: What are you people doing to Palestinian boys? Then they start to apologize.
We Jews in general, and Israelis in particular, are very concerned about what people think of us: Do we look nice? But makeup cannot help. We are dealing with basic questions. Those people who have guilt feelings and don't see the danger, and are willing to accept Palestinians back from exile, are like a body that's lost its immunities. They are more concerned about how they look to others, and it overwhelms their instincts about what has to be done. When it comes to your existence, the hell with what that professor or diplomat or journalist thinks of you.
 
Arie Eliav
 
A 70-year-old Labor member of Parliament who chose not to run this month; directs an educational project in the Negev.
The Six-Day War was a heroic and tragic watershed. Looking back over 25 years, it's become another Israel. And you balance everything out, it is a worse place, no doubt about it. The war was a fortune that became a misfortune.
Nobody will deny that from 1948 to 1967, Israel, with all its deficiencies, was a democracy by every yardstick. But in the 25 years of our rule over the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza, it's become a nondemocracy. It's a country under military rule. What we are doing is against the teachings of the prophets -- this conquest, this rule over minorities, this treatment of the stranger in our midst. Eventually, continuation of the conquest will make Israel less and less tolerant. It's inbred. You can't be a tolerant conqueror.
Settlements are not only a hindrance, they are a catalyst for losing our goals, the Jewish, Zionist, Israeli values. It started with the Labor Government, but it continued more and more with this Government. What Sharon is doing is sending a curse on Israel. It's messianic craziness.
The settlements are a burden on the army. Most of the Israeli top generals, past and present, will tell you that they don't need them for security reasons. They need some observation posts. The army is our guarantee, and many of the settlements are just a burden for it.

There is a great difference in the motivation of those who came 20 years ago and those coming from Russia now. Twenty years ago, people had a certain kind of Jewish motivation. Most could definitely find fulfillment and happiness here, although not everybody completely agreed with how things were going. In Russia, Jews were very successful in industry, in culture and arts. There was a stereotype that anything in Jewish hands is somehow perfect, relatively at least. So here, they expected management to be perfect, and it upset many of them that it was far from that. But still many came with a feeling of belonging.
Nowadays, it's just a desire to find a better place. Many new immigrants feel very much like strangers because they lack any knowledge of the culture, of language, of the religion. The No. 1 question is employment, and given the incredible task for a small nation to absorb 10 percent of its population in two years, Israel has failed to provide everybody a relevant job. Most were in high positions in Russia, and they are forced to do simple labor like sweeping streets and washing dishes in hotels.
It is difficult for me to imagine how it would be if I were not religious or not a Zionist. If they do not become involved in Jewish education, culture and heritage, it will be very hard for them, and I do not know if they will stay or not.

The focus of an emotional debate last month when she prevented a mob attack on a Palestinian who had stabbed and lightly wounded an Israeli boy in downtown Jerusalem; a rigorously Orthodox Jew; 40 years old; won both praise and abuse from other Israelis, reflecting the inherent tensions and the flashes of hope that are part of the last 25 years.
Yes, the Arabs have stabbed children. But still, we as Jews, the chosen people, have to take a very deep breath before taking the law into our own hands. People shouted at me after the stabbing, "An eye for an eye!" But these are crucial matters of life and death that in our history were decided in a court of scholars.
We have to set limits, because violence is so much in the air. That is a big change that has occurred in recent years. Relations in general between people in our society have deteriorated, and the Arabs are also bearing this burden. The loss of respect for human life is there in the careless driving and serious accidents on the roads, in beatings, drugs and child abuse. It's a process that has taken years. People are not at peace. There are tensions, and they extend in every direction.
I protected someone because he was a human being, and found that I had to explain myself. Our people are so divided, so confused, so politicized. The public is very tired.

HEADLINE: BUSH WOULD OUST RIO MEMO'S LEAKER

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 7

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would like to dismiss the official who made public a confidential memo suggesting revisions that might reverse the American position on an international treaty to protect plants and animals.
"Help me find him," the President said at a news conference at Camp David, Md. "He'd be gainfully unemployed." 
 Mr. Bush and his aides were furious at the disclosure by an unidentified official last week of a confidential memorandum from William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who said the United States should agree to what he called "minor modifications" of the treaty being considered at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to alleviate international criticism of Washington's refusal to sign the document.
Hours after Mr. Reilly proposed the changes, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and the President's domestic policy coordinator, Clayton Yeutter, rejected the idea.
Mr. Bush spoke at a news conference at Camp David, the Presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains, where he spent the weekend with Prime Minister John Major of Britain. Although Britain and Japan indicated on Friday that they would sign the agreement, known as the bio-diversity treaty, Mr. Major today avoided criticizing Mr. Bush for refusing to go along.
 
Britain's Problems 'Different'
 "We all have different problems with the bio-diversity convention, on the levels of technology transfer, on the protection of intellectual property," Mr. Major said, adding that Britain's problems were "different than those of the United States."
Mr. Bush said Mr. Reilly had been doing his job when he proposed the changes in a confidential memo. But referring to an article published Friday in The New York Times, Mr. Bush said, "For someone, who may or not have been opposed to the document, to the treaty, or any changes, to leak it, it's insidious."
Although Mr. Bush acknowledged that there was no issue of national security at stake, he added: "I'd like to find the leaker, and I'd like to see the leaker filed -- fired. Filed would be all right. No, but the reason is, it's very difficult to conduct government if somebody, in his or her infinite wisdom, can shape the wisdom by leaking documents."
Mr. Bush also said the political, military and ethnic upheavals sweeping Eastern Europe after the collapse of Communism were "growing pains."
"The new world order is not facing one common objective: an aggressive international Communism," Mr. Bush said.
"Nobody said that the emergence of freedom would be easy," he said, adding that of the countries now in the grip of political and ethnic unrest, "I don't know that any one of them wants to now turn its back on democracy."

NEW YORK CITY
 
A NEW EQUALITY IN EARNINGS IN QUEENS 
 An analysis of the latest census has generated a finding that some demographers say is nothing short of astounding: the median household income for blacks in Queens has virtually matched that of whites. The 1990 census figures showed that, over the previous decade, the household income of blacks rose 31 percent, adjusted for inflation, compared with 18 percent for whites. Demographers say that while national comparisons are still incomplete, they believe that Queens is the largest political subdivision where blacks and whites share a common median income. A1.
 
IF BUSES DON'T ROLL, 225,000 MAY WALK
City transportation officials were bracing for big traffic delays in the event that 225,000 commuters in Queens and Brooklyn are stranded by a strike against five privately owned bus companies. Amid last-minute negotiations, the officials warned that a walkout would significantly add to highway congestion as commuters used their cars, taxis or illegal vans to get into Manhattan or to subway stations. The strike, threatened by more than 2,000 drivers, mechanics and dispatchers, would affect riders throughout areas the private bus lines are the primary form of mass transportation into Manhattan. B3.
 
A CHALLENGE TO REDISTRICTING PLAN
Arguing that New York City's Hispanic residents would be shortchanged, an advocacy group is asking the Federal courts to strike down a Congressional redistricting plan that the State Legislature is expected to approve this week. Hispanic leaders say there should be at least at least three districts in which Hispanic residents are a majority, not the two in the current proposal. "As the fastest-growing group in the city, we deserve more representation," said the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "Two seats is not fair." B3.
 
ASKING FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE
Hispanic and Asian social-service agencies are challenging old-line charities, many of whose original charges long since ascended into the middle-class and whose board members and officials no longer reflect the race, ethnicity or religion of their current clientele. Up for grabs is $2.6 billion in contracts for services ranging from foster care to job training that New York City awards to private agencies. At issue are fundamental questions of fairness: how to nurture emerging community groups without punishing established agencies that have provided services for decades. Metro Matters, B3.
 
 REGION
 
EQUAL ACCESS IN HEALTH PLAN
Legislative leaders and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo have agreed to a major overhaul of New York State's health-insurance system, including provisions that would compel commercial insurance companies to accept all applicants, no matter how sick, and would forbid them from charging higher rates based on factors like age and sex. After weeks of meetings, negotiators said they were satisfied that all sides were committed to the broad outlines of a plan that advocates for improved health care say would make insurance cheaper for the sick and elderly. A1.
 
POLLUTION CLOSES A POPULAR BEACH
The beach at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island suffered its worst erosion in 30 years during storms over the weekend, and when the fog cleared, the sand was covered with large oil balls that had washed in during high tide, forcing state officials to close the beach. B5.
 
A RIVER RAN THROUGH IT
People returned to their flooded homes and began to clean up the damage from the weekend flooding in Connecticut. In Wallingford, a group of mostly elderly residents of a trailer park hosed off their homes and compared the flood to the last time the Quinnipiac River overflowed, on the same day 10 years ago. B5.
 
A CRUEL SPRING FOR THE PINELANDS
First it was the wildfires in May, then the clouds of hungry looper moths and finally a severe frost that gave large parts of the New Jersey Pinelands, a million-acre preserve, the brown look of late fall. It has not been a good spring for the Pinelands and the signs of distress are everywhere. The health of the Pinelands forest is of interest to people beyond hikers and nature lovers: a new management plan is being drafted that, among other things, will deal with the issue of how much timber can be harvested.

Private Agencies Fight For Funds to Help Poor

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"They also serve who only stand and wait" may have been John Milton's credo. But emerging groups of black, Hispanic and Asian social-service agencies are getting tired of waiting to serve.
Their decision to take a stand is reverberating within some of the venerable philanthropic agencies, many of whose original charges long since ascended into the middle-class and whose board members and officials no longer reflect the race, ethnicity or religion of their current clientele. 
 Up for grabs are $2.6 billion in contracts for services ranging from foster care to job training that New York City awards to private providers. Revised rules may elevate fledgling agencies in the competition for declining funds.
Also at stake is a question of fundamental fairness: how to nurture the emerging community organizations -- some of which may, in fact, be more representative of and sensitive to their constituents -- without sacrificing standards based on performance or punishing those established agencies that for decades have provided services through government contracts and their own philanthropy without regard to the recipients' race, religion or ethnic background.
It's an economic and social question with profound political consequences.
"There's a tremendous danger that you could trigger the next wave of white flight if there's a widespread perception that contracts are going to be handed out on the basis of ethnicity and not on the basis of ability," said City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher, a member of Councilwoman Carolyn B. Maloney's Contracts Committee, which has considered the issue.
That perception was fueled last fall when City Hall, faced with deep cuts in Federal heating subsidies, shrunk the number of field offices where poor people could apply. Six of seven centers managed by Jewish organizations and the only one run by an Irish group were dropped. Four new offices were opened in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, responding to criticism by the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors, said two weeks ago that the city would study whether a pattern of discrimination against black and Hispanic nonprofit organizations justified the imposition of goals to guarantee that those groups get more contracts. (His administration denied that it had discriminated and delicately said rules suggested by the Puerto Rican group "may need to be fine-tuned to make them less restrictive, lest they result in being exclusionary rather than inclusionary.")
The city's Human Resources Administration began a survey last month to determine what proportion of its contracts goes to organizations that serve or are run by Asians, blacks, Caribbeans, women and Jews, the only category of whites specified.
"The irony is that as the newer groups began to develop and New York's multiculturalism increased, we found ourselves having to cut back on contracts," said Cesar A. Perales, the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services. "That's when we began to see some competition among the groups for the first time."
That competition flared again this spring when Federation Employment and Guidance Service, a distinguished 58-year-old organization, was denied a major job-training contract by the city's Department of Employment. The matter was was quietly resolved but not without hurt feelings.
"In this climate," Mr. Perales said, "people are going to be suspicous that we have a black Mayor taking things away from Jewish organizations and dividing them among other groups."
What constitutes a community-based group, though? "Our definition," said Michael C. Rogers, director of the Mayor's Office of Contracts, "is that since you don't own a nonprofit, it should be not the executive director, not just the population served, but who controls the board."
David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society and of Black Agency Executives, agreed that predominantly white groups "have to believe in themselves enough to open up their leadership, and not only to the people who are 'safe.' " But he noted that the issue is usually debated only in private.
"What do they mean by community control?" said Alfred P. Miller, executive vice president of Federation Employment and Guidance Service, which provides educational, training and home-care services to black and Hispanic, as well as white, clients. "It should mean service to that community. It doesn't mean your executive office has to be in that community."
How to strike a balance and best serve the poor? "It's like good brandy -- you can't dump the old for the new, but you want a mixture," Mr. Miller said. "There's an obligation on the part of the older agencies to transfer technology and engage in joint ventures with the new ones. Wouldn't it be better if we helped them become part of the establishment?"

HEADLINE: Slow Start At Europe's Disneyland

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, June 7

 BODY:
Euro Disneyland, which opened with immense fanfare almost two months ago, has encountered teething problems, and its normally ebullient executives are backing away from their unbridled optimism.
Euro Disney stock plunged 5 percent Friday, to 109.5 French francs on the Paris bourse, more than 20 percent below its price when the park opened and more than 30 percent below its high. 
 The fall followed a report issued Thursday in which Euro Disney said it was having difficulty attracting people from the Paris region and suggested that it might not be profitable in the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30.
 
Reaction in New York
 Euro Disneyland is 49 percent owned by the Walt Disney Company, whose stock fell $1.875 a share on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, and another 75 cents Friday, closing the week at $36.50.
On the eve of the park's opening on April 12, its chief financial officer, John Forsgren, had said in an interview that the park would show a profit in the period to Sept. 30, guaranteeing that Euro Disney would make money in the fiscal year.
"It's going to be a small profit, but that's still something of an achievement," he said at the time.
But the company's view seems to have shifted since then. In Thursday's report, Euro Disney said, "In light of the operating uncertainties, there can be no assurance as to whether the group will achieve profitability during the fiscal year."
 
Income From Interest
 For the first half, the company announced net income of 74.57 million francs ($14 million), essentially from interest on the cash it is holding.
The report said attendance at the park and guests at Euro Disney's six hotels there had fluctuated considerably during the period. "Activity on weekends and holidays has significantly exceeded that of midweek periods," it said. It promised new advertising and tight management of costs in response to the situation.
Euro Disneyland's opening was accompanied by a barrage of withering critiques from French intellectuals. Left-of-center newspapers have been quick to seize on small indications that things are not going as planned, like statements by workers on the rail line leading to the park that the trains are empty.
Up to now, Euro Disneyland has vehemently denied the talk. But Thursday's report said that surveys in France "indicate that misleading reports of traffic jams and overcrowding have led many, especially residents of the Ile-de-France region, to postpone until the fall their plans to visit the resort." The Ile-de-France is the area around Paris.
When it opened, Euro Disney said it hoped to attract 11 million people in its first year. Since then, 1.5 million people have come, but the company said on Thursday that it was impossible to extrapolate meaningfully from initial results.
Paul Slattery, an industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the report was not surprising given that most European economies were in a mild recession. The price of admission at Euro Disneyland is $48 for adults and $28 for children. Lunch of a hot dog, soda and bag of chips is about $6.50; an ice cream bar about $3.
Mr. Slattery said he expected Euro Disney shares to fall "at least another 10 percent."
Many analysts believe the critical test for the park will be to attract visitors in the winter, something no theme park in France has done.
Euro Disney also said it was postponing the opening of Disney MGM Studios Europe, the second phase of its project, to 1996 from 1995.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Publishers' Best Seller: The Backlist

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
The book is a publisher's dream: a sure-bet novel by a popular author, but there are no big advances, no artist's fee for a cover design, no big cross-country promotional tour for the author and no bad reviews that could mar the debut.
What's the catch? There is none, and the truth is there are thousands of books just like it at virtually every publishing house. 
 Backlist books -- books from previous seasons that become part of a publisher's regular repertoire -- are the dependable mainstay of publishing. Publishers and booksellers say that as the economy continues to wobble, more attention is being paid to marketing and selling them.
 
'It Pays the Bills'
 Backlist books are the blue jeans and T-shirts in an industry where most outsiders pay more attention to the haute couture -- the hot new best sellers. Backlists include the classics (Dickens and Homer, for instance), guide books, cookbooks, reference books and reprints of best sellers from past seasons, titles that are familiar and durable.
"Backlist isn't sexy," said Carl Lennertz, director of backlist marketing for the Random House adult trade division, "but it pays the bills."
The trend of pushing backlist books was evident at the American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, Calif., recently, where several publishers were offering special deals and discounts on backlist books. One of the most notable backlist promotions was at the Bantam, Doubleday, Dell booths, where for the second year running the publisher set up a mini-bookstore featuring its entire backlist.
"The backlist is the core of our business," said Stephen Weitzer, president of sales and marketing at Bantam, Doubleday, Dell. "It is something we are all paying increasingly more attention to as we look for ways to get more out of what we have."
 
Tie-Ins to New Books
 Mr. Weitzer said his company frequently looked for ways to tie in backlist titles with new books. Bantam, for example, has just reissued a new paperback edition of Judith Krantz's "Scruples," which it first published in paperback in 1979, to coincide with Crown's publication of "Scruples Two." Bantam is offering the book at $3.99, compared with the $5.99 such a book would ordinarily cost.
Random House also made a big backlist push at the booksellers convention, offering special discounts to booksellers who placed orders there. Usually, Mr. Lennertz said, Random House takes very few orders at the convention and uses the event to promote new books and mingle with clients. But this year, he said, it sold more than $1 million of backlist titles.
Most publishers say backlist titles of adult trade books make up about 25 to 30 percent of their overall business. Adding backlist children's and reference books more than doubles that percentage.
Rubin Pfeffer, managing director of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's trade division, said the adult trade backlist accounted for about 45 percent of his company's business.
 
Redesigned Covers
 Mr. Pfeffer said Harcourt frequently redesigned the covers for backlist books to give them a second breath of publishing life. The publisher recently redesigned all of Alice Walker's books to coincide with this year's publication of a new novel, "Possessing the Secret of Joy," and last year's publication of a new poetry collection, "Her Blue Body Everything We Know."
Moreover, he noted, the company's latest catalogue devotes 14 of its 96 pages to the backlist, including books by Ms. Walker, C .S. Lewis, Eudora Welty and Virginia Woolf.
Many publishers have started to repackage and promote backlist books to coincide with events like Black History Month, Women's History Month and, this month, Gay Pride Month.
"Those kinds of promotions get backlist books off the wall and onto the floor," said Charles R. Cumello, the president and chief executive of Waldenbooks, who added that backlist books accounted for about half of the book sales at his stores.
 
Prestige and Reputation
 But backlist is not only profit to a publishing house; it is also prestige and reputation. Publishers hope that by publishing distinguished authors from their backlists, they will attract new writers for the front list.
Houghton Mifflin's publishing of books by Rachel Carson, Dian Fosse and Jane Goodall over the years has brought other naturalist writers to the company, said Joseph A. Kanon, director of the publisher's trade and reference division.
Farrar, Straus & Giroux is particularly known for keeping its authors in print. John McPhee, for example, has written 24 books for the publisher and all 24 are in print and are in the process of being repackaged in similiar covers.
"Being able to keep books in print is a big attraction to an author," said Roger W. Straus, Farrar, Straus & Giroux's president and chief executive. "It tells them that you value them and that you value literary tradition."
But Michael Jacobs, president of Viking-Penguin, said that while the backlist might be "the annuity of a publishing house," it loses its value if it is taken for granted.
"A backlist that lays dormant doesn't sell," he said. "It has to be nurtured and promoted. And a backlist can be a great resource for analyzing what works. There's a great, old sales expression, 'Sell more of what sells.' "

HEADLINE: An Empire Built on Steel Rods

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

 BODY:
While some people look at old steel plants as symbols of faded industrial might, unsuitable for anything but abandonment, James A. Todd Jr. has a vastly different vision.
To Mr. Todd, the chairman of the Birmingham Steel Corporation, these shuttered and unprofitable plants are opportunities that are waiting only for the right mix of capital and management. 
 So Mr. Todd, 63 years old, has been buying aging or failing steel operations, one by one -- seven all together -- and resuscitating them. In the eight years of Birmingham Steel's existence, that strategy has taken his company's operations far beyond the suburban office tower here where he and his staff work.
Birmingham Steel's purchases have ranged from mills in Seattle to plants in Illinois, all in the name of producing steel reinforcing bars used by the construction industry. And for the most part that strategy has led to shining successes, a testimony to what can be achieved in the emerging world of the steel mini-mill.
A mini-mill is a company that makes steel by using electricity to melt scrap, rather than by starting with iron ore. Smaller than the giant steel companies, mini-mills generally are not unionized and often focus on one or two steel products rather than making all steel goods for all customers.
Now, against a backdrop of subdued earnings during the nation's two-year economic slump and an increased investment in technology by other mini-mill companies, some steel experts say that for all Mr. Todd has accomplished, it is time for a fresh approach.
"The main challenge for Birmingham Steel is to go beyond piecing together castoff mills and to move into being a quality producer using newer technologies," said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants Inc. in Philadelphia. "It has worked well so far, but how will it play in the coming decade?"
Discussions about Birmingham Steel often seem to invite comparisons with the Nucor Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., the nation's largest mini-mill company. Nucor has adopted new technology to produce sheet steel, the bread and butter of the big steel companies.
Mr. Todd acknowledged that he would like to emulate Nucor's technological prowess -- someday -- but added that it would be at least several years before that could occur.
"We feel we have to go where Nucor is," he said. "We're looking at every approach being done in the world and deciding which one we should do."
Among the projects currently on the agenda is the construction of a mill near Phoenix. Scheduled for completion in 1994, the mill will make reinforcing steel for sale in the Southwest and Mexico.
And Mr. Todd said he remained ever on the lookout for another acquisition. "We do plan to make more acquisitions, and we think that right now is an attractive time to do that," he said. "We are convinced that there continue to be opportunities in the mini-mill business. We think that mini-mills will account for 40 to 45 percent of the steel business in this country in the next decade or so, and we plan to have a big stake in that."
 
A Few Missteps
 But not all of Birmingham Steel's purchases have been successful. A plant in Norfolk, Va., bought in 1988, was mothballed earlier last year because it could not operate profitably. "It took 16 hours to do the maintenance to run it for 8," Mr. Todd said, adding that the purchase was "not one of our brilliant moves."
The company also closed a mill last year in California that it bought in 1987, citing the high rates for electricity.
And like nearly all other steel companies, Birmingham Steel has been ravaged by the recession, which weakened the market for steel products and caused profits to thin in the last two years.
After record earnings of $39 million in the 1989 fiscal year, Birmingham saw its profits decline, reporting a paltry $21,000 in net earnings for the fiscal year that ended last June 30. "It was the most disappointing period in the company's history," Mr. Todd said.
But while Mr. Todd, in an interview in his office here, acknowledged the hits and misses, he was quick to insist that his company was on solid footing and in the early stages of a rebound that would be robust, once the economy picked up.
Birmingham Steel's performance compares quite favorably, Mr. Todd said, with the losses recorded by the big integrated steel companies and many mini-mill companies as well.
While Birmingham Steel had net income of $3.5 million in the first three months of 1992, its fiscal third quarter, Mr. Todd noted that Bethlehem Steel lost $44.6 million and USX's steel division lost $13 million. Minimill competitors like Oregon Steel, New Jersey Steel, Bayou Steel and Roanoke Electric also fell short of Birmingham's earnings, he said.
Many people who follow the steel industry say the success of Birmingham Steel is a testament to Mr. Todd's acquisition philosophy. Buying at bargain-basement prices, usually when operations are on the verge of being idled, Mr. Todd then tries to operate them at costs far below those of his competitors. Birmingham Steel's workers take 1.6 hours to produce a ton of steel, compared with the industry average of about 5.
"Jim Todd is a very good operator and good businessman who has found opportunity where many did not think opportunity existed," said F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman and chief executive. "Of course, his approach to the mini-mill industry is different from ours, but it seems to work for him."
 
'We Were in the Steel Business'
 Mr. Todd, a native of West Virginia, is known among employees and industry executives for being particularly straightforward, as well as being driven by a desire to keep costs low.
"He is an energetic guy who pushes harder for profits than most executives I've ever known," said Jerry L. Ledbetter, general manager of the company's plant in Jackson, Miss.
For 25 years, after graduating from West Virginia University, Mr. Todd worked for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, serving in various sales and marketing positions. He left to work as vice president of marketing for the Atlas Powder Company, a manufacturer of explosives owned by the Tyler Corporation.
In 1977, he became president of the United Affiliates Corporation, a subsidiary of the United Coal Company, and three years later, was named chairman and chief executive of the Birmingham Bolt Company, when it was acquired by United Affiliates.
Birmingham Steel was put together in 1984, when AEA Investors Inc., a New York investment group, bought Birmingham Bolt. Birmingham Bolt ran two small steel operations -- in Birmingham and Kankakee, Ill. -- that made products for the company's roof manufacturing plants.
"I soon realized that we were in the steel business and that's where our future would be," Mr. Todd said.
 
Low End, Nonunion
 The company bought Mississippi Steel in 1985 and went public later that year, renaming itself Birmingham Steel. Next came the acquisition of plants in Norfolk in 1986 and in Seattle later that year. In 1987, the company bought a mill in California and, last year, bought another steel plant in Seattle.
The company's plan was to produce reinforcing bars, an item at the low end of steel product offerings, with a nonunion work force and low capital costs. The work force is paid on the basis of an incentive system linked directly to output and productivity.
In the last 15 years, mini-mills have virtually taken away from the big steel producers the market for concrete-reinforcement bars used in highways and construction projects. And, until the recession, Birmingham Steel's profits rolled in, as the company became the nation's largest producer of the reinforcement bars.
"The company's track record, as far as profits go, has been quite good," said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group. "The recession affected them, but not to the extent it affected some others in the industry. That's because Jim Todd stresses keeping costs down to a bare-bones level. He is known for that."
 
Not a Hero of the Steelworkers
 Mr. Todd is also known for speaking his mind, and at no time is he more blunt than when discussing unions. Birmingham Steel, like many mini-mill companies, is completely nonunion, and Mr. Todd hopes the company always will be.
"We do not see any way that the union is interested in building the steel industry in the United States," he said. "We simply cannot live with their work rules because they seem to be more interested in maintaining the status quo and so interested in protecting the older workers' pensions that they discriminate against younger workers."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Todd is not a hero to the leaders of the United Steelworkers of America. "Mr. Todd is not fond of unions and isn't fond of the idea that the law gives them the choice to be unionized," said Richard H. Davis, interim director of the United Steelworkers' District 36, which covers four Southern states. "He intrudes in employee decision-making on unionism. His attitude is terrible and not very progressive."
In fact, Mr. Todd was the object of derision from members of the United Steelworkers in Seattle, after Birmingham Steel bought the assets of a steel plant and replaced union members with nonunion employees from a nearby mill that Birmingham had previously closed.
 
Cash to Invest
 The union critics aside, some steel experts question whether Birmingham Steel can prosper in an era in which the most successful mini-mills are expected to be those taking on new technology and making sheet steel for the automobile and appliance industries.
A public offering earlier this year raised $63 million, and Mr. Todd said that he expected the company to generate $150 million in cash flow in the next fiscal year. That would give him the footing in cash and borrowing ability to invest in technology, particularly sheet steel production.
"Some of our ideas work out well and some of them don't," Mr. Todd said. "But we always feel we always have to keep trying something."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
3 Reasons to Put Aside Worries About Inflation

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
With recent increases in the price of oil and other important commodities and signs that economic recovery will not fade this year the way it did in 1991, some credit market participants are starting to worry that the best news on inflation may be about over.
But such market concerns are not shared by a wide range of current and former policy makers. 
 Last week, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, made what seemed an uncharacteristically bold prediction when he said that inflation pressures would remain low for two to three years. Using that forecast as a platform, Mr. Greenspan said in the next breath that the inflation-expectation premium reflected in current bond yields was much too high.
 
Frustration on Long-Term Rates
 "It is pretty heroic to go out that far with a forecast," said William Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm in New York. "And it seems to us that it is quite an undertaking to say that inflation is not a problem going forward."
In part, Mr. Greenspan was voicing frustration over the Fed's inability to get long-term market interest rates below the range of 7.75 percent to 8.25 percent, where they have remained for well over a year, even as short-term rates have plummeted. But despite Mr. Griggs's reservations, a number of private economists said they found no fault with the Fed chairman's outlook.
With prices rising at a rate of about 3 percent a year, "we haven't been in an inflation environment this benign in 20 years," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "And yet long-term rates are at least 2 percentage points higher now than they were then."
This low-inflation view, economists said, was supported by at least three underlying assumptions: oil prices will remain fairly constant; economic growth for two to three years will be 2 percent to 2.5 percent, and private credit demand will not rebound strongly once recovery is in place.
And the analysts said there were sound reasons to embrace all three.
Although reports of a change in Saudi production plans have pushed oil prices up recently, analysts said supply-and-demand fundamentals provided little reason to expect a continued increase.
"I look at sluggish growth everywhere around the world, and more supply coming on stream from places like Kuwait and other countries," said Paul D. Mastroddi, an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. "Over the long run, higher oil prices does not impress me as a story that is fundamentally sound."
Similarly, the economy does not seem to have the ability to expand at a sustainable clip of more than 2 to 2.5 percent. And inflation triggers that might be pulled if growth is faster -- including rising wages and price increases induced by factories operating at close to full capacity -- pose no threat for the foreseeable future.
"Wage inflation has never, ever gone up when the unemployment rate is above 5.5 percent, which is considered to be when the country is at full employment," Mr. Mastroddi said. "And even if the economy grows at a 4 percent rate for three years, it would take all that time to use up the excess capacity we have currently."
Rather than reflecting expectations of future inflation, some market participants said fears of a clash between public and private credit demand explained why bond yields remained so high.
"I take some comfort from Mr. Greenspan's view that the inflationary prospects are encouraging, and I don't think the market is quarreling with that view, " said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, primary dealers in Government securities. "I think the Federal budget deficit is the reason for the premium. We are conducting our Federal finances like a banana republic."
For the last year or more, ballooning budget deficits have been financed fairly easily, in large part because private credit demand has been extremely weak.
But many assume that condition will change as the economy improves, and businesses begin to borrow at a healthier clip.
Charles Clough Jr., chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, does not share that assumption.
"You are not going to see a resurgence in private borrowing," he said. "That will make it hard to get a rise in inflation."
 
Real Estate and Money Supply
 In large part, Mr. Clough's view is based on the probability that real estate lending, which represented nearly two-thirds of all the credit produced in the 1980's, will not recover.
In addition, Mr. Clough puts much stock in movements in M-3, the Fed's broadest monetary aggregate, which measures total bank deposits.
"Those deposits are the major engine of credit, and as a consequence M-3 is the best early-warning indicator that borrowing and spending are picking up," he said. "M-3 grew at double-digit rates in the 1970's. Now, for the first time in history, M-3 growth on a year-over-year basis is negative."
Going forward, Mr. Clough said, "M-3 won't grow much, private credit demand won't come back and inflation won't become systemic."
The bad news, Mr. Clough added, is that it may take an entire business cycle to convince bond investors that the credit cycle, which pushed inflation-adjusted interest rates to their highest levels ever in the 1980's and early 1990's, is finally over.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Has Gulled Us for 70 Years

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In arguing against oversight of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (editorial, May 27), you laud the Port Authority as "the region's economic engine." But that engine has dragged our economy down an unforeseen and mistaken track.
Many forget that the Port Authority, as its name implies, was founded 70 years ago to improve New York's chief asset: the world's second-greatest natural deep-water port, after Hong Kong. The Port Authority was sold to the public as the vehicle for a much-needed railroad tunnel from New Jersey to the Brooklyn docks. 
 The tunnel was never built. Without the oversight such quasi-public institutions are expressly designed to avoid, the Port Authority built highways, airports and office complexes. New York's docks decayed, railroads went broke, manufacturing fled the city, and unemployment soared.
The public, not bondholders, investment bankers and real estate developers, should call the shots at the Port Authority. Increased oversight, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo recommends, is the least that is needed. Better would be the dissolution of an institution that has so betrayed its original purpose.

HEADLINE: Kodak Dealt a Setback In Antitrust Case Ruling

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that the Eastman Kodak Company must stand trial in an antitrust suit that has important implications for the ability of manufacturers to control the markets for the parts and servicing of the products they make.
By a vote of 6 to 3, the Court rejected Kodak's argument that it was legally entitled to dismissal of the suit, brought in 1987 by 18 companies that sell replacement parts and service for Kodak's line of sophisticated business machines. 
 These companies, known as independent service organizations, contend that Kodak was trying to force them out of business by restricting their access to replacement parts and by trying to insure that customers for its business machines either service the machines themselves or buy service directly from Kodak.
 
Two Accusations
 The service companies' lawsuit accused Kodak of two violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act: unlawfully tying the sale of service for Kodak machines to the sale of parts, and unlawfully trying to monopolize the market for service.
The Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled for Kodak, dismissing the suit by granting the motion for summary judgment. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned that decision, reinstating the suit in a 1990 ruling that the Supreme Court affirmed today. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion.
While the ruling today was not the final word in the case -- Kodak might still prevail before a jury -- it was significant regarding important points of antitrust law and for rejecting several of Kodak's defenses.
If the Court had accepted Kodak's legal theory, which the Bush Administration essentially supported, manufacturers in Kodak's position would have been effectively immunized from antitrust liability for driving competitors out of the markets for replacement parts and service.
 
Market Domination at Issue
 Kodak controls nearly the entire market for its replacement parts -- which are not interchangeable with the parts for other manufacturers' business machines -- and between 80 and 95 percent of the service market. But it has only about a 20 percent share of the overall market for the machines at issue in the case: high-volume copiers and equipment used for microfilm and microfiche. There is lively competition in that market, with Kodak standing behind the International Business Machines Corporation and the Xerox Corporation.
Kodak contended that it could not be found to be exercising monopoly power in the parts and service markets in the absence of market power in sales of the basic equipment. It asked the Court to adopt a rule that a parts and service business cannot be considered a monopoly as long as there is competition in the sales and manufacture of the machines.
In his opinion today, Justice Blackmun met Kodak on its chosen battlefield of economic theory and found its analysis lacking. "Presumably, the theory's corollary is to the effect that low service prices lead to a dramatic increase in equipment sales," he said. Yet, Justice Blackmun continued, the record indicated that rather than try to lower prices for service, Kodak has in fact raised service prices by driving out the independent companies, and "there is no evidence or assertion that Kodak equipment sales have dropped" as a result.
 
Examining Market Behavior
 "In sum, Kodak's theory does not explain the actual market behavior revealed in the record," Justice Blackmun said. He noted that despite the competition in the equipment market, owners of these expensive machines could neither readily switch companies as a practical matter, nor easily obtain information for comparative purposes about the actual lifetime cost of maintaining them.
Kodak also asked the Court to rule that the market for a single brand of a product or service -- such as its own replacement parts -- can never be a "market" for assessing monopoly behavior under the Sherman Act.
"We disagree," Justice Blackmun said, adding that "the relevant market for antitrust purposes is determined by the choices available to Kodak equipment owners," who must use Kodak parts.
The decision, Kodak v. Image Technical Services, No. 90-1029, was somewhat surprising because the Court in recent years has given manufacturers more freedom under the antitrust laws to control their distribution and service operations. The Court has also appeared to indicate that antitrust suits should be carefully scrutinized by trial courts and be more readily dismissed at the summary judgment stage.
Justice Blackmun's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. They said it "makes no economic sense" to define market power as power over a single brand, adding that the decision "threatens to release a torrent of litigation and a flood of commercial intimidation that will do much more harm than good."
This case was watched closely in the computer industry and in other high-technology industries, where independent service companies have found a profitable niche.

HEADLINE: Official Urges Bankers to Lend

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson told bankers today to stop blaming regulators for the so-called "credit crunch" and to "come out of their caves" and start lending money to spur economic growth.
Mr. Robson told a meeting of the American Bankers Association here that for more than a year, the Bush Administration had been vigilant in striking down regulatory impediments to lending. 
 "Frankly, it's time for the banks to step up to the plate," Mr. Robson said, in his strongest plea in months for increased lending. James Chesson, the bankers association's chief economist, said that bankers were ready to make good loans once the recovery took hold but that they still faced a huge regulatory burden.
He cited preliminary results from an association survey that showed a regulation explosion since 1989 had added at least $1 billion in new costs to bank operations and eaten up at least 20 percent of bank profits. The figure partly represents costs of employing staff to fill out reporting forms, compliance memos and disclosure statements to meet regulations, he said.
Mr. Robson offered support for a bill proposed by the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, that would cut back regulations for small banks.
Mr. Robson said the Administration had already changed 35 bank examination policies, held more than 200 meetings with bankers, borrowers and regulators and imposed a moratorium on neededless regulation.
Mr. Robson, second in command at the Treasury after Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, also reiterated the Bush Administration's call for the Federal Reserve to expand the money supply.

HEADLINE: With Park and Path, New York Tries to Link Asphalt to Water

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
After 50 years of bickering and frustration over the condition of New York's seedy waterfront, a new conservation drive has taken its first halting steps toward reclaiming the city's enormous, watery edge.
Fueled by an unlikely combination of pragmatic environmentalists, developers beleaguered by recession and politicians who have seized upon the public clamor for use of New York's 578 miles of waterfront, the drive may soon provide every borough with at least some new access to the city's varied shores. 
 To the surprise of supporters who have sought such improvements for years, dozens of new esplanades, parks and walkways have been proposed recently, stretching from the tidal estuaries of Staten Island to the rocky promontories of the Bronx.
"This is always going to be a tough issue," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "And there will always be the tension between those who want to build on the water and those who want to preserve it. But finally, it seems, people are starting to understand you can -- and must -- do both."
Some of the most ambitious improvements, like the expensive renovations city planners envision for existing parks in Coney Island or Jamaica Bay, will clearly have to wait until the city treasury and private developers see better days. But others are already evident.
At Grand Street in Brooklyn, the nonprofit Parks Council turned a factory lot into public space along two acres that provide some of the city's most alluring views. Now, with the Pfizer Company, which shares the waterfront space, they are discussing building a more formal walkway.
 
Planning Department Initiative
 At Hunters Point in Queens, the borough's largest planned residential development will include an enormous public esplanade along the East River, similar to one on the Hudson at Battery Park. And although the City Department of General Services has proposed placing a $30 million parking garage along Piers 35 and 36 on the Lower East Side, the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, and many community organizations have begun to lobby furiously for public space on the water there to create a continuous path from South Street Seaport to East River Park at Houston Street.
Perhaps most important, for the first time since New York enacted its initial zoning law in 1916, the City Planning Department will release a comprehensive waterfront initiative this summer that will require all new development along the water to include public access to open space. That document, which has been anticipated for years, has already begun to knit together dozens of unconnected groups, public and private, into a cohesive and unified movement.
This is, of course, far from the first time that parks advocates and city planners have argued that New Yorkers need a cohesive belt of greenery around their teeming metropolis -- and for every area of agreement there are at least two skirmishes yet to be fought. Skeptics say the grand proposals, including the Planning Department's initiative, are certain to remain enviable visions, stillborn like their predecessors.
But many others insist that this time they actually will prevail. They say that New York finally seems on the verge of creating the type of recreational and commercial amenities on its waterways that have become successful hallmarks of other major cities -- from Baltimore, Boston and Toronto to Seattle and San Francisco.
Although the shoreline of Manhattan is the most contested, valuable and noticeable in the city, parks and esplanades are planned for every other borough as well -- from the decrepit piers beneath the Brooklyn Bridge to the shore line of Queens, where city officials have approved a plan for greater pedestrian access along the edge of Flushing Bay.
In the Bronx, city planners have proposed enhanced waterfront access to two major parks, Ferry Point and Pelham Bay. And as part of a new effort to increase access to the riverfront in Manhattan, the only part of the city without a beach, Ms. Messinger has proposed transforming a salt storage center on the East River north of 125th Street into a "Harlem Beach Esplanade," which she hopes would be similar to well-used portions of Chicago's shore.
 
Listening to People
 "This is not something I would necessarily have predicted, though God knows I've begged for it," Tom Fox, executive director of the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition, a parks advocacy organization, said of the emerging movement. "Developers have become more reasonable, environmentalists are less inclined to fight about everything -- and we are all actually listening to what people want. And they really want greenways near the water."
Mr. Fox is expected to be named as director of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a group that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins agreed last month to establish to revive the neglected shoreline along the West Side of Manhattan from Battery Park to 59th Street.
By agreeing to include the park in a broad development plan, and to guarantee that a green, 40-acre buffer will sweep up the West Side, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins made the most visible gesture yet in the resurgent attempt to protect the waterfront from unabated development. But it was not the only one. Earlier in the same week, Donald J. Trump's plan to build a new neighborhood on the Upper West Side inched forward, largely because he has agreed to compromise with parks advocates and permit a 22-acre riverfront park to border the Hudson.
Neither plan is near final approval, and perhaps neither will ever succeed. But compromise -- a word rarely heard in connection with New York's disputed waterfront -- has begun to guide planners and developers, both agree. In part, that is because the recession has dulled all but the strongest appetites for building.
 
Balancing Needs
 "We have to start from the premise that nearly 600 miles of waterfront is big enough to accommodate all the uses this city needs," said Wilbur Woods, director of the Planning Department's division of waterfront and open space. "There are some places in this city that are natural and should be completely protected. There are others where industry exists and should be encouraged. What we have tried to do is identify which is which and figure out a way to help the process."
Even the optimists know it will not be easy, because in New York one neighborhood's great chance to incorporate the water into residents' lives is almost always somebody else's chance to build a dream apartment complex, or a badly needed sewage plant or a bridge to ease congestion.
Perhaps the most obvious illustration of the tension between waterfront preservation and eagerly sought development can be viewed in Brooklyn, along the historic walkways of Brighton Beach.
A large development, Brighton by the Sea, which would replace the Brighton Baths along the oceanfront with 1,600 residential apartments in five high-rise towers, was endorsed in April by the local Community Board. The neighborhood, filled with Russian immigrants struggling economically, is badly in need of the jobs that such a large development would provide.
But the project has yet to win approval from the City Planning Department, whose board will vote next month, and increasingly vocal opponents say the scale and density of the development will forever cut access to the ocean and views of the sea. The Parks Council and the Municipal Arts Society have proposed an alternative development that would place taller buildings and retail stores on Brighton Beach Avenue and low-rise buildings next to a new community park alongside the public boardwalk.
 
Discussion With Developers
 "This will cut off access to an important beachfront in one of our most populous boroughs," said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council. "It is as out of context with the neighborhood as it could be."
The developers have in the past dismissed such criticism, asserting that they have won approval from the Community Board and that the loudest complaints are often heard from people who live or work in Manhattan, not Brighton Beach. But this week, they agreed to enter discussions about the alternative plan.
The dispute -- development versus preservation -- is not likely to disappear soon, however, particularly if the real-estate slump begins to ease. Other plans, too, clash with the vision of a recreational greenway ringing the city. In the Bronx, for example, Borough President Fernando Ferrer says waterfront access is something to strive for -- but not before the city begins first to reclaim devastated stretches of the South Bronx.
"We want vital waterways," said Bernd Zimmermann, the borough's director of planning and development. "But when it comes to a choice -- and with funds low, choices are always difficult -- we want our priorities to be clear. And unfortunately, the absence of esplanades is not our biggest problem."
Financing greenways will certainly remain difficult, but as a report by Ms. Messinger on the Manhattan waterfront pointed out earlier this year, some significant improvements can be made for the cost of moving a chain-link fence, or paving a dirt road. Others, such as ambitious plans for an amphitheater along the Hudson, will have to wait until money is more readily available.
Increasingly, parks advocates are learning to barter with the city for their desperately sought patches of green. The troubled sewage plant on the Hudson River in Harlem was built only after the state agreed to build a $30 million park on top of the plant. City officials will rarely admit it, but they no longer expect to build such plants, incinerators or sanitation depots without delivering similar amenities to the community.
"We have to be rational here," said Albert Appleton, Commissioner of the City Department of Environmental Protection. "You can't go and spend billions on making marginal improvements in the quality of our water and then say we have no money to help the public enjoy it. Nobody is going to buy that anymore. And they shouldn't."

HEADLINE: G.M. Cost Cutter Sharpens His Ax

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZURICH

 BODY:
A revolution in the way cars are made that started in a small, nondescript office building in a suburb of this Swiss city is sweeping the General Motors Corporation. Its code word, coined by a Spaniard, is "Picos."
Repeated like a shibboleth by executives at G.M.'s modest European headquarters, Picos is short for "program for improvement and cost optimization of suppliers." In essence, the term covers the mix of ruthless probing, consultation, orders and ultimatums that J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua used to slash the cost of parts for G.M. Europe, making it hugely profitable while its Detroit-based parent piled up losses. 
 Now, Mr. Lopez, an indefatigable 51-year-old engineer sometimes referred to as the "grand inquisitor" in European automotive circles, is attempting to do for G.M. in the United States what he already achieved in Europe as the executive in charge of purchasing. That is, G.M.'s new management would like to see G.M. Europe's performance, in piling up $8.54 billion in profits since 1987, repeated at home.
"He ran the European parts operation the way they now want the whole North American operation organized," said John F. Smith, vice president for planning of G.M. Europe, who is not related to John F. Smith Jr., the G.M. president. "That's why he's over there. That's his mission. And I tell you he's driven."
Named vice president for worldwide purchasing in Detroit in April, Mr. Lopez, who is 51 years old, gave a taste of his medicine on June 2 when he told a startled group of executives from G.M.'s suppliers that contracts would be reopened for bidding, that prices would be renegotiated, that G.M. would no longer favor its internal manufacturers, which supply 70 percent of components in G.M. vehicles, and that 50 percent improvements in productivity were expected by 1995.
"We were told the slate is clean," said John Kennedy, the president of Autocam, a supplier in Grand Rapids, Mich.
In other words, Mr. Lopez has made clear his determination to change G.M.'s culture. Where the corporation concentrated on hugely expensive automation in the 1980's, Mr. Lopez believes all the gadgetery is useless unless people are motivated to lower costs.
Mr. Lopez's goal is ambitious. Although G.M. Europe is no midget -- it had 1991 sales of $25.36 billion -- the unit is dwarfed by its parent. It has just four basic model lines, or "platforms," compared with the more than 65 offerings of G.M. North America.
"Doing things is much easier here than in Detroit, because we're relatively autonomous and lean," said Paul W. Schmidt, chief financial officer for G.M. Europe.
Many analysts believe the reorganization Mr. Lopez is attempting is overdue. "G.M. in Detroit has long sourced too many components in-house, and unlike G.M. Europe has had its policy completely wrong on this," said Robert Barber, senior auto analyst at James Capel in London. "That's a major reason why the company has not been competitive, and I think it's a reflection of bad management and arrogance."
Despite its profits in Europe, G.M. lost $2 billion in 1990 and a record $4.5 billion in 1991.
Mr. Lopez declined to be interviewed. But a look at what he did in Europe after taking over purchasing in 1987 suggests that a brutal shake-up looms for the companies that provide G.M. with about $50 billion worth of parts and components.
Preaching his pet maxim that "productivity improvements of just 10 percent are nothing," Mr. Lopez relentlessly switched G.M. Europe's purchases of parts to manufacturers in cheaper areas. He also became personally involved in reorganizing the way parts-makers operate.
Mr. Smith, the European vice president, said that in 1986, a year in which G.M. Europe's losses totaled $340 million, bringing its accumulated losses since 1979 to more than $2 billion, the unit acquired about 70 percent of its components in Germany. This was considered acceptable because Germany is by far the largest market for Opel, the leading brand name for G.M.'s European cars.
But by this year, under Mr. Lopez's direction, Germany's share in the supply of components had plunged to 40 percent. "We've moved to Southern European suppliers such as Spain, or even Turkey, where we now get our seat covers," Mr. Smith said.
Not content with changing suppliers, Mr. Lopez instituted "Picos workshops" -- no-holds-barred brainstorming sessions during which a manufacturer's methods may be completely reorganized to achieve price and quality targets that had hitherto seemed impossible.
For example, in February, a group of G.M. Europe specialists headed by Mr. Lopez descended on Johnson Controls Automotive Systems, a seat supplier based in Geel, Belgium. During a four-day session, design and processing changes were plotted that should, according to G.M. Europe, cut the cost of a seat by up to 20 percent.
Last year, Mr. Lopez told a German magazine, Manager, that productivity improvements at companies subjected to his blitzkrieg had increased as much as 79 percent, and had averaged 42 percent. Production space had been reduced by an average of 31 percent, and lead times by 99 percent. At Siemens, for example, the Lopez team improved productivity on an air-conditioner assembly line by 46 percent and reduced lead times by 85 percent.
 Some analysts see parallels between Mr. Lopez's approach and the Japanese methods popularized by Toyota, in which similar brainstorming between manufacturers and suppliers take place.
Under this Japanese method, rather than having a model price set by the cost of components plus profits, component prices are set as a function of a target price for a new model.
But Hanspeter Ryser, a spokesman for G.M. Europe, said that Mr. Lopez did not accept that his methods had been copied from Japan or were in any way coercive. "His message to manufacturers is, 'Look, you can do better, and we can help you get there.' "
Mr. Smith said Mr. Lopez managed to get manufacturers on his side by offering lifetime contracts -- a lifetime being that of a particular model -- to those prepared to meet his standards. He also instituted an annual prize-giving session for suppliers with outstanding performances.
 
 
Resistance Is Likely
 It is by no means clear whether Mr. Lopez will be similarly successful in winning over manufacturers in the United States. He is likely to face resistance from G.M.'s in-house parts producers and from labor unions if he abruptly switches suppliers and revolutionizes work methods.
But the bait he used in Europe seems to be on the Lopez menu in the United States. Suppliers say he has talked of lifetime contracts and offering new opportunities to become suppliers to both G.M. North America and G.M. Europe. Up to now, suppliers to the two units had been kept distinct.
That dividing line is now falling away as G.M. Europe becomes the model for remaking G.M. North America. Where it was once argued that conditions in Europe were too different to offer any lessons, that view has been summarily dumped.
"It was always nonsense," said Mr. Barber of James Capel. "I used to hear that the U.S. was more competitive than Europe, but Opel has done best in Germany, and there is no more competitive market than that in the world."
The company's president, John F. Smith Jr., led G.M. Europe when it turned around decisively between 1986 and 1988, and worked closely with Mr. Lopez. Mr. Smith appeared at Mr. Lopez's side during recent sessions with suppliers to reinforce the Spanish executive's message.
 
 
Leaner Headquarters
 "I'd say a lot of what we do has applications in the United States, and Mr. Smith is going to try to implement those things," said Mr. Schmidt, the G.M. Europe financial officer. "We're going to see some leaning up of North American platforms, moving toward the European concept of a very vertical product line. They're going to concentrate platforms to get economy of scale and avoid confusions."
Mr. Schmidt added that he believed a much leaner head office would emerge in Detroit. The G.M. Europe headquarters has a staff of just 170 people.
Moreover, officers of G.M. Europe think the decision-making process in Detroit is going to be drastically streamlined. "What is going to pay dividends there is getting everyone in one room and getting things done," said Mr. Smith, the G.M. Europe planning officer. "So many people had to get involved in Detroit. It was much more difficult to move."
Mr. Lopez's task is to bring movement. He has a huge ship to turn. But, Mr. Smith said, "he's the very best that G.M. has, and he's uniquely, obsessively focused."

Chart: "G.M.'s New Parts Strategy"
 Highlights of General Motors' new approach to global purchasing of components, based on an address to G.M. suppliers on June 2 by H. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
 
Cost Reduction
 In 1991, G.M. started a program to save $2 billion over three years, but now thinks it can do better and is accelerating the effort. G.M. will help suppliers identify areas of waste so they can lower costs.
 
Hard-Nosed Purchasing
 Longstanding relationships between G.M. and suppliers are to be replaced by decisions based on tougher criteria like quality, price and service. Internal G.M. parts subsidiaries, which now supply 70 percent of G.M. components, will have to compete with outside suppliers on this basis.
 
Global Sourcing
 G.M.'s goal is to establish international coordination in purchasing. U.S. supliers will get opportunities to sell parts to overseas G.M. operations, but will face competition form foreign suppliers selling to G.M. in North America.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Cooper Industries Is Looking for a New Conquest

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Cooper Industries rose into America's manufacturing elite over the last 30 years by buying businesses like Champion Spark Plug, McGraw-Edison and Crouse-Hinds and sharpening their operations.
The list includes more than 60 companies and product lines, which raised Cooper's revenues to $6.2 billion from $62 million. 
 The Cooper pattern has been to squeeze costs, spend freely on more efficient production equipment, then wait patiently for growing market share and profits that help bankroll new conquests. Family-controlled companies with solid industrial brands but groggy leadership are the main quarry.
 
Major Acquisition in the Offing
 Now, after two years of record earnings, pruning costs at Champion and at Cameron Iron Works since both companies were acquired in 1989 and huge savings from a reduced debt load, Cooper has the financial muscle for a bid approaching $1 billion, analysts say. Robert Cizik, Cooper's chief executive, says he hopes to sign a "substantial" deal by autumn. The only hint he has given is that his shopping list might include a hand tool maker or an auto parts manufacturer.
A sudden sharp drop in Cooper's stock price at the end of April drained away some buying power, but Mr. Cizik is undaunted and remains in the hunt for another company. The decline, in which the stock fell nearly 20 percent in more than two weeks, came after Mr. Cizik forecast a drop in profits in its biggest business segement, petroleum products.
Investors apparently concluded that the company's earnings growth -- 35 consecutive quarters of rising profits -- might end in the second quarter, a prospect Mr. Cisik concedes.
With market leaders like Lufkin measuring tapes, Crescent wrenches and Wagner headlights under its tent, Cooper has managed to withstand the battering its energy products suffered during the 1980's thanks to its savvy acquisitions.
Andrew Campbell, director of the Ashridge Strategic Management Center, a management research and education school in London, said Cooper deftly limited acquisitions to basic manufacturers with established products, distribution channels and plant operations similar to what Cooper already knows.
A team of manufacturing experts that Mr. Cizik assembled nearly 20 years ago at Cooper combs through newly added companies for grist to combine operations with ones Cooper already has and close plants, trim labor costs and install modern equipment to improve productivity.
The formula has rarely faltered, said Mr. Campbell, who has studied dozens of global corporations that stumbled when acquisitions took them into unfamiliar products and markets. The Cooper playbook also includes auctioning off laggards; Mr. Cizik has sold 40 companies and product lines.
"In the last 10 years, manufacturing know-how has changed very dramatically, led by the Japanese," Mr. Campbell said. "A company that knows a lot about a certain manufacturing process has had an opportunity to buy those left behind and sort them out."
Mr. Cizik, who sees a resurgence among basic manufacturers in America, has had a hand in every Cooper deal since joining the company in 1961. The Pennsylvania coal miner's son, who is 61 years old, ranked in the top 2 percent of his 1958 graduating class at Harvard Business School and was a takeover specialist of a relatively rare breed in the 1980's. He never filled a war chest for a surprise raid on another company.
Cooper was either a friendly acquirer of companies under siege from hostile suitors or high bidder for companies on the auction block. In its biggest deal, Cooper bought McGraw-Edison Inc., a maker of electrical power distribution equipment, for $1.1 billion in 1985.
Four years later it borrowed heavily and issued preferred stock to raise $1.5 billion to acquire Champion Spark Plug and Cameron Iron Works, a Houston-based rival in drilling equipment.
 
Courting Owners of Prospects
 Paul Mecray, a partner at the Wellington Management Company, an investment concern in suburban Philadelphia, who has followed Cooper since the 1960's, said Cooper often courted aging family members who owned companies that were ripe for consolidation.
"They have a file thicker than you realize on prospective acquisitions," Mr. Mecray said. "Cizik knows all these old families, and he's done his missionary work ahead of time."
Some consultants and scholars consider Cooper a classic model of a diverse and capably managed American manufacturer that zealously improved productivity during the 1980's and has shaped up to compete for and win its share of global battles.
From 1979 to 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturers in the United States improved their output for every hour of labor by an average of 3.1 percent, compared with a sluggish 1.4 percent increase from 1973 to 1979 and 2.9 percent from 1948 to 1973.
And the dollar value of manufacturing exports, which accounted for 4 percent of the nation's gross output last year, has increased by an average of 11 percent a year since 1988, a surge aided by a 1987 decline in the dollar's value that made American goods cheaper to buy in other countries. Cooper itself has had five years of rising foreign sales, which accounted for 34.9 percent of its total revenue last year. Seventy of its 180 plants are outside the United States.
Through the 1950's the company, known then as the Cooper-Bessemer Corporation, was mainly a maker of compressors for moving natural gas through pipelines. Founded in 1833, it is still close to the oil patch. Petroleum-related products contributed 33 percent of sales and 35 percent of operating income last year as drilling accelerated abroad.
 
Four Nonpetroleum Divisions
 It has four other industrial divisions, which Mr. Cizik wants to expand, turning out products like fuses, voltage regulators and spark plugs. The units are divided among suppliers of electrical products, electrical power equipment, hand tools and hardware, and automotive products.
Although profits in petroleum markets are heading lower, they should rise in Cooper's four other segments and give the company another year of record earnings, Mr. Cizik said. Last year, when energy-related profits prospered, earnings in the nonpetroleum segments were down.
It was a downturn in compressor orders in the late 1950's that persuaded Mr. Cizik's predecessor at Cooper, Gene Miller, to seek acquisitions. He wanted to buffer yearly earnings against the fluctuations of the petroleum markets while remaining in basic manufacturing businesses.
Mr. Cizik has held the same view. Even before drilling activity plunged in 1982, and oil prices collapsed in 1986, he took Cooper into other fields to cushion the company's profits against an oil-patch downturn.
He sees Cooper as similar to General Electric in the United States, and Germany's Siemens, Japan's Mitsubishi and Britain's Hanson Industries. Those companies have proved resilient to recession because of their financial strength, varied products and global operations, he said. They also have "the resources to subsidize business during economic downturns so they can be thriving and healthy when the cycle turns up," he added.
 
Increasing Capital Spending
 Cooper's first-quarter profits rose 10 percent, to $71 million, or 51 cents a share, from $64.7 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues were flat at $1.5 billion.
Mr. Cizik said he increased capital spending to $300 million this year from $266 million a year ago, to further sharpen Cooper's productivity. He probably could extend the record of 35 quarters of rising profits by shaving millions from the capital budget this quarter, but he says that might hurt quality improvements now and profits in the future.
"If you nick away muscle for that reason, then you are nicking it for the wrong reason," he said. "Where we fail in most cases to be successful at Cooper is where our quality isn't up to snuff in some cases." Last year, Mr. Cizik and his wife, Jane, shared equally with Cooper a $2.5 million gift to endow a professorship in manufacturing quality at Harvard.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Long-Distance Recycling;
Earth Summit Petitions Are Being Put to a Test

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
By the thousands, Americans are signing up to preserve the environment by pledging "to make the earth a secure and hospitable place for present and future generations." The pledges are to be presented to Maurice Strong, the secretary general of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro today.
The problem is, the pledges are on paper. Lots of different kinds of paper. Fax paper, magazine paper, color copier paper, all of which is hard to process in conventional recycling processes. 
 But this is the Earth Summit, with 160 nations gathered to work out agreements to ease the burdens on the planet. It would not do to just truck the crates of pledges to a landfill, adding to the trash disposal problem and conspicuously consuming scarce resources.
So, as a means of demonstrating the recycling capabilities of a French subsidiary, the Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham, Mass., will collect the discarded pledges, fly them across the Atlantic and ship them to a plant about 100 miles east of Paris for recycling.
The subsidiary, E.& M. Lamort S.A., has a multistage process that Thermo Electron executives say can remove ink and other coatings from fax and color photocopy papers. The end product is a high-quality pulp that can be made into paper.
Although Thermo Electron executives are not saying that it makes economic sense to ship wastepaper by air across oceans for recycling, they do say that it is important to demonstrate that it is technically feasible to treat grades of paper now kept out of recycling programs.
"Emerging technologies allow us to re-use an increasing portion of our valuable resources," said George N. Hatsopoulos, chairman of Thermo Electron. "In doing so, we can help assure development without destroying the environment."

Grand Metropolitan Makes Shifts at 2 Units

 BODY:
Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the British food, drink and retailing group with large American holdings, yesterday announced management changes at the top of two divisions.
George Bull, 55 years old, currently chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners, the company's drinks unit, becomes chairman and chief executive of the food operations, which includes Pillsbury and Green Giant. 
 Mr. Bull takes over the posts in the food group from Ian Martin, 57, managing director and chief operating officer of Grand Met, who will become chairman of International Distillers and devote more time to the overall activities of the company.
 
Burgers and Eyeglasses
 Mr. Martin will remain responsible for the international retailing operations, which include the Burger King restaurant chain and the Pearle Vision Centers, which sell eyeglasses and contact lenses in the United States.
John McGrath, 53, currently managing director and chief operating officer of International Distillers, becomes its chief executive and a director of Grand Metropolitan.
Both Mr. Bull and Mr. McGrath will report to Mr. Martin, who remains responsible to Sir Allen Sheppard, 59, chairman and group chief executive of Grand Met.
Mr. Bull is known for having a strong marketing background and for building brand recognition. He became International Distillers' chief executive in 1984 and has been a director of Grand Met since 1985.
International Distillers is the world's biggest seller of wines and liquors. Its brands include Smirnoff vodka, J & B Scotch and Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur. Under Mr. Bull, the unit's operating profit has shown compound growth of 25 percent over the last five years.
Mr. McGrath joined Grand Met in 1985, becoming joint managing director of International Distillers in 1988 and subsequently managing director and chief operating officer.
 
Acquiring a Winery
 Grand Met bought its way into the American brandy market and added to its wine interests with the acquisition of the Christian Brothers winery in California in 1989.
Grand Met's food sector includes Pillsbury, the market leader in prepared dough in North America; Green Giant, the world's largest vegetable processor, and Haagen-Dazs, the ice cream maker.
Grand Met announced last month that six-month profits grew 6.9 percent, defying the British recession. Sir Allen said he expects 1992 to be "another record year for the group."
But he added a warning: "Trading conditions in our major markets continue to be testing. In the U.S., the recession has ended and the recovery is under way. In Britain, we consider the recession has ended, but the net outcome is patchy and the position is not yet clear."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower in Quiet Day And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower yesterday in extremely quiet trading.
Dealers said activity was subdued because many European traders were absent. Except for London, the leading European markets were closed for a religious holiday. The dollar held to tight ranges in domestic trading. Its advance against the Japanese yen was a consequence of more active cross-trading in the yen and German mark, analysts said. 
 With no new information to move the market, traders again reflected on Danish voters' rejection last week of the Maastricht treaty for European economic and political union.
Weaker European currencies are expected to decline now that European union has been thrown into question. Indeed, the Federal Reserve, at the request of the Bank of Italy, sold German marks and bought lire to support the sagging Italian currency, Mike Faust, an anlayst with MMS International, said.
"We saw a carryover from last week, where the mark tended to benefit" on news of the Danish vote because Germany's economic strength is generally considered to be secure, he said.
Trading was particularly quiet. "There's just not that much for North America to focus on," Mr. Faust said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.20 yen, down 0.35 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.13 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.15 yen, up from 126.65 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8345, from $1.8350 late on Friday. In York it cost $1.8350 to buy a pound, more than $1.8335 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.5875 German marks, down from 1.5900; 1.4490 Swiss francs, down from 1.4525; 5.3495 French francs, down from 5.3550; 1,201.50 Italian lire, down from 1,203.00, and 1.1942 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1923.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.5895 German marks, up from 1.5890; 1.4518 Swiss francs, up from 1.4500; 5.3560 French francs, up from 5.3555; 1.7900 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7905; 1,202.50 Italian lire, up from 1,201.75, and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1939.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold prices were mixed. Gold bullion for current delivery settled at $338.20 an ounce, off 50 cents. The Republic National Bank in New York said gold slipped 70 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $337.90.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $338.75 an ounce, from $338.65 late on Friday. In Zurich, markets were closed for the holiday. In Hong Kong, where markets were closed Friday for a national holiday, gold rose 22 cents an ounce from Thursday's close to end the day at a $338.91.
Silver prices were lower. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.041 an ounce, down from $4.051 on Friday. In London the metal slipped to a late bid price of $4.05 from $4.06.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Trying to Curb Price of Drugs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
THE pharmaceutical industry is under growing Congressional pressure to slow the rise of prescription drug prices. Even though executives of several large drug companies have pledged to restrain their increases voluntarily, drug prices are still increasing at almost triple the general inflation rate.
Prescription drug prices rose 9.4 percent in the 12 months ended in April, the Labor Department said in its latest report, while the Consumer Price Index increase was only 3.2 percent. 
 Senator David H. Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Aging, hopes to get a vote later this year on his proposal to deny tax credits to drug makers that raise prices faster than general inflation. And Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are working on a measure that would establish national controls on price increases for drugs as well as hospital and physician charges.
Under one version of the House bill, Federal officials would set maximum rates of payment for a select list of federally approved drugs called a formulary. But Congressional aides say the plan's advocates still do not have enough support for committee approval. The committee Democrats plan to meet to consider the issue again tomorrow.
Public concern about drug prices is growing, especially among elderly people who are covered by Federal Medicare, which does not pay for prescriptions outside of hospitals. In a recent survey of 2,000 people by Louis Harris & Associates for the Kaiser Family Foundation, 73 percent said the Government should set the prices for prescription drugs, 25 percent disagreed and 2 percent had no opinion. The margin of error was plus or minus 2 points.
Mr. Pryor's proposal, which is co-sponsored by Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, is linked to tax credits for profits on products made in Puerto Rico. The credits enabled 26 drug companies to slice at least $8.5 billion from their Federal and local taxes in the 1980's, said a study issued last month by the General Accounting Office.
The G.A.O. study said the industry's profits on 17 of the 21 most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States in 1990 were sheltered by the Puerto Rican credits. Because the fruits of the drug makers' heavy investment in research and development are intangible, it is easy to transfer these assets to the territory, industry accountants said.
Unless Congress changes the tax laws, the drug makers may get $7.5 billion more in Puerto Rican tax credits over the next five years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates $15 billion in Puerto Rican credits for all industries, and the G.A.O. said that the drug companies had been getting about half the credits. But their share could change if other industries in Puerto Rico, like computers and instruments, grow faster than pharmaceuticals.
The Puerto Rican tax credit is also vulnerable to attack by members of Congress who see it as a chance to recoup money for the Treasury. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and Willis D. Gradison, Republican of Ohio, recently introduced a bill that would liberalize certain foreign tax credits. To help pay for the cost to the Treasury, their bill would cut the Puerto Rican tax credit by 15 percent. Mr. Rostenkowski plans to hold hearings on the bill next month.
A spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget said it was too early to take a position on either the Pryor or Rostenkowski measures. The Treasury tried unsuccessfully to cut the Puerto Rican tax credit as a revenue-raising measure during the Reagan Administration.
Lobbyists for the drug makers and other companies that have invested in Puerto Rico say the credit has generated 115,000 jobs on the island plus 200,000 more by suppliers and service businesses. The G.A.O. report said the drug makers received $70,788 in tax credits per employee in Puerto Rico in 1987, or $2.67 for every dollar they paid in wages. But industry spokesmen said the analysis omitted the nonpharmaceutical jobs that were indirectly generated, which they contend would have reduced the subsidy per job to less than $15,000.
Peter Holmes, a Washington spokesman for the Puerto Rico USA Foundation, an industry group, said that ending the tax credit would drive more American companies to flee to foreign countries, reducing the hoped-for savings for the Treasury.
Both the Bush Administration and a number of influential Senate Democrats opposed Senator Pryor's proposal when it was rejected as an amendment to the Democratic tax bill, which the President vetoed in March. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, objected to singling out the pharmaceutical industry and using the tax code to control prices. But Mr. Pryor's aides said he would probably try again in the fall by attaching his measure as an amendment to a health-cost containment bill.

HEADLINE: Japanese Troop Bill Clears Parliamentary Hurdle

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, June 9

 BODY:
After a bitter marathon of debate and delaying tactics, the upper house of Japan's Parliament passed a bill early today that would allow Japanese troops to venture overseas for the first time since World War II and participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
But the bill was so watered down by compromises, and the debate so aroused pacifist passions among some Japanese, that many fear it may turn out to be a mere symbol of Japan's continuing ambivalence about taking a more active role in the post-cold-war world. 
 Sohei Miyashita, Director General of the Defense Agency, has already said he plans to send troops to the peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. Japanese leaders have made it clear they see their efforts to help restore peace to Cambodia as a major new step for Japanese foreign policy. But the recent debate also made it clear that such measures could be a long way off.
The battle over the bill has been so divisive that it may have done more harm than good to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the govering Liberal Democratic Party, some commentators have argued. An election for the upper house is scheduled for July, and there are signs that it is shaping up as a referendum on the public's attitude toward sending troops abroad.
The bill must still pass the more powerful lower house, and more delaying tactics are expected from the Socialists and Communists. But with the Liberal Democrats holding a majority in the lower house, final passage seems likely within the next several weeks.
The upper house vote was considered more important because the Liberal Democrats, who do not hold a majority there, had to win the support of two centrist political parties to get the bill passed. The final tally was 137 to 102.
Still, the process provided a rare spectacle of the legislative body nearly paralyzed. The final vote, which concluded at 2 A.M., followed four days and three nights of filibustering by the Socialists and Communists, whoinsist that permitting Japanese troops to operate abroad violates the Constitution, written largely by American Occupation forces. It forbids the use of military power for resolving international disputes.
Opponents argued that the bill redefined the Constitution, and thus required more extensive debate. The Liberal Democrats refused.
The Government has been at pains to pass the bill since the war in the Persian Gulf, and had already abandoned the first attempt because of fierce resistance. Japan was embarrassed over international criticism of its actions during the war; it provided $13 billion in cash and aid, but was not able even to send even military medical teams to help in the effort to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Japan did send minesweepers after fighting had ended, but this was considered a special circumstance.
Prime Minister Miyazawa has staked his career now on passing the bill so that Japan can take a role in international political affairs commensurate with its economic might.
The amendments his party accepted would freeze the provisions for sending troops abroad under United Nations auspices until the Parliament voted yet again to end the prohibition. The entire Parliament would then have to vote each time troops were to be sent on peacekeeping missions, and the bill would have to be reviewed in three years.
The bill has other provisions that would permit Japanese civilians to participate in United Nations operations, such as monitoring elections, providing emergency medical care abroad, rescuing refugees and helping reconstruct devastated areas. These operations would not require individual parliamentary approval.
The Socialist Party slowed the passage of the bill by resorting to a tactic known as the "cow walk." This involves ambling slowly to the rostrum when recognized to speak or to cast a ballot. The walk can be done in just a few minutes, but through the long evenings of the past week some lawmakers took as long as 30 minutes. They also delayed the process by introducing a series of censure and no-confidence motions.

HEADLINE: A Sanction Minuet;
To Bosnia, Diplomacy Is Merely Nice; Serbs Seem to Understand Only Force

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, June 8

 BODY:
With Sarajevo enduring the most devastating attack on a European city since World War II, United Nations sanctions on a predominantly Serbian Yugoslavia are not biting soon enough or hard enough to stem the violence.
"Before we run out of Coca-Cola here in Belgrade, there will be no water to drink in Sarajevo," said Stojan Cerovic, a journalist and critic of the Yugoslav Government, summing up the growing impression that the sanctions will not stop the furious Serbian assault on the Bosnian capital. 
 The population of Sarajevo, staggered by shelling that has intensified over the last two days, is said to be hoping for speedier deliverance in the form of Western jet fighters zeroing in on the mountainside positions from which the Serbs unleash storms of artillery and rocket fire.
 
Toward Military Action
 And the notion of an international military response is being taken more seriously because the last two days have made clear that, whatever sanctions might achieve in the long run, they are not likely to bring relief to Sarajevo.
In Germany, which has taken the lead in recognizing Bosnia and the other three breakaway republics of Yugoslavia, officials have pointedly noted that military options cannot be discounted.
United Nations suggestions that the airport in Sarajevo be forced open by international peacekeepers as a supply route for humanitarian relief also imply the use of military measures, since it would be impossible to secure the airport without first silencing the guns and rockets on the hills.
Certainly in describing the situation in a letter to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, sounded like a man in need of more urgent assistance.
 
Plea From the President
 "Around 85 percent of the territory of our country is under attack," he wrote in his letter, sent on Sunday.
"I assure you, dear Mr. Ghali, that after two months of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, nothing has changed in the character of the conflict. It remains a ruthless and unabated aggression by Serbia and Montenegro, i.e., the federal republic of Yugoslavia, which together with the former Yugoslav National Army wish to realize the aim which could not be reached by political means: namely, to create, by ethnic cleansing of some territories, the precondition for their secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina and merging into Serbia and Montenegro."
But if a trade embargo is followed not by diminished aggression by Serbs, but by a brutal and punitive attack on the civilian population, what options remain for collective action? And what risks do they involve?
 
Curb on Nationalist Zeal
 With the decision to apply extensive sanctions on Belgrade, the world has decided, perhaps belatedly, that it has an overriding obligation to suppress the kind of nationalistic zeal that encourages aggression to unite kith and kin across recognized borders.
For the politicians and diplomats in Europe and the United States who concern themselves with continental security, any success by those fighting and killing for long-held dreams of a Greater Serbia could only encourage other nationalists to take up arms.
There are resentments and rivalries rippling not only through the countries that have devolved from Yugoslavia but also through dozens of ethnic groups in Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and parts of the old Soviet Union. Before there was a first World War, there were two Balkan wars. All three conflicts began with such hostilities.
The assumption that led to sanctions was that this process had to be stopped by a resolute international action. But the Serbs fighting in Bosnia are not stopping.
"They simply do not care what happens," said Mr. Cerovic, the journalist, who was trained as a clinical psychologist. "You have to understand their mentality. They are like the Communists in that for them the end justifies the means. For them the idea of creating a Greater Serbia that they think will last forever is worth the suffering and pain and killing."
While he does not believe the denial by the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, of responsibility for the fighting, Mr. Cerovic said the controversy over exactly who was fighting was irrelevant. Sanctions, he said, could and perhaps should be imposed to punish Mr. Milosevic for what he had done in the past, but they are not stopping what is happening now.

HEADLINE: Drop in Post-Soviet Arms Industry Cited

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
American intelligence officials today sketched a picture of a rapidly disintegrating military-industrial complex in the former Soviet Union, with many plants near bankruptcy and weapons sales expected to plunge by 60 percent to 85 percent this year.
In Congressional testimony, the officials voiced concern that the huge drop in sales, which is making it hard for many plants to pay workers, might push the plants to sell sophisticated aircraft or surface-to-air missiles to many third-world nations. 
 Analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency also said that as a result of the decline, the military-industry complex is now a big obstacle to President Boris N. Yeltsin's plan to press economic reform in Russia.
 
Delaying Cutbacks
 John McLaughlin, director of Slavic and Eurasian analysis for the C.I.A., said pressures from the military were causing Mr. Yeltsin to delay reductions in Russia's armed forces. Early this year, the Government said it would reduce the size of the military, currently 2.5 million to 3 million troops, to about 1.5 million by 1995; the C.I.A. says that level will not be reached until 2000.
The analysts said the purchase of weapons for ground forces last year fell 40 percent from 1988, purchases for air forces fell 50 percent and those for naval forces dropped by a third. And these figures, they said, were calculated before the 60 percent plunge expected this year.
Thus, they said, the ratio of military spending to economic output would fall to between 4 percent and 6 percent, from the 15 percent to 17 percent level during the cold war. The officials noted that Russian officials say up to two million workers in the military industry may be laid off this year.
 
Data Are Depressing
 Mr. McLaughlin said the overall economy of the former Soviet Union was in a parlous state, with inflation soaring, exports falling 30 percent last year and imports down 40 percent.
Intelligence officials said industrial output in the former Soviet Union fell 8 percent last year, farm production by 7 percent and the output of oil, coal and civilian machinery by 10 percent.
In a report today on the republics' transition to a market economy, the intelligence agencies said: "The economic and political situation in all the Commonwealth states will be extremely difficult and uncertain for at least the next year or two. Under the best conditions, output will continue to decline and unemployment will rise."
The report added that political and economic frictions among the Commonwealth states would probably continue, partly because smaller nations are likely to suffer even greater hardship than Russia will.
 
Exports Also Decline
 Testifying before the Technology and National Security Subcommittee of the Joint Economic Commmittee, Mr. McLaughlin said the draft military budget for the Commonwealth of Independent States called for 50 percent less spending than in the 1991 Soviet military budget. But he said the cuts would probably be greater because most of the 10 republics in the commonwealth other than Russia were not making good on their pledges to the budget. (The three Baltic nations and Georgia are not members.)
Kathleen Horste, special assistant for Russia/Eurasia at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said arms exports by the former Soviet republics in 1991 were less than half the 1990 level, dragged down in part by cuts in military aid abroad.
She said Russia would probably offer more advanced systems, perhaps SA-10 surface-to-air missiles, at lower prices or in barter deals.
Russian officials have repeatedly said they would carefully control such sales and exercise discretion in choosing clients. But, the intelligence analysts said, dire conditions could encouarge individual plants to attempt unauthorized sales.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Exodus by the Young Leaves the Future of Family Farms in Doubt

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALNUT, Iowa

 BODY:
For three generations, the lessons of farming have been passed down in the fields here on Rural Route 1, where the Rogers family has planted corn every spring for nearly 100 years.
"I remember when horses plowed the fields," Orris Rogers said. "And my father and I would pick corn by hand." 
 But as Mr. Rogers, now 67 years old, prepares to retire, the family tradition is ending. His children, like a growing number of other young people from the farms, have followed careers far from the cornfields.
 
Ominous Shadow
 Unlike the forced sales of the 1980's, which led to benefit concerts and movies about the farmer's plight, the situation of the Rogers family is evidence of a quieter exodus from the land. The farmers who are selling land today are often making a handsome profit. But all the same, the movement is hastening the decline in the number of family farms and casting an ominous shadow on the little towns built around them.
Since 1980 the number of farmers under the age of 25 has dropped by half, while the number of those over 65 has held steady, a circumstance that could leave tens of thousands of farms in the next decade without anyone in the family to tend the fields. When a small farm comes to the end of the family line, the land almost always goes to a bigger farmer with deep pockets and a powerful line of machinery who can work an extra few hundred acres with efficiency.
Even the Future Farmers of America has fewer future farmers. The organization for high school and college students has seen its membership shrink more than 20 percent since 1980, and just 25 percent of its members say they plan to go into farming, as against 41 percent a decade ago. About half plan to work in jobs that relate to farming, but 27 percent say they will leave agriculture altogether, up from 5 percent in 1980.
 
Transformation in Farming
 In most cases, the link between generations is being broken by an economic transformation in American agriculture that makes it impossible for the average grain farm of 400 acres or so to support more than one family or generation at a time. So with parents still working the fields, the heirs must leave the farm after high school or college. Years later, when the time comes for the parents to retire, their children have settled lives elsewhere.
Even for those who want to return to the fields, the move toward bigger and bigger farms often poses another insurmountable hurdle. A beginning farmer can have start-up costs of as much as $200,000.
And even on farms with room for one more generation, the experience of the calamitous 1980's, when foreclosures hit farm country like hailstones, has soured many young people on a way of life that offers so little security in return for so much hard work.
"Some of them don't want to experience what they grew up with," said Eddie Smith, the director of agriculture education in Oklahoma. "In other cases, the parents are telling the kids not to come back to the farm."
 
Now, a Big Business
 Mr. Rogers and his wife, Patricia, own 350 acres of corn and soybean fields along nameless gravel roads at the edge of Pottawattamie County here in southwestern Iowa. Hogs were a mainstay of the family operation for many years, but they were sold when Mr. Rogers turned 65.
Their son, Scott, 39, and daughter, Connie Schaberg, 44, left Iowa long ago. Their grandsons, who are in their early 20's, have lived in many places, but never on a farm. So the tending of these fields will pass from the family.
"Farming isn't a way of life anymore, but a big business," Mr. Rogers said recently as he pulled on his boots, overalls and cap adorned with a seed company logo before firing up the corn planting machine. "You're kidding yourself if you try to think otherwise. And you're probably going to go down the tube."
 
The Family
Riding Tractors, Gazing at Airplanes
 As a boy, Scott Rogers reveled in the world of "mischievous freedom" on the family's farm, where the yearnings of a larcenous young heart could be satisfied by snatching a few watermelons from a neighbor's patch.
"Or turning on somebody's lawn sprinkler, ringing the door bell and then running like heck," Mr. Rogers said, recalling youthful days of daring.
His older sister, Connie, who could drive a pickup before she was 9, was a natural in the fields. As a teen-ager, she was often hired for chores by neighboring farmers. In a later generation, she might have become a farmer herself. But in the 1960's, girls were not allowed to join Future Farmers of America or raise livestock with the boys in 4-H. Connie thought these rules were worse than silly. "I didn't think it was fair," said Connie, a saleswoman in Tulsa, Okla. But, she added, she accepted the rules and never thought of becoming a farmer.
 
Cultivating Other Dreams
 Scott, a star athlete who was offered a college scholarship to play football, also kept busy with chores on the farm. But as he neared graduation from high school, he knew the farm wasn't big enough to support another farmer. He cultivated other dreams.
"I'd be sitting on a tractor in the middle of a field, and I'd look up in the sky and watch the planes that were flying by," he said. "I would daydream about who was flying them, where they were going. I fell in love with airplanes."
Scott now works in management for United Air Lines in Denver. But there have been many times when he has thought about moving back to the Iowa fields.
In fact, he was working for Frontier Airlines when it went bankrupt in 1986, and he talked to his father about returning to the farm.
"But Dad discouraged the idea," he said. The father talked about the greater risks in today's farming, and reminded his son, "You've been away from farming for a long time."
Still, the fate of the farm is not an easy subject for the son or daughter. As the family gathered in Iowa this Easter, the parents spoke about the possibility of selling the land and the farmhouse.
"Scott couldn't even talk about such a thing," said his mother.
Although he works in Denver, Scott lives about 35 miles south of the city, on a two-and-half-acre plot, so he can be closer to the countryside. And he keeps a small tractor, much to the amusement of his neighbors.
"I'm the most relaxed when I'm sitting on the tractor," he said. But his reverie has changed from those days in the cornfield. Nowadays he daydreams about the farm.
"It's our roots," he said. "It's been in the family for generations. It's the place I want to go home to."
 
The Business
A Clear Message: Get Big or Get Out
 In a market sense, the nation simply does not need as many farmers as it once did.
Using sophisticated machinery and powerful chemicals, a farmer today can produce 120 bushels of corn an acre, twice the yield produced in 1960. For consumers, this increased efficiency has meant lower costs for food.
But it also means that when inflation is taken into account, a farmer makes less on his crop and needs to work twice as many acres to survive, which has driven the trend toward larger agricultural businesses, said Terry Francl, an economist with the American Farm Bureau in Park Ridge, Ill.
"When I was a kid in the early 60's in central Nebraska, a 350-acre farm was considered to be a pretty good size," he said. "But on a typical Midwestern crop farm today, you're going to need 600 to 700 acres to make enough money to sustain a family."
As a consequence, smaller farms become subsumed by bigger ones, a trend that shows no sign of abating. A 1990 report by the Congressional Budget Office predicted that "maintaining the 1988 level of average farm net income would require that nearly 500,000 farms leave the sector" in the next five years.
 
No Choice but to Leave
 For farmers, the message is clear: get big or get out. And many young people from farm backgrounds have no choice but to leave the fields.
Mark Timm, a freshman at Purdue University who was president of the National Future Farmers of America last year, will not be returning to the family's wheat and soybean farm in Indiana. Instead, he plans to work in an office job in an agricultural company.
"At this point, that's the most feasible thing for someone my age," he said. "To go back into production agriculture, you'd have to get some breaks along the line."
In an effort to stem the loss of smaller farms, the Iowa Agriculture Department has started to match beginning farmers with those who plan to retire. The Center for Rural Affairs, an advocacy group in Walthill, Neb., has a similar program. The efforts aim to produce agreements that will allow young people to take over farms without huge investments.
"A lot of farmers who have spent 30 or 40 years of their lives on a farm don't want to see it simply bulldozed and made into a part of a larger operation," said John Baker, a lawyer for Rural Concern, an Iowa organization that is helping state agriculture department in the project.
Mr. Baker said the trend toward larger farmers carries disturbing cultural and social ramifications in rural regions, as fewer and fewer people control vast land holdings.
And the emergence of huge farms has troubled environmentalists, who worry that those operations' heavy pesticide use and giant machinery are damaging the land.
"If you've traveled the farm country, you've seen those large fertilizer rigs moving across the field at 30 miles an hour," said Al Prosch, a former farmer who works for the Center for Rural Affairs. "No one can caretake at that rate of speed and do anything more than a marginal job."
As one farmer replaces three, many of the small communities that depend on trade with farmers have shriveled. Some rural experts say that for every five or six farmers who leave the land, a business on Main Street closes its doors.
Iowa, for example, lost nearly 5 percent of its population during the 1980's, as the farm crisis hollowed many small towns.
"This raises concerns that go well beyond the farm gate," said Paul Lasley, a sociologist at Iowa State University. "It represents a change in the opportunity structure of America."
 
The Community
Once All Farmers, Now Commuters
 As he drives along the gravel road from his place, Orris Rogers passes five old farmhouses. None of the people who live in those homes are farmers.
The residents work in town, one even going across the border to Omaha. The crop land has gone to bigger farmers.
"We don't really even know the neighbors," he said. "If I broke my leg, nobody around here would even know about it."
Big-scale farming, he lamented, has changed more than just the size of the tractors.
Twenty-five years ago, when a nearby farmer, Bud Hamdorf, burst his appendix, Mr. Rogers and two other farmers fed the ailing man's cattle and milked the cows. They never expected any pay.
And when Mr. Rogers caught the mumps -- "I was 45 years old, if you can believe it" -- Wally Riech and Ross Bielfeldt rushed over to milk his cows.
Of course, those were the days when almost every farmer had some milking cows, along with some pigs, chickens and maybe a few lambs. But in the age of specialization, the kinds of farms celebrated in the "Old Macdonald" song have virtually disappeared. These days, most crop farmers in the Midwest stick to corn and soybeans.
Mr. Rogers is chagrined by the changes in farming that can intimidate a beginner. "Not too many people can reach into their pockets and pull up $250,000, just to get going," he said.
He remembers another way. "Years ago, a hired farm hand could save enough to rent some acreage," he said. "And then his friends would lend him some machinery until he got going."
A few miles from the Rogerses' farm, a young man named Val Sothman has dreamed of little but becoming a full-time farmer.
"There's something about the love of the land, being your own boss," said Mr. Sothman, 35. "Even the risk of it all has a certain appeal."
But his family's rented farm in the area was not big enough to support another farmer. So Mr. Sothman went to vocational school and learned to fix farm equipment, and later took a job as a mechanic. On the side, he raised pigs and planted corn on a small plot.
He wanted to rent some more land, just enough to become a full-time farmer, but most land was renting for $100 an acre a year. "I've been standing on concrete for 17 years now," he said, "and I wanted to be standing on the soil."
When a chunk of the Rogerses' land came up for rent, several bigger farmers hurried to make a bid. They would pay top dollar.
But Mr. Rogers thought about the changes he has seen in his time: small farms being swallowed by bigger ones, machinery that costs more than a house, hard-working young people leaving the land for want of a chance.
He offered to rent the land to Mr. Sothman.
Starting this season, as he had dreamed for so long, Mr. Sothman has traded the concrete floors for the soil. "He didn't have to do this for me," Mr. Sothman said, explaining that Mr. Rogers had rented him the land at far below market value.
His wife, Susan, a teller at the First Whitney Bank in Atlantic, did not come from a farm family. She supports her husband in the quest for his dream, but she knows the dangers.
"I'm a little scared," she told him. "But I knew when I married you that you had farming running through your blood."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail

 BODY:

SENATE NOMINEES IN CALIFORNIA TO CAMPAIGN AS TEAM
SACRAMENTO, Calif., June 8 (AP) -- Dianne Feinstein and Representative Barbara Boxer will campaign for their Senate seats as a team to excite voters and lump together their Republican opponents -- one moderate, one conservative, a top state Democrat says. The Democratic nominees face John Seymour, an interim Senator, and Bruce Herschensohn, respectively. 
 Campaigning together "increases excitement for both of our candidates, and it also has the benefit of tying Seymour and Herschensohn together," said Phil Angelides, chairman of the state Democratic Party.
A spokesman for Mr. Seymour, Jeff Weir, said the Senator and Mr. Herschensohn would not campaign as a team but t would not fight each other either.
 
A LONG CHAT WITH PEROT, ON VIDEO
 Arriving any day now, at a video store near you: Ross Perot, the extended interview.
A Chicago company, MPI Home Video, began shipping "A Conversation with Ross Perot" to video stores around the country last week. The 75-minute interview, which an independent producer conducted with Mr. Perot 18 months ago, has a suggested retail price of $19.98.
Though the tape sheds little light on how a President Perot would specifically attack the nation's problems, it does show Mr. Perot declaiming about what ails the nation's economy and schools. The Perot political organization was not involved in producing or distributing the tape, MPI said.

HEADLINE: House Prepares to Debate Balanced-Budget Plans

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
As its backers worked on refining the precise language of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, Representatives on both sides of the issue made last-minute preparations for a week of conflict in the House.
Supporters and opponents of the proposed amendment, which would require that Federal outlays not exceed revenues, were canvassing for votes and polishing arguments they would offer before Thursday's vote, which all sides said would be close. It takes a two-thirds majority, or 290 ayes if all members vote, to pass. 
 A spokeswoman for Representative Charles W. Stenholm, the Texas Democrat who has forced the issue to a vote in the House, said he would meet Tuesday with senators who support the plan to try agree on identical language to be proposed in both Houses to prevent the effort from being sabotaged in a House-Senate conference.
She said the points to be ironed out were technical, such as whether the amendment would require the budget to be balanced in 1997 or 1998.
 
Less Chance in the Senate
 No action is scheduled on the issue in the Senate this week, except for a hearing of the Budget Committee on the views of leading economists. An amendment appears to be in more difficulty in the Senate than in the House, chiefly because of the intense opposition of Senators George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
A two-thirds vote is required in both Houses before an amendment can be submitted to the states. Then it must be approved by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states, or 38 states, to take effect.
Mr. Stenholm's amendment, which would allow the balanced-budget requirement to be waived by three-fifths votes in both Houses, will be the last of four versions to come to a vote on Thursday. Each will be debated for an hour, after nine hours of general debate on the issue on Wednesday.
The alternatives include two Republican plans. One would add to the basic proposal a requirement of a three-fifths vote to raise taxes. The other would limit Federal spending to 19 percent of the gross national product, a level its sponsors say approximates the average level of Federal taxes in the last 25 years.
 
Democratic Alternatives
 The third alternative is one offered by the Democratic leadership, which would allow expenditures to exceed revenues if the President and majorities of both Houses agreed, but would prohibit Congress from approving more total spending than the President sought in his budget. It would also exclude Social Security taxes from the calculation of total Federal receipts, and Social Security benefits and payments on the national debt from the outlays covered by the amendment.
That proposal is one of two moves by House Democratic leaders to make it easier for supporters of their plan to oppose the Stenholm amendment. The other proposal is a vote on an ordinary law, scheduled for Tuesday after only 40 minutes of debate. That proposed statute would direct the President to propose a budget next year that would be balanced by the fiscal year 1998 and direct Congress to adopt balanced-budget resolutions.
The proposed statute, which will be offered by Representative Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut, a chief deputy Democratic whip, was assailed today by Representatives Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, and Bill Gradison of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee.
They called it a "last-minute ploy" and said ordinary statutes had proved insufficient to curb the deficit. They also said an amendment would "fundamentally shift the balance of power between those who want to spend, spend, spend and those who believe that the deficit represents the greatest threat to our nation's economic future."
President Bush met with state legislators today to seek support for an amendment. "I think the country is sick and tired of deficits," he told reporters before meeting with the lawmakers. "This will help discipline the executive branch and the legislative branch, and we've got to get it done."

HEADLINE: The Talk of Hollywood;
A Movie of One Man's Riot Exploding From the Inside Out

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, June 8

 BODY:
It's the hottest day of the year in downtown Los Angeles, and morning rush-hour traffic on the freeway is gridlocked. A bespectacled man in his late 30's, neatly dressed in a short-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair in a crew cut, has been dismissed from his job in a defense plant because the cold war has ended. He watches a fly buzz around his car, and suddenly, inexplicably, goes haywire, abandoning the auto while drivers shout at him, curse and honk horns.
That's the start of "Falling Down," a new film, not yet completed, starring Michael Douglas, which details a seemingly normal man's daylong over-the-edge odyssey across the tense city, an odyssey that underscores the man's personal disintegration and rage. 
 Hollywood executives often insist they want to make timely films, but rarely do so because such movies are too risky and unpredictable at the box office. So "Falling Down" has attracted considerable attention because of its social and political timeliness.
Although the film was written long before the Los Angeles riots and the political rise of Ross Perot, it taps into the same sense of anger and frustration. In one early scene, Mr. Douglas's character has a confrontation with an Asian grocer, and filming in South-Central Los Angeles had to be delayed for several days because of the riots.
The screenplay of "Falling Down" is by Ebbe Roe Smith, a low-key 42-year-old who has acted in several Sam Shepard plays, worked at the Public Theater in New York and played many, he says, "drug addicts and bad guys" in the movies. He said his idea for the film was inspired by a newspaper article about a truck driver who, in a frenzy, began ramming cars in front of him on a freeway. Mr. Smith completed the screenplay, his first to be produced, in 10 weeks.
"The thing about L.A. is that the anger is manifested in cars," he said. "In New York, you see people angry in the streets. In L.A., the cars become sort of weapons. They express anger with their horns, by cutting people off, by not letting people in. It's in your face."
"This is Joe Normal, a guy who bought the American dream, and it's blown up in his face," Mr. Smith said of Michael Douglas's character, while seated in a trailer at Warner Brothers with Arnold Kopelson, the producer of the film, and Joel Schumacher, the director.
The movie also stars Robert Duvall as a police officer seeking to find Mr. Douglas; Tuesday Weld, as Mr. Duvall's wife, Barbara Hershey as Mr. Douglas's estranged wife, and Rachel Ticotin as Mr. Duvall's police colleague. The cost of the film, which is to be released late in the year, is high: $30 million. A good chunk of that is Mr. Douglas's salary, one of the highest in Hollywood, perhaps as much as $8 million to $10 million, or even more.
Mr. Schumacher, whose directorial credits include "Flatliners," "Dying Young," and "St. Elmo's Fire," said of the Douglas character: "This is not a bad guy. But he's had it. He's part of the the vanishing middle class; it's about the people who used to be the strength of this country, the people who played by the rules and feel abandoned. There aren't a lot of programs or help or sympathy for these people and they're very, very angry."
Mr. Kopelson, who produced "Platoon," said several studios passed on the relatively downbeat script, and he was about to make it as a television drama for Home Box Office when Warner Brothers changed its mind and decided to make the film. Though the movie is not about poverty or racial strife, the producer said, the furies of the recent riots have left an imprint on it.
"Everyone said after the riots to get the camera crew in there and use some of it," Mr. Kopelson said. "But that's not what the film is about. It's about one man's anger. It's the same anger that has allowed Ross Perot to touch people, an anger with complacency, with unemployment, with crime, with government. People are fed up!
"The Michael Douglas character would have voted for Perot."
 
For Love and Money
 Although "Falling Down," seems to have embarked on a relatively smooth journey to the screen, another out-of-the-mainstream movie, "Mistress," has had a more difficult time. "We had problems; it goes to show you," said Robert De Niro, a producer and star of the offbeat comedy about a once promising film maker (played by Robert Wuhl) whose prospects for making a personal film are sidetracked because the investors want to put their mistresses in it.
The film is directed by Barry Primus, a film and stage actor and drama teacher who co-wrote the script with J. F. Lawton, who wrote "Pretty Woman." The film's cast includes not only Mr. De Niro, but also such performers as Martin Landau, Christopher Walken, Danny Aiello, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Laurie Metcalf and Eli Wallach.
Although the movie is crammed with name actors, the studios have been reluctant to pay for its distribution because the film seemed too offbeat. It was faced with the bleak possibility of moving directly into the video market without appearing on movie screens -- the fate of some other independent films -- when Rainbow Releasing, a company headed by the film maker Henry Jaglom joined with Mr. De Niro's TriBeCa Productions, to market and distribute the movie. It finally has an opening date: Aug. 7 in New York City.
"You've got to tell yourself it's one of those things, not to take any of this personally," Mr. De Niro said in a telephone interview from New York City about the difficulties of getting the movie off the ground. "People wanted Barry Primus to make changes, but I said: 'Yeah, right. Barry wants to make it his way; it's his vision, so let's do it his way.' Look, it's a personal film and the studios are geared to something big and important, and not like this."
Mr. Jaglom said his small company began distributing his own movies ("Someone to Love," "New Year's Day" and "Eating") and now works by other film makers because theater chains avoided these art house movies. Mr. Jaglom said his office staff calls newspapers in cities across the country, speaks to film critics, and asks for the name of the local art-house theater, or where Woody Allen films play. Then they make a pitch to the theater.
"We were told these films can't play in Oklahoma or Dubuque," Mr. Jaglom said. "That's not true at all. The problem with some of these studios is that art films are dirty words to them. You can't even say it."
 
Imitation of Life?
 Frank Capra remains in the pantheon of Hollywood directors for making such classics as "It Happened One Night," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "Meet John Doe," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "It's a Wonderful Life." On the basis of these films, and on the persona Mr. Capra himself cultivated, he was viewed as a tolerant and passionate advocate of the poor and disenfranchised, a man who despised the rich and selfish.
But Joseph McBride, a reporter and film reviewer for Daily Variety, the trade newspaper, spent eight years on a major study of the director, who died in 1991, and said he found that like so much else in Hollywood, myth had overtaken reality. This has resulted in a copiously researched and highly acclaimed book, "Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success," published by Simon & Schuster. It depicts Mr. Capra as duplicitous, mean-spirited, bigoted, an admirer of Mussolini and Franco, a man who betrayed colleagues during the McCarthy period and viewed the poor and working class with distrust.
He was also extraordinarily complex, suicidal at times. "He wanted to perpetuate the myth but he also wanted to reveal himself," said Mr. McBride, who spent more than a year interviewing Mr. Capra. When the director gave all of his papers to Wesleyan University for study by film scholars, Mr. McBride said "it was nothing less than an act of confession."
"He was a great film maker," Mr. McBride said. "But as with other great film makers, it's important to get behind the myth and find out who he really was. It illuminates his films in a new way."

HEADLINE: Earth Summit Finds The Years of Optimism Are a Fading Memory

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IO DE JANEIRO, June 8

 BODY:
The representatives of 178 countries gathered here for the Earth Summit confront a far more sobering task than did the intellectual and political predecessors who, in a landmark meeting, gathered in Stockholm 20 years ago last week and put the cause of the environment on the world's formal agenda for the first time.
In those palmy save-the-whales years, full of hope and idealism, the delegates to the United Nations Environment Conference in Sweden asserted confidently that "the capability of man to improve the environment increases with each passing day." 
 Here, the optimism of 1972 has been replaced by a hard realism. The delegates in Rio have discovered how hard it is for nations to unite on fundamental environmental problems facing them.
Differences between the rich countries of the industrialized world and the poor ones of the developing world, for instance, today threatened the summit with its first big, clear-cut failure as talks on a statement of principles for managing the world's forests seemed headed toward an inconclusive result.
The rich nations had hoped that the summit would produce a call for a treaty on protection of forests to be negotiated after the talks in Rio. But that hope appeared doomed, delegates and official observers said today, and it seemed highly possible that no statement at all would emerge.
 
An Isolated U.S.
 The difficulties are also reflected in the isolation of the United States, the world's biggest environmental actor, on the two big summit issues of biodiversity and climate change. It appeared today that all the other industrialized countries would sign a treaty strengthening the world's efforts to protect living species, leaving the United States as the major dissenter.
The United States agrees with the treaty's provisions on protection of species as such, but demurs on grounds of finances and intellectual property rights. Other rich countries share the objections, but say that it is important to get the treaty in force. It can be modified after it is ratified, they say.
And the argument between the United States and Europe over whether to adopt specific targets and timetables for stabilizing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, which were thought to have been resolved when a treaty aimed at controlling the gases was negotiated in New York last month, has carried over to the summit.
The Europeans wish to see the treaty altered soon after it goes into effect so as to include the specific targets and timetables. The United States disagrees, saying that the threat of warming is not yet scientifically clear enough to move that far just yet. The Europeans say it is clear enough to them.
The tougher job of the Rio delegates stems from two underlying causes: the environmental problem itself has worsened since Stockholm, and the world has grown more serious about dealing with it.
Human activity has continued to put relentless pressure on the biosphere, the earth's life support system, in the last 20 years. Between Stockholm and Rio, population has grown by more than 40 percent, or more than 1.5 billion.
New scientific measurements have limned the fragile character of the biosphere, as emphasized by the depletion of the earth's protective ozone shield, far more clearly than the Stockholm conferees could have known or appreciated.
The delegates in Rio are far more aware of the prospect of climate change, given that emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that scientists fear will cause global warming, have grown by 35 percent over the two decades.
 
Protecting Future Generations
 Moreover, the Rio negotiators have come to grips with the problem of "sustainable development," how to serve the economic needs of the world without damaging the biosphere and its vital resources and thereby compromising the well-being of future generations.
The concept had barely germinated in Stockholm, but now, as thinking has evolved over the last two decades, it has acquired a sort of orthodoxy.
"You're getting into terribly difficult areas to negotiate," said Russell E. Train, who was the chief United States delegate at Stockholm and is to attend the Earth Summit this week as president of the World Wildlife Fund of the United States. "I think they're going to take a long time to work out. This is a continuing process."
Stockholm set in motion a chain of intellectual and political events that led directly to Rio, and together the two conferences constitute benchmarks in international environmentalism.
In 1972, the world was nowhere near confronting the hard questions that are being debated here. At Stockholm, environmental protection was conceived relatively narrowly, primarily in terms of physical pollution and the endangerment of popular species.
Several concrete developments were propelled ahead by the Stockholm meeting: the successful negotiation of a treaty on trade and endangered species; a treaty on ocean dumping; a moratorium on the hunting of whales; and the establishment of the United Nations Environmental Program, which has tried to serve as a catalyst for environmental action.
But more than that, said Mr. Train, Stockholm was itself a "catalytic event that raised consciousness about the issue and energized politicians."
This shift in consciousness has led most of the world's governments to establish departments of the environment since 1972. International aid programs are developing an environmental dimension. A new fund, the Global Environmental Facility, was established last year to channel money for environmental protection from rich countries to poor ones. Environmental advocacy groups have grown enormously in number, expertise and force, exerting pressure on governments around the world.
"There's been a huge institutional evolution since Stockholm," said Mr. Train.
But science has revealed new threats in the meantime and changed the perceived shape of old ones. From concern over creatures with devoted public supportlike whales, for instance, the attention of conservationists has broadened and shifted to encompass the concept of preserving biological diversity and protecting whole ecosystems rather than focusing on a single popular, but not necessarily critical, species at a time. This more comprehensive approach is embodied in the biodiversity treaty that countries are signing here.
And it has only been in the last decade or less that the twin issues of global warming and depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer have appeared.
The Vienna Convention of 1985 established an institutional framework for protection of the ozone layer, followed in 1987 by the creation under the convention of the Montreal Protocol. Both are widely cited as landmark acts. They have led to the outright banning by the end of this decade of chemicals that destroy ozone, and the deadline will probably be moved up later this year.
Only in the last six years has the question of climate change -- global warming, or the greenhouse effect -- vaulted to the top of the international agenda.
"In 1986, the world wasn't working on greenhouse at all; now all heads of government have had to deal with it," said Rafe Pomerance, a specialist on the issue at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research and advocacy organization.
In 1982, the United Nations held a second environmental conference, this one in Nairobi, Kenya. The successor to Stockholm and predecessor to Rio, it reaffirmed the ideals of Stockholm but revealed clearly that there was a huge gap between the theory and the practice of environmental protection.
Out of this conference grew the World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway.
The 1987 Brundtland Report, as the commission's product is called, changed the terms of the debate by giving economics equal consideration with the environment. A manifesto for sustainable development, it said that economics and environment were inextricably linked and that economic development and reduction of poverty were essential to protecting the environment.
Those ideas are central to the Earth Summit, and are perhaps the biggest reason why the going here is so difficult.

HEADLINE: BUSH PLAN TO SAVE FORESTS IS BLOCKED BY POOR COUNTRIES

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's drive for a sweeping statement of principles on conserving the world's forests at the Earth Summit was stymied today because of objections by poor countries resisting such an agreement as an intrusion on their autonomy.
An agreement on the forestry initiative, which has picked up support among industrial nations over the last 18 months, has become President Bush's highest priority. The White House renewed its backing this week as a way of demonstrating American leadership on environmental issues and deflecting criticism of other American environmental policies. 
 As an incentive to developing countries, Mr. Bush said the United States would increase its aid to other nations' forestry programs by $150 million, to $270 million, in the next fiscal year. He challenged other nations to double spending on forest conservation, to $2.7 billion annually.
 
Japan to Increase Aid
 But diplomats and environmental groups said the Administration's proposed spending was giving little impetus to the forestry talks.
In a day of negotiations on several issues as the Earth Summit churned through its sixth day there were these other developments:
*Japan indicated that it would substantially increase its foreign aid, which has been running at about $10 billion a year, to help poor countries pay for environmental programs.
*There was an 11th-hour attempt by Britain, France and Japan to persuade the Bush Administration to sign a treaty to protect plants, animals and natural resources.
*Germany took the lead in Europe in pressing for a protocol to a treaty at Rio to adopt stricter limits on carbon dioxide emissions, the heat-trapping gases believed to cause global warming, than those supported by the United States.
 
Conflict Over Forests
 The goal of persuading the Rio summit conference to call for a treaty on preserving the world's forests, or at least issue a declaration of principles, has won broad support from the United States and other industrial countries. But developing countries are resisting an accord as an unwarranted intervention in their domestic matters.
As a fallback, the United States has proposed a simple call by the Earth Summit for future negotiations on a forest treaty, but even this weaker step "is not in the cards," said Gareth Porter of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute in Washington, an independent research organization.
"There is no way you're going to change the developing countries' mind on this anytime in the foreseeable future," said Mr. Porter, an official observer at the conference.
Underscoring Mr. Porter's pessimistic assessment, Kamal Nath, India's Environment Minister, said at a news conference that "we have opposed and will continue to oppose" such a treaty.
Forests, he said, are not a global issue any more than oil is, in effect rejecting the industrialized countries' argument that forests are an essential part of the global biosphere.
A United States official said that while Washington still hoped that a treaty could eventually be negotiated, it recognized that the developing countries were "so nervous about this" that Washington was hoping simply for "a good declaration of forest principles."
 
Agreement Is Doubted
 But some delegates said that even a nonbinding statement of forest principles, the minimum that had been expected to come out of Rio on the subject, might not be produced. "Unless there's a real change of attitude, we're not going to have a statement," said a European delegate who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
This delegate said that negotiators might simply submit to the main session of the Rio summit meeting "some sort of statement that we were working hard but could not agree." Asked if this could be the conference's first clear-cut failure, he answered, "Yes."
Both delegates and observers said that time was rapidly running out. Negotiations must be completed by Wednesday night, and the European delegate said that while there had been some progress, the two major questions of the call for a treaty and trade in forest products had not yet even been addressed.
The negotiators, he said, had already declared an impasse on another major issue: Whether to call for international guidelines for the management of forests, a point favored by the industrialized countries but rejected by the developing nations.
As for the $150 million in aid for forest preservation proposed by Mr. Bush, this official said that some developing countries had expressed interest in receiving the money. An American official said that those countries that supported the United States in pushing for a full declaration of principles on forests at the Rio conference would receive special consideration in the distribution of the American aid.
 
'It's a Toughie'
 While there was some movement on these steps, Maurice Strong, secretary general of the summit meeting, was less than optimistic about the outcome. "It's a toughie," he said.
Compounding the impasse, environmentalists charged that the forest talks were being used as a political football to gain leverage in negotiations on a comprehensive blueprint to guide nations in pursuing economic development while protecting the environment. As a result, they said, proposals were being watered down to the point of worthlessness.
"They're in real serious trouble," William Mankin of the Sierra Club, a forest specialist, said of the talks. And if they succeed in producing a statement of principles, he said, "they're just not going to do anything wonderful."
He and other environmentalists charge that even if there is agreement on a draft statement on forests, it will probably fall far short of forestry measures already taken. Among such measures are the World Bank's prohibition adopted in 1991 on financing for logging in primary tropical rain forests, and other international rules confining trade in tropical timber to materials gained from sustainable forest management.
The environmentalits also said that the proposed forestry statement being discussed in Rio would not adequately address the root causes of forest destruction, like clearing land for agriculture and cutting trees for fuel and timber sales.
 
Reserving Veto Power
 On the biodiversity treaty, some European Governments, including the British, were said to be preparing to sign the treaty while formally declaring at the same time that they would reserve the right of veto power over provisions on control of financing.
The United States opposes the treaty because it fears that there might be provisions making the financing of preservation projects mandatory.
The Bush Administration also opposes the treaty on grounds that it does not do enough to protect intellectual property rights relating to the manufacturing and marketing of medicines and other materials gleaned from the world's forests.
Some of those involved in the last-minute attempt to obtain American support say that the United States might be able to sign the treaty conditionally. Under this proposal, the United States would sign but would also issue a statement saying that it was interpreting the treaty in its own way. American opposition to the treaty has drawn widespread criticism, but many delegates were doubtful that the United States would go along.
"I can't believe they will get Bush to sign," said a member of the American delegation, who added that there was "a lot of scurrying around looking for something for Bush to announce."
 
Carbon Monoxide Targets
 Europeans, led by Germany, made it clear that they would accompany their signing of the climate treaty with a declaration advocating firm targets and timetables for reducing their emissions of carbon dioxide.
One way to do this would be to negotiate a protocol to the treaty after it is ratified. It would embody the European proposal, rejected by the United States in the treaty itself, to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels in the year 2000. The United States position is that it is too soon to consider such protocols, giving the uncertain state of scientific knowledge about global warming. The Europeans say the science is convincing to them.
"We continue to think that setting targets and timetables is setting the cart before the horse," Michael Young, an American spokesman, said at a news conference today.
Whatever the outcome of the talks here, negotiators tonight created a new international watchdog group, the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, to insure that governments respect the pledges they make here.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Racing With Perot

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Traveling abroad for a couple of weeks, I found myself missing Ross Perot.
That startled me. I can't think of another American politician I ever thought about when I was absorbed writing from foreign countries. Yes, politician -- it would help to see more clearly if we thought of him that way, not as the Lone Ranger. His own top aides point out that Rangers don't make billions by their lonesome. 
 It certainly wasn't personal. I talked with him by long distance a few times before I introduced myself to my telephone buddy -- on a men's room line at a Broadway theater opening. No bells seemed to ring. But that's all right -- I will forget all about it, in 10 or 20 years.
And I'm troubled a lot that he has kept his mind top secret to the voter on programs and ideas that might lift the country out of various messes. Still I kept thinking of Mr. Perot, for two reasons.
One: He has managed to get America excited again about politics, the essence of American democracy. And he has made the Presidential campaign a two-man race again -- two of them, in fact. That strikes me as the kernel of the Perot story.
Millions of voters already are determined to vote for President Bush. Some think he has done a decent enough job. Others feel more comfortable with a known President than a gamble.
For other millions, the Clinton button will stay on. They are convinced the future should be with a Democratic candidate who is one of the most attractive in years -- learned, alert and gutsy.
But that still leaves enough voters to tip the election one way or another. Some are not happy about the President but totally put off by Mr. Clinton and hate saxophones. ABC -- anybody but Clinton. Before Mr. Perot took off, anybody was just George Bush. Now they have a choice: Bush or Perot.
And there are many Americans who voted for Mr. Bush but are determined not to do that thing again. At home, they count him out for always seeming to float like a bouncing balloon beyond the problems of the country, including the recession that has not turned around for the unemployed or for merchants who still stare at empty aisles.
On foreign policy he has forfeited one-time Bush voters who fault him for starting a war he never finished, remaining tied to a doomed Gorbachev and turning away from too many friends of the United States -- Chinese political prisoners, Balts, Israelis, Kurds among them.
In the never-again contingent are also women and men who favor free choice but voted for Mr. Bush despite his stand against abortion rights. They simply thought that, bottom line, he would be a far better President than Michael Dukakis. But as they see free choice in jeopardy, they are making that the paramount issue -- crossover Democrats and Republicans too.
Many of the lost Bush voters would have voted for Mr. Clinton. Now they have the choice: Clinton or Perot. Obviously this could hurt the Governor. But at least he has a chance to present the voter with a strong contrast: Choose between his own carefully thought-out ideas and a man who so far has not put forward anything better than "Trust me and be quick about it."
Mr. Clinton also needs a chance from American journalism. Even Charles Black, a Bush adviser, says it is keeping Mr. Clinton hidden. I include myself, for too quickly and unjustly dismissing his speeches on Los Angeles.
Mr. Perot sees himself as a straight shooter. But if he keeps ducking and weaving on domestic and foreign affairs, pretty soon he will look like a weaving duck.
I think he is a smart enough politician to know that. If so, now's the time to give the country some real ideas to chew. (That electronic town hall gimmick will fall on its constitutional backside if he tries to do anything with it but give everybody another chance to pop off.)
So I don't accept all the sky-is-falling among some of my friends about a Perot candidacy. I understand the fear -- that he will turn out to be nothing but a noise on a horse -- with all the nasty memories that brings back. If so, Americans can dispense with horse and rider at election time. Isn't that the whole idea?
Meantime, Mr. Perot is waking up American politics and the parties will never be quite the same. Is that bad? Where's the beef is a good question. So is what's the beef.

HEADLINE: Worse Than Unbalanced

 BODY:
This week the House will vote on a series of constitutional amendments, all bad, that would require a balanced budget. Each would tilt spending away from long-term investment, the very opposite of sane policy. Worse yet, Byzantine tactics by opponents of the amendments might backfire and produce the worst possible result.
Yes, the economy would be better off with a balanced Federal budget. But only if "balance" is defined to to take account of inflation, growth and -- most important -- the economy's need for public investment. None of the proposed bills make sensible discriminations. None deserve to pass. 
 The crucial votes come on Thursday, when four proposed amendments will be voted in preset order. Whichever amendment passes last, by majority vote, goes on to a second vote, which requires a two-thirds majority for passage.
The first key vote will be on a proposal by the majority leader, Richard Gephardt, that would require balancing the budget without touching Social Security. The exemption makes a bad idea truly horrific. Congress would have to chop hundreds of billions out of the deficit -- eviscerating investments in infrastructure, education and research -- without asking the elderly to share the burden. That builds a constitutional safeguard for the elderly, who, as a group, are better off than many who would bear the brunt of cutbacks.
The next vote will be on an amendment sponsored by Charles Stenholm of Texas, which makes no such exemption. That's still unacceptable, but at least doesn't victimize the non-elderly.
Incredibly, some opponents of a constitutional remedy plan to vote for Gephardt. They can thus claim to back both fiscal prudence and the elderly. Next, these opponents expect the Stenholm amendment to carry, replacing Mr. Gephardt's proposal. When the Stenholm version comes up for a second vote, opponents can then vote no, telling voters they couldn't vote for a law that would victimize the elderly.
But this is a dangerous game. If Stenholm loses in the first round of voting, which is increasingly possible, the even worse Gephardt amendment could be the only one still in play.
All the proposals should be voted down. By indiscriminately lumping together spending for consumption and investment, requiring that everything be paid out of current revenue, the amendments would drive Congress away from the type of long-term, but costly, public investments the economy desperately needs. The amendments would not even allow Government to increase its debt as the economy grows, a choice virtually every other industrialized country readily exercises.
Many opponents fear the amendments would insinuate the courts into Congressional budget setting, undermining the Constitution's balance of governmental powers. Maybe so. But there's no need to engage in such complexities. The proposed amendments fail on the merits.

HEADLINE: Perotxysms

 BODY:
Ross Perot may be a sudden breath of political fresh air or a blowhard offering more bull than beef, but either way he provides an irresistible target for name puns. An article in The New Republic last week describing him as paranoid was entitled "Perotnoia." On television last week, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York warned likewise against "Perotanoia." Another commentator referred with Shakespearean sarcasm to the idyllic world of Pros-Perot.
Puns need not be scorned as low humor, not when they make sense at each level of meaning, as in John Leonard's gibe at economists preoccupied with anti-recession models: "Brother, can you paradigm?" But making puns on people's names invites endless, tasteless imitation and so it might be worth the effort -- all together now -- to get every conceivable Perot pun out of our systems. 
 Let it be conceded, once and for all, that if he was elected President he would offer economists, and Bush Administration theorists, a new Perotdigm. Even if his Latin American policy made him sound like a Perotnista, his concern for global nuclear safety would remain Perotmount.
In terms of domestic policy, he would surely be attentive to Perotchial schools. His concern for the handicapped would extend to Perotplegics and his health care reform would have to cover Perotinitis and Perotdontia.
But his opponents can be depended on, before long, to ridicule any claim that he's a Perotgon of virtue who could lead America to political Perotdise. They are more likely to prefer a sentence of life without Perotle, while the rest of us wish for, at least, no more name puns. While there's life there's hope, Caesar might have said. Dum spiro sperot.

HEADLINE: $2.3 Billion Merger Set By Utilities

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In a deal that would create one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, the Entergy Corporation of New Orleans yesterday announced plans to buy Texas-based Gulf States Utilities for $2.3 billion in cash and stock.
The combined entity would serve 2.3 million customers in an area of 112,000 square miles. Entergy operates in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and Gulf States, which has been struggling for six years with a costly nuclear plant and stiff competition from independent generators, serves Texas and Louisiana. 
 Under an agreement unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, Entergy would pay $20 a share for Gulf States stock, either in cash or in its own shares at the option of shareholders.
Gulf States shares gained $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $15.75. The stock was as low as $8.50 last year.
"If they were to stay independent, this would not be a $16 stock," said Barry M. Abramson of Prudential Securities. Entergy closed at $27 a share, down 12.5 cents, on the Big Board.
 
Lull in Utility Mergers
 The deal was announced after a long lull in utility mergers, created in part by the rejection by California regulators a year ago of a merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric.
In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates interstate power contracts, has destroyed one traditional goal of mergers: the creation of huge proprietary transmission networks. The commission has told utilities that it will not approve their mergers unless they open their transmission systems to other companies.
But some analysts -- and, evidently, some utility executives -- still believe that mergers can bring substantial economies. Executives of Entergy (which used to be known as Middle South Utilities) and of Gulf States told Wall Street analysts yesterday that their combination would save $600 million in fuel costs over 10 years.
They also suggested that because Gulf States operates only one nuclear plant, combining its operation with Entergy's four would allow lower-cost operation through better use of personnel.
"We're still in a business that has economics of scale," Edwin Lupberger, chairman and chief executive of Entergy, said in a telephone interview. "The bigger you are, the better you can do, if you manage it right."
 
Are They the Answer?
 Some utility experts are skeptical that opening transmission systems, as was done in the Pacificorp and Utah Power and Light merger in early 1989, or achieving economies of scale, as is claimed for all mergers, have made much difference.
"It's hard to say that the world is a better place, or that the customers of Utah or California are better off because a single company controls such a huge territory," said Leon Lowry, an electric utility expert with Environmental Action, a Washington-based advocacy group.
Utilities generally contend that combined operation allows for "economic dispatch" of generating stations, so that as demand for power rises and falls, generating stations are started up and turned off in order of their costs to run. Smaller utilities generally overcome this problem by buying and selling power among themselves.
But Mr. Lupberger said: "There's a real benefit to having a jointly owned operation. Obviously, you can do a lot of things with your cousins or your neighbors, and so forth, but you can be more effective with your immediate family."
The agreement announced yesterday comes as the smaller partner, Gulf States, emerges from a long troubled stretch. The company cut stock dividends in 1986 and 1987 and teetered near bankruptcy because it finished the River Bend nuclear plant, in St. Francisville, La., far over budget in 1986 just as a severe regional recession was beginning. The recession cut the demand for power, and the company also lost sales to independent generators.
Recently, however, it paid off back dividends in preferred stock, which it must do if it is to resume common dividends.
Mr. Lupberger said that Entergy had held on to big industrial customers by offering special deals, and that Gulf States had done the same. The combined entity would do more, he said.
 
Approvals Are Needed
 The utilities must win regulatory approval for their merger from the public service commissions of Texas and Louisiana; the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates Entergy as a multistate utility holding company; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates bulk interstate power sales, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because both utilities run reactors.
The utilities said they thought the deal could close in 12 to 18 months but Mr. Abramson of Prudential and others said two years was more likely.
The deliberation may be particularly complex in Louisiana. According to Paul Zimmering, a New Orleans lawyer who in the past has been hired by the state's Public Service Commission to analyze regulatory decisions, about half the state's residential customers are served by Gulf States, and 40 percent by Entergy. He said the commission would probably conclude that the merger was favorable for both groups of customers.
Another issue for the Louisiana commission, he said, was that if the merger was consummated, some of its regulatory power would, in effect, be transferred to the Federal Energy Regulatory commission, which regulates the bulk power-sales contracts used by big utilities like Entergy to sell power to their operating subsidiaries.
He added, "You've got an awful lot of jurisdictions with an interest here."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the proposed merger of Entergy and Gulf States Utilities misstated the position of Paul Zimmering, a lawyer. He said that before Louisiana's Public Service Commission could approve the merger, it would probably have to conclude that the deal would benefit customers of both companies; he did not say the commission would conclude that the merger would benefit the customers.

HEADLINE: HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK A REVAMPING OF JOBLESS BENEFIT

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Challenging President Bush on a politically sensitive issue, the Democratic-controlled House voted overwhelmingly tonight to make sweeping changes in the unemployment insurance system to grant automatically renewable benefits to the long-term jobless.
Mr. Bush would have preferred another simple extension of unemployment benefits for 13 or more weeks. But the measure that was passed went far beyond that, putting him in the awkward position of potentially vetoing a bill that would help more than two million unemployed workers in an election year. 
 If no further extension is enacted, the current round of extended benefits will expire July 4.
 
Threat of a Veto
 The White House strongly suggested tonight that Mr. Bush would veto the measure. Laura Melillo, a White House spokeswoman, said the President preferred a Republican-sponsored bill that would have provided $2.5 billion for extending benefits, as well as lowering capital gains taxes and repealing the luxury tax on boats. As for the Democratic bill, she said, "in its current form, we do have a veto threat."
The bill was approved 261 to 150. Voting for it were 235 Democrats, 25 Republicans and 1 independent; opposed were 131 Republicans and 19 Democrats. [Roll call, page A18.]
The legislation would replace the current system of irregular extensions of benefits with one that would automatically grant at least 13 extra weeks of benefits in states where the unemployment rate was 6 percent or higher. In addition, it would immediately provide 20 or 26 additional weeks of emergency unemployment benefits, depending on the state, and require states to create programs to seek out the unemployed who need help.
 
Fiercely Partisan Debate
 The Senate Finance Committee is planning to take up a similar, though less generous, bill on Thursday. That bill is expected to be passed quickly, and sponsors of the House and Senate bills do not expect any difficulty in reconciling the two versions.
In a fiercely partisan debate that had overtones of the Presidential election campaign, Republicans today accused the Democrats of purposely cornering Mr. Bush into a politically costly veto when they could just as easily extend current benefits. Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of upstate New York, asserted that the Democrats were proposing "a bill produced specifically designed for a veto." Mr. Solomon said Democrats were using the unemployed as "pawns" and "unemployment checks as bargaining chips."
 
Higher Taxes for Employers
 The Administration has expressed strong reservations about the measure because it would raise taxes on wealthier people and raise taxes paid by employers of higher-paid workers.
In a statement opposing the bill, the Office of Management and Budget argued last week that "increasing taxes on employers would threaten job growth and existing jobs."
But citing the recent announcement that the nation's jobless rate rose to 7.5 percent last month, House Democrats contended today that the safety net for the unemployed needed mending.
"We are no longer talking about the hard-core unemployed, no longer talking about somebody else," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader. "Today, 'them' is 'us.' Today, unemployment wears a blue collar and a white collar; unemployment lives next door; unemployment is our family. And helping the unemployed is our responsibility."
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House bill would cost $5.8 billion through 1997, while its revenue provisions would raise an estimated $6 billion over the same period.
In early February, Congress approved an additional $2.7 billion in unemployment benefits, adding 13 weekly payments averaging about $170 depending on the state. (The Federal Government matches a state's contribution for the extended benefits.)
The New York State Department of Labor estimates that 210,000 New Yorkers would receive $800 million in additional benefits from the House bill passed tonight. If the provision were to become law quickly, residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would become eligible for 26 weeks of payments.
 
Citing the Perot Factor
 Much of the debate today was overcast by the long shadow of Ross Perot, whose Presidential candidacy has gained momentum because of the public's perception that Congress and the White House are fixed in gridlock.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said the Democrats' refusal to allow a Republican alternative bill to come to the floor and the vote to send Mr. Bush a measure he would surely veto "explains the Ross Perot phenomenon as much as anything."
Most Americans lose their jobs are entitled to 26 weeks of regular umemployment benefits. But because of the extensions granted by Congress in November and February, they can also receive an additional 26 or 33 weeks of extended benefits, for a total of 52 to 59 weeks, depending on how high joblessness is in their states.
But those extended benefits will begin expiring soon. Only people who use up their regular benefits by Saturday would be entitled to 13 or 20 weeks of extra benefits. Those who deplete their regular benefits after July 4 would be entitled to no extra benefits at all.
House Democrats also want to lower state eligibility standards for extra weeks of benefits Under current law, states qualify for extended benefits when the rate of unemployment both reaches 5 percent and is 20 percent higher than for the same period in the previous two years.
Under the bill, extended weeks of benefits would be granted once a state's unemployment rate both reached 6 percent and was 10 percent higher then the same period in either of the preceding two years. The Federal Government would also expand its contribution to the extended benefits to 75 percent of a state's amount, from the 50 percent it now pays.
In addition, many workers who had previously been required to reapply for extended benefits would instead receive them automatically.
 
Phasing In a New Plan
 The bill, whose chief author is Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk County, would phase out the current Federal unemployment system over three months after the average national unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent or on Jan. 1, 1993, whichever comes first.
To pay for the expanded benefits, the bill would reduce itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers by 2 percent for each $2,500 of adjusted gross income they earn above a level of $100,000 for single people and $157,900 for those filing jointly. It would also limit to $1 million the tax deduction a corporation could declare for salaries paid to its officers, effective Jan. 1, 1992. The companies could continue to pay whatever salaries they wished to, but the tax deduction would be limited.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the nation's unemployment rate will average 6.9 percent this year and 6.4 percent in 1993.

HEADLINE: Post-Soviet Baltic Republics: Still Stunted and Struggling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIGA, Latvia

 BODY:
Some nine months after gaining independence from Moscow, the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia remain stunted and struggling, their fledgling political and economic institutions still seeking stability.
But in this city, founded in 1201, as in the nearby capitals of Tallinn and Vilnius, the months since the break with Moscow have produced a sometimes bewildering rush of change and new possibilities. 
 Western luxury cars line the old cobbled streets, and new air and ferry links to Western Europe and Scandinavia have brought in a flood of diplomats, investors and emigre Latvians, many of them young people determined to rebuild the nation their parents and grandparents remember from before the Soviet occupation a half-century ago.
 
Presence of Russian Troops
 Still, the economies of Latvia and its Baltic neighbors remain feeble, leaving consumers little better off than those in other former republics of the Soviet Union. Food and fuel supplies are erratic, the countries produce few goods yet that have a market in the West and the most reliable communication beyond the Baltics depends on imported satellite phones.
Politically, their nascent Parliaments are riven by dissension and infighting that sometimes borders on chaos. In Lithuania, the nationalist Government's attempt to institute market-oriented changes has been thwarted by a debate with leftists in Parliament over who is in charge. In Latvia and Estonia, where there are sizable Russian minorities, there are angry debates over citizenship as politicians wrangle over the even more fundamental question: to whom, exactly, do the new nations belong?
More difficult, the presence of 120,000 to 130,000 Russian troops estimated to be within their borders -- units left over from the days when the Baltics were the Soviet Union's northwestern frontier -- casts a dark shadow over the future of the republics. Dispersed across all three nations, which together cover an area equivalent in size to the state of Washington, the soldiers, sailors and air crews represent the most enduring and potentially destabilizing legacy of the old Soviet era.
"This is the greatest threat to our stability, as well as an active disincentive to Western investment," said Valdis Steins, a member of the Latvian Parliament. "All you have to do is look to Moldova or Azerbaijan to realize the Red Army does not always listen to Moscow."
Sovereign nations only a half century ago, and the least submissive of all the Soviet republics, the Baltic republics were regarded by many as the most likely to succeed as the Soviet Union began to come apart at the seams.
 
Slow Transition And Limited Trade
 Even now, the emblems of new statehood are everywhere: the maroon and white striped Latvian flag flies from most buildings, and the police and Latvian border guards stroll the streets in their new brightly colored uniforms.
Although there were some deadly incidents in Latvia and Lithuania in early 1991, when Communist hard-liners took on protesters, the republics have generally been spared the terrible violence that has stained other republics.
At the same time, the Baltics have natural allies in Canada and the United States, where there are large and well-connected emigre organizations, as well as among the nations of Scandinavia, which share the Baltic coastline with them.
Finland and Estonia, separated by only 50 miles across the Gulf of Finland, have already signed a pledge to increase trade. At the same time, Swedish, Finnish and American companies are looking at programs to rebuild the Baltics' tattered telecommunications system.
But so far, investment is moving slowly, partly because so few enterprises have been privatized, and partly because more than 90 percent of the Baltics' current trade continues to be with Russia and the former Soviet republics.
Juris Dobelis, a leading member of the Popular Front faction in the Parliament, says Latvia should not expect things to change overnight.
"After 50 years of occupation, after two whole generations, of course we must go through a transition of some kind," he said. "So in a way, our situation is normal, for where we have been. But it doesn't mean, don't worry, be happy. Our country is full of Russian troops, and we are still trapped in the ruble zone."
 
Threat to Stability: Russia's Troops
 In Latvia, where according to estimates there are from 35,000 to 60,000 Russian troops as well as 100,000 military retirees and the headquarters of the Russian Baltic command, defense officials complain of almost daily confrontations with Russian units.
In May outside Riga, for example, Latvian guards fired into the ground to keep back Russian soldiers who gathered after accusations that the Russians were stealing electrical wire. One Russian soldier was wounded in the foot in the incident.
"The Russians are involved in deliberate provocations, aimed at justifying the continued presence of their soldiers on the sovereign territory of Latvia," an official of the Latvian Ministry of Defense, Auseklis Plavins, said.
During talks with representatives of the Baltic states, which have been fruitless so far, Moscow has argued that it cannot withdraw the troops because there will not be enough housing in Russia to accommodate them before 1997, at the earliest. Moscow is also pressing to be allowed to lease back some of the bases, including naval sites on the Baltic Sea.
Meanwhile, they have begun to complain forcefully that Russian soldiers and Russian nationals living in the Baltics are the victims of harassment and discrimination. In May, for example, the Russian Government delivered a four-page memorandum to the Council of Europe, describing what it called "massive" human-rights violations in the Baltics because Russians there are being discriminated against on the basis of language and nationality.
Baltic Governments dismiss the complaints, saying the Russians are only trying to foment unrest, to enforce their hegemony over the region. Estonian officials, for example, say the Russians have been helping to organize strikes among workers who run the utility plants in northeast Estonia, where Russians are the majority of the population.
The tensions with the army in Latvia and Estonia are complicated by the large Russian minorities. In Latvia, Russians and other Slavs are 42 percent of the population of 2.6 million; in Estonia, they make up about 35 percent of the population of 1.5 million (in Lithuania, Russians are only 9 percent of the 3.7 million population).
 
Citizenship Question: 'Are You Latvian?'
 "The presence of so many Russian soldiers in our nation only piles barrels of gunpowder around what is still a very volatile situation," said Aleksejs Grigorjevs, a member of the Latvian Parliament whose constituency includes mostly ethnic Russians.
The situation has been aggravated by the debate within Lativa and Estonia over who should be accorded citizenship in the two countries. To the alarm of some Government officials and Russian ethnic leaders, nationalists who wield the balance in Riga and Tallinn want to limit citizenship at first to only those people who lived in the countries before the Soviet occupation in 1940, or their direct descendants.
Both countries have outlined possible naturalization plans for Russians, which could take several years and require they that they pass a language exam. In the meantime, they will not be able to vote.
"In Latvia, we say we want to build a democratic society without understanding what democracy is, or even believing in it," said Janis Jurkans, the Foreign Minister, and an outspoken opponent of those who now argue that Latvia should be only for Latvians. "When we stood at the barricades we did not ask the person next to us, 'Are you Latvian?' What right does the Parliament now have to start sorting them out?"
Mr. Grigorjevs, who is a member of the Popular Front that opposed the Soviet rule in Latvia, said the debate also posed a practical question, given the economic difficulties that Latvia is facing.
"In a time of hardship, with the possibility of food and fuel shortages again next winter, why should we push these people to the corner?" he said.
 
New Currencies And Fear of Russia
 The specter of social instability is compounded by the republics' economic dilemma. The International Monetary fund, in a recent report on the Baltic states, described the Baltics' short-term economic prognosis as bleak. The fund predicted a decline in gross domestic product over the coming year of up to 30 percent in Lithuania and Latvia, and 20 percent in Estonia.
Like other former Soviet republics, the Baltics are eager to issue their own currency as a symbol of their independence and to wrest themselves free of Russia's financial grip on their economies.
Estonia has announced plans to begin printing its own currency, the kroon, which is to be issued in June. It will be tied to the German mark and backed by $120 million in gold and timber reserves.
In May, Latvia and Lithuania issued a currency of sorts -- Latvian ruble and Lithuanian ruble coupons -- intended to circulate equally with the Russian ruble.
Those currencies were printed against the advice of international bankers, who warned it would only stoke inflationary pressures, but the Governments said they had no choice: both nations are facing critical currency shortages, because they say Russia is deliberately withholding ruble shipments to the new republics.
Such ruble shortages fuel the fears of those who see Russia's dark hand behind every economic misfortune. Their worst fear is that a more bellicose, nationalist Government might seize power in Moscow, and seek to reclaim the Baltics.
"The Baltic states are small," said Juri Luik, head of the political department for the Estonian Foreign Ministry. He went on to say conditions could be favorable for a new dictator.
 
Moscow's Legacy: Wells of Bitterness
 While they each speak different languages, and celebrate different traditions, their common history in recent years has left all the Baltic states afflicted, by varying degrees, with a kind of siege mentality, symbolized by the Parliament building in Vilnius. Fifteen months after a bloody showdown with Soviet troops, the Parliament there is still surrounded by the rusting coils of barbed wire, concrete barriers and steel tank traps.
In all three countries, there is a political determination to bar Communist collaborators or foes of the independence movement not only from politics or key Government jobs, but also from citizenship.
The decades of Soviet occupation, of property confiscation and political exile, have left a deep reservoir of bitterness. In schools, in hospitals, in factories, for example, the chosen language was Russian, not Latvian, and even now Latvians who visit clinics in Riga often complain that the Russian doctors and nurses do not know a word of the national language.
It is in reaction to that that Latvia and Estonia have enacted legislation affirming the primacy of their native languages. Across Riga, there has been a small boom in Latvian language seminars and courses.
Mr. Jurkans is among a small group of Baltic officials warning his countrymen not to go too far.
"The economic and political landscape we inherited from the former regime is more distorted than we thought," Mr. Jurkans said. "But what is even worse is that the moral landscape was totally destroyed, and we must start from there."
At the same time, there is a tendency to embrace all that is Western, almost as if the old drab gray of Communism can be washed away by Western sounds and colors.
Western pop music seems to be everywhere, even blaring from the windows of Government offices and tape machines propped up beside the guards at border posts. Near the center of Tallinn, a Indian-born British entrepreneur has opened the Baltics' first Indian restaurant, and another joint venture has brought Estonia a retail outlet called American Style, where Estonians can now purchase Barbie dolls, among other Western consumer goods.

HEADLINE: Baseball Will Allow Sale of Seattle Team To Japanese Group

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
In an abrupt turnaround from baseball's much-debated policy against selling significant portions of clubs to non-North American interests, a committee of major league owners yesterday unanimously recommended the sale of the Seattle Mariners to a group whose majority investor is a Japanese company.
The approval of the sale by the American and National leagues, considered a virtual formality, is expected today. 
 Resolution of the $125 million transaction, originally proposed last January, was made possible by a series of maneuvers that began when baseball backed away from its stated aversion to foreign interests and instead emphasized local ownership. The Japanese company, the Nintendo Company, in turn agreed to decrease its effective interest to that of a minority shareholder and to take a passive role in the running of the club by ceding operating control to one of its Seattle-based partners.
The final and most crucial negotiations came last week in meetings among the bidders, members of baseball's joint ownership committee and Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball. Those discussions, held last Tuesday in Washington, D.C., and last Thursday in Chicago, resulted in an agreement by the bidding group, the Baseball Club of Seattle, to reduce the role of Nintendo, the world's biggest video-game company, which has its American offices in Redmond, Wash.
The Seattle group also agreed to put 100 percent control of the club in the hands of an individual rather than a corporation. And it agreed that the individual would be North American-born and a Seattle resident. Its choice was John Ellis, the group's managing partner and the outgoing president and chairman of Puget Sound Power & Light Company.
"It was very hard work, but the Baseball Club of Seattle met our requests and came a long way to comply with the guidelines," Mr. Vincent said.
With the compromises in place, the ownership committee voted, 7-0, to recommend that the bid be approved.
Mr. Vincent, initially criticized for stating the owners' policy on banning "off-shore" interest, then increasingly seen as a leader of the proponents of the sale, yesterday termed the latest development "a triumph for baseball."
"It's a transaction," he said, "that meets baseball's objectives and a transaction that serves baseball interests about heavily local ownership."
Although many owners must familiarize themselves with the details of the sale, the leagues will probably vote on the recommendation after each meets separately in Manhattan today at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel during baseball's quarterly business meetings. According to at least one owner, it seems likely that the full ownership will approve the sale. The votes of 10 of the 14 American League owners and 7 of 12 National League owners are required.
Fred Kuhlmann of the St. Louis Cardinals, chairman of the body that passed the unanimous recommendation yesterday, said, "The ownership committee is a pretty representative group."
The committee's vote ended nearly half a year of high intrigue that began Jan. 23 when the Baseball Club of Seattle made public its willingness to relieve Jeff Smulyan, the Mariners' chairman, of the club.
The proposed payment was $100 million, plus an additional $25 million for operating costs. When the group announced that 60 percent, or $75 million, of its bid would be financed by Horoshi Yamauchi, president of Nintendo, the proposed sale ran into a fortress of opposition, within and outside the sport.
 
Policy Reversal
 The opposition was there because baseball had adopted a policy just one month before that banned foreign ownership of any sort. When the policy was stated by Vincent on behalf of the owners, the sport found itself in a fierce controversy. And the game became an unwitting player in the balance-of-trade debate between the United States and Japanese governments and business communities.
As baseball's policies were scrutinized, it soon became evident that some of the sport's owners and executives were willing to consider an evolution of the policy. When they agreed to begin negotiating with the group in February, rather than dismiss the bid immediately, it was obvious that some form of approval was being considered.
The original rejection also created a stir in Japan. Mr. Yamauchi held a news conference in Tokyo to explain that his bid came only after he was approached by political leaders in the United States. It was widely interpreted that the rejection emphasized what some said was a growing American resentment of Japanese economic strength.
Leaders in Seattle, including United States Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, went out of their way to champion the Nintendo bid, which guaranteed that the club would stay in that city.
The Mariners had marshaled local support for the sale without giving Seattle much cause for pride. The team entered the major leagues in 1977, but has never finished higher than fourth in the American League West.
As the debate raged and the proposal endured, the commissioner of Japanese baseball offered a response that helped to bolster sentiment in this country against the sale. The commissioner, Ichiro Yoshikuni, said in February that he believed "Japanese fans would not approve a foreign company owning a professional baseball team."
Nintendo refused to withdraw its bid and baseball eventually reconsidered.
"Obviously that policy gave way," Mr. Vincent said of the initial ban on non-North American interests. "And it was a wise decision. Baseball confronted reality and obviously yielded to get this done."
So did the Japanese. Mr. Yamauchi's decision to become a "passive investor," in Mr. Vincent's words, will allow the Japanese businessman involvement in only extraordinary issues, such as the sale of the club.
Mr. Kuhlmann said that Mr. Ellis would make decisions on budget, stadium leases and the like. "There's Japanese ownership, but control is with a local resident," Mr. Kuhlmann said.
In Seattle, where there was general delight over approval of the sale yesterday, people weren't so concerned about the distinction.
Ron Hamakawa, a manager of F. X. McRory's, a sports bar across from the Kingdome, where the Mariners play, said: "You have to remember that the Kingdome is a stone's throw from the Port of Seattle, where every day container ships load and unload. Seattlites have always known that they depend on the Asian Pacific Rim for their bread and butter."

HEADLINE: Underground in Sarajevo, the Ethnic Groups Share the Terror and the Hope

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 9

 BODY:
Above ground, Sarajevo is almost a ghost city, with a few crouching figures running in short bursts between buildings, dodging shells and snipers.
Below ground, at thousands of places like No.2 Vase Pelagica Street in the city's old Muslim quarter, the city has gathered anew, and what is happening there is about all the hope there is that Sarajevo will one day live again. 
 "Welcome to Sarajevo," said Muhamad Hafizovic, a 65-year-old retired thermal plant engineer, rising from his chair at a makeshift card table down a flight of narrow stairs from the building's lobby. "Here we have Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Jews and Slovenes." Motioning about him at some of the 100 people packed into four small rooms, he added: "We're living here as a family. This is a small Sarajevo, and a small Bosnia, too."
Serbian artillery continued to pound Sarajevo today, hitting still more apartment buildings, the Holiday Inn, the railway station, a mosque and two churches, as well as hundreds of houses and shops. But life went on as normal in the subterranean world created in tens of thousands of basements and homemade bunkers.
It is a life with death at the shoulder, since the high-explosive ordnance being used by the Serbs has the power to collapse whole buildings and set them afire, trapping all who shelter there.
 
A Time for Plum Brandy
 Shells have completely blown away the top floor of the seven-story apartment block on Pelagica Street, about a mile from some of the most powerful artillery guns and mortars. But in the basement the mood was anything but doleful.
Cards were on the table for a new hand of remi, a bridgelike game that the players at the table thought originated in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Jokes were being traded, and before long glasses were being filled with golden-yellow slivovitz, the plum brandy that is the nectar of Balkan life.
There were occasional words of contempt for the Serbian gunners and their political masters. Sarajevans have long thought of themselves as the Balkans' most sophisticated city-dwellers, and many a round of slivovitz has been downed in recent weeks to denunciations of the gunners as uncultured brutes.
In the basement, there was also considerable bitterness toward the United States Government for failing to heed Sarajevo's anguished cries for American military intervention to stop the city's destruction. One man, an economist, was vituperative after he heard a radio news broadcast reporting the White House's latest insistence that there will be no dispatch of American troops.
Others chose sarcasm. "We are very satisfied with your military intervention," said Jasmin Hamzar, a 28-year-old gas station attendant. "Tell Bush, 'Thank you very much.' "
 
Laughing, Not Weeping
 Otherwise, on Pelagica Street, and everywhere else that Sarajevans have become what they refer to as mice, people were not so much complaining as enduring, not weeping so much as laughing at the hand fate has dealt them. In this, there is something of London during the blitz, a straightening of the shoulders under fire.
But to outsiders, much of what is happening here seems to carry a more universal message, one rooted in Sarajevo's own idea of itself as a place where the tides of history have thrown together cultures and religions in a way that profits all.
In this there is a special defiance, since the Serbian nationalist leaders who command the hillside guns have set out to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina and to create what they call "ethnically cleansed territories," in which there are few, or none, of the republic's other ethnic groups to disturb Serbian domination.
Seized documents published in Sarajevo's two surviving newspapers suggest that as early as last September Serbian leaders had a detailed plan for the ethnic partition of Sarajevo, whose 560,000 people have lived for decades in densely mixed neighborhoods.
To sustain human ideals on Pelagica Street has not been easy. Since the Serbian attacks began two months ago, people have slept end to end and side by side with barely space to walk between, the walls shake every few minutes from exploding shells, and food has dwindled to the point where a small onion from somebody's backyard is enough to cause a stir.
 
'The Spirit Is Good'
 "Sometimes we fight, of course, because people are nervous," said Iso Papo, a 70-year-old retired mechanical engineer. "Somebody is smoking too much, there is not enough food, such things. But as you see, generally the spirit is good."
Mr. Papo is one of several Jews in the basement. In August 1941, as a 19-year-old, he crept into a railway boxcar at Sarajevo station and fled the Nazis who had arrived in the city several months earlier, setting out on an odyssey that has left him with a strong dose of patriotism and a ready wit. When a visitor noticed that he was wearing a deerstalker hat of the kind worn by Sherlock Holmes, he laughed, lifted the hat, and replied: "Yes, but this is not a two-pipe problem. This is a two-month problem."
Many Sarajevans who are not Jews have compared what they are undergoing here to the Holocaust. Mr. Papo, whose father, mother and sister were killed by the Nazis and their Croatian Ustashe collaborators, was asked if he wasn't uneasy with the comparison between Nazi pogroms and Serbian attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina that have killed a few thousand people. Bosnian estimates put the total for the republic at about 6,000, perhaps half of them in Sarajevo.
"No, not at all," he said, then pointed to the hills and added, "These people are fascists."
"They are too much nationalistic, these Serbs," he continued. "They are ready to kill everybody who is not of the same nation. They try to say that what is going on here is a war between Serbs and Muslims and Croats, but it is not true. It is a war between terrorist killers and ordinary people.
"Look at the people here. This gentleman is a Serb. So is this one. I am a Jew, he is a Croat and this lady here is a Muslim. So what is this nonsense about an ethnic war?"
 
New Sort of Commune
 In reconstructing Sarajevo underground, the residents of Pelagica Street have not lost the irony the Sarajevans savor. Many of the residents were employees of Energoinvest, an energy and transportation conglomerate created in Communist Yugoslavia, and many lived in subsidized apartments and had other comforts not easily available under Communism. Now that Communism has disintegrated, they find themselves living in a new sort of commune, in which truck drivers and rock guitarists and gas-pump attendants, refugees from parts of Sarajevo that have been destroyed, share their quarters.
While adults in the basement chatted, two small girls, Maja, age 8, and Marina, 6, sat listening, occasionally giggling at Mr. Papo's jokes. Their father, Vlado Duka, a 40-year-old mechanical engineer, died of a heart attack when an artillery shell struck outside his office on Marshal Tito Street on Saturday morning, but with their mother away arranging burial, the girls have not yet been told of their his death.
For families that already pool their food and establish rosters for the hazardous journeys to a nearby mosque where water taps still flow, the care of the girls has been something else to share.

HEADLINE: Study Says Poverty Rose To 25% in New York City

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A new analysis of poverty in New York City concludes that one in four of the city's residents had incomes in 1990 that fell below the Federal Government's poverty threshold, more than at any time during the previous decade.
The report, based on data from a house-to-house survey by the Bureau of the Census, provides a grim portrait of huge numbers of New Yorkers who were left out of the city's boom from the late 1970's until 1988, and who have since been at the bottom of a deep recession. 
 It also contrasts with earlier studies, based on census data for 1989, which found that many of the city's poorest residents had benefited from its robust economy earlier in the decade and that the poverty rate had declined.
 
Children Suffer Heavily
 The new study was conducted by the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor, and found poverty rates to be highest among Hispanic and black New Yorkers. However, the report showed that poverty rates rose most sharply for whites, nearly doubling from 1979 to 1990. Most troubling, the group said, was that 40 percent of the city's children were living in poverty, roughly double the rate for children elsewhere in the nation.
The analysis was based on a survey by the Census bureau in March 1991 in which 5,297 people were interviewed, a tiny minority of New York City's 7.3 million residents. But the group said the survey, which asked questions about 1990 income, produced more reliable data than the 1990 census, in which questionnaires were mailed to a far greater number of people, but where the results were clouded by relatively low response levels in poor neighborhoods.
In a report released in April, based on its 1990 census, the Census Bureau said that the poverty rate for New York City in 1989 had been slightly under 20 percent, and about the same as 10 years earlier.
The new analysis, while relying on surveys that may have been too small to provide a precise measure of poverty, may reflect the recession, which carved most deeply into New York City employment and income levels between 1989 and 1990.
 
Severe Economic Setback
 The economic decline then "was so steep that you would expect a commensurate increase in poverty," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York Regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But the Community Service Society attributed the increase in poverty to more deeply rooted economic and social problems, including a greater number of single-parent households, illiteracy and a decline in factory employment and in low-skilled jobs.
One of those counted in poverty is Dulce Rojas, a native of the Dominican Republic who has been living in Manhattan since 1989 and who lost her job in a small computer chip assembly plant in March 1991. Now, as the unmarried mother of three children, ages 5 to 9, she is living on $388 a month in unemployment insurance and $280 a month in food stamps, or $8,016 a year.
In analyzing New York City poverty, the report estimated the proportion of people living on incomes under the Federal poverty threshold, which varies depending on family size. In 1990, it was $13,359 for families of four and $6,652 for single people without children.
By relying on the Federal threshold, the Community Service Society said, the study may understate the plight of poor New Yorkers, since housing and other necessities are more expensive in New York than in many other parts of the country.

HEADLINE: Earth Summit Races Clock to Resolve Differences on Forest Treaty

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 9

 BODY:
Earth Summit negotiators sought today to bridge their differences on forest preservation and other contentious environmental issues, but officials warned that they might not reach agreement in time for world leaders to sign them on Friday, the day they all plan to attend.
To speed up the negotiating process, summit coordinators planned to adopt streamlined parliamentary procedures on Wednesday. Celso Lafer, the Foreign Minister of Brazil, worked behind the scenes to pressure the various delegations to compromise. 
 United States officials began to sound a note of frustration and irritation at what the Bush Administration regards as unwarranted criticism by both developing nations and European countries of Washington's environmental positions. The developing countries, for example, oppose a United States-backed treaty on forest preservations as an intrusion on their autonomy.
"Certain countries are determined to sink this in an effort to embarrass the U.S.," one American official said after leaving talks on a declaration of principles for forestry use. "Every time the U.S. says something, India pops up and says the opposite."
 
An Initiative That Wasn't New
 Countering his criticism, Kamal Nath, the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests, rejected charges that India and developing nations are blocking progress toward compromises. Referring to President Bush's offer last week to increase United States aid for forest protection, Mr. Nath said, "It was neither new, nor was it an initiative."
Today, the mood among delegates ranged from gloom to patience in Rio Central, the conference center.
"This conference is revolving more around politics and economics than around protection of the environment," a Jordanian delegate said, referring to slow progress on Agenda 21, the global action plan that is to be adopted before the end of the summit.
But a few cubicles away, in a vast hall that looks like a miniature world's fair, a delegate from the Philippines, Delfin Ganapin, said that international conferences often hit lulls before the clock takes hold on negotiators.
"The delegates are willing to make all efforts, even if it means we don't sleep at night, just to finish the documents," Mr. Ganapin said.
 
Just Like Capitol Hill
 Senator Tim Wirth, Democratic of Colorado, compared the process to amending legislation in committee session on Capitol Hill. "It's just like a Senate markup," he said. "The negotiating goes until 3 A.M.
But Michael Young, deputy chief of the United States delegation, seemed to have little confidence that a consensus could be reached on a declaration of principles on forestry management, which is the centerpiece of what Mr. Bush wants to achieve.
The United States also said it was not yet prepared to sign the Rio Declaration, a statement of principles to guide nations in the pursuit of economic development while safeguarding the environment.
Mr. Young said that some provisions of the declaration were "problematic." For example, he said, it would accord all countries the "right to develop." In the past, he said, some countries have used the right to develop as an argument to justify human rights violations.
The United States also objects to language referring to occupied territories and a paragraph that puts primary responsibility for environmental degradation on industrialized countries.
Mr. Young said that Washington was keeping its options open "until we see what the total package looks like" on all issues under consideration.
In another break with the United States, the European Community adopted a joint statement setting targets and timetables for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the end of the century.
And Britain's Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Howard, formally announced today that Britain would sign a treaty to protect plant and animal species that the United States has said it will not sign.
 
U.S. Tops 'Worst' List
 Anti-American feelings remained high around the Earth Summit 48 hours before the President Bush is expected to arrive Thursday evening.
On Monday, representatives of 150 private environmental groups voted to place the United States at the top of their list of "worst" nations on environmental policy. Saudi Arabia, in second place, was criticized for attempting to remove from treaties all language referring to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Japan was criticized for presenting itself as "an ecological superpower" while "silently supporting the United States."
Terraviva, one of three English-language newspapers circulating among the 35,000 Earth Summit participants, published an editorial cartoon today depicting President Bush as a devil with horns and a forked tail. In addition, a small protest took place outside the Rio Central conference hall.

HEADLINE: U.S. at the Earth Summit: Isolated and Challenged

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 9

 BODY:
As the Earth Summit enters its final phase, Europe and Japan are showing increasing independence from the United States on environmental issues, worsening American isolation and creating a diplomatic challenge for Washington.
President Bush strained relations with industrialized countries and the third world when he rejected detailed targets in a treaty to curb global warming and refused to join a pact to preserve plant and animal life. 
 The traditional northern allies are still trying to build bridges to the increasingly beleaguered American delegation because they realize that without Washington's participation, no agreements made here can be effective. But they are constrained by the fact that they see the problem differently.
They do not agree with President Bush that the measures should be rejected or modified because they could threaten jobs. Unlike the Administration, they see safeguarding the environment as an unavoidable challenge that will strengthen their industry in the long run, not as a new and sinister threat to their way of life.
 
Forfeited U.S. Leadership
 "What we see emerging in the United States is something like 'ecologism' -- fear of a new Communism hidden behind ecology," Environment Minister Klaus Topfer of Germany told reporters here recently.
That view may be extreme. But America's lonely position at the Earth Summit does appear to represent a departure from the recent course of post-cold-war diplomacy.
While the United States has had little difficulty getting its way in other multilateral organizations, like the United Nations Security Council, since the Soviet Union broke up, it has forfeited its leadership role here, and neither Europe nor Japan are able to step in.
A powerful reason why some of America's closest allies do not share the Administration's apprehension about the economic costs of cleaning up the world is that they expect to benefit from such a commitment.
 
Japan's Reluctant Stance
 Japanese and German industries in particular have led the development of "clean" technologies, and they hope the Earth Summit plan to endorse Agenda 21, a global cleanup proposal, and to give third-world countries money to pay for it will translate into fat orders for their companies.
"Of course there are short-term costs," said the European Community spokesman, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, this morning. "But in the end energy efficiency is good for industry, not bad."
Dr. A. S. Kasenally, Environment Minister of the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, said, "It's difficult to see how America is protecting jobs by not signing a biodiversity convention that would allow its drug companies to experiment with our natural genetic resources."
Japan certainly appears to take the meeting more seriously than the United States, fielding a delegation of more than 100 officials compared with 45 American officials. But diplomats say it remains reluctant to give a clear lead that cuts across American interests.
As the world's largest market, the European Community clearly has potential clout, but it often lacks unity of purpose. Despite economic difficulties caused by unification, Germany is often closer to the neutral Scandinavian countries in its enthusiasm for green causes than Britain, Spain, and Portugal, who shy away from new financial burdens.
Western diplomats generally see the roots of the present Administration's grudging approach in the political pressure of a Presidential election campaign, an economic recession and a high budget deficit.
"The United Nations must learn never to hold an international conference during an American election year," says Thomas K. Koh, the respected Singapore diplomat who heads the main negotiating committee.
The major United States initiative, an offer of $150 million in bilateral aid to save third-world forests, backfired because most countries saw it as an attempt to distract attention from Mr. Bush's unpopular decisions.
In an effort to change that impression, Britain and Germany want the American offer accepted as a first contribution toward a new world agreement they eventually hope to negotiate on preserving forests.
The European Community and the Nordic countries also rejected as unnecessarily anti-American a plan suggested by the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria for a joint statement criticizing the global-warming convention that President Bush weakened and pledging to strengthen it.
Instead, the European Community adopted a uniform statement setting targets and timetables for reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the end of the century -- a position at odds with that of the United States.
But the 12 also offered the Bush Administration a face-saving way of signing the convention on biodiversity by agreeing to make a statement setting out their own interpretation of contentious clauses. The White House has shown no interest in going along with it.
Meanwhile, the Europeans are increasing America's isolation by trying to persuade small island states as well as India, which all face severe flooding if the climate warms, to back their call for tougher commitments on cutting warming gas emissions.
That sense of isolation may increase further when heads of state and government start addressing the meeting at the end of the week. For President Bush is unlikely to be able to pledge the third world as much help with making its future development environmentally sustainable as his counterparts from Europe and Japan.

HEADLINE: Competitors Reluctantly Match Delta's Fare Cuts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The new discounts in business fares to Europe announced by Delta Air Lines on Monday were grudgingly matched by other carriers yesterday.
One reluctant competitor grumbled, "Thanks Delta, we really needed that." 
 Wall Street greeted the news of a trans-Atlantic fare war with chagrin, sending the stocks of the major airlines tumbling on the New York Stock Exchange. Delta shares fell $1.625 each yesterday to $58.625; those of the UAL Corporation, United's parent, were off $1 each, to $117.875, and AMR, American's parent company, fell $1.25 each, to $64.625.
 
Fear of a Fare War
 Investors apparently feared a repeat of the recently completed fare war in domestic flights, where half-price tickets created frenzied demand but had an uncertain effect on profits.
"The problem with fare wars is they only last less than 24 hours, then you're back where you started from and making less money," said one airline official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
Analysts said they were puzzled that a carrier as strong as Delta would have cut by as much as 45 percent its "bread and butter" fares -- the first-class, business-class and full-coach fares that account for as much as 60 percent of revenues on the highly competetive trans-Atlantic routes.
"I have to believe the traffic wasn't where they expected it to be," said Daniel M. Kasper, an airline specialist for Harbridge House, an international management consulting firm.
 
How Carriers Responded
 American said it would match Delta's discounts on full fares to all its European destinations, while United said it would match Delta only on routes where it competed directly.
Northwest will match Delta's discounts except on the Detroit-Frankfurt route. And USAir, which flies only six trans-Atlantic routes, said it would match Delta's fares from markets outside USAir's hub cities, while offering discounts lower than Delta's from the cities in which USAir flies nonstop to Europe: Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C.
Trans World Airlines, which has been offering discount fares to Europe since last fall, said that Delta's discount fares matched T.W.A.'s, "except on New York to Paris, where our $1,400 round-trip full-coach fare is $100 less than theirs," added Donald Fleming, a T.W.A. spokesman.
The paradox of the price cuts, airline officials say, is that leisure travel to Europe this summer is expected to be stronger than at other any time in the last few years. That is because many travelers stayed away last summer in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war and because airlines put summer excursion fares to Europe on sale this spring for as much as one-third off their next-lowest advance-purchase fares.
But business fares have faltered, hurt by weak economies on both sides of the Atlantic.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND RUSSIANS FAIL TO CONCLUDE NEW ARMS ACCORD

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, failed to conclude an agreement today on how to cut the number of nuclear warheads below the levels set in the recently signed strategic arms reduction treaty.
But the two said they would keep trying in the week remaining before the next Russian-American summit meeting. 
 Speaking to reporters outside the White House at the end of two days of talks with his Russian counterpart, Mr. Baker said: "We do not have closure on the question of further reductions of nuclear weapons, although we continue to work on the issue and discuss different formulations. We will continue these discussions, hopefully over the course of the next several days."
 
Differences Narrowing
 American officials said they are waiting to hear from the Kremlin whether it might be fruitful for Mr. Baker to go there in the next several days to try to close the deal or whether they should wait until President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia comes here for the summit meeting, scheduled for June 16 and 17.
Both sides made clear that they have been narrowing their differences, and said that the prospect of an agreement at the summit meeting remains high, but cautioned that it could also take longer.
 
A General Willingness
 The two sides are trying to agree on deep cuts in nuclear warheads, roughly 50 percent lower than those just agreed to in the Start treaty. Both sides have signaled a general willingess to reduce to around 4,700 warheads each, from roughly 8,500 warheads each as set in the Start accord. But Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev said they have not been able to agree on which missiles those warheads should be removed from, the aggregate numbers that should be removed and at exactly what pace.
Asked when he thought they might close a deal, Mr. Baker answered: "I don't know. As I've said over the course of the past month or two as we have met on this issue, it's a question not just of numbers but of the mix of weapons. I hope that we can find some common ground."
Mr. Kozyrev seemed slightly embarrassed at having to stand outside the White House and tell American reporters that the Russians were resisting American demands for deep cuts in strategic arms at a time when they Moscow is asking the United States for billions of dollars in economic assistance.
American officials said the problem was that the Russian Foreign Minister had little room to maneuver because hard-liners in the Russian military and in the Kremlin were holding him back from making deep cuts in the most sophisticated and potent Russian weapons.
American officials hold Mr. Kozyrev in high regard, but believe he is being held in check in part because he has no real power base in Moscow, save for his relationship with Mr. Yeltsin.
Russian officials said the problem was that while they are prepared to cut thousands more warheads by the year 2000, as the Americans have proposed, they are not willing to give up most or all of their most modern missiles with multiple warheads, like the SS-18, as the Americans have demanded.
In their view, Washington's proposing was too lopsided, as it would undercut Russia's nuclear strength while leaving largely intact the American advantage in sea-based ballistic missiles with multiple warheads.
The mix of nuclear warheads is a complicated economic and military question. For instance, it is more expensive to base nuclear missiles on submarines than it is in fixed silos on land. Most of the missiles on American submarines carry multiple warheads. If those missiles had to be stripped from ten warheads down to one warhead, it would become far more expensive, on a per-warhead basis, to keep them on submarines. But if the United States scrapped its sumbmarine missiles it would no longer have its nuclear triad of land-, air- and sea-based missiles, the basis of its nuclear strategy for four decades.
Some critics argue that the nuclear triad is a cold-war concept and that the Administration should seize the opportunity to reduce its nuclear weapons budget, lock the Russians into deeper cuts in nuclear warheads and not worry about the mix of missiles.
Mr. Kozyrev stopped by the White House to see President Bush before leaving for Moscow today, and he went out of his way to make clear to reporters that the reluctance of the Russians to make cuts in certain of their most advanced missiles did not mean they contemplate using them one day against the United States.
"With regard to further reductions in strategic offensive arms, I want to make one thing absolutely clear: We do not need those arms and we are not going to use them against the United States," Mr. Kozyrev said.
Officials in Washington were hoping that they could quickly follow up the momentum of the Start treaty with further cuts that Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev would hammer out themselves, without having to turn to technical negotiators.
 
A Twilight Zone
 But the failure to reach an agreement on these deeper cuts also underscores the sort of twilight zone that American-Russian relations are in today, with both sides beginning to treat one another more as allies than adversaries, but neither one yet really ready to let down its guard in case the old adversarial relationship re-emerges.
Mr. Kozyrev alluded to this in his parting remarks, saying: "The real challenge here is finding out just how we dismantle this war machine that has been created over the past 40 years. It's basically the same problem that we run into in terms of our economic reform, that is, trying to overcome the Communist inheritance that we somehow have to get over in order to move forward."
"The real challenge of these negotiations here," he said, "is not to strike the right balance of mutual threats, but rather to find a technically and economically feasible way of destroying the arsenal that we already have."

HEADLINE: Former Top H.U.D. Official Is Charged With Conspiracy

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
A former Assistant Secretary in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Thomas T. Demery, was indicted today on charges of conspiracy and conflict of interest.
Mr. Demery is the the highest-ranking official to be charged so far in a two-year inquiry into influence peddling at the agency during the tenure of Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
 A Federal grand jury charged Mr. Demery with manipulating agency programs to help businesses represented by a co-defendant with whom he had a financial arrangement, Phillip McCafferty. Mr. Demery had sold his real estate business to Mr. McCafferty at what the indictment says was an artificially high price, and was paid in installments during his tenure from 1986 to 1989.
Mr. Demery, of Alexandria, Va., was charged with one count of conspiracy and four counts of using his office to further personal financial interests. Mr. McCafferty, of Orchard Lake, Mich., was charged with one count of conspiracy and four counts of aiding and abetting Mr. Demery. All are felony charges.
Arlin M. Adams, the independent counsel who is investigating accusations of mismanagement, influence-peddling and favoritism, has already charged two former executive assistants to Mr. Pierce, Deborah Gore Dean and Lance Wilson.
There is no mention of Mr. Pierce, who served as Housing Secretary under President Ronald Reagan, in today's indictment.
 
Central Figure in Scandal
 Mr. Demery has been a central figure in the scandal at the housing agency since it unfolded in 1989.
A lawyer for Mr. Demery, John Hume, issued a statement today denying any wrongdoing by his client. Mr. Hume said Mr. Demery had disclosed all his dealings with Mr. McCafferty.
Concerning the conflict of interest charges, the statement said, "Mr. Demery did not knowingly take any official action on any matters affecting his personal financial interest."
The statement also denied any artificial inflation of the value of Mr. Demery's business, asserting that its worth was affected by changes in the tax laws and the real estate market that occurred after the sale of the business to Mr. McCafferty.
Mr. McCafferty could not be reached for comment.
 
$270,000 Payment
 Today's indictment stems from Mr. Demery's sale of his Michigan real estate brokerage, Income Property Services, or I.P.S., to Mr. McCafferty in 1986. According to the indictment, Mr. McCafferty agreed to pay $270,000 in cash and other considerations over a period that included Mr. Demery's tenure as Assistant Secretary.
The value of the brokerage's assets were inflated by Mr. Demery, Mr. McCafferty and others to a price "well above I.P.S.'s fair market value," the indictment said.
Mr. McCafferty, according to the indictment, dealt with Mr. Demery and other H.U.D. officials on behalf of a company in Brighton, Mich., called PM Group Inc. The business, which had interests in or managed four housing projects in Chicago and Michigan, was seeking H.U.D. subsidies or assistance.
The indictment describes a conspiracy in which Mr. McCafferty would pay Mr. Demery through I.P.S. At the same time Mr. McCafferty was paid by the PM Group in exchange for his effort in obtaining H.U.D. subsidies and other benefits, the indictment said.
The indictment accused Mr. Demery of these manipulations to benefit PM Group:
*Mr. Demery made it easier for a PM Group affiliate to receive subsidies under the moderate rehabilitation program for a housing project in Lansing, Mich. In that case, Mr. Demery "intervened in the affairs of a H.U.D. program over which he had no authority."
*Mr. Demery "intervened in the affairs of H.U.D. field and regional offices in a manner contrary to H.U.D. policies" in connection with two apartment projects in Chicago. In addition, he directed housing agency officials to reverse themselves and approve the sale of the apartments to a PM Group affiliate.
*Mr. Demery awarded discretionary subsidies to a PM Group project in Mount Morris Township, Mich., that did not qualify for such money, the indictment says.
If convicted, Mr. Demery and Mr. McCafferty would face five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on the conspiracy charge. The other counts carry maximum penalties of two years in jail and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
 
Six Others Charged
 So far, two people have been convicted and four others have been indicted in the investigation of the housing agency during Mr. Pierce's tenure from 1981 to 1989..
DuBois L. Gilliam, an aide to Mr. Pierce, served an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy and gratuities charges in 1989.
In February, Samuel P. Singletary, a New York businessman close to Mr. Pierce, pleaded guilty to trying to evade taxes on income he received from a consulting firm that had a grant from the housing agency.
The Federal grand jury also previously indicted Victor R. Cruse, a former Connecticut housing official and business associate of Paul J. Manafort, a Republican political consultant. Mr. Cruse was charged with lying to the grand jury and obstruction of justice in connection with Mr. Manafort's alleged efforts to block a H.U.D. grant to a housing project in Georgia that he had unsuccessfully tried to buy.
Three people are awaiting trial: Mr. Wilson, who was indicted on charges of fraud, conspiracy and making false statements; Ms. Dean, who was indicted on charges of soliciting and accepting an illegal grauity and making a false statement to the Senate, and Leonard E. Briscoe, a Texas real estate developer accused filing false statements to obtain a $2.4 million H.U.D. grant.

HEADLINE: Blacks Push for Jobs Rebuilding After Riot

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 9

 BODY:
Hoping to channel the rage from the rioting into efforts to create jobs, residents of the city's poorest neighborhoods are picketing construction sites and meeting with officials to make sure they get their share of the rebuilding work.
Black groups and contractors say they believe that insurance companies and building owners will not give enough jobs to the areas hit hardest by the unrest, and so these groups are stepping up their protests at sites employing workers from other areas. 
 In some cases the pickets have successfully demanded that contractors and laborers from their area be given the jobs in starting to rebuild some of the thousands of stores and other structures damaged or destroyed by fires and looting.
The State Insurance Department met with insurance companies to press them to direct reconstruction work to minority companies, and officials from the department plan to bring together a group of the contractors and insurers on Friday to help the contractors win a greater share of rebuilding contracts.
The contractors are also keeping up pressure on officials to make sure that the money going to rebuild their neighborhoods will create jobs there. In particular, the contractors said, they want representation on the board of Rebuild L.A., the private group, led by Peter V. Ueberroth, formed to head the long-term economic development efforts for the areas affected by the riots.
 
Issue Seen as Volatile
 Government officials, insurance company executives and large contractors all say they will make special efforts to steer business to local companies and workers. But leaders of community groups and residents said they remained distrustful. And they warned that the issue had become an emotional and volatile one on the streets, where unemployed black men see the cleanup and rebuilding work as a rare job opportunity for them.
"This issue may have a long fuse, but ultimately it's going to ignite more dynamite," said Danny Bakewell, the president of the Brotherhood Crusade, a black community organization. "We don't always want to be in a position of confrontation, but we are not going to allow this community to be rebuilt without us."
With most building owners still trying to settle an estimated $775 million in insurance claims, very little reconstruction is yet under way. But as preliminary work begins, the Brotherhood Crusade and other groups said they were monitoring work sites to see who was obtaining jobs. And where the jobs appear to be going to nonblacks or to people from outside the area, they said, they will try to halt the work and demand that local contractors be hired.
In one case, a delegation from the Brotherhood Crusade appeared a week ago at a burned-out building in South-Central Los Angeles with dozens of supporters from the neighborhood and a message for the largely Hispanic crew that had been hired to clean up the site.
 
Crowd Rings Building
 "If black people can't work," the crowd chanted as it ringed the building, "then nobody can work."
The Hispanic laborers at the building at Vermont Avenue and 85th Street quickly stopped working. In a few days the white-owned contractor that had hired them, Kenco Construction of suburban Glendale, agreed to replace the Hispanic crew from El Monte, 15 miles northwest of Los Angeles, with the Superior Salvage Company, a black-owned firm from the South-Central area.
Superior Salvage, in turn, agreed to hire five unemployed people from the immediate neighborhood to do unskilled work. After receiving several hundred applications for the temporary $6-an-hour jobs, Larry Crowley, Superior Salvage's owner, said he decided to hire nine people instead of five as a show of support for the people in the neighborhood.
"Maybe by involving them, they'll really believe they will have a part in the rebuilding of the community," Mr. Crowley said on Friday after the company's first day at work on the site.
Reed T. Kennedy, the owner of Kenco, said the incident would also lead white-owned contractors operating in the area to work harder to find minority subcontractors there. "The experience is certainly going to increase our sensitivity in this area," he said.
Minority contractors said they had long had difficulty winning a fair share of business in their communities. Black-owned contractors said one big impediment to getting reconstruction business was breaking into the circle familiar to insurance companies, which often suggest the names of contractors to owners of damaged or destroyed businesses. Officials from the California Insurance Department have already met once with representatives of insurance companies, and they said they planned to meet again with them in the next several weeks to push them to do more to seek out and direct work to minority contractors.
 
Problems Are Daunting
 The insurance companies said they had heard the message. "It's our hope that the money will stay in the community as much as possible," said Dick Griebel, a spokesman for the Transamerica Insurance Group in Woodland Hills, Calif.
Still, many minority-owned companies continue to face what they say are daunting problems. Among them is being able to afford bonding insurance to protect customers if the contractor fails to complete the work. Several weeks after the riots, black-owned companies, working with local churches, formed a new trade association, United Minority Contractors, to address issues like bonding insurance and to press the business community to hire them.
"Businesses ought to be conscious enough to come here to the community to get minority contractors to rebuild because we can help address the circumstances that caused the burning in the first place," said Dasol Mashaka, a project manager at Montgomery & Sons, a black-owned contracting company in the South-Central area.
"These unemployed young men out there, they've always wanted to work, but now they really want to work and they're getting angrier and angrier," Mr. Mashaka said. "If we don't do something, pretty soon we're going to have an environment out there where it's difficult for any of us to do business."

HEADLINE: Foreign Buying Off

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The Government said today that foreign purchases of American businesses and properties plunged 66 percent last year to the lowest level since 1984. The Commerce Department said that purchases by foreigners of companies, office buildings and other real estate totaled $22.60 billion in 1991, compared with $65.93 billion in 1990. It was the third consecutive annual decline. The department said the big drop reflected the weak American and global economies, the slowdown in corporate takeovers and the fall of Japan's stock market.

HEADLINE: 2 Bolivian Executives Vie in New Arena: Politics

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia

 BODY:
They are known here simply as Max and Goni and, apart from drug kingpins, they are possibly the two richest men in Bolivia, owning two of the most successful and technologically advanced companies in this isolated Andean country.
They also happen to be the two leading presidential candidates for Bolivia's 1993 elections, and barring some startling development, either Max Fernandez or Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada is almost certain to be Bolivia's next head of state. 
Whomever the voters choose, the country will get a leader who has taken bankrupt companies or failing industries and shown that even in this tiny Latin American economy, Bolivia can be innovative and competitive in world markets. But that is about where the comparisons between the two end. In their personalities and ways of doing business, they could not be more different.
Mr. Fernandez, 50 years old, is a Bolivian mestizo, a mixture of Andean Indian races, who was born into poverty and orphaned. Lacking a high school degree, he began work as a truck driver and is now president of the country's largest private employer, the Bolivian National Brewery.
He may seem an unlikely manager and candidate: awkward in public appearances, self-conscious and shy, speaking in a Spanish heavily accented by his native Quechua tongue. But his humble origins ring well with much of Bolivia's population, which is 90 percent Indian or mestizo.
The 61-year-old Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, on the other hand, emits the confidence and refinement of his birthright as one of Bolivia's landed gentry. Leaving Bolivia when he was a year old, he grew up in Washington, Boston and Chicago.
Before he could enjoy the family riches, however, a coup put his diplomat father out of a job. The family lost everything in the great land reforms of the early 1950's. But Goni, as he is called, returned at age 21 and eventually built up the largest private mining company in Bolivia, the Mining Company of the South, also known as Comsur. He has also had a strong dose of politics, as a Cabinet minister a few years ago.
Still, he is definitely an outsider, speaking Spanish with a thick American accent.
The political season ahead is sure to be described as a battle between the "cholo," a derogatory but often endearingly used term for Bolivians of Indian descent, and the "gringo" who was reared and educated in the United States, with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago.
 
Wealth Through Mining
 When he returned to Bolivia in the mid-1950's, Mr. Sanchez de Losada was almost thoroughly Americanized. His first business venture was in film making. Then he tried his hand in aerial photography for oil exploration companies, until he settled on buying up small to medium-sized mines mostly abandoned by Bolivia's huge state mining company.
Bolivia had nationalized the country's largest tin and silver mines, where workers' hours were long, and conditions were cramped, dangerous and bleak. These conditions have not changed much in the last 30 years.
But Comsur's mines -- which extract zinc, tin, gold, silver and lead -- tend to have large and reinforced shafts, lighting throughout, good ventilation and extensive networks of tracks. Mining safety is preached by the managers serving under Mr. Sanchez de Lozada.
Perhaps just as important, Comsur is putting in a $16 million zinc mill near its Porco mine to increase production. By contrast, the Bolivian Government has invested hardly any money in its mining sector in years.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, Comsur's majority stockholder, has brought in the British mining giant RTZ Ltd. as a partner. RTZ now owns one-third of Comsur, and the companies have formed a joint partnership looking for new mines in Bolivia.
"If we find a small mine, we run it," he said. "If we find a big mine, they run it. Our speciality is running labor-intensive, narrow-vein mines."
 
Experience in Government
 Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's interests turned to politics by the late 1970's. And while he may run a mining company on the side, his most significant contribution to the Bolivian economy was from 1985 through 1988 as Minister of Planning and Coordination under President Victor Paz Estenssoro.
When the Paz Estenssoro Government came to power, inflation was running at 24,000 percent a year. The country was mired in recession and Bolivians essentially paid no taxes. With the help of the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada brought inflation down to 26 percent, balanced the budget and increased tax revenues fourteenfold. He cut tariffs that often exceeded 100 percent down to a uniform 10 percent, freed exchange controls and changed a tax system of 450 brackets to one with only seven.
Since those years, Bolivia has enjoyed one of the most stable economic periods in its history. But during his term as Planning Minister, tin prices collapsed and the Government fired half of Bolivia's mine workers, the part of the population that may help elect his chief opponent.
He acknowledges that he cannot seem to escape the image of being part of the establishment.
While few doubt where Mr. Sanchez de Lozada got his money, many wonder how Mr. Fernandez turned a prospering beer distribution company in the central Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, 300 miles southeast of La Paz, the capital, into 50 percent ownership of the country's largest brewery.
Some speculate that he has ties to drug traffickers. Others say he has dealt in the black market. For those reasons, the United States Embassy will not give him a visa to travel to the United States. But none of the accusations have stuck.
Mr. Fernandez attributes much of his success to simple currency speculation in times of hyper-inflation. He describes getting bank credits in Bolivian currency and converting them immediately into dollars. Three or six months later, after the Bolivian currency had fallen 50 to 80 percent, he was able to buy entire companies for a fraction of their original cost.
"I have a smell for these things," Mr. Fernandez said, recalling how he used currency speculation in 1985 to purchase a plastic company for $1.5 million at a cost to himself of only $20,000.
But his business acumen is not limited to currency speculation. After being asked to buy control of the failing Bolivian National Brewery in 1986 for a reported $8 million, he revived its fortunes within a year. Now it has 85 percent of the domestic market and exports its beer, notably the Pacena label, throughout Latin America and to Japan.
"He is probably the most successful businessman in Bolivia, probably much more successful than Goni," said Jorge Lazarte, a member of Bolivia's National Electoral Court, which regulates elections.
Mr. Fernandez is now building a new, highly automated brewery in Santa Cruz. And in an area of the world where thick, brown, reusable bottles remain the sole bottling method, he is building the only aluminum can factory in the southern part of Latin America. The plant will sell cans to other breweries in Bolivia and in Peru, Chile and Argentina.
Using the economic base of his brewery, Mr. Fernandez has built a political following. Not only is he the country's largest employer, effectively providing jobs for 43,000 Bolivians, but he has personally financed hundreds, possibly thousands, of small construction projects around the country, ranging from schools, parks and social halls to water tanks and soccer fields.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Down 6.3%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Consumer credit fell at its steepest rate in nearly 12 years in April, as Americans kept paying off their debts, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
The $3.8 billion contraction in credit represented a 6.3 annual rate of decrease in total credit, the third straight monthly decline and the steepest rate since a 7.4 percent rate fall in June 1980. 
 The drive to improve personal balance sheets is seen as a healthy development after the debt-ridden 1980's, but it slows the pace of recovery for an economy heavily dependent on consumer willingness to spend.
"This doesn't reflect a strong recovery nor a very confident consumer," said Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. here. "We're still seeing people concentrating on working down their debts."
Spending by consumers on goods and services accounts for about two-thirds of total economic output in the United States, so any weakening in credit influences companies' production and hiring plans.
The April fall-off in outstanding credit followed smaller declines of $990 million, at a 1.6 percent annual rate, in March and $223 million in February when credit was shrinking at an annual rate of four-tenths of a percent.
Among specific primary credit categories, loans to buy new cars dropped by $1.96 billion, or at a 9 percent annual rate in April.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Efficient Power From Fuel Gases

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Based on the principle that almost any fuel can be burned more cleanly and efficiently if first turned into a gas, engineers are developing ways to produce electricity with fuel gas made from coal, wood chips, sugar cane leftovers -- even sewage sludge.
The process employs systems known as gasifiers, which can cook organic material into a fuel for gas turbines, the most efficient electricity generators available. While utilities currently burn natural gas in their turbines, coal is more plentiful and may eventually be cheaper. 
 Indeed, gasifying coal could be economically attractive in the United States in the near future, many energy experts say. Extracting more electricity from a ton of coal, by burning it as a gas in a turbine instead of as a solid in a boiler, would make it easier to remove conventional pollutants, like sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. Possibly more important, it would also mean less carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse" gas associated with global warming.
 But energy experts predict that another approach may become even more environmentally important: gasifying a "renewable" fuel like wood. In the developing world, particularly, using wood or crop wastes in utility power plants could be a key to electrifying less-developed nations and making better use of forests than burning trees as firewood.
True, burning a tree for fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But it also opens up space for the growth of a new tree, which will absorb carbon dioxide as it grows. By contrast, digging up and burning coal -- the repository of eons of carbon accumulation -- neither encourages the formation of new coal nor recycles the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.
Irving Mintzer, coordinator of the Climate Change and Sustainable Development Program at the Stockholm Environment Institute, said turbines running on wood or other organic matter -- known generically as biomass -- "could be part of a systematic response to global warming."
 
 
Perpetual Wood Supply
 Most undeveloped countries burn wood at rates far faster than forests can be regrown. But a 30-megawatt plant, sufficient to meet the needs of about 15,000 American households and an even larger number in a less developed country, could use 27,000 acres of tree farms to supply it into perpetuity. That assumes the harvesting of an average of 5.5 tons of wood from each acre each year, and the planting of new trees.
A gasifier works by heating solid fuel with steam in the presence of a carefully regulated amount of oxygen. "Dirty" solids like coal, which is filled with impurities, or solids with a low energy density, like wood or crop wastes, can be gasified, producing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and other combustible gases.
 Utility companies in industrial nations are increasingly turning to gas turbines, sometimes paired with steam turbines that use the gas turbines' waste heat to make even more electricity. These are replacing old-fashioned generating stations that burn fuel in a boiler furnace to make steam, and then run the steam through a turbine to make mechanical power, which turns a generator.
Burning a fossil fuel like coal in a boiler, a generating station converts, at most, only 32 percent of the fuel's heat into electricity; the rest of the heat energy escapes up the stack or into a cooling tower or condenser. The best gas-turbine plants, by contrast, are 53 percent efficient.
"We see gas turbines evolving, for as far out into the future as we need to care about," said James C. Corman, general manager of advanced technologies at the power generation engineering section of General Electric's Research and Development Center here.
As a manufacturer of power-plant generating systems, G.E.'s primary interest in gasification is in a coal-fired technology that will replace the current standard -- burning pulverized coal to produce steam. G.E. estimates that between now and 2005, the worldwide market for new coal-fired power plants will exceed $300 billion, representing a combined generating capacity of 300 billion watts. The company believes a substantial portion of that capacity could be met with gasifiers instead of boilers.
With help from the United States Department of Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute and other organizations, General Electric and Texaco Inc. built a plant called Cool Water, in Daggett, Calif., in the desert northeast of Los Angeles, that ran for five years in the late 1980's. It demonstrated that coal gasification worked reliably enough to supply electricity.
But it was not designed to show it was financially feasible, and in fact, it did not prove to be. Among Cool Water's disadvantages was that the temperature of the fuel gas had to be reduced before the gas could be cleaned, increasing equipment costs and wasting some energy.
At its research and development center, however, G.E. is now running a high-temperature system that cleans up the gas while it is hot by spinning it in an artificial cyclone.
In addition to improving the energy properties of coal, gasification might turn useless agricultural waste, like the stalks of harvested cotton plants, into valuable fuel. Researchers are even considering converting the Cool Water plant to use sewage sludge.
Earlier this year, G.E. tried again, using two biomass fuels -- wood chips and then bagasse, the residue of sugar cane after the sugar juice has been squeezed out. The work was carefully reviewed by the State of Vermont, which wants to create jobs for foresters; the Agency for International Development, which is seeking technology for use in the third world; the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
In some ways, biomass fuels were superior to coal, because they have little sulfur, simplifying cleanup.

HEADLINE: Court Upholds Plan to Build Audubon Medical Research Center

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A plan to build New York City's first biomedical research complex was upheld yesterday by a state appeals court over the opposition of a coalition that contended it posed a health threat to the surrounding neighborhoods.
Initially, much of the opposition of the Save the Audubon Coalition had centered on the proposed destruction of the Audubon Theater and Ballroom, which many New Yorkers regard as a memorial to Malcolm X, who was assassinated there in 1965. 
 But the project, the Audubon Research Park, was changed to preserve the historically significant portions of the theater and ballroom, including their facades, and to create a community center and a memorial to Malcolm X. As a result, the court said the only issue for it to resolve were charges that the research center portion of the project posed a health and environmental hazard.
 
Response by Opponent
 Kenneth D. Schaeffer, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Right, which represented the coalition, said coalition members were "not happy" that the theater and ballroom would not be totally preserved, but he said he did not know if the coalition would seek to block the project on that ground. Telephone calls to several coalition members went unanswered yesterday.
In a unanimous decision, a five-member panel of the the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court for the First Department affirmed a lower court ruling that the research center did not pose a health or environmental threat. The court said that the coalition's arguments that the complex posed a health hazard were based on outdated information, adding that health and environmental agencies, including the City Health Department, had reviewed the project and found no evidence of any immediate public-health risks.
Mathew J. Cachere, another lawyer for the Constitutional Right center, said he would have to review the decision before deciding whether to request permission to appeal. Because the panel's ruling was unanimous, the coalition would have to receive the court's permission to appeal its ruling to the State Court of Appeals.
If there is no appeal, initial construction of the $27.8 six-floor Audubon Research Building could begin. It would be the first of five similar buildings that would be included in a four-block, triangular complex bounded by Audubon Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenues and West 165th and 168th Streets in Washington Heights.
The project, which would be part of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center at Broadway and 168th Street, is sponsored jointly by Columbia University, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Columbia envisions that the entire complex, which will be built at a cost more than $100 million, will eventually include more than 700,000 square feet of research space and employ more than 2,000 people.
Martin E. Gold, a lawyer for Columbia's Board of Trustees, said he was delighted with the ruling.

HEADLINE: Bank Money Market and C.D. Rates Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were off slightly for the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
Robert J. Hutchinson, managing director of consumer marketing for Chemical Bank, noted that for the last six to eight weeks, yields have been bouncing along at about the same level, with economists and analysts all saying different things about the economy. 
 "How low can rates go?," Mr. Hutchinson said, repeating a question put to him. "The Fed is the key, and it goes back to what the economy does. In the meantime, depositors continue to tough it out and are taking their cash and parking it in liquid savings and checking accounts, since yields are not attractive enough to move on."
 
Rates Off on Treasury Bills
 Rates at Monday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills fell to their lowest levels since the middle of May. The results of the weekly auction are often considered a barometer of what many banks will pay depositors in the weeks ahead.
The average rate on a three-month bill was 3.71 percent, down 4 basis points from the previous auction, and the six-month bill was down 7 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The average decline in bank money market yields was a little steeper in New York area banks than at banks outside the New York market, repeating last week's trend.
 
New York Area Rates
 On the average, money market yields at all New York area banks fell 2 basis points, to 3.39 percent, and certificates of deposit were unchanged, at 3.52 percent for three-month certificiates and 3.69 percent for six-month certificates.
Among New York area institutions, commercial banks lowered their yields on money market accounts to an average of 3.17 percent, down 2 basis points, and cut the yield on the average three-month certificate of deposit by one basis point, to 3.37 percent, but the six-month certificate was unchanged, at 3.46 percent.
New York area savings banks, meanwhile, lowered their money market account yields by an average of 2 basis points, to 3.60 percent, and their three-month and six-month certificates by a basis point to 3.68 percent and 3.91 percent, respectively.
The sharpest yield changes came from Citibank, which lowered the yield of one of its money market accounts by 10 basis points, to 3 percent, and at Anchor Savings, which increased the yield on its three-month certificate by 11 basis points, to 3.75 percent. First Nationwide moved the yield on its six-month certificate up 17 basis points, to 3.54 percent.
In a sampling of 20 large banks outside the New York market, yields were down similarly, with the average bank money market account and six-month certificate down a basis point, to 3.26 percent and 3.62 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 34.21 to End At 3,369.92

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market had a broad decline yesterday, as investors waiting for important Government economic reports scheduled for later this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.21 points, or 1 percent, to 3,369.92. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 191.2 million shares were traded. On Monday, volume was only 161.2 million shares.
 
Little Desire to Buy
 With little news to move the market, traders blamed a lack of buying interest rather than heavy selling pressure for yesterday's losses. 
 "There has not been really strong buying interest for the last week or so," said Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer & Company.
Investors were cautious in anticipation of the data on retail sales and producer prices for May, which are to be released tomorrow and the report on consumer prices for May, which is scheduled on Friday.
The data are expected to influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, possibly leading to another cut in short-term rates, which would help stock prices. The Fed is under pressure to cut rates after figures showed last week that May unemployment rose to 7.5 percent, the highest level in eight years.
Inflation concerns, however, have come back into the market in recent days, caused by a weak dollar as well as rising prices of grains and industrial materials, said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at the First Albany Corporation.
And if the economic data confirm that sentiment, Mr. Johnson said, the Fed certainly would not cut rates and might even begin to raise them.
"That might raise questions about the length and durability of the economic recovery," he added.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.21 points, to 573.80. The New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 1.76, to 225.95, and the American Stock Exchange composite tumbled 3.37, to 393.06.
 
Airlines Off Sharply
 Airline stocks were lower after Delta Air Lines led a round of price cuts on Monday. Delta fell 1 5/8, to 58 5/8; AMR, parent of American Airlines, tumbled 1 1/4, to 64 5/8, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, declined 1, to 117 7/8.
The blue-chip issues were mostly lower. Coca-Cola fell 1/4, to 43 1/8; I.B.M.3/8, to 90 5/8; McDonald's 5/8, to 45 7/8, and Philip Morris 1 3/8, to 74 1/8.
The most active Big Board issue was Abbott Laboratories, unchanged at 27 3/4. The company said on Monday that it would take a charge against second-quarter earnings to cover costs associated with taking a new antibiotic off the market.
Among other actively traded issues were Telefonos de Mexico, down 5/8, to 54 1/4; Bristol-Myers Squibb, which issued disappointing earnings news last week, down 1/4, to 64 1/2, and Chrysler, up 1/4, to 20 3/4.
International Paper fell 2 3/8, to 64 7/8, after an analyst's report reduced earnings estimates for the company and several other packaging-related concerns.
In over-the-counter activity, Wetterau rose 6 3/8, to 30 3/8, after Super Valu Stores said it would buy the supermarket chain. Hutchinson Technology fell 4 1/2, to 15 3/4, after the company said third-quarter earnings would be lower.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Super Valu Is Buying Wetterau for $1.1 Billion

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Super Valu Inc. agreed yesterday to acquire Wetterau Inc. in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. The move will make Super Valu the nation's largest food wholesaler.
The acquisition will extend Super Valu's reach from its strong base in the Midwest into the Southeast and New England. 
 But some analysts expressed concern yesterday that the company was committing itself even further to the slow-growing distribution business. Some analysts are pessimistic about the long-term outlook for the food-distribution business.
"They are committing themselves more and more to a business that has limited potential," said Gary Vineberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Should you invest in a mature and shrinking business?"
 
Super Valu Stands Firm
 But Michael W. Wright, Super Valu's chairman and chief executive, said, "We continue to say that wholesale distribution is an outstanding business."
Still, Super Valu has become increasingly interested in the faster-growing grocery retailing business recently, and is opening its Cub Foods warehouse stores at a rapid clip.
Although Super Valu is already huge, with $10.6 billion in sales last year, the addition of Wetterau, whose sales totaled $5.7 billion last year, will give Super Valu added clout.
"They had muscle before; they have even more muscle now," said Clare Zempel, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
 
More Power Seen
 Many supermarket executives feel that wholesale clubs and the huge mass merchants, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Kmart Corporation, get special prices deals not available to grocers. With its added girth, analysts said Super Valu could be more aggressive in making demands on its suppliers.
"They can wield more power with the manufacturers in terms of pricing and other perquisites," said Craig Carver, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis.
Under the terms of the deal, Wetterau's shareholders will receive $30.20 a share in cash, plus shares in a Wetterau chain of stores to be sold before Wetterau is acquired by Super Valu. The deal is expected to be competed by September.
The acquisition continues the consolidation in the food-distribution business. Mr. Zempel said there are 100 food wholesalers currently, down from 200 a decade ago.
 
Pressure All Around
 Food retailers are facing pressure on several fronts. Much of the growth in the past came from acquisitions, and fewer are being made. Also, the flat birth rate is not helping the grocery business.
And, Wal-Mart and Kmart are hungrily eyeing the grocery business. Both excel in distribution, supplying their stores out of central warehouses and bypassing middlemen.
The wholesalers have also been hurt by a lack of inflation in food prices, which has made it hard for the companies to grow by passing on price increases. After the deal was announced yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it had placed Super Valu's long-term debt under review for a possible downgrade. The ratings agency said the review would focus on the "negative trends affecting the industry."
Moody's added, "Food price deflation, weak consumer spending and heightened competition at the retail level have created greater operating risk for the food wholesale distribution industry."
Food wholesalers act as the middlemen between food companies and independent grocery stores.
 
Both Stocks Rise
 The shares of Super Valu, which is based in Minneapolis, rose 12.5 cents each yesterday, to $25.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Wetterau, based in Hazelwood, Mo., jumped $6.75 each, to $30.375, in over-the-counter trading.
The deal, which requires the approval of the Federal Trade Commission, will take place in several steps. At first, 70 percent of Wetterau's retail chain, Shop 'n Save, will be spun off to Wetterau shareholders. Super Valu will then acquire the remaining operations of Wetterau, which will become a Super Valu subsidiary.
Both companies have small but fast-growing retail operations. Super Valu has been rapidly expanding its Cub Food stores, warehouse-style supermarkets, that do up to $50 million a year in sales at each location.
Mr. Zempel, the Baird analyst, said Super Valu might expand its Cub Foods into Wetterau territories.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher, as Traders Focus on Fluctuating Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday, but most traders were focused on the fluctuating German mark.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $338.30 a troy ounce, up 10 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 10 cents an ounce in late trading, to a bid price of $337.80. 
 Analysts said the dollar came under pressure early in the session as the German mark firmed. But as the day wore on, the mark weakened, and the dollar benefited.
"It was kind of a cross-driven day," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V., referring to the heavy activity centered on the mark and other European currencies.
 
Impact of Maastricht Treaty
 The mark has drawn strength from last week's rejection by Denmark of the Maastricht treaty for European political and economic union. Germany is perceived to have the best chance for independent economic survival, should attempts to unify Europe fail.
But the mark fell back yesterday on profit taking and confusion about what would happen following Denmark's action, Mr. McCarthy said.
Yield differentials continue to favor the mark, however, since German interest rates are higher than those in the United States. For that reason, the dollar is expected to remain under pressure, Mr. McCarthy said.
"That's not going to change until German rates go down or U.S. rates move up on evidence of further economic activity," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.23 yen, up 0.03 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.55 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.50 yen, up from 127.15 yen on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5915 German marks, up from 1.5875; 1.4550 Swiss francs, up from 1.4490; 5.3550 French francs, up from 5.3495; 1,204.00 Italian lire, up from 1,201.00, and 1.1924 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1942.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $338.15 an ounce, from $338.75 late Monday. In Zurich, where the market was closed Monday for a holiday, gold closed yesterday at a bid of $337.65 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Networks Cutting Back On Foreign Coverage

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Even with war raging in Yugoslavia, the network evening newscasts have covered less foreign news in 1992 than in any of the three previous years. But network-news executives dispute any connection between the drop-off and the financial cutbacks that have forced the closings of some foreign bureaus in recent years.
Instead, they point to other factors for the reduced foreign coverage, and the less attention devoted to the fighting in Yugoslavia than what would probably have been given in previous years. 
 Among the factors cutting into foreign news coverage, the network executives say, are the greatly increased attention paid during this unconventional Presidential campaign; the election-year shift of priorities by the White House to domestic concerns from international ones; a general heightened interest in national issues, and, in the case of Yugoslavia, the difficulty of explaining a complicated conflict to viewers who lack a vested interest in the outcome.
The Tyndall Report, a newsletter published every two months that counts total minutes of network-news coverage, says total minutes devoted to foreign coverage at each network has been down from figures for 1991.
 
'Fewer Long Pieces'
 Of course, the United States was in a foreign war in 1991, and a tally of total minutes does not take into account the quality or depth of coverage. But Dan Rather, the anchor of the CBS "Evening News," conceded in an interview: "We do fewer long pieces about foreign news than we did seven, eight years ago. That's true for all three networks."
CNN, which is often included in news coverage comparisons, clearly has so different a format from other newscasts, with reports 24 hours a day, aimed at both an international and national audience, that a meaningful comparison with the reports on CBS, ABC and NBC is not possible.
Mr. Rather also suggested that tighter economic constraints imposed on the news divisions by corporate managers in recent years "force us to justify everything we do with foreign coverage before we do it."
Robert Murphy, the vice president for news coverage at ABC, said justifying expenses was a valuable journalistic exercise. "I feel very passionate about this notion of how cost consciousness has affected us," he said. "It's not a contradiction that a good journalistic operation is also a good business operation."
 
Time Given to Candidates
 Executives of the three networks said this year's Presidential campaign, especially with a strong third-party candidacy, has eaten into the time available for foreign coverage on the newscasts. "The domestic political agenda is so crowded this year," said Peter Jennings, the anchor for ABC's "World News Tonight." "All foreign news suffers in that respect."
And Tom Brokaw, the NBC "Nightly News" anchor, said yesterday that after several years of intense interest in the Persian Gulf war and the breakup of the Soviet Union, "the whole nation started turning inward, with the main concerns being about what's going on inside our own borders."
Andrew Tyndall, who publishes the Tyndall Report, said the shift to domestic pieces is part of a traditional election-year pattern of networks. He added that the amount of foreign coverage is also affected by the tendency of a President up for re-election to avoid getting enmeshed in foreign affairs.
The war in Yugoslavia has recently received more extensive coverage on the newscasts after a period of irregular, and according to some network executives, inadequate coverage.
One senior network producer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Yugoslavia coverage has been driven by pictures of violence, reflecting a return to an old-style news philosophy. "Everybody seems to want to go for the blood," he said."It's back to, 'Cut me a minute of bang-bang.' But nobody wants to go into the issues behind the bangs."
 
'Peaks and Valleys'
 Still, correspondents for all three networks have reported from Yugoslavia at various points this year, leading to what the CBS foreign editor, Allen Alter, called "peaks and valleys" in the coverage.
Mr. Rather said the Yugoslavia coverage had been affected by the fact that "it's hellaciously expensive, and hellaciously dangerous." He added, "And you always have to deal with that old adage, It's a long way from Broadway."
He said the reluctance to go heavily after a foreign event initially because it would not seem relevant to Americans had a Catch-22 aspect: many events have to be seen before they capture the interest of American viewers. The example he cited was the Tiananmen Square confrontation in China, which garnered so much attention because American television was there to document it.
Mr. Jennings said a large part of the problem with coverage in Yugoslavia was simply the density of the situation. "Early on, no journalist understood what was happening in Yugoslavia well, and you can't get the public to understand if the journalists don't understand," Mr. Jennings said.
Another aspect of foreign coverage that has changed dramatically in recent years is the willingness of the networks to send their anchors to the sites of big events. Both Mr. Jennings and Mr. Brokaw said this week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero, with President Bush attending, is the kind of event they would have covered as recently as a year ago.
"Part of the reason I'm not going is surely economic," Mr. Brokaw said, "but we are rethinking our whole approach to how we cover stories like this."
One senior network executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his network had saved about $70,000 a day by covering a recent foreign piece with a correspondent on the scene instead of sending an anchor.

Writers Protest
Forget Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and his multi-million-dollar book advance and forget Barbara Taylor Bradford and her multi-million-dollar book contract and Stephen King and his multi-million-dollar book contract.
The average writer in America earns less than $9,000 a year for writing, representatives of several writers organizations say, and is ignored and abused by publishers.
To draw attention to what they described as the plight of B-list authors -- and even, sometimes, A-list authors who have less star quality -- several groups representing writers declared yesterday "Writers Rights Day" and staged a two-hour protest at Grand Central Terminal, where they signed a Declaration of Writers' Economic Rights and urged writers to band together to defend themselves.
"You read in the papers about the multi-million-dollar book deals that a handful of writers are fortunate enough to get," Erica Jong, the president of the Authors Guild, told about 200 people at the former Incoming Train Room at the station. "You don't read about the canceled contracts, the writers sued to pay advances back with interest, the writers who worked 4 years or 7 years or 10 years only to have it orphaned when some fancy new Japanese or German conglomerate bought the publishing house and fired the editors who were the authors' only contact."
The protest brought together several writers' groups that had steadfastly disagreed on how best to help authors. Among the groups participating here and in similar events around the country were the Authors Guild, the National Writers Union, the Published Authors Network, the Romance Writers of America and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't have gotten all these groups together," said Susan Cheever, the author. "But the economic situation has become so bad that writers have no other choice but to work together for better working conditions."
Protest organizers compared their efforts to the organizing of the Screen Writers Guild in the 1940's, saying they hoped that one day publishers, among other things, would contribute to health insurance and pension funds for authors, the way movie studios must now do for screen writers.
The National Writers Union addressed one of the chief complaints of its 3,200 members -- the difficulty in getting health insurance -- by becoming an affiliate of the United Auto Workers last year.
The groups also want to establish minimum standards for writers' contracts, including higher and more timely payments, making publishers assume or share the cost of libel insurance and giving writers a fair amount of time to return advances on canceled projects.
"We have a lot of work to do among writers, building their consciousness and convincing them that together we have power that we don't have individually," said Barbara Raskin, the novelist. "Many writers are afraid of alienating publishers and won't stand up for themselves."
Several of the writers who participated in yesterday's protest said they wondered, "Why Grand Central Terminal?" Then they learned that while the station cost $2,000, space in other buildings they considered more appropriate to their cause, like the New York Public Library, would have cost at least five times as much.
"We thought it was unusual," said Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers Union. "But mostly it was cheap. You see writers are frequently driven by economic imperative."
 
New Paperback Chief
 Clare Ferraro has been editor in chief of Ballantine for about three weeks, and she said she has already learned one very important thing about the business of mass-market paperbacks: it's not good enough these days to buy a best seller, shrink it, put on a paper cover and send it off into bookstores for a guaranteed paperback success.
"The days of sending out a book and just assuming it will stick are over," said Ms. Ferraro, who was been senior vice president and associate publisher of Ballantine/Del Rey,/ Fawcett/Ivy before being named to replace Robert Wyatt as the head of Ballantine.
"It's always been true that you have to know the market you're trying to reach," she said. "But now more than ever, if you don't communicate through packaging and promotion what you are selling and if you don't find out whether what you're selling is what the public wants to read, then you are in big trouble."
The authors she inherited at Ballantine are an impressive lot, including Michael Crichton, Norman Mailer, Martha Grimes, John Irving, Marilyn French and John Hassler. She also inherited a bit of an awkward situation, with her predecessor resigning abruptly one day, saying he was unhappy at the publishing house. All those authors and the editors and publicity people and office staff members now have to be reassured that Ballantine is secure and that Mr. Wyatt's displeasures will not undermine business.
Although she has been at Ballantine since 1979, she has always worked on the business side, not the editorial side. Still, she said, making such a transition within a familiar house is easier than making such a leap to someplace new. "At least," she said, "I know who to ask when I don't know where to go."
 
Royal Expose
 Imagine you are an American publisher who has recently paid more than $4 million to an author to write an expose of the British royal family that is to be published around 1995 and suddenly several hot new British books are elbowing each other to reveal intimate details about the Princess of Wales. "Our book looks even better to me," said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books, which signed Kitty Kelley to the royal project. "As a former editor said to me, 'Everything's been done before; the secret is how well you do it this time around.' Besides, we figure that we have Kitty Kelley and, frankly, she's the star of this book, not Princess Di. Her name goes on top, not the royal family." . . . Oh, the places Dr. Seuss continues to go! With graduations at hand, Dr. Seuss's "Oh, the Places You'll Go" (Random House, $12.95) has hit the No. 1 spot on the New York Times hard-cover best-seller list for the third year in a row. All told, it has been on the list for 112 weeks and has sold more than 1.5 million copies . . . Rutledge Hill Press has a most unusual distinction on the Times lists for June 21: Its "Life's Little Instruction Book" is No. 1 in the Advice, How to and Miscellaneous category in both hard cover and paperback.

The War Against Women
By Marilyn French
223 pages. Summit Books. $20.
 
Looking for the Light
The Hidden Life and Art of Marion Post Wolcott
By Paul Hendrickson
Illustrated. 297 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $35. 
 "The War Against Women," by Marilyn French, is a terrifying essay combining newspaper tales about incest, rape, battered women, mutilation and other horrors with the long history of cultural and institutional abuse. Even after several decades of heightened feminist awareness and some changes by law, Ms. French asserts, the battle between the sexes is still alive and not going well for women.
Her essay, which at times reads like a field report from the Seventh Circle of Hell, is divided into four parts: the subjugation of women by tradition, religion and the state; institutional discrimination that keeps women from economic self-sufficiency, gaining a political voice and controlling their own bodies; hatred of women as expressed in culture, language and the arts, and physical assaults on women in daily and domestic life.
Ms. French is on solid ground when she writes: "The United States has one of the highest, if not the highest, rates of rape in the world, counting only those that are reported. The National Crime Survey, conducted annually by the Census Bureau, found twice as many actual rapes as were reported to the police."
Yet by mainly relying on cold figures and exceptional criminal acts, Ms. French condemns men in general. Her "War Against Women" doesn't seem aware that there are caring fathers who believe in personal, social and economic equality for their daughters as well as sons; that many men strongly support abortion rights and feminist independence on every level of life, and that some women in former bastions of male power aren't always helpful to their less fortunate sisters. In short, they behave just like men.
Discussing the "systemic discrimination against women," Ms. French properly points out that only 2 women currently sit in the 100-member United States Senate. She states that when Margaret Thatcher was Britain's Prime Minister, journalists impugned her sexuality and criticized her dress and manner. "Yet she was the most extraordinary world leader of her time!" Ms. French surprisingly adds. Stacking the deck, she overlooks Mrs. Thatcher's military adventurism and the austerity measures that led to high unemployment (for women, too), rejection by her own Conservative Party and her resignation.
"The War Against Women" is impressive when the author documents her views with information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other authoritative sources. "In the United States, women hold less than one-half of 1 percent of jobs in the highest echelons of corporate managers and only 3 percent of the top five jobs below C.E.O. at all Fortune 1000 companies," she writes. "In societies that value primarily money and power, the value of a group is shown by its financial reward."
Ms. French is a novelist ("The Women's Room") and essayist ("Beyond Power: Women, Men and Morals") but, above all, she's a polemicist. As a scholar rather than a popular journalist, she's less personal, heavier going and much angrier than two current writers, Susan Faludi ("Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women") and Gloria Steinem ("Revolution From Within: A Book of Self-Esteem"). Although not all her conclusions hit their mark, "The War Against Women" is a challenging essay that justifies the feminist revival.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Freedom is, or ought to be, genderless; above all, freedom means personal choice: the right to be an individualist, even to do the wrong thing, by conventional standards. In "Looking for the Light," an unusual biography of a working woman of great talent who reversed course and abandoned her career for marriage and a family, Paul Hendrickson writes about Marion Post Wolcott's life as a young photographer in the fabled Farm Security Administration.
In 1938 she joined the group of government photographers -- including Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Carl Mydans and Ben Shahn -- who created a poignant human record of Depression America. Then in 1941, when she was 31, Marion Post left the agency and married Leon Wolcott, a high-ranking official in the Department of Agriculture. He was a widower with two children; they also had two children of their own. Their long marriage ended with her death in 1990.
The 77 black-and-white photographs in the book tell her story best; they're the most impressive part of the biography. Mr. Hendrickson, a staff writer for The Washington Post, keeps intruding to describe his discoveries and interviews with the Wolcotts, a narrative method that conflicts with his subject. It doesn't help that "Looking for the Light" lacks an index. Fortunately, Marion Post Wolcott's own picture captions have been retained and reveal her character and liberal instincts.
One of her photographs shows a group of men standing around a car in Ducktown, Tenn., in 1939. The caption reads, "Waiting for strikebreakers (scabs) to come out of the copper mines." Another picture, taken near Belle Glade, Fla., in 1939 is labeled, "Lineup of migrant vegetable pickers getting paid off in field." A caption quotes a migrant family from Missouri in Belle Glade in 1939: "We ain't never lived like hogs before, but we sure does now."
In the era when Marion Post Wolcott took pictures with her Speed Graphic, working women were still oddities -- "girls" -- as exemplified by the headline on an article about her, which read: "Girl Photographer For F.S.A. Travels 50,000 Miles in Search for Pictures." After a half-century, going from Girl to Ms. is a small, symbolic measure of progress.

HEADLINE: Browns Looking at Bavaro

 BODY:
Mark Bavaro has satisfied the Cleveland Browns he can play football again; the Browns will decide today if it is at the level they want.
Bavaro, the former Pro Bowl tight end for the Giants, was technically "waived injured" by New York last year, having failed to recover from surgery to replace a disintegrating bone in his knee. But several months ago, he called Bill Belichick, the former Giants' defensive coordinator and now the Browns' head coach, for a tryout. Essentially, he passed the physical. 
 "I want to get a complete report Wednesday morning," the Browns' owner, Art Modell, said yesterday by telephone. "I want to present a hypothesis and see what the medical people make of it."
And what would this entail?
Said Modell: "Economic considerations. Whether he could be a role player. Nobody expects him to do two-a-day workouts. There's no question he's hurting pretty good. And the last thing I want to do is embarrass my friend Wellington Mara."
Mara, the Giants' co-owner, arranged Bavaro's departure so that he could earn a year's pay even though he was unable to play. Last season, Bavaro, who is 29 years old, coached at his former high school outside Boston.
"This is a shot," said Modell. "A long shot. Bill obviously thinks he can play, and you're talking about a man of his character and competitive integrity."

HEADLINE: No Smoke, No Mirrors, No Deficit?;
Bush Leads the Way

BYLINE: By Ronald Reagan

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Here I go again. . . .
Ten years ago, in a speech on the Capitol steps, I urged Congress to adopt a balanced-budget amendment. I reminded Congress of a warning by Thomas Jefferson: "The public debt is the greatest of dangers to be feared." Since then, Congress has refused to work with the President and pass the amendment and has shown little restraint in spending. 
 While pundits will want to blame the White House for deficits, the blame game won't work. Congress alone has responsibility and authority for passing budgets, and Congress alone can balance them. No finger-pointing will change that. As the debt soars toward $4 trillion, not surprisingly Congress suffers from its lowest approval ratings in decades.
But this year, Congress has a chance to restore public faith in our Government. Today it is debating a balanced-budget amendment more seriously than ever before. Several versions compete for approval but each requires these basics: The President must submit a balanced budget; Congress must pass a balanced budget; at year's end, spending cannot outrun revenues, and Congress can engage in deficit spending only if both chambers vote to do so.
The best proposals add something more: a requirement that Congress approve increases in spending and taxation by "super-majority" votes -- 60 percent of each house. The super-majority requirement insures that Congress treats your money with the same respect that you do.
An amendment as proposed by President Bush will do more than obliterate deficits. It also will encourage wise social and economic policies. The system does not punish members of Congress when they waste taxpayers' money. It often rewards big spenders with political-action committee contributions and new terms of office.
A sound balanced-budget amendment reverses this trend by restraining spending and taxation. It's important to understand that tax increases don't balance budgets. In recent years, Congress raised taxes dozens of times. In each case, Congressional spending outpaced the tax increase, and the deficit grew.
Today, each new dollar in revenue inspires Congress to spend an additional $1.59. The way Congress loves to spend money reminds me of a T-shirt I saw that said: "How can I be out of money? I still have some checks left!" A balanced-budget amendment also ought to support growth. If we balance the budget by taking every last dime that workers earn, we haven't accomplished a thing. In the post-cold-war world, the U.S. must remain competitive, strong and vigorous. We must not heap taxes, massive Government borrowing and burdensome regulations on workers and entrepreneurs.
The need to restrain Government gets more urgent every day. Total government spending (Federal, state and local) consumes more than one in every three dollars produced by the economy. Congress has balanced only five budgets since 1950, the last in 1969.
If present trends continue, total debt will exceed our gross domestic product within the next 20 to 25 years. In other words, the Government will owe more money than the economy generates. To put it in perspective, every child in America arrives on this earth owing $16,000 for the Government's profligacy.
Worse, mandatory spending -- entitlement and other programs that grow without Congressional review or approval -- consume almost two-thirds of today's Federal budget. In addition, Congress increasingly imposes new burdens on state and local government without providing the money to finance them. That's unfair and irresponsible, and President Bush wisely has vowed to veto measures that include such mandates.
We cannot possibly balance the budget unless we show the courage to bring these programs under control. It doesn't require Draconian action. If we simply limit the growth in spending per beneficiary to the rate of inflation, we save tens of billions of dollars.
But Congress has not risen to this challenge. Even though the amendment is popular with Americans, Congress has refused to pass it. Congress has also refused to give the President the line-item veto most governors have. Even when Congress adopted budget discipline under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, it dropped the restraints at the first opportunity. Some in Congress also want to abandon the restraints of the 1990 Budget Act, just as they begin to take full effect.
A balanced-budget amendment provides the discipline that members of Congress say they want and need. George Washington said in his Farewell Address, "The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government." Today, we have a historic opportunity to approve an amendment that restrains spending and liberates the taxpayer. We can take a bold step toward a dynamic society where government is truly the servant of the people.

HEADLINE: Listen, Suburbs, the Cities Aren't Going Away;
The Ones Left Behind

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is at least one area where the problems of South-Central Los Angeles and other ghettos can be traced back to the 1960's. Affirmative action programs for blacks came out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and after 1972 produced greater income inequality among both minorities and women.
The "talented tenth," a concept celebrated by W. E. B. Du Bois, have prospered as a result of affirmative action. Colin Powell, Jesse Jackson, Gov. Douglas Wilder and most of those testifying at the Senate hearings before the appointment of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas all demonstrate the effectiveness of affirmative action programs for superior African-Americans. 
 Unfortunately, there is another side of this coin -- the worsening of the conditions of those remaining in the inner city left by the growing black bourgeoisie who have racially integrated many suburbs in the last two decades.
Ironically, many of these new products of affirmative action have become critics of this institution, especially Justice Thomas and perhaps even Anita Hill and others, who were also subjected to Law and Economics courses in their law schools, where the principles of the laissez-faire Chicago School are propagated.
At the same time that the talented tenth have been prospering, those African-Americans in the bottom half have been struggling to rise under conditions of increased slack in the labor markets. Not only Republican Administrations but also the Democrats (to a somewhat lesser extent) have assumed that the inflation problem can only be remedied by increasing the rate of unemployment.
Whether it is labeled cooling off an overheated economy (by bankers) or employing the Phillips curve (by Democratic demand-managers), the result is the same -- more secular slack in the system and greater discrimination against poor minorities.
What is called for is not a reversal of affirmative action, at least not before we get back to genuine full employment. Rather we should remember the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1977, which defined full employment at 4 percent unemployment. Even during the long Reagan expansion, unemployment never fell below 5 percent. If the figures were adjusted for age, to make the rate comparable with the 1977 unemployment rate, it was closer to 6 percent.
Humphrey-Hawkins required the Council of Economic Advisers to estimate yearly when 4 percent unemployment might be achieved. This the council did for several years in its annual report, a practice it seems to have abandoned.

HEADLINE: Aid With Strings on It Helps Us, Not Them

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "American Exports to Poor Countries Are Rapidly Rising" (front page, May 10): You do not mention the Agency for International Development policy that requires development aid recipients to spend most of the money in the United States.
According to Nicaragua Through Our Eyes (Volume 6, No. 4, December 1991-January 1992), the newsletter of the Committee of U.S. Citizens Living in Nicaragua, the Nicaragua Electric Company contracted for ceramic insulators with a workshop operated by disabled Nicaraguan veterans. After 16 months of developing the manufacturing technique and a few months of production, the workshop saw its contract canceled. The utility explained that it had received A.I.D. funds and had to buy insulators made in the United States. 
 The veterans were thrown out of work, the Nicaraguan productive capacity was diminished a notch, and Nicaraguan dependence on the United States increased. The main beneficiary seems to be the U.S. insulator maker.

Norwood Is Waived by Bills

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
SCOTT NORWOOD went the full gamut from hero to goat to unemployed as the Buffalo Bills announced yesterday they had waived the place-kicker who is the team's career leading scorer.
Norwood, whose clutch kicking helped establish the Bills as an American Football Conference power in the late 1980's, will be best remembered, however, for missing the would-be winning field goal in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. 
 Norwood, who scored 670 points in his career at Buffalo, realized his time was up when the Bills signed the former Tampa Bay kicker STEVE CHRISTIE to a lucrative contract early in this year's Plan B free-agent signing period.
"We've signed Steve Christie and we knew quite a bit about him before we signed him," Coach MARV LEVY said.
In his seven-year career -- all with the Bills -- Norwood hit 72 percent of his field goals and 97 percent of his extra-point attempts. But his field-goal percentage dropped steadily from 86 percent in 1988 to 62 percent last year.

HEADLINE: Penn State Got the Exclusive $14 Million, 10-Year Deal With Pepsi! Uh-huh!

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
For less than a dollar -- the price of a can of Pepsi -- nearly 70,000 students at 21 of Penn State University's campuses will soon be able to get a quick lesson in economics, social policy, ethics and marketing. Oh, and English, too.
Uh-huh! 
 Any time they try to slake their thirsts at a soda machine or in a campus cafeteria, Penn State students will find Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Slice, but not a Coca-Cola anywhere, because of an unusual $14 million, 10-year contract that makes Pepsi-Cola the official beverage of Penn State.
 
Big Beverage on Campus
 Pepsi has been given exclusive rights to stock its products in all soda vending machines, supply all soda fountains, advertise exclusively on the giant scoreboard at the 94,000-seat Beaver Stadium, fill all the soda cups at Joe Paterno's games -- and to plaster its new slogan "You Got the Right One Baby! Uh-huh!" in corners of the 21 campuses where it is likely to make professors of English grimace.
University officials see the deal as a creative solution in these penny-pinching days when most major universities are scrambling to find new money. Pepsi's contract will provide at least $8 million for Penn State to spend on scholarships and buildings, money it did not have before from existing contracts.
While most universities sign contracts with major suppliers, the Penn State deal is unusual in its comprehensiveness and exclusivity. But many people, including some Penn State professors, find the commercial arrangement, well, distasteful.
"My initial reaction was, "I like Coke," said Michael Barton, an associate professor of social science and American studies at the university's Harrisburg campus. "That was my gut feeling, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that if Pepsi's arrived, can McDonald's be far behind?"
Others believe that desperate times require desperate measures.
"We're in a tough period right now," said Robert Secor, a professor of English and chairman of the English department on Penn State's main campus at University Park. "There is some concern about commercializing the enterprise, but at the same time there is a desire to find funding where it can legitimately be found."
Officials at several national higher education associations said they had never heard of a contract that was as all-encompassing as the one between Pepsi and Penn State, combining as it does three areas usually dealt with in separate contracts: athletic sponsorship, vending machines and fountain sales.
The big winner so far seems to be Pepsi-Cola, which was able to get its arch-rival Coca-Cola practically banished from the Penn State system until the year 2002.
When the contract was announced in May at University Park a Pepsi official, Andy Cross, crowed, "From all of us at Pepsi to all of you thirsty people at Penn State: You've got the right one baby, uh-huh."
A Coca-Cola spokesman said that Coke has been sold at Penn State for 25 years and that the company would have liked to get the new contract, but was outbid by Pepsi. Still, the Coca-Cola Company says Coke is available at 80 percent of the college campuses in the United States and that it outsells Pepsi in the college crowd by 2 to 1.
The contract came about innocently enough, in the course of Penn State's effort to raise money for a new 16,500-seat arena. University officials tried to get Pepsi interested in advertising at the arena, which is scheduled to open in late 1994 or early 1995.
"What started out as a fairly simple arrangement," said Roger Williams, assistant vice president for university relations at Penn State, "grew into a larger and more unique sort of business package."
When the new center opens, Pepsi will be the only advertiser on the main scoreboard. When Penn State plays its first home football game next season on Sept. 19 against Temple, Pepsi will have sole possession of the scoreboard, having blocked the current advertisers, Mellon Bank and Quaker State.
All soda sold during the football games will be made by Pepsi. Television and radio advertising for beverages will be Pepsi brands. The cups used for the soda will probably be printed with a still-to-be designed Penn State-Pepsi logo.
The cafeterias on all 21 campuses will eventually dispense only Pepsi and Pepsi products. The plastic boards on which menus are listed, the plastic tops of fountain spigots and spot advertising throughout the cafeterias will all reflect Pepsi's red, white and blue, a chilling prospect for some.
"The commercialism I find disgusting, and it seems dangerous in the direction it's going," said Joseph C. Flay, a professor of philosophy at the University Park campus.
It's not the prospect of being unable to buy a Coke on campus until the next century that bothers Professor Flay (he is, he admits, a Pepsi man). It is the implication that the university's good name is available to the highest bidder, and that the deal that brings in enough money is now acceptable.
"Individual groups or institutions take desperate steps at certain points in crises," Professor Flay said. "This seems to me to be a desperate step, and I don't think it bodes well."
University officials do not see the Pepsi deal that way at all. They say that Penn State, and indeed most American colleges and universities, already have close relations with many corporate sponsors, and in many instances the money reaches much deeper into the classroom than does the Pepsi contract. For example, Penn State has a major endowment grant to support research into the genetics of the cocoa bean, with the money provided by Hershey Foods.
And with budgets so tight, many university officials see it as their duty to find other ways to raise money.
 
'A Win-Win Situation
 John A. Brighton, executive vice president and provost of Penn State, said the Pennsylvania Legislature had slashed the university's $250 million annual budget 3.5 percent this year and had threatened a similar 3.5 percent cut next year.
He said he did not see anything ominous about the exclusive contract or the degree to which Pepsi and Penn State will be linked.
"I can't really see that we're going to go any further with something like this," he said. "It seems like a one-time opportunity for both sides to take advantage of a win-win situation."
And for those who drink Coke? "It's strictly B.Y.O.," said Mr. Barton, the associate professor at the the Harrisburg campus. "Unless they plan to search you at the door."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Retreat in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Participants in the credit markets meandered through another quiet session yesterday, and prices of most outstanding Treasury securities drifted lower.
Traders did say that demand for short-term notes and bills remained quite strong, especially for two-year and three-year notes. A big commercial bank was rumored to be a large buyer of two-year notes. 
 However, bond prices began to fall in midafternoon, pushed down by selling in the Treasury bond futures pits at the Board of Trade in Chicago.
Analysts said they saw no real reason for the price decline.
"The market was very quiet and trading was very thin," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "We have been groping for explanations ourselves" to justify the selloff, he added.
 
Daily Market Commentary
 In their daily market commentary, analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, said that "traders were fed up with the market's sideways drift. However, there have been no fresh fundamental developments to suggest that further declines are in the offing."
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101 13/32 , down 13/32 , to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.84 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 7/32 in late trading, down 5/32 , to yield 7.32 percent. And prices of the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes dipped by 1/32 , to 100 3/32 , to yield 5.07 percent.
Rates on outstanding short-term Treasury bills moved a bit lower.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.66 percent in late trading, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late rate of 3.79 percent.
Activity was decidedly more brisk in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, where close to $2 billion worth of new issues were priced.
And corporations offered just under $1 billion worth of new debt issues.
Among the municipal issuers was the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which sold just over $350 million worth of general obligation and special obligation revenue bonds backed by gasoline tax receipts.
The general obligation bond offering consisted of serial and term bonds with yields from 4.90 percent on serial bonds maturing in 1996 to 6.63 percent on term bonds maturing in 2013.
The $103.6 million worth of gasoline tax bonds were offered at yields from 5.35 percent on securities maturing in 1998 to 6.45 percent on term bonds maturing in 2013.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the negotiated offering.
The general obligation bonds are rated Baa by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The gasoline tax bonds, the first ever sold by the Commonwealth, are rated A by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Demand for the bonds well exceeded the amount sold. And the state's improving financial outlook enabled the securities to be sold at much lower yields than were available to Massachusetts just six months ago.
In December, Massachusetts sold long-term general obligation bonds at yields which were a half-point higher than those negotiated yesterday, Kenneth Olshansky, director of debt management in the Massachusetts treasury department said.
"Investors realize the Commonwealth is poised for a ratings upgrade, and want to grab on to these securities for potential capital gains," he said.
Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have indicated their ratings on outstanding Massachusetts issues are under review, and may be upgraded.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Public Service Gas and Electric Company offered a total of $600 million worth of first and refunding bonds at competitive bid.
The issue consisted of $250 million of 3-year bonds, $150 million of 5-year bonds and $200 million of 30-year securities.
A bid from a group led by the First Boston Corporation won the 6 percent three-year bonds, which were priced at 100, or par, 39 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 7/8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
A bid from a group led by Merrill Lynch & Company won the 6 7/8 percent five-year bonds, which were priced at $99.762, to yield 6.931 percent, 40 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.

Atlanta No. 1 In Industrial Construction

BYLINE: By Ford Risley

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
WITH several large projects either under way or about to begin, industrial development remains one of the few segments of this city's commercial construction market with any significant activity.
Atlanta led the country with seven million square feet of new industrial construction in 1991, according to Jonathan Barry, a partner with Atlanta-based Corporate Property Investors. In contrast, construction of industrial space in the six New England states totaled 329,000 square feet last year. 
 Still, last year was down significantly for Atlanta from the late 1980's, when industrial construction climbed as high as 15 million square feet a year.
"People aren't saying no to deals; they just aren't saying yes as quickly," said Howard Peck, vice president of Bessemer Properties Inc., which has four industrial parks in the Atlanta area.
Bessemer signed one of the biggest industrial deals in recent months, a 700,000-square-foot distribution center for the Ford Motor Company. The center is being built in Bessemer's Liberty Industrial Park on Atlanta's South Side.
As with the Ford project, most of the industrial construction currently taking place in Atlanta is "built to suit" -- the industrial company contracts with a developer for specific buildings on the developer's land.
The recession and continuing tight credit conditions have all but ruled out most speculative development, people in the industry say.
Only 14 percent of total industrial construction last year in Atlanta was speculative, Mr. Barry said. On the other hand, there were more than 30 build-to-suit projects ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 square feet.
"Speculative development has come to a standstill," said Patrick Henry, director of marketing for the Trammel Crow Company, which has more than eight million square feet of industrial space in metropolitan Atlanta.
Speculative developers have also been discouraged by the city's relatively high vacancy rate for industrial space, 18.1 percent last year, Mr. Barry said.
Although the vacancy rate is disturbing, Mr. Barry said, it is a slight improvement from 1990's rate of 19 percent. The vacancy rate also is fairly typical of high-growth metropolitan areas. For example, Phoenix had an 18 percent vacancy rate and Los Angeles a 22.7 percent rate.
The slowdown in speculative work is expected to continue this year and into 1993, said Leigh Burch, vice president of Atlanta-based Jamison Research Inc. But with what appears to be a slowly reviving economy, he said, the vacancy rate should continue to improve.
Although the downturn in speculative work has unquestionably hurt industrial developers, the pain is being eased somewhat by the size of many of the build-to-suit projects.
Besides the Ford project, a 650,000-square-foot distribution center for the Whirlpool Corporation was recently completed. And Nestle S.A. announced last month that it would build a 784,000-square-foot distribution center, one of the largest ever built in Atlanta.
The three projects are indicative of Atlanta's growing domination as a distribution center. The hub of a transportation network and situated in the center of the Southeast, Atlanta has long had an advantage over other cities in the region for distribution operations.

HEADLINE: Private Hospitals in New York Reach Accord on Job Security

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Hospitals and nursing homes in New York City reached a benchmark agreement yesterday that virtually guarantees 65,000 health-care workers their jobs within the industry.
The tentative contract includes a wage package that keeps pace with inflation, giving the workers a raise of about 12 percent over three years, letting them retire three years earlier with full benefits and reducing their medical costs. A housekeeper's salary would rise to an average of $23,640 a year from $21,426; a pharmacist would get a raise to $52,454 from $47,541. 
 But the centerpiece of the pact, reflecting workers' major concern, is job security. The agreement generally guarantees a laid-off worker first rights to a comparable opening at any hospital covered by the contract and supplements unemployment benefits until the worker gets rehired or for at least one year while being retrained.
Management balked at an outright no-layoff guarantee. Its embrace of the industrywide job-security program reflected two factors. First, its assessment that, given attrition rates, the program would largely take care of itself. Second, that faced with cuts in Federal and state reimbursements, it was in management's interest to make this deal to further a joint lobbying campaign for health-care issues.
 
Victory for Union Chief
 "This blazes new trails," said Edward Silver, the chief management negotiator, who said he knew of no other major field in which job security was guaranteed on an industrywide basis.
The agreement also represented a victory that bolstered the standing of Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, who took office three years ago with an ambitious labor and political agenda.
The hospitals and nursing homes affected are private nonprofit institutions represented by the League of Voluntary Hospitals, the League of Voluntary Nursing Homes and the Roman Catholic Archidocese of New York.
The agreement, patterned in part after a precedent-setting accord signed in February with Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, also a private nonprofit hospital, might raise the stakes in protracted bargaining with other unions representing hundreds of thousands of public and private-sector workers whose contracts have expired -- in particular, employees with similar jobs at New York City's municipal hospitals.
But James F. Hanley, the city's Director of Labor Relations, disagreed. "As far as we're concerned, it does not set a pattern," he said of the hospital pact's impact on negotiations with city government workers. "We're in a different situation -- we don't have any money."
The accord was hailed as heralding an era of good feeling between management and organized labor.
"I think it's unprecedented and tremendously meaningful because it literally means a career for these workers in terms of an industry," said Victor Gotbaum, a former municipal labor leader who directs the Center for Labor-Management Policy Studies of the City University of New York Graduate Center.
If the contract is ratified and its provisions fulfilled, that would be a departure from the rancor that has defined the relationship between Local 1199 and the hospitals league for years. Yesterday's announcement met an informal deadline imposed by Mr. Rivera, who is to be installed for a second term as union president today, and marked the first time that a settlement was reached before the contract expires, on June 30.
Health care is New York's major growth industry but one that has been beleaguered by staggering costs and occasionally by shortages of qualified employees among the technicians, therapists and social workers and others at the more highly trained range of the union's jurisdiction, which also includes orderlies and laundry workers. Although the contract announced yesterday is with private institutions only, some of the additional $256 million or so cost in wages and benefits will be absorbed by the public because the institutions receive Medicaid reimbursements at rates set by the state.
 
Notice Before Layoffs
 Under the agreement, a hospital would have to provide 30 days' notice before laying off any employee, would refer that worker to a joint career placement service and would try to find a comparable job for that worker on its own staff. Once notified of a layoff, no member of the hospitals league could hire someone else in that category without first offering the job to workers who were being laid off. Seniority for benefits would be maintained. Severance would be paid to the new employer.
If the worker could not be hired somewhere in the system within the 30-day notification period, the worker would be placed in a training program, which would supplement unemployment benefits for a year or more -- unless perhaps the institution closed or the grant program was scrubbed. Employers would increase their contribution to the training fund after a $1 million grant from the union's training program.
Both sides pronounced the agreement as "reasonable" and "balanced." But the theatrics accompanying the announcement suggested the contract largely represented Local 1199's agenda. As hundreds of union negotiating committee members cheered in a Manhattan hotel ballroom, Mr. Rivera presented the chief management negotiator, Bruce McIver, the hospitals league president, with a rose; the union treated management to a chicken lunch in the hotel basement, and more details of the contract were revealed by the union than by management.
 
More Flexibility
 Not all of them, though. Instead of the flat no-layoff clause that the union won from Beth Israel, the contract includes industrywide job guarantees that protect workers but also give management more flexibility.
Also, the proposed wage settlement includes a $500 bonus -- representing an average 2 percent increase -- that will not be figured in the base for future negotiations or calculated for pension benefits. The contract would raise wages by 3 percent on Dec. 15, 1992, and on July 1, 1993 and by 4 percent on Oct. 1, 1994. Management, which will resume or supplement its contributions to union benefit and pension funds, estimated the total wage increase at about 10.8 percent.
Nonetheless, the agreement included components, if not the language, of the Beth Israel contract, which the league's new team of negotiators, Mr. McIver and Mr. Silver, had initially discounted as the product of unique circumstances at that institution.
"It is made possible because of a very specific set of circumstances at Beth Israel Medical Center," Dr. Robert G. Newman, the hospital's president said at the time, "and they relate to atttitude."
 
A Test for Rivera
 But that attitude, as it turned out, also infused the industrywide talks that began a month ago -- so much so that at yesterday's lunch at the Sheraton New York, Basil Paterson, the union's chief negotiator, toasted his counterparts in the hospitals league.
The negotiations represented a test for Mr. Rivera, who had delivered a surprisingly generous contract to his members three years ago after dividing management by settling first with the archdiocese and then orchestrating his militancy against the hospitals league. The agreement, by guaranteeing jobs, enhances the union's power and frees it to engage in this year's state and national campaigns.
Mr. Rivera said the settlement marked a "historic moment."
In 1994, management would begin contributing three-tenths of 1 percent of gross payroll to a child-care fund for the families of union members. In 1995, employees with 25 years of service would be entitled to retire with full benefits at age 62. Joint labor-management committees would be formed to resolve major grievances and to improve patient care. Mediation and arbitration procedures would be expedited.
The contract would cover 38,000 employees in 55 hospitals and health centers represented by the hospitals league, 5,000 in the five hospitals and medical school run by the archdiocese and another 5,000 in institutions represented by the League of Voluntary Nursing Homes. The hospitals league's contract usually sets the pattern for about 17,000 employees in 20 other institutions.

HEADLINE: YELTSIN SAYS U.S. SEEKS ARMS PACT ASSURING AN EDGE

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 10

 BODY:
Less than a week before a summit meeting in Washington with President Bush, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia accused the United States today of seeking an advantage over his country in negotiations over further cuts in strategic nuclear weapons.
Speaking to senior military officers at the Russian Defense Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin said he would resist Washington's efforts to eliminate heavy, land-based, multiple-warhead missiles -- the backbone of Russia's nuclear deterrent -- while the United States was allowed to preserve an advantage in sea-based missiles. 
 The United States "suggests that all our multiple-warhead, land-based missiles should be eliminated, while at the same time cutting to a smaller degree the number of strategic naval forces," Mr. Yeltsin said, a report by the Itar-Tass news agency said.
 
Preparatory Talks Fall Short
 "If such a decision is made," he said, "the United States would find itself in a more advantageous position."
In a round of talks that ended Tuesday in Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, failed to resolve differences over what combination of weapons should remain in their countries' arsenals, although they generally concurred on the number of warheads each side should have.
Mr. Kozyrev, before leaving Washington, held out the possibility of a deal being reached at the Bush-Yeltsin meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.
But Mr. Yeltsin, apparently seeking to demonstrate his resolve before his meeting with Mr. Bush, accused the United States of asking too much. "Russia supports the idea of strategic parity," he said, "while the U.S. side is moving along a different path."
 
A Busy Washington Schedule
 All these questions, he said, must be discussed when he meets with President Bush in Washington. Mr. Yeltsin will also address Congress, seeking to convince it of his commitment to democracy and economic reform without directly asking for financial aid.
[In Washington, Administration officials played down the rebuff by the Russian leader, saying that such remarks were to be expected during arms negotiations. Page A8.]
Mr. Yeltsin's objections to the American arms stance were as much political as strategic, senior Western diplomats suggested, since some Russian officials regard the American negotiating position as an effort to take advantage of Moscow's current weakness and its need for a $24 billion package of Western loans.
Hard-liners in the United States have long pressed for the elimination of Moscow's long-range missiles, which they regard as destabilizing. They have criticized the unratified SALT II treaty, as well as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- widely known as Start -- the provisions of which are now in force. These critics say the treaties have permitted deployment of Moscow's heavy weapons systems.
Now, with Communism dead, the Soviet Union in pieces and Russia asking for American economic aid, Washington is doubtless trying to press its advantage to secure deeper cuts in the Russian arsenal, a senior Western diplomat said.
Richard R. Burt, the American negotiator in the Start talks until April 1991 and former Assistant Secretary of State for European affairs, said today in Moscow that big land-based missiles like the SS-18 are inherently destabilizing because in a crisis, they become "use-them-or-lose-them" weapons.
"I think there is the belief in Washington that the United States probably has the upper hand in this negotiation," Mr. Burt said. "It's difficult to be sensitive to the Russian desire to be a superpower while they want help to rebuild their economy. There is logic to the position that in return for providing help to Russia, we should expect them to remove or lift the threat to the United States."
 
Moscow's Hard-Liners
 Mr. Yeltsin, who is under criticism from hard-liners in his own Parliament that his foreign policy is weak, is trying to shore up his credentials before meeting with Mr. Bush.
He spent today placating the military leaders, who have suffered humiliation as the mighty Soviet armed forces disintegrated along with the Soviet state. Soldiers have been stranded in many newly independent republics where they are not wanted, or -- as in Georgia or in the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh inside Azerbaijan -- are viewed as sources for weapons so that warring nationalists can fight each other.
The Russian legislative hard-liners have complained that soldiers are being humiliated, attacked and denied support from Moscow. Mr. Yeltsin's Vice President, former Col. Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, has even urged support for a breakaway republic of ethnic Russians in Moldova, arguing that Russian soldiers and civilians are being neglected by officials in Moscow.
Mr. Yeltsin has announced the creation of a Russian Army, but it will be reduced to about 1.5 million men by the year 2000, from a total Soviet force of 3.2 million to 3.4 million. The enormous military budget has been slashed, conscription notices are widely ignored by young men, and once-important bases now belong to independent countries.
 
Soldier's Life an Unhappy One
 Many Russian soldiers remain in crumbling barracks in Eastern Europe or in the Baltic lands because there is no work or housing for them at home.
Some new housing in Russia is being built by Germany, a traditional adversary, as the price for troop withdrawals. It is a trade-off that deeply upsets some Russian nationalists.
Control of the Black Sea Fleet is a matter of contention between Russia and Ukraine. And Russian junior officers and enlisted personnel complain of pay that has not kept pace with the rapid price increases resulting from Mr. Yeltsin's economic changes.
The Russian officer corps -- trained to regard the United States and NATO as the prime potential adversary -- is confused about military doctrine and who its enemies might be in a world turned upside down.
"Our previous history of 70 years can only give us examples of military reaction and the use of force to defend our interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei V. Yastrzhembsky said today. "That's why conservatives are not satisfied with our policy. They see some state treason or betrayal causing us to lose our position everywhere, but it's not true."
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that Russian nuclear weapons will no longer be aimed at American cities and targets, Mr. Yastrzhembsky said. "But it's hard for the military to change because we need a new military strategy."
 
Raises and Promotions
 The President, in his wide-ranging talk with officers, announced pay increases in commissioned grades as high as 80 percent, and he made a series of appointments and promotions to the new Russian military command.
Col. Gen. Viktor Dubinin, the former commander of Soviet forces in Poland, was named Chief of the armed forces General Staff, and three other top-ranking officers were appointed to be Deputy Defense Ministers.
The elevation of one of these officers -- the former Baltic commander, Gen. Valery Mironov -- was viewed as an important gesture because Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania demand the immediate withdrawal of former Soviet troops from their territory. Mr. Yeltsin has said that Moscow cannot afford to do so, and today he added: "We cannot pull out the troops into an open field, and we will never agree that a withdrawal should resemble fleeing."
Mr. Yeltsin also told the military leaders that he had full confidence in the economic-reform policies of his First Deputy Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar. Mr. Gaidar is respected in the West but has been bitterly criticized by Russian hard-liners. "There is no alternative to Gaidar's team today," Mr. Yeltsin said. "I am convinced that now we need to go further. Any halt would be simply fatal for Russia."
Trying to convince the West that his economic changes are on track, Mr. Yeltsin said in an interview with the Interfax news agency that three new Economics Ministry officials regarded as relatively conservative are also supporters of reform. The new officials promised that "they would, under no circumstances, permit any split in Gaidar's overall economic team," the President said.
A senior Western diplomat suggested tonight that Mr. Yeltsin's defiant remarks on nuclear arms reduction might be part of a strategy to delay an agreement until the summit meeting, to prove that his direct talks with Mr. Bush can produce results.
But other diplomats cautioned that arms agreements reached at summit meetings by Mikhail S. Gorbachev were often viewed at home as window dressing, a way to divert attention from worsening domestic crises.
Under the Start treaty, the United States would cut its nuclear arsenal from about 12,000 weapons to 10,000, and the former Soviet states, from about 10,000 to 8,000. Each side would have about 8,500 warheads.
Mr. Bush, in his State of the Union address in January, called for each side to reduce its arsenal to 4,700 warheads, and Moscow generally agreed, with Mr. Yeltsin suggesting a cut to 2,500 warheads by the year 2000, a goal he repeated today.
 
Cutting Back SS-18's
 But Mr. Bush has also called for a ban on land-based, multiple-warhead missiles, a demand that has led to the current standoff. The best-known of these weapons is the SS-18, a 10-warhead missile with a range estimated at 6,800 miles. Russia is thought to now have 308 of these missiles. Under the Start treaty, that number would be halved, to 154.
Should Moscow agree to dismantle all its multiple-warhead, land-based weapons, traditional military doctrine would call for Russia to build more sea-based missiles or intercontinental single-warhead, land-based missiles in compensation. But this is the sort of expense that the strapped Russian economy is unlikely to be able to bear.
Even dismantling missiles is expensive. Diplomats suggest that keeping them in place would probably be cheaper for the Russians in the short run than it would be to dismantle them safely, guard the warheads and properly dispose of the nuclear material.
Western nations are already concerned that lax security around former Soviet missile bases and storage depots could lead to the sale or theft of nuclear material by terrorists or by nations seeking a shortcut to nuclear capacity.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMITBush and Rio;
President Has an Uncomfortable New Role In Taking Hard Line at the Earth Summit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Only a year after claiming his role as leader of the new world order, President Bush leaves Thursday for Brazil and an Earth Summit where opposition to his environmental policies threatens to produce the kind of embarrassing diplomatic wrangles that marred his recent trade mission to Japan.
But White House advisers, reflecting both Mr. Bush's ideological opposition to regulation and the realities of campaign politics, say that Mr. Bush is determined to take full election-year advantage of his uncomfortable new role, in which he is seen by many as global environmental spoilsport. 
 The White House said today that Mr. Bush would speak "hard truths" in defense of the American environmental record on his two-day visit to Rio de Janiero for the United Nations conference. Senior officials predicted the President would offer a blunt defense of his stands on major issues that have drawn critical fire at the summit.
Criticism has focused on opposition by the United States to firm timetables for curbing carbon dioxide emissions associated with global warming and on its refusal to sign a treaty to protect plants and animals. Both these positions are in disagreement with Japan and European nations.
The United States has also been assailed by poor countries who charge that Washington should come up with more money to help them pay for programs to protect their environments.
In Rio today, negotiators said they were nearing agreement on a multibillion dollar accord in which industrialized nations would help pay for environmental efforts in the developing world. [Page A9.]
Countering the criticism, the Administration argues that the environmental records of some of prominent foreign critics, who are already complaining about United States' bullying and indifference to global concerns, would collapse under close scrutiny.
Mr. Bush finds himself in this position because of the trade-off he made by placing economic and political needs, rather than diplomatic or scientific concerns, at the center of Administration's environmental stance. In addition, because of budget restrictions, the Administration believes that it cannot afford to come up with the multibillion-dollar aid packages that are being proffered in Rio by Japan and European countries.
Nowadays, moreover, Mr. Bush's words and his environmental positions are attuned to the political base of party loyalists and Reagan Democrats -- particularly those in the Sun Belt and the Rockies -- that swept two Republicans into the White House, and who are now being seduced by the pro-business oratory of Ross Perot.
 
The President's Role
 As a result, on the eve of his arrival in Rio de Janiero for the United Nations conference, the President finds it difficult to cast himself in the role he prefers -- that of the unifying leader of "the sole remaining superpower" who is glad to serve as the rallying point for lesser and more timid nations.
In effect, Mr. Bush is expected to argue in Rio that on matters of global warming, endangered species, forest conservation and aid to poor nations' environmental programs, the world is marching out of step with Washington, and not vice versa.
By playing to the hilt the role of global maverick, aides to the President say, Mr. Bush hopes to display a brand of tough leadership that will play extremely well at home, especially in an election that features the tough-talking Mr. Perot. But Mr. Bush, in taking this line, also risks a repeat of the sort of clumsy and fractious disputes that marked his politically embarrassing mission last January to Japan, in which Japanese leaders rejected American demands for trade concessions and the President collapsed from stomach flu at an official dinner.
"There isn't any question that we don't have a great record on the environment, a first-rate record on the environment, the best record in the world," Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, said Wednesday in defining the current White House line. "For the United States not to go to Rio and talk about the best record in the world would defy logic."
A second senior official later added: "To the extent it's a benefit from a political aspect, that's pure gravy."
Mr. Bush arrives in Rio late on Thursday evening after an all-day flight that will take him first to Panama for a speech and a meeting with President Guillermo Endara, who replaced Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as that nation's leader in 1989.
In Rio, the President will sign a treaty setting out first steps to curb warming of the Earth's atmosphere and will make a brief speech to the Earth Summit audience before dining on Friday with President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil. He will hold meetings and a news conference before returning to Washington late Saturday or early Sunday.
Political and policy aides to Mr. Bush insisted this week that his unyielding stances at the Rio summit were driven more by ideology than by political calculus, and that those stands have been widely misread both by diplomats and the world's press.
 
Questions of Money
 In either case, it is clear that the White House currently lacks either the political mandate or the national resources to play the role that Mr. Bush has relished in past foreign crises.
Financially, the Administration believes that it cannot afford to sign on to the most dramatic proposals at Rio even if it wanted to. The multibillion-dollar infusions demanded to address poor nations' environmental problems, and which Germany, Japan and some other Western nations are touting, neither exist in America's strapped treasury nor could pass political muster if they did.
Many of Mr. Bush's aides and political advisers privately express fury that the United States is being pilloried at the Brazilian summit by its longtime allies for refusing to commit to actions that they argue are not just unattainable, but often hypocritical.
"Japan's out there killing whales and running driftnets, for God's sake, while we've got the world's toughest environmental laws and we're twisting ourselves into knots over how many jobs to abolish to save a subspecies of an owl," fumed one Republican adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And these guys presume to lecture us about environmental responsibility?"
The differences between American and European and Japanese positions on the environmental issues arise from more than a willingness to spend money. The summit has demonstrated that on environmental issues, American allies analyze the issues differently, seeing environmental problems as an opportunity and challenge. German and Japanese companies stand to gain, for example, from the development of "clean" technologies that could be adopted throughout the world.
The White House has decided to try putting Mr. Bush on the offensive in Brazil in an effort to reap whatever political benefit can be extracted from the trip. Officially, Mr. Bush's re-election campaign has taken no role in that decision, but his political advisers are openly pleased by it.
"This is what leadership is all about -- standing up for what's right and doing the best thing for all Americans," the campaign's spokeswoman, Torie Clarke, said.
Many of Mr. Bush's advisers believe his unyielding stances will yield benefits where the President most needs them: among conservative ranchers, miners and businessmen in the Rocky Mountains and points west who have long been a Republican bulwark.
 
Adjusting His Dialogue
 The President has recently adjusted his dialogue to stress disgust with environmental advocates and his insistence that curbs on pollution and development will not come at the cost of jobs. Speaking in Fresno, Calif. two weeks ago, he charged that environmentalist critics of his Earth Summit positions are "extremes" who want to "shut down" American society.
"I don't think the issue is whether the rest of the world agrees with the decisions of George Bush," Steven Goldstein, the spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan, said. "The issue is whether George Bush will insure that economic factors are taken into account in these environmental decisions. And that may not play well in Managua, but it plays extremely well in Ogden, Utah."
Mr. Bush nevertheless comes to Rio not as the accomplished leader of cold war coalitions, but as a head of state who is at loggerheads with much of the rest of the planet on the most basic initiatives of the United Nations summit.
Showing a personal interest on the subject, he singlehandedly forced negotiators to excise from the global warming treaty any reference to deadlines for capping emissions of pollutants. His refusal to sign the treaty increasing protection of endangered plants and animals is based on the claim that the treaty infringes on patent rights and contains open-ended financing commitments.
 
Opposition to a Deadline
 The President's aides argue that both actions have been widely misread. The United States opposed a deadline on reducing emissions of global warming gases, they say, because the deadline was unattainable and because only two nations -- the United States and the Netherlands -- had prepared any blueprint for cutting those emissions.
The treaty that Mr. Bush effectively dictated, and which he will sign in Rio on Friday, sets no deadline for cutting emissions but does require every nation to devise an "action plan" for reducing pollution, and to report regularly on whether that plan's goals are being met.
Mr. Bush's aides also argue that the United States has rightfully rejected the second treaty, covering endangered species, because it surrenders control over World Bank environmental funds to an undefined melange of treaty-signing nations, and because it undercuts American patent laws and business practices.
Even the Administration's harshest critics allow that those claims have merit. But even some of its supporters agree that the White House has been unusually obstinate, grasping at fine points of principle and refusing to accept concessions that could have eliminated the objections to both documents.
Administration officials attribute the President's stance ultimately to a longtime struggle within the Administration between environmental moderates and a passionate band of conservatives who view the Earth Summit as a scientifically fraudulent and economically disastrous venture.
The conservatives, mostly in Vice President Dan Quayle's office and in economic policy posts, have captured the high ground and Mr. Bush's favor in many recent debates. They are backed by other conservative strategists like Interior secretary Lujan, for two decades a Congressman from New Mexico, who see environmental policy as a way for Mr. Bush to win back Western conservatives who are deserting him.

HEADLINE: War in the Balkans Creates a Bitter U.S. Front

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
With a cigarette dangling from his lips, Vladimir Radojicic, a 34-year-old photographer, projected an unflappable cool during a late-night gathering of Yugoslav immigrants in Manhattan. But when the evening's video began, a taped tour of downtown Belgrade, the tears rolled quietly down his face.
Mr. Radojicic, son of a Croatian mother and a Serbian father, is caught quite personally between the warring ethnic factions in his native land. Drafted by both the Serbian and the Croatian armies last fall, he fled instead to the United States. Here, the tensions causing the Balkans to implode have revived Old World rivalries among the more than one million Americans of Balkan descent. 
 Outside Detroit, rival Yugoslav and Albanian youth gangs, the "Yugos" and "Albos," have traded fists and sticks in mall parking lots. In Cleveland, Serbian and Croatian soccer teams have canceled matches because violence during games was escalating. In the Chicago area, a Serbian monastery was defaced with anti-Serbian vulgarities, while a Croatian cultural center was spray-painted with anti-Croatian slogans. The Chicago Commission on Human Rights reported death threats and bomb threats to Serbian community leaders.
So Mr. Radojicic did not exactly escape the war he tried to leave behind.
"I could not choose to go fight the family of my mother or to go fight the family of my father, so I chose out," Mr. Radojicic (pronounced rah-DOE-yeh-cheech) said. "But now I watch on television as my country falls apart -- everybody guilty and nobody guilty."
For Mr. Radojicic and his fellow immigrants, the strife in the Balkans -- which has caused an estimated 16,000 deaths so far -- is more than just a war that most Americans can't quite follow. Monitored by short-wave radio, it is their daily obsession, a conflict tearing up not only their relatives' lives back home but their lives here as well.
"My phone is constantly bombarded, like Sarajevo," said the Rev. Slavko Soldo, of the Croatian Roman Catholic Church of St. Cyril and St. Methodus in Manhattan.
Following the collapse of Communism in Yugoslavia, relations between Serbs and Croats and Albanians and Slovenes here, generally distant, have turned hostile, but, on the whole, in subtle ways.
When Vlade Divac, a Serbian center for the Los Angeles Lakers, met Drazen Petrovic, a Croatian guard for the New Jersey Nets, on the court at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., he was snubbed publicly by his former teammate on the Yugoslav National Team.
"Hate begets hate," said Darlene Gakovich, a Serbian-American who lives in Madison, Wis. "We have a longtime friend, a Croatian-American, who will not so much as say hello to us now."
In New York, car tires have been punctured, and a war of threats has been waged over fax machines. But the hostilities are defused, and diffused, by the relatively small size of the Serbian and Croatian communities in the ethnic expanse of the metropolitan region.
In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the 1990 Census counted about 85,000 people of Balkan ancestry, adding together those who identify themselves as Yugoslav, Croat, Serb, Slovene, Bosnian and Herzegovinian. The Serbs and Croats themselves, however, estimate a population of more than 150,000. Concentrated in Queens, particularly in Astoria and Ridgewood, their religious and social lives radiate around two churches in Manhattan -- the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava, at 16 West 26th Street, and the Croatian Roman Catholic Church, at 502 West 41st Street.
 
Shifting Power Of Local Factions
 
 
Following the United Nations' recognition of Croatia as an independent republic at the end of May and the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia, the balance of power, so to speak, between local Serbs and Croats has shifted.
For years, the Croatian-Americans in the New York area, who outnumber the Serbian-Americans, have felt like outsiders to the official Yugoslav presence here. (Some Serbs who fled Communism did, too.) What they had was a grassy area for soccer and picnicking in northern New Jersey called Croatian Land -- "two acres where we could be free and independent," said Josip Kristic (pronounced YOH-seep KREE-steech), director of the Croatian Information Center, in Queens.
But at the end of May, things changed. Thousands of Croats gathered to watch the red, white and blue flag of Croatia hoisted over the United Nations. And last week, Croatia's first ambassador arrived to open a mission.
At the same time, the Yugoslav consulate, the national airline offices, and the Yugoslav cultural center in New York were closed. A Serbian lawyer employed by JAT, the national airline, said agents of the Treasury Department, who were instructed to seize all Yugoslav assets in this country, arrived without notice last week -- "like a scene from 'The Untouchables,' " she said.
"I was so scared," she said. "All of a sudden I was an enemy of the people."
Many Croats used to say that news organizations in the United States favored the Serbs, but Serbs are now outraged at what they see as a bias against them. Angry about what he called the "lack of realism" in recent coverage of the war, which followed declarations of independence by Croatia and Slovenia a year ago, the pastor of the Serbian church in Manhattan declined to be interviewed.
"In the media, the Serbs have been demonized beyond recognition," said Nadja Tesich, a Serbian-American writer in Manhattan.
In contrast, Mr. Kristic, of the Croatian Information Center, said: "Until recently, the American media made angels of the Serbs. But now they are coming to their senses."
 
A Shared Pain, A Shared Anger
 Still, the Croats are hardly rejoicing.
"Of course, this is a historical moment for the Croatians here, to be finally recognized," said Father Soldo. "But all this going on back home, with war, destruction and deaths, dampens any celebration we could have."
A young Croatian-American film maker, Tomislav Novakovic, who grew up in what used to be Little Croatia in Norwood, the Bronx, is working on a low-budget anti-war movie about the Balkan conflict. The film, "Are They Still Shooting?" focuses on the relationship between two brothers, one on the front in the Balkans, the other in Manhattan but "experiencing the same pain and frustration dealing with the war."
"Please, for my protection, stress that the film is under the auspices of Columbia University," Mr. Novakovic said. "It is not financed by either Croats or Serbs."
In an apartment on Roosevelt Island, a group of young immigrants from Belgrade and Sarajevo, unable to sleep these days, lingered late into the night, agonizing over the fate of the Balkan states.
Mr. Radojicic, the photographer, worried aloud about his uncle in Sarajevo, who had lost 30 pounds in the last month while hiding in a cellar as the city exploded above him. He also spoke of his grandparents, who, on the island off Croatia where they had lived all their lives, were suddenly under siege by neighbors because their daughter married a Serb more than three decades ago.
"Most of us are in shock," said Dusica Tomanovic (DEW-cheet-sah toe-MAH-noh-veech), a designer from Belgrade. "One second, our country is like a big family, noisy, fighting at the dinner table. The next second, our brothers and sisters and cousins are under the table, scratching each other's eyes out."
 
Gathering Together To Remember Home
 Watching the video walking tour of Belgrade, listening to the love songs of the pop group Idoli, these immigrants were homesick and heartsick for a place that no longer exists. Film director Slobodan Pesic (pronounced sloe-boe-DEN peh-CHEECH) tried to lighten the mood.
"Everything comes down to sex, and the Serbians are better lovers," he told the group. "That's how this started."
Nobody laughed.
Ms. Tomanovic waved a Time magazine with a cover story about the Balkans, which referred to Serbians' "dream of dominance."
"It's not true, it's not true," she said. "I don't think about territory never. Never in my life."
A Sarajevan, who, like Mr. Radojicic, is of mixed parentage, whispered, "I consider myself Yugoslavian but if you print that with my name, it will be dangerous for me."
"Halfs and halfs," as people of mixed parentage call themselves, are held up by the defenders of a united Yugoslavia as symbols of the "family feud." There are millions of them, the pro-unity Yugoslavs said.
But the Croats dismissed that estimate as an exaggeration for the purposes of propaganda. "There was not nearly so much mingling," Father Soldo said. "If American boys married French girls, would that mean France and America should be the same country?"
In the United States, the only real mingling took place before World War I, when the Serbs and Croats shared cemeteries, choral societies and distaste for the Austrians. After that, except when a united Yugoslav movement surfaced briefly during the 1940's, political and religious differences resurfaced and intensified.
The Serbs huddled around their Eastern Orthodox churches, the Croats around their Catholic churches. The Serbs, whose most popular folk song proclaims "Nobody has what the Serb has," printed community newspapers using the Cyrillic alphabet. The Croats used the Latin alphabet.
"As a people, the Croats, much to their praise, like to assemble," said Denyo Ranko Brashich, a Serbian-American lawyer in Manhattan. "The Serbs are maverick. You put four Serbs together, you have 18 political parties." (In the early 1980's, Mr. Brashich founded the Serbian-American Bar Association as a joke, because "everybody else had an association," and, much to his surprise, it flourished.)
The largest Serbian and Croatian communities in this country are in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, San Pedro, Calif., and New York.
In Chicago, where the tensions between Serbs and Croats have been most intense, a nun tried to persuade the Rev. Nikola Dugandzic (pronounced dew-GAHN-djeech), a Croatian priest, to meet with a local Serbian priest. But Father Dugandzic refused.
"As long as he is defending what's happening over there, I cannot sit down and talk to him," he said, standing in a church hall crowded with boxes of clothes, canned food, rice and flour bound for Croatia.
 
Disillusionment And Despair
 Few Serbs in this country support the Serbian president. "We despise Slobodan Milosevic for using nationalism to lull Serbians into believing he was for them," Mrs. Gakovich said.
But they point out again and again that the Serbs, now considered, they say, to be ruthless aggressors, have been victims of such atrocities throughout history that they must stand up for themselves.
"That's no rationalization for a vicious land grab," Mr. Kristic, a Croat, retorted. He added that the Serbian-dominated Communist government had pushed Croats into exile. "And now that policy is boomeranging, because we all assimilated and prospered and we're behind the Croats in their struggle."
The only point of agreement seemed, finally, to be that the situation back home -- a civil war to the Serbs, a war of aggression to the Croats -- was a sad mess.
"There is a real period of almost numbness now, where people on all sides are starting to see the futility of war," said Mr. Novakovich, the film maker.
Looking out over the East River, the Sarajevan man told a joke, and then smiled wanly at the punch line.
"How does an intelligent man from Belgrade speak to a non-intelligent man from Belgrade?" the joke went.
"By phone, from New York."

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Pact Is Shaping on Environmental Aid to Third World

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 10

 BODY:
Negotiatiors from rich and poor countries were moving tonight toward a multibillion-dollar agreement under which the industrialized nations would help the third world pay the extra costs of making sure that their economic development does not inflict irreparable damage on the world's fragile ecological systems.
Environment and development ministers from many of the 178 countries attending the Earth Summit will try to conclude the agreement at their first ministerial-level meeting on Thursday by seeking a compromise on the exact amount of new aid and on new steps to preserve the world's dwindling forests and fight pollution of the atmosphere. 
 Participants said today that after all-night negotiations, a deal appeared to be in sight on the crucial question of financing environmentally sustainable development in the third world. That accord may open the way to resolving other disputes, they said.
With heads of state and government due to start arriving here on Thursday, negotiators are under intense pressure to complete the package of new environmental measures. Their leaders hope to sign the accords at the conclusion of the Earth Summit this weekend.
 
Statement of Principles
 Those measures include a statement setting out the broad principles that should guide the world as its tries to avoid exhausting environmental resources yet sustain economic growth. The leaders also plan to adopt a more detailed action plan, known as Agenda 21, that outlines steps for achieving that goal in every environmental sector and provides for the North to help pay the extra costs that such safeguards will entail in the developing world.
The United States is also pushing hard for a declaration on principles countries should follow to save the world's diminishing forests. The measure would be nonbinding, but would commit the nations to negotiating a binding convention on the issue later on.
New conventions on curbing emissions of climate-changing gases and on preserving rare plants and animals have already been prepared for signature by the leaders attending the gathering, which is described as the biggest conference of governments ever held.
 
Organizer Is 'Encouraged'
 At a news conference late this afternoon, the summit meeting's organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, said he was "very encouraged at the progress being made" in the aid talks. "Outstanding issues are not going to override the tremendous desire to suceed," he said.
Other diplomats appeared more optimistic than they had been a day or so ago, when the gap between North and South seemed formidably large. The American Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Agriculture Affairs, Michael Young, said that "things are falling into place."
Industrialized countries have been resisting third world demands that they enter into a binding new commitment to raise the volume of their assistance to 0.7 percent of their economic output by the year 2000. Their contributions currently average about 0.45 percent.
The United States is outside the debate because it has never accepted the 0.7 percent target. Other industrialized nations endorsed that goal some 20 years ago but have never achieved it as a group.
Diplomats say the ministers will try to reach agreement on a vaguer commitment by Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to reach the target of 0.7 percent "as soon as possible" or "by the year 2000 or as soon as possible thereafter."
 
Concrete Aid Commitments
 To win the support of the developing world for this compromise, the industrialized countries are making a series of specific and immediate new aid commitments, diplomats said.
The 12 European Community countries are discussing a plan to offer $3 billion to $5 billion in environmental aid over the next five years. This would involve rolling over some existing aid projects into a single community-wide package but would also include new money, officials said.
Japan plans to increase its environmental aid to developing countries from $2.3 billion for the three-year period from 1989 through 1991 to $7 billion over the next five years. That would mean an increase from about $800 million a year to $1.4 billion a year.
The United States and other donors are considering creating a new fund for the World Bank's International Development Agency next year that would provide virtually free environmental loans to the world's poorest nations.
They are also expected to agree to double, or perhaps triple, the $1.3 billion Global Environment Facility they established at the World Bank three years ago to finance third world environmental projects. That financing comes up for renewal next year.
Finally, heads of state and government from the industrialized world are expected to commit themselves to increasing the flow of aid when they address the Earth Summit at the end of the week, though it is unclear whether they will pledge specific amounts.
Ministers attending the meeting on Thursday will also seek a compromise on a plan strongly supported by the United States to adopt a set of principles on forest preservation, including a commitment to negotiate a binding convention.
In an effort to win African support for a strong statement on principles and a commitment to such a binding convention, the United States agreed today to support African countries in seeking another international convention to fight the creeping encroachment of the desert on their continent.
Officials say the summit participants are likely to call on the United Nations General Assembly to set up a negotiating body to complete a convention on the desert by June 1994.
 
Several Fighting Forest Pact
 Several countries with extensive forests, led by Malaysia but including India and Brazil, are opposed to the declaration of principles on forests and want to weaken it as much as possible.
Finally, the ministers will try to deal with an effort by Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers to weaken proposed pledges on conserving energy.
The Saudis argue that these pledges are unnecessary now that the nations have agreed to a convention on the climate that would require countries to curb their emissions of carbon dioxide and other warming gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
Picture Is Jumbled on Which Abortion Messages Can Get on TV

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
This spring, television stations reaching the Ninth Congressional District in southeastern Indiana broadcast commercials for an anti-abortion candidate that included photographs of dead, late-term fetuses.
But a Buffalo station rejected a much less explicit advertisement by the National Abortion Rights Action League showing the Statue of Liberty and a billowing American flag as a narrator's voice pleads to make "abortion less necessary" by encouraging sex education and birth control. 
 Advocates on both sides say they are learning that whether a spot dealing with abortion will run has less to do with the message than with the messenger. Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission say a television station must broadcast spots by candidates for Federal office, no matter what the content. Moreover, the political spots must be sold at the cheapest rates.
That is how Michael E. Bailey, the Republican primary victor in the Indiana district last month, compelled network affiliates in four Midwestern markets to clear his graphic 30-second advertisements at $100 a slot.
"TV stations never accepted my pro-life scripts before," said Mr. Bailey, who founded the nonprofit Christian Media Ministries, which makes religious commercials. "Running for Congress gave me the opportunity to say, 'Hey, you've got to run these.' "
But the rules change strikingly for advertisements promoting a point of view instead of a political candidate. Whether on abortion or other concerns, such issue-centered advertising is only minimally regulated by the commission, so television networks and stations have enormous discretion in deciding which spots they will run.
The major networks and many local stations have a uniform policy against advertisements dealing with issues, while other stations scrutinize them on a case-by-case basis.
In April, when Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, was trying to shut down clinics in Buffalo, the National Abortion Rights Action League had mixed success getting its relatively mild advertisements on the air.
David R. Luka, national sales manager for the CBS affiliate in Buffalo, WIVB, turned down the group's advertisements. "Even if Operation Rescue had not been in town, I'd question the ad," he said. "It's a sensitive issue, and we elected not to get involved."
The two other network-affiliated stations in Buffalo did broadcast the abortion-rights spots, which ran in April.
"More stations are accepting the ads now because of the recession, and because the consequences for running them aren't as bad as they feared," said Kim Haddow, of a Washington-based media consulting firm, Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Grunwald & Associates Inc.
 
Intense Scrutiny of Ads
 Many broadcasting experts say television officials go to unusual lengths to scrutinize spots involving abortion, whether they are from abortion-rights groups like Naral and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, or anti-abortion groups like the National Right to Life Committee and the Arthur S. De Moss Foundation, a Philadelphia-area Christian organization.
In April, before Naral could run a $200,000 national two-commercial campaign on CNN and some local stations in Washington and Philadelphia, the group was not only asked to submit scripts for approval, but also to file papers substantiating testimonials in the advertisements from two older Americans who said their mothers had died from illegal abortions.
One spot features a 67-year-old former marine, Jim Friedl, whose mother died when he was 4. Stations required Mr. Friedl to provide copies of his mother's death certificate, which states that she died of an overdose of a drug intended to induce abortion. Mr. Friedl also had to present copies of his own birth certificate, and his 30-year service record with the Marine Corps.
Groups seeking to run anti-abortion ads have encountered similar requests for documentation. This spring, the De Moss Foundation has tried to buy time for its "Life. What a Beautiful Choice" advertisements, in which a narrator says that the parents of the children shown in the advertisement chose to give their children up for adoption rather than to have abortions.
The Washington station WJLA, an ABC affiliate, said last month that it would not run the De Moss advertisements without documentation that the children shown had been adopted. The station recently accepted a new De Moss advertisement that emphasizes adoption but does not make the factual claims that appeared in the first ones.
 
Rejections From CNN
 The Turner Broadcasting System agreed to run the original De Moss advertisements on its four cable networks, CNN, Headline News, TNT and TBS, without any documentation. Steve Haworth, a spokesman for CNN, said that because none of the individuals in the advertisement were identified, CNN did not require proof that the children shown were adopted.
Officials of the De Moss Foundation refused to discuss their advertisements. Both the Naral and De Moss advertisements contain disclaimers at the beginning and end naming the group that paid for the ad.
Last spring CNN rejected two of four spots by Planned Parenthood. One was rejected because CNN was not satisfied with the documentation for its assertion that a teen-ager's death was directly caused by an abortion law that required parental consent. The other, in which a teen-ager, talking on the telephone, confides that she has just had an abortion and then faints, was deemed too strong.
Advertisements by political action committees on behalf of a particular candidate, like generic issue advertisements, are subject to discretionary station policies. In the bitter 1990 North Carolina race between Senator Jesse Helms and his Democratic challenger, Harvey Gantt, who favored abortion rights, the state Republican Party sent a letter to stations planning to broadcast Naral's spots supporting Mr. Gantt, which reminded them that they were under no obligation to do so.
The National Right to Life Committee has sponsored both issue advertisements and political spots for candidates. The group's series of so-called educational spots, with the tagline "Abortion Stops a Beating Heart," has run on local cable stations around the country. In the 1990 Virginia governor's race, its political action committee prepared advertisements for the anti-abortion candidate, Marshall Coleman. The spots met with only limited success at local stations, some of which did run Naral's political advertisements for his successful opponent, L. Douglas Wilder.
"The reasons were arbitrary," Nancy Meyers, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group, said.

Documentation has been requested to prove that the children in the ad were indeed adopted; Before an abortion rights group could run a $200,000 national two-commercial campaign, it was asked to submit scripts for approval and file papers substantiating testimonials in the advertisements.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Balanced Budget Proposal Termed Harmful by Clinton

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., June 10

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said today that he would oppose a proposal for a balanced budget amendment now before Congress because it would place too many restrictions on Government spending.
"The people who say they can just raise taxes and cut spending and balance the budget are only giving you a prescription for a worse recession," Mr. Clinton said in an interview with a Detroit television station, one of several remote radio and television interviews he conducted from the Governor's mansion here. 
 Mr. Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, said any plan to reduce the deficit must focus instead on constraining health care costs, reducing administrative costs of government and transferring military spending to domestic needs.
 
Quadrupling of Debt
 "I would support a balanced budget amendment," he said. "But I don't like the one that's now being considered because it doesn't provide for investment. The real problem with America is that we quadrupled the debt in 12 years and we reduced our investment.
"I want to make a real distinction between investing in the future and just spending on a daily basis."
Both houses of Congress have been preoccupied in recent weeks with battles over different versions of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Democratic leaders, including the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, oppose the idea of making such a requirement part of the Constitution. They have argued that sending such an amendment to the states for ratification is an unwieldy and confusing way of dealing with the nation's budget problems and that it would invite court challenges.
But the House rejected a Democratic plan to call for a balanced budget by ordinary statute, and a plan pushed by Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, is scheduled for a House floor vote on Thursday. His amendment would prohibit Federal outlays from exceeding revenue and would allow deviations from that standard only in times of war or when both Houses vote to do so by three-fifths majorities.
Mr. Clinton maintained today that such an approach would lead to increased taxes and prevent the country from borrowing for needed investment in highways, bridges, sewers or education. "I think we ought to be restrictive in borrowing just to spend money on a year-in, year-out basis," he said. "Where I come from in farming country, we call that eating our seed corn."
Mr. Clinton said benefits for programs like Social Security and Medicare, in which the money is automatically given to all people who meet certain criteria, would not necessarily have to be reduced to meet budget-balancing targets. "These entitlements are not going to poor people or middle-class people," he said. "They are going to health care providers who are ballooning this system. And it is a national scandal."
He said that passing a balanced budget amendment would allow Republicans to evade responsibility for failing to address the rising deficit during the years they have held the White House. "This is just a way that the President can put his responsibility off past the second term," he said. "Once you go through the constitutional amendment process, it's going to take years to do it. Meanwhile, this President and his predecessor never presented anything that got close to a balanced budget."
Mr. Clinton said he would spell out his deficit reduction plan in the legislative agenda he intended to present to Congress before the Democratic nominating convention begins next month.
 
Tax-Cut Plan
 He said he still favored granting middle-income people a tax cut, an approach he stressed in the early primaries but seldom mentions now.
"I don't think you can possibly underestimate the extent to which essentially we had class warfare in the 1980's, lowering taxes on upper-income people while their incomes soared, raising taxes on middle-class people while their incomes dropped," he said. "It was one of the most unforgivable things we've ever done."

HEADLINE: Ban Is Urged on Cigarette Smoke in Public Places

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The American Heart Association said today that cigarette smoke should be banned from work and public places as an environmental toxin.
The association released a paper summarizing what its authors said was overwhelming evidence that exposure to the smoke of others increased a person's chances of getting lung cancer, heart disease or emphysema. 
 The group said it would urge the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, and William K. Reilly, director of the Environmental Protection Agency, to toughen Federal smoking standards and increase financing for education about the risks of smoking. Teaching the public about the dangers of secondary smoke will receive special attention, the group said.
Dr. Aubrey E. Taylor, a physician who helped draft the paper, said that since the Surgeon General's report in 1964 reporting on the dangers of smoking, thousands of studies have shown that secondary smoke increases the risk of heart and lung disease.
Dr. Homayoun Kazemi, another physician who helped prepare the paper, said: "I don't think in 1992 we have to debate whether environmental tobacco smoke causes disease. The evidence is there."
That statement was sharply challenged by the Tobacco Institute, a trade group, which insisted that fewer than 100 studies had been done on the effects of secondary smoke. "The weight of the scientific evidence continues to show that there is no link," Tom Lauria, an institute spokesman, said of a tie between secondhand smoke and heart and lung diseases.
Anticipating that reaction, Dr. Lee B. Reichman, president of the American Lung Association, said, "Asking them about the effects of environmental tobacco smoke is akin to asking the fox about conditions in the chicken coop."
The paper was released at the same time as a public opinion poll that found that 9 in 10 people think secondhand smoke is harmful. The poll, based on a Gallup Organization sample of 1,067 adults, was commissioned by the heart association, the lung association and the American Cancer Society.
 
Added Risk Defined
 The paper concludes that about 50 million nonsmoking adults over the age of 35 are exposed to secondary smoke, and it estimates that about 50 percent of all American children live in families with one or more smokers.
According to studies cited in the paper, those people are 1.3 times more likely to come down with heart disease, lung cancer or other respiratory illnesses than are nonsmokers who live and work in primarily smoke-free environments.
Secondary smoke could contribute to the deaths of 40,000 nonsmoking Americans every year from heart disease, said Dr. Douglas C. Johnson, one of the paper's authors. The group also said evidence suggests that 3,000 to 5,000 people die from lung cancer every year as a result of exposure to smoke at home or in the office.
Cigarette smoking causes about 435,000 deaths each year in the United States. They include 200,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease, 100,000 from lung cancer and 80,000 from chronic lung disease.
"This news is the final nail in the tobacco coffin," said Fran Du Melle, deputy managing director of the American Lung Association. "The time has come to really clear the air in public places to protect the health of every one of us."

HEADLINE: Gunfire Shatters Peace and Lives In Washington

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Michelle Royster rapped her knuckles on the witness stand, the taps echoing like a drum in the quiet courtroom this morning as she imitated the sound of bullets fired at her car last year.
"There was not a long pause," Miss Royster said, calmly recalling the July night when a woman in another car was killed in the same crossfire near the Capitol. "I don't recall a stopping, a pure silence, just that I constantly heard shots." 
 The bullets that ripped through the other car hit the trunk, fender, bumper, license plate and eventually the driver's seat. Now four young black men are on trial for firing on Miss Royster and three others that night and for killing Marcia Williams.
 
An Everyday Shooting
 Trials of this sort draw little attention in Washington or most other major cities these days. Almost every day, children, families at home, people in cars and pedestrians fall victim to drug-related drive-by shootings, gang warfare and shootouts between people settling personal disputes.
The latest Federal statistics, which detail a nationwide increase in such shootings, have prompted the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association to label gunshot wounds and deaths a public health epidemic. Hardest hit of all the nation's urban centers is Washington.
In a study made public Tuesday by the National Center for Health Statistics, the firearm homicide rate in the District of Columbia was twice the average rate for 80 metropolitan areas studied from 1987to 1989.
Gun homicides were highest among black men from the ages of 15 to 19. In Washington the rate was 227 deaths for every 100,000 people; Los Angeles County was next with 226. The lowest rate in the study was 129 per 100,000, in Dade County, Fla., which includes most of the Miami metropolitan area.
These findings prompted the Journal and C. Everett Koop, a former Surgeon General of the United States, to call for licensing gun owners, who would have to meet qualifications similar to those for drivers' licenses: a minimum age and skill level, followed by periodic license review for violations that could lead to revocation.
In Washington, where the level of shootings spurred passage of limited gun control legislation last year, community leaders say they cannot do much more unless the Federal Government enacts broader restrictions.
But the only Federal gun-control proposal under consideration is the beleaguered Brady Bill, which would require a waiting period for purchases of hand guns. The bill, part of a larger crime package that the Bush Administration does not support, passed the House of Representatives last year but has stalled in the Senate.
 
Firepower Equals Respect
 In the District of Columbia Superior Court today, 19-year-old Thomas W. was waiting to testify as a witness in another trial involving a random shooting. "I know where I can get a nine millimeter gun for $100," he said. "I can pick it up today."
"Guns aren't just for gangs or drug dealers; it's everybody who's looking for a reputation," said the unemployed black youth, who declined to give his last name. "The more powerful the ammo somebody's got, the more respect he gets.
He said guns and gun fights have become the routine way to settle disputes in his inner city neighborhood in Southeast Washington, where the District's highest homicide rates are recorded.
"There are fights going on all the time, over everything -- if someone steps on my new shoes, or looks at me wrong," he said. "The attitude is, if I've got a gun, no-one will call me a punk. If my gun is bigger than yours, you won't mess with me."
 
Call for Federal Action
 Despite such attitudes, District Councilman James Nathanson said today that the medical journal report "gives us a glimmer of hope that we can get to the nub of the problem."
But he also noted a paradox: "If there is something on the market -- a toy, medicine, food -- that is a danger to public health, we are quick to do something to restrict, if not ban, the availability of the item.
"People need to come to understand there is a health menace out there," he said. "The menace comes from guns. It needs to be addressed at the Federal level. We can ban certain guns here, but we can't control neighboring states.
"And we have to have the government show leadership to fight the N.R.A.," he said, referring to the National Rifle Association's vehement opposition to any restriction on gun ownership as an infringement of constitutional rights.
Thomas W., a high school drop-out, said he had sold drugs to earn money, adding: "You can't get away from it, because it's everywhere.
"That's why I think I don't want any kids," he said as he described the cycle of violence and despair in his neighborhood. "Then I'd have to worry about them, about my wife. And if I get shot, what would my son do? He'll get a gun. Nobody can stop it."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Robertson Withdraws U.P.I. Bid

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
The television evangelist Pat Robertson withdrew his $6 million offer for United Press International today, insuring the end of the venerable but bankrupt news service as a worldwide presence and raising the possibility of a shutdown as soon as Friday.
In a statement issued early this evening, the news agency said, "If additional funds for U.P.I.'s operations are not found, U.P.I. will terminate operations on Friday, June 12, at midnight." Pieter Van Bennekom, the company's president, told employees to prepare for an orderly shutdown. 
 Mr. Robertson, who was the only bidder for all of U.P.I. at a court-supervised auction three weeks ago, said today that his team of lawyers and auditors had concluded that "the economics for us just don't seem to make any sense." He then offered to buy U.P.I.'s name and some other assets for $500,000, an offer the bankruptcy court rejected this afternoon.
 
Three Decades of Losses
 U.P.I. has run losses for most of the last three decades, and in the last 10 years has been been handed off through a succession of owners who all proved unable to turn a profit. With the collapse of the Robertson deal, the 85-year-old news agency remains $60 million in debt with almost no place to turn.
While U.P.I. has shown a persistent knack for escaping shutdowns and said today that it was still talking to alternative bidders, its prospects are bleak. In the court auction, the only bidders besides Mr. Robertson were companies that wanted to buy individual assets at prices ranging from $12,000 to $125,000.
The likely demise of U.P.I., at least as an organization with bureaus around the world, would mark the end of an news service that was first to report the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and scores of other major stories and also started journalists including David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite on their careers.
 
Scoops and Penny-Pinching
 In the annals of journalism, U.P.I. was uniquely scrappy, notorious for pinching pennies, but frequently managed to scoop its bigger competitor, The Associated Press.
U.P.I. news reports are received by 2,000 news outlets worldwide, said Steve Geimann, the agency's executive editor, who declined to say how many of those were broadcast stations. National Public Radio subscribes to U.P.I.'s service and broadcasts its reports during news broadcasts.
There is no longer much room for cutting costs without curtailing much if not most of U.P.I.'s network of correspondents. The staff has already been cut to 500 from about 1,840 in 1984, and reporters and editors, who were never well paid, are working under a 20 percent pay cut.
Mr. Robertson said his auditors had concluded that he would have to invest at least $31 million over the next 18 months in new technology and, even then, would not necessarily turn a profit. Among other problems, he said, about 32 percent of U.P.I.'s clients decided to drop the service because it no longer has the "depth and breadth" needed to compete with The Associated Press and other news organizations.
 
Victim of the Bottom Line
 Unless a buyer comes forward, or U.P.I. makes Draconian cuts to stop losing money for the first time in years, the lawyer representing the company's creditors said his group would have to cease operations.
"It's a terrible dilemma for us," said Dennis O'Dea, general counsel for the creditors, which include A.T.& T., GTE Spacenet and the union representing reporters and editors. "We do understand the desire of the company to remain in place, and we do feel a civic responsibility. But this is a very hard dollars-and-sense decision."
Mr. Van Bennekom, the U.P.I. president, said the company was still evaluating its options. "We of course had every intention of going through with this," he said at a news conference with Mr. Robertson. "This is not the desired outcome."
Many U.P.I. alumni said today's news was regrettable but not surprising, and some said the time had come to end the prolonged agony.
"It is time to turn out the lights and provide a decent funeral," said H. L. Stevenson, who served as U.P.I.'s editor in chief from 1972 to 1983. "The media in the last decade decided it could not or would not support the concept of two strong, competing wire services. It may be a year or two, but the result surely will be less information and less competition, and the loser will be the average reader or viewer."
 
'I Will Miss It,' Says Brinkley
 Mr. Brinkley, who worked for U.P.I. in Alabama in the 1940's and now is host of the ABC News program "This Week," said: "I will miss it, but I don't know how many others might. I don't think the public really pays attention to which news service writes the stories."
The end of U.P.I. would mark the end of a distinctively American institution with reporters who slaved to be first to bring the world news of major events. Founded as United Press by E. W. Scripps in 1907, it became United Press International in 1958 when it merged with William Randolph Hearst's International News Service. It was conceived as an alternative to The Associated Press, a cooperative news organization owned by its member newspapers across the country; U.P.I. always ranked second to A.P. in size and the number of subscribers.
Always struggling for profitability, U.P.I. developed a legendary reputation for its stinginess on expenses. At the same time, it invested heavily in building a worldwide corps of reporters and broke major news stories time and again. In 1940 a U.P.I. reporter, Edward Morgan, was the first to report the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico by agents of Stalin. Mr. Morgan went on to become a radio and television correspondent at ABC.
 
Pearl Harbor and J.F.K.'s Slaying
 For several days U.P.I. was also the only news organization at Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack in 1941. U.P.I. was also the first news organization to alert the world to the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas, a classic story of journalistic one-upmanship. The U.P.I. White House correspondent, Merriman Smith, was riding with with the press pool and grabbed the car's radio telephone before anybody else could move. To the furor of his rivals, he refused to give up the line as he filed an initial report.
The Scripps family sold U.P.I. in 1982 to two Tennessee businessmen, Douglas Ruhe and William Geissler. They filed for bankruptcy, and U.P.I. was subsequently bought at a bankruptcy sale in 1986 by a Mexican businessman, Mario Vazquez Rana, and a Houston developer, Joe Russo. In 1988 Mr. Vazquez Rana, who controlled 90 percent of the company, sold it to Infotechnology Inc.
Infotechnology filed for bankruptcy in August, and the company's creditors have been struggling to find a new buyer ever since.
Part of the problem is that U.P.I. was barred by the bankruptcy judge from talking to alternative bidders during the 30-day period that Mr. Robertson was given to analyze the company's finances. That left the company and its creditors scrambling for new investors with very little time remaining before it ran out of cash.
Steven Geimann, the executive editor of U.P.I., said he remained optimistic that a last-minute deal could save the company. "All afternoon we've been having discussions with groups interested, people interested, in doing a deal with U.P.I.," he said. "Given that there's still interest, I'm still optimistic."

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Poll Finds Skepticism in U.S. About Earth Summit

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Although Americans put a high priority on environmental issues, they are skeptical about whether President Bush will accomplish much at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.
Only 9 percent of those surveyed in a CBS News poll conducted from May 27 to May 30 said they expected the meeting to produce substantial results to help solve the world's environmental problems. Forty-seven percent expected the meeting would help a little, but 35 percent said they felt the session would have little or no effect. 
 This attitude appeared to be linked to Mr. Bush's low ratings on environmental issues, with 31 percent saying they approved of the President's policies and 55 percent saying they disapproved.
"I do not think that Bush plans to be an active participant at the summit," Ruby Cannon, a Federal employee in Portsmouth, Va., said in a follow-up interview after the survey. "I think he is just going for political reasons."
 
Upset Over Treaty Opposition
 Cindy Dowdy, an accountant in Lansdale, Pa., expressed a similar view. "I think international conferences are mostly for show," she said. "Bush did nothing on the environmental issue until it became popular again with the anniversary of Earth Day."
Ms. Dowdy also said she was upset that the United States had refused to sign a treaty to preserve living species.
The Bush Administration has said it opposes the pact, the biodiversity treaty, because it would interfere with American patent law protections and biological research.
But only 28 percent of those surveyed said they thought the treaty would give other countries too much say in the domestic policies of the United States, as against 47 percent who said they would not.
 
More Talk Than Progress
 The nationwide survey, conducted by telephone, involved 1,347 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The skepticism about the Earth Summit aside, the survey found that concern for environmental issues remained high despite the nation's lingering economic problems.
Asked if protecting the environment was so important that requirements and standards should be set regardless of cost, 67 percent responded in the affirmative. This is down from a peak of 80 percent reached just after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 but well above the 45 percent approval rating recorded when The New York Times/CBS News Poll first asked the question in 1981.
A sizable majority of those surveyed said they felt that Mr. Bush talked more about protecting the environment than he had accomplished. Seventy percent said the President had been insincere in his expression of support for environmental issues, as against 19 percent who said they believed he had made progress.
This represents an erosion of Mr. Bush's already low standing on the environment from early in 1990, when 24 percent of those surveyed said they felt progress had been made, while 62 percent said he had just talked about the issue but had done little or nothing about it.
"I do not think Bush has an environmental policy," said Karen Steigerwald of Auburn, N.Y., who works at the state prison there. "We need to do things things to stop the emission of greenhouse gasses and stop polluting the oceans. Acid rain, for example, is a big problem around here."

HEADLINE: House Debates Deficits and Proposed Balanced Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
For 10 hours today, the House of Representatives debated a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget, as its author declared that the change would "give us a constitutional reason to find the courage to make the tough choices necessary to balance the budget."
The House will vote on the amendment Thursday. Representative Charles W. Stenholm, the Texas Democrat who has forced the issue to the floor despite the House leadership's opposition, steadfastly predicted passage. He said he had the 290 votes needed to obtain the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution if all members vote. 
 Opponents, like House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, said the outcome was in doubt. "It is right on the margin," he said. "It could go either way."
 
Breadth and Thoughtfulness
 Circumstances favor the proponents, who came close to passage two years ago. Now they are on a political field where Congress is very unpopular, many members have problems with overdrafts at the House bank and Ross Perot, the probable independent candidate for President, has gained political weight from attacking the deficit.
Electoral arguments were often put bluntly in today's exchanges. "This is so politically popular in an election year," said Representative Jim Slattery, a Democratic opponent from Kansas.
A Republican supporter, Representative Carlos J. Moorhead of California, said, "It is a positive step to show the American people that we care."
The debate went back and forth with a rare degree of breadth and thoughtfulness. Ultimately the argument was over whether adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would make it more, or less, likely that the deficit would be reduced.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, said he was supporting the amendment, "not because I think it's all that good, but because I perceive a universal failure to make the tough calls."
 
Opponents See More Deficits
 Until now, he said, deficit reduction has failed because "we have tried to balance the budget from inside the Beltway without the force and the moral authority of a constitutional imperative to guide us." An amendment, he said, would tilt the balance so Congress could muster the will it now lacked.
Opponents said such an amendment would merely provide political cover for more years of big deficits. Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said it was merely a political gimmick. Because the deficit could be cut only by raising unpopular taxes or cutting popular spending, the only way reductions could come about was by "taking a political risk of defeat in an election."
Representative Leon V. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, complained that a rigid requirement of balanced budgets would threaten the economy and clutter the Constitution. "There are many members here," he charged, "who are willing to make a giant riverboat gamble with our economy and with our Constitution in order to inject courage into cowards and to place a spine into the spineless.
"The Constitution already provides power to the people to deal with the gutless," he said. "It is called the right to vote."
There are actually four potential amendments before the House, but Mr. Stenholm's is almost certain to be the one that is put to the crucial two-thirds vote, overcoming two Republican proposals. One Republican proposal would add a ban on spending that exceeds 19 percent of the gross national product; the other would impose ar three-fifths majority requirement for passage of any tax increase.
Mr. Stenholm's proposal is also expected to overcome a Democratic plan that would require the President to propose a balanced budget and prohibit Congress from deficit spending if he did not ask for it. It would also prohibit spending more than the President asked. Its main attraction is that it would put Social Security taxes and spending off the budget permanently.
Today's debate rarely focused on the differences between the competingproposals; attacks and endorsements were equally framed in general terms.
Another attack came from Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of New Jersey, who contended that the proposals should be called the "feel good amendment" because they did not include any mechanism that would actually make spending decisions.
But Mr. Stenholm cited the three-fifths majority vote required for deficit spending in his proposal as a useful mechanism. "By raising the threshold of difficulty for deficit spending," he said, "this amendment would prevent anyone in the executive branch or in Congress from ducking responsibility for the deficit."

HEADLINE: SCHOLARS SCORN BUDGET PROPOSAL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Among policymakers, economists and good-government groups, the idea of using the Constitution to balance the Federal budget is a matter of intense debate. But among scholars of the Constitution there is something approaching a consensus: it is not a very good idea.
From conservatives like Robert H. Bork, the former judge, teacher and Justice Department official, to liberals like Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard law professor who helped lead the effort to defeat Mr. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, the general view is that a budget-balancing amendment would be an empty promise that would demean the Constitution and invite chaos into the courts. 
 "The whole thing strikes me as potential for a big legal mess," said Mr. Bork, now at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. Professor Tribe, who favors a far more active role for the judiciary than Mr. Bork, said the proposed amendment would cause a "litigation nightmare."
 
Details to Come
 The proposed amendments now before Congress differ in details, but all would require Congress to balance Federal receipts with outlays each year unless 60 percent of the members in each chamber approved a deficit. But the proposals give no clue to how the the nation's deficit-heavy budgets would be balanced, how such a mandate would be enforced or what court would have jurisdiction.
Sponsors of the amendments say the proposals can stand on their own, but they also say they plan to develop legislation spelling out administrative details if a budget-balancing amendment is approved.
The House bill was introduced by Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, introduced companion legislation in the Senate, which is expected to vote next week. If both chambers approve by a two-thirds vote and three-quarters of the states ratify it, the amendment would take effect two years after ratification.
Constitutional experts find many faults with both proposed amendments, and most begin with a criticism that they are merely a promise with no plan. "Congress is saying, 'Once we have tied ourselves to the mast with this amendment, we will have the courage to not listen to the sirens of spending and won't get shipwrecked on another deficit budget,' " said Professor Tribe. "But the problem is that this amendment has no ties that bind."
 
Deluge of Lawsuits
 Professor Tribe and other experts said courts would not be able to enforce the amendment but would nevertheless be deluged with lawsuits challenging Congressional budget decisions.
The experts said the courts would not know if the amendment was being violated until the end of a fiscal year, adding that neither proposal gave the courts guidance about what to do if, in a previous year, Congress had run a deficit.
Courts would either decline jurisdiction over the political issue or else assume authority for erasing a deficit by eliminating programs or raising taxes, the experts said. Ultimately, the United States Supreme Court would be involved.
"I can just see the Supreme Court wrestling with the national budget," Judge Bork said. "It would tie them up in knots, and we wouldn't find out until fiscal 2005 whether fiscal 1995 met the amendment. And what would the Court do then?"
The amendment would also disrupt the traditional separation of powers by shifting responsibility for balancing the budget from Congress to the President as well as to the judiciary.
 
More Power for President
 "The amendment could be read as giving the President a back-door, line-item veto over the budget," said Walter Dellinger, a professor of law at Duke University. The President, he said, would be able to reduce expenditures in an enacted budget law because the President would have a greater obligation to uphold a constitutional amendment than a statutory law.
There are some constitutional experts who support such an amendment in principle while acknowledging the practical problems.
"Not every provision of the Constitution is fully enforceable," said Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of constitutional law at the Yale University School of Law. "Even if this proposed amendment weren't a cleanly workable political rule or an easily enforceable judicial rule, it might give some moral status and strength to the fundamental idea that it is wrong for us to finance current benefits on the backs of our children and grandchildren."
Roger Pilon, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, said Congress could easily circumvent the proposed amendment, but he sees value in it anyway. "After all, constitutions are efforts to write in stone for eternity what we haven't the will or discipline to write in sand at the moment," he said.
Michael W. McConnell, a professor of law at the University of Chicago, supports the idea of a budget-balancing amendment, but not the ones under consideration. "A good amendment would, in the event that a budget is out of balance, provide some political procedures for giving the President enhanced authority or for giving Congress some privileged status to cut spending," he said.

Amdura Cannot Explain Big Jump in Stock Price

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Amdura Corporation said yesterday that it could not explain why its share price had been zooming upward. But its big shareholders are taking steps to get in on the bonanza.
The Tulsa, Okla., company, whose shares leaped from $1.875 on June 1 to $8 on Tuesday, when the New York Stock Exchange halted trading, reported growing losses from its Harris Waste Management Group subsidiary. Harris makes waste-management equipment and has been suffering from a combination of recession and the effect of new environmental rules. 
 The company also said that it was not yet clear whether it would be able to meet interest payments due at the end of June on some debt, and that another debt restructuring was being considered.
The Big Board did not allow trading to resume, saying it expected another announcement from Amdura. That announcement last night provided additional details regarding its operating loss of $1.6 million in the final two months of 1991, after it emerged from bankruptcy protection.
Nothing in either announcement provided any evident reason for a rising share price, but the market reaction will not be clear until trading is resumed.
Amdura had imposed rules that barred its former creditors, who now own 87 percent of the company's stock, from selling those shares until 2006. But a majority of shareholders, including former creditors, have the right to waive that provision, and yesterday the company said a majority had decided to do that.
It was not clear if the waiver had taken effect, but Max Holmes, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, noted that one of the banks, Internationale Nederlanden Bank, had already notified the S.E.C. that it was considering selling part or all of its 17.7 percent stake. When the waiver does take effect, that would make a great number of additional shares available for trading, which could depress the stock price.
 
Risk of Losing Tax Break
 By allowing those shares to trade, the company risks losing some tax benefits. Under Federal tax law, companies that experience a change in control -- as could easily happen if the large holders sell shares -- lose the right to deduct some past losses against later profits, and thus risk having to pay higher taxes.
For the moment, however, Amdura would not seem to be in any danger of paying taxes. Yesterday's announcement said that in the first quarter, the company lost $1.1 million, on revenues of $31 million, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $259,000 on revenues of $37.5 million a year earlier. It said Harris was primarily responsible for the problems; its other major operation, the Crosby Group, reported improved results. Crosby is a maker of wire rope and chain.

HEADLINE: Libya's Press Hints at Westward Turn

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya, June 10

 BODY:
The official Libyan press, which unquestioningly echoes the views of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has criticized the Libyan leader's call for Arab unity as a "mirage" and has proposed reconcilation with the West.
At a time when Libya is under United Nations sanctions for refusing to turn over Libyans suspected of helping blow up American and French airliners, it was unclear whether the press criticism represented genuine rebellion or was part of a plan by Colonel Qaddafi to repair his ties to the West. 
 Most Western diplomats interviewed here leaned toward the second conclusion, and predicted that Colonel Qaddafi might soon announce a change in the country's policies and perhaps begin to edge Libya toward compliance with the demands of the United Nations Security Council.
In an article that first appeared on the back page of the weekly newspaper Jamahiriya on Tuesday and was reprinted on the front page of the country's only daily, Al Fajr al Jadid, on Wednesday, Colonel Qaddafi was accused of "following a mirage."
"We will not follow the mirage with you this time," the editorial said. "If this is your pan-Arabism, then follow it alone. Go wherever you wish, but none of us will follow you. We know now what is in our interest."
Another editorial in Al Jamahiriya suggested that Colonel Qaddafi could gain more by cooperating with the West rather than continue the futile struggle for Arab unity.
"We say to you, you are free, go alone to your Arabism and your Islamic links," the newspaper said. "As for us, we have America. It is much better for us to cooperate with America than with all the Arabs because we have realized that our own interests are above all else."
 
Text Called Unusual
 A senior European diplomat described the language of the articles as "very explicit."
"It is amazing, especially for the normal Libyan," the diplomat said. "I have never seen this kind of language."
Under the United Nations sanctions imposed in April, international air service to Libya was severed, its diplomatic corps abroad was reduced and all military sales to Libya were suspended. The Security Council ordered the sanctions because of Libya's refusal to extradite two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1989 bombing of a French airliner. The two bombings killed 441 people.
In official announcements and the state-controlled press, Libyans adopted a defiant stance both before and after the sanctions, blasting the United States and saying Arab leaders who urged compliance with United Nations demands were guilty of "betrayal."
But in criticizing the country's centrally planned economy, saying it has left store shelves bare or filled with "shoddy" goods, the Jamahiriya editorial said the economic sacrifices were made so that Libya could support other Arab countries and liberation groups.
In a second editorial in Jamahiriya today, the paper said that, because other Arabs failed to to realize all the sacrifices Libyans had made, the country was "demoralized."
"We have been stabbed in the back."
Despite their harsh words, Libyan officials and Western diplomats said they believed that Colonel Qaddafi had approved the editorial.
Colonel Qaddafi insists he is not a head of state but a leader who follows the dictates of the Libyan people, who are organized into people's congresses. The General Congress is scheduled to begin its yearly meeting on Saturday and will discuss economic reforms and what to do about the sanctions, according to Libyan officials.
Government officials contend that the editorials are part of a popular call to reverse past policies.
Despite a pervasive and often brutal security apparatus, Libyans are increasingly open about their distaste for Colonel Qaddafi's eccentric style of government. Many complain that the Libyan leader, who has ruled since 1969, has turned the country into a pariah nation, pouring millions of dollars into movements like the Irish Republican Army or the Palestine Liberation Organization while Libyan roads crumbled and the economy stagnated.
 
Sees Trade Union Officials
 The Libyan leader has been meeting over the last 10 days with trade union officials who have been shown on television complaining of poor maintenance and mismanagement of Government industries. Such public criticism is rare in Libya.
"He is trying to form a new populism based on self-criticism," said one senior Western diplomat. "His main goal is not his ideology, but survival."

HEADLINE: Record Profits for Banks in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Unusually favorable interest rates raised bank profits to a record in the first three months of this year, regulators said today, but much of the improvement is not expected to last over the longer term. .
The nation's 11,806 commercial banks earned $7.6 billion, up 36 percent from the comparable period last year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said. That topped the old quarterly record of $7.3 billion set in the first quarter of 1989. 
 The vast majority of the banking industry remains profitable, but a core segment remains vulnerable to possible insolvency, raising the prospects of a severe banking crisis if interest rates begin to rise.
Senior regulators warned that many large and smaller banks continued to be troubled by a high level of bad commercial real estate loans. More than 1,000 banks remain on the regulators' list of troubled institutions that could fail and they hold more than $600 billion in assets.
Still, 93 percent of banks were profitable, compared with 89 percent in the first quarter of 1991, and 73 percent reported earnings gains.
Recovery in that sector will be slow, particularly in the Northeast and Southern California, they said.
Regionally, 44 states recorded improved earnings. However, in California, where real estate problems hit later than in other parts of the country, profits slipped to $271 million, from $750 million in the quarter last year, a decline attributed to depressed results at five big banks.
The F.D.I.C. report showed the two biggest contributors to improved profitability at banks elsewhere were the direct result of the steep decline in short-term interest rates.
Banks' net interest margin -- the difference between the interest they charge on loans and the interest they pay on deposits -- widened to 4.31 percent in the first quarter, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 1988. That resulted in a $2.8 billion increase in net interest income over last year.
Also, falling interest rates sent bond prices up and bank gains on securities sales showed a $682 million year-to-year improvement.
 
If Interest Rates Rise
 "A sudden change to a less favorable interest rate environment could produce problems that are not currently part of the landscape," the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, William Taylor told the Senate Banking Committee.
A Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, responding to a question from Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, the chairman of the committee, indicated that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to reduce interest rates further unless the recovery unexpectedly fizzled.
Meanwhile, the country's 435 savings banks reported their first quarterly profit in three years. They earned $176 million in the January-March period, compared with a $184 million loss a year earlier. The F.D.I.C. attributed the swing to the Government's seizure of failed institutions.

HEADLINE: Looking for More Mouths to Feed

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Most businesses try to create a satisfied customer for life. But Gerber, the undisputed king of the $1 billion baby-food market, loses 10,000 gurgling, happy consumers a day. Why? They grow up and defiantly reject a diet of rice cereal and strained peaches.
So, in an ambitious plan to more than double its pool of potential customers, the Gerber Products Company will soon market a new line of vegetables, snacks and stews that it hopes will appeal to the more sophisticated palates of 2- and 3-year-olds. 
 But whether those children's parents will buy enough of the new product to justify Gerber's decision is far from certain. Despite its 72 percent share of baby-food sales, Gerber has a spotty record in its past efforts to expand beyond the bib brigade.
 
Nature vs. Nurture
 For the last 10,000 years or so, babies, once they develop teeth, have survived by graduating from milk and infant gruel to eating most of the same foods consumed by their parents and older siblings.
When told about Gerber's plans for toddler food, called Gerber Graduates, some nutritionists, parents and others were quick to criticize the idea as an example of marketing gone amok.
"It is a completely unnecessary product," said Kate Clancy, a professor of nutrition at Syracuse University. "It gives parents the impression that they are incapable of providing the right kind of food for their kids."
But Gerber executives dismiss such criticism as potshots from nutritionists living in a fantasy world, where parents are in the kitchen making homemade apple sauce and fresh steamed vegetables for their child each meal.
"Maybe those nutritionists' children have been eating fruit," said Steve Poole, a Gerber spokesman, "but most kids are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and SpaghettiOs and things that are not appropriate for them. I think those nutritionists are living in world that is somewhat false."
Gerber executives have high hopes for the product.
"It is the most important thing that we have launched since we basically invented the category of baby food in 1928," said James T. Smith, Gerber's president.
Mr. Smith said the Graduates rollout would be the most expensive product introduction in the company's history, although he would not disclose the marketing budget. Gerber, based in Fremont, Mich., will run its first network television advertising in several years when it introduces the product nationally this fall, he said.
The new line, whose 23 dishes include diced green beans, Cheerios-like cereal, turkey stew and baby-sized low-sodium hot dogs, will cost about $1 each.
Sales of Gerber's basic baby foods have been climbing steadily for the last few years, with sales last year of $650 million in the United States. But the company expects the Graduates line to add $400 million to $500 million a year in five years.
"We are trying to get people to feed baby food earlier and trying to get mothers to stay on baby food longer," Mr. Smith said. "We think it is nutritionally better for the child. It's obviously good business for us if we can extend that age."
 
Stock Is Favored
 Analysts familiar with the new food line are recommending Gerber stock, which closed yesterday at $62.125, down 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. If nothing else, said John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential Securities, the company's near-monopoly position in the existing market merits more recognition from investors.
The company is planning to start shipping Gerber Graduates to some grocery stores at the end of the month, with national sales planned for the fall.
Although Gerber says that consumers have requested such transitional foods for toddlers, the early informal reaction outside of Wall Street seems lukewarm.
 
Informal Poll of Parents
 When told about the plans for toddler cuisine, few parents said it was the answer to their prayers.
"Anything I eat, he'll eat," said Liz Marte, the 20-year-old mother of Timothy, an energetic 19-month-old in Manhattan. "I don't think he would like a hot dog in a jar." Her own diet includes pasta and chicken, she said.
There is no need for such products, said Wendy, a 31-year-old mother, sharing a lunch-time cheeseburger and fries at McDonald's with her 2-year-old daughter, Loren. "She'll eat anything now," said the mother, who would not give her last name.
No one is criticizing the nutritional content of Gerber Graduates, but Dr. Clancy and others say they are concerned that the new line will inflate the food bills of lower-income families, who tend to buy more baby food than more affluent consumers.
"Families that are lower income are already stretched," said Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington. "To saddle them with the added costs of food that they could easily prepare themselves is abusing the marketing system."
Even a Gerber study shows that baby food is more expensive per serving than fresh food prepared for a baby. Many of the entrees are also slightly costlier than similar servings of existing packaged foods, like Cheerios.
 
The Real-World Defense
 Still, the company says the higher cost of baby food is more than offset by its convenience and nutrition.
In the real world, Mr. Poole said, the alternative to the low-sodium foods offered in the Gerber line, was a dinner of "chicken wings or pork chops."
Regardless of the initial reaction to the new foods, some health advocacy groups say that expanding the baby food audience is far from the worst marketing threat to lower-income families. These groups point to the huge amount of liquor and cigarette advertising directed at poor people.
"Baby food is a good product," said Jane Delgado, president of the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, in Washington. "There are so many unhealthy products, we need to focus on those," she said, arguing that tobacco companies are the single largest sponsor of parades, street fairs and other events in Hispanic neighborhoods.
It is "intellectual imperialism," she said, to suggest that poor people could not make a reasoned judgment about whether the new line of baby foods made economic sense for them.
"Poor people make choices every day," Dr. Delgado said. "People will not make choices that aren't to their benefit."
She noted that fresh produce was often more expensive in poor neighborhoods, and that in families where the mother worked, it was unrealistic to think that fresh food could be prepared at each meal. She also said poor people typically shopped only once a week, making canned food more attractive.
 
In Search of New Mouths
 Gerber's enthusiasm for the new Graduates line may be tied to the company's strong need to find new growth markets, so to speak. The birth rate in the United States is expected to stay flat for the rest of the decade and the company already has 72 percent of the baby-food market in this country.
For the year ended March 31, Gerber Products had $1.2 billion in sales and profits of $127.5 million.
In the 1970's, the company tested Singles, a line of food for adults that was sold in baby-food-type jars. The line flopped, in part, Mr. Poole said, because the name Singles reminded elderly customers that they were eating alone.
The company also introduced the Chunky line of products for toddlers, in 1982. That has not sold very well either, and it will be largely phased out in favor of Graduates.
Gerber has also moved down the age ladder, entering the infant formula market several years ago by licensing the Gerber name to the Mead Johnson division of Bristol-Meyers.
Beech-Nut, a division of Ralston Purina and a distant second in the baby food market, said it was watching the Graduate line with interest. Responding to the Gerber test marketing, Beech-Nut started selling its Tabletop line of microwavable dinners for toddlers in 1990.
But Beech-Nut said it had no additional plans to pursue older kids. "We are continuing to focus on the infants," said Elmer Richars, a spokesman for Ralston Purina in St. Louis.
Gerber justifies its premium prices by pointing out that the products are specially designed for "little hands and mouths." For instance, the Graduates juice boxes are much narrower than regular juice boxes, making them easier to hold. And its pretzels are designed to crumble rather than to break into sharp edges when bitten.
That was not enough for Toni Bernstein, a Manhattan mother of two children under 3 years old. "In a pinch, I might pick one up," she said. "But I wouldn't be a regular user."

HEADLINE: Blue Chips Tumble, With Dow Down 26.70

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell sharply yesterday for the second straight session, as fears about corporate earnings and Federal Reserve policy mounted.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 26.70 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, at 3,343.22. 
 New York Stock Exchange volume was a heavy 210.8 million shares yesterday, compared with 191.2 million Tuesday, when the Dow registered its biggest loss in two months, 34.21 points. Decliners outpaced gainers by 1,121 to 587 on the Big Board.
Much of the Dow's losses came in the final hour of trading.
"It looks like they broke some support on the downside," said Paul Hennessey, a vice president in trading at the Boston Company.
Robert Caputo, director of research at the Swiss Bank Corporation's Investment Banking Inc., said investors were nervous about corporate earnings. "We're starting to see question marks about pumped-up expectations for the second quarter," he said. "That's really been troubling the market."
He noted that analysts had cut estimates for some paper and specialty chemical companies.
While the Federal Reserve has said inflationary pressures are modest, recent gains in the prices of oil and other commodities have fanned market concerns about the price picture.
Mr. Caputo said the Fed's hints that credit policy was on hold had also depressed the market.
Drug stocks, hit hard for the last week, continued their downward course.
"Some people are disappointed that some of the strongest growth stocks of 1991 are not performing well," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities.
Among individual stocks, Telefonos de Mexico topped the active list, slumping 2 3/8, to 51 7/8. Rumors swept the United States market that the company's union would sell some of its stake in the company. The union denied the speculation.
Technology Solutions tumbled 5 1/2, to 14 1/2. It expects to have a write-off of receivables and contracts in the 1992 fiscal year but does not believe the write-off will have a negative effect on net income for the year.
International Paper gained 1 1/2, to 66 3/8. Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the company.
Among drug and medical-related stocks, U.S. Surgical lost 3 1/8, to 106 1/4; Critical Care lost 2 3/4, to 37 1/4, and Medical Care International fell 2 7/8, to 56.
Morgan Stanley cut airline earning estimates, citing recent fare wars. AMR fell 1 1/2, to 63 1/8; Delta Air Lines eased 1 3/8, to 57 1/4, and UAL fell 2, to 115 7/8.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks ended down 2.81 points at 407.25. The American Stock Exchange index fell 2.93, to 390.13.
The Nasdaq over-the-counter index fell 4.09, to 569.71.

HEADLINE: Earthmovers' Keeper;
Designated Worm Tender Is State Champ

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Consider the lowly worm. Taz Guishard did, and now he's a state champion.
Thirteen-year-old Taz, a seventh grader at Dr. Alfred M. Franko Middle School here, is the appointed worm keeper for the after-school ecology club, Kids for the Earth. 
 He tends the bin in which several thousand red worms work, turning food scraps into compost at the rate of a pound a day. A pound of worms, munching on the school's lunch leftovers in a covered wooden bin, can provide all the soil the students need for growing marigolds on the windowsills in the computer room. Not coincidentally, that is where the club's sponsor, Patricia Monahan, teaches.
Taz, an honor-roll student, makes sure the worms' shredded newspaper bedding stays moist enough. He feeds them fat-free garbage, which keeps the computer room from smelling rotten. He has learned enough about the scientific principles of vermicomposting, or recycling with worms, to discuss the topic with anybody.
 
Illustrated Talk
 Phyllis Feingold, a home-economics teacher at Franko, recently took Taz to a state meeting of the Future Homemakers of America in Albany, where he competed in an event called Illustrated Talk Junior, using posters and charts to describe vermicomposting to a panel of judges.
His competitors discussed such topics as teen-age pregnancy, vegetarianism and child abuse. Taz won the event, bringing home a certificate and pin for himself and a trophy for Franko, which is a magnet school for math, science and the performing arts.
"He was adorable, personable and well versed in his subject matter," said Patricia Colasacco, a home-economics teacher at Harrison High School in Westchester County and a judge at the event. "He had a lot of personal charisma for someone on that age level."
With school winding down, Taz has more time to think about his next adventure, a trip to Chicago in July to compete with his worm talk at the National Meeting of Future Homemakers of America. Ms. Feingold said she would accompany him, and there has been an outburst of fund-raising at Franko.
The school band is pushing flowers and candies. Other students are making ponytail holders to sell, and still others are seeking donations. The goal: at least $1,300 to pay Taz's way.
 
Faculty Is Involved Too
 The faculty has also gone into high gear. Roy Thomas, a drama teacher, said he would help Taz make better use of his illustrations and loosen up his body movements. His advice to Taz before the Albany competition, Mr. Thomas said, was "to live honestly with his own feelings, to believe in what he had to say and to make sure his listeners got the point."
Meanwhile, Taz keeps up with his duties as keeper of the worms. Holding them in his hand is not a required part of the job, he said, but he likes to do it anyway even though it does "feel kind of funny to have them wriggling."
He seemed not to fathom why some people, including his own mother, wouldn't like the creatures Ms. Monahan calls "the earth's best recyclers."

HEADLINE: Brighton-by-the-Sea Housing Proposal Endures a Stormy Hearing

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Amid renewed pressure on developers to scale back their proposal once again, nearly 300 people crammed into a hearing room before the New York City Planning Commission yesterday to praise and decry plans to replace the historic Brighton baths with a large-scale housing development.
The rancorous daylong hearing at City Hall was the last public forum before the commission casts a crucial vote next month in the longstanding debate over the project -- one of the most contentious issues to come before the commission since it assumed expanded powers under the new City Charter. 
 Earlier this week, Richard L. Schaffer, chairman of the commission, told the developers, Alexander Muss & Sons, that the plan to build 1,600 luxury and middle-income apartments in five high-rise towers needed some modifications.
But as he stood before a throng of Brighton Beach residents, community advocates and construction workers, Stephen Muss, the company's president, said he would not change his plan for Brighton-by-the-Sea. It is the third time Mr. Muss has submitted the plan, though it has been scaled down since it was first introduced in 1986.
 
General Support
 If approved by the commission, the plan will be taken up by the City Council and a final decision will be made by mid-September. Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, has not taken a public stance on the project, though a cadre of other politicians, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn and Councilman Samuel Horwitz, who represents the Brighton Beach area, have voiced general, if not explicit, support for it.
Some members of the Planning Commission say privately, however, that they will vote against the project -- which they believe is still too big, too exclusive and in need of more environmental safeguards -- unless changes are made.
But Mr. Muss said that if the plan was rejected, he would give up.
"There are no more concessions which can be made which will not strike a vital organ," said Mr. Muss, a towering man with snowy white hair, who drew cheers from 60 construction workers lining the back of the room and muttered aspersions from rows of elderly residents in the front.
 
'Our Last Plan'
 "The compromise that is before you is, as I have said before, our last plan," he said.
Those in favor of the project, which would replace the decaying Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club with towers of up to 29 stories, repeated their praise for it as an economic boon for the low- to middle-income neighborhood that is home to thousands of Soviet emigres.
"Those of us who support Brighton-by-the-Sea, who would, in fact, welcome Brighton-by-the-Sea, want to enhance the flavor of the Brighton Beach community and strengthen Brooklyn as a whole," said Mr. Golden, whose testimony was met with calls that his time be cut short.
But when Mr. Shaffer reprimanded the audience, Mr. Golden countered, "I have no problem with the crowd -- they are from Brooklyn."
 
Environmental Problems
 Opponents, including the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach & Manhattan Beach and the Parks Council, argued that the project posed social and environmental problems, especially for the local sewage plant, which they said was already working above capacity.
"We oppose Brighton-by-the-Sea because it disrupts the balance in favor of private interests and ignores the city's public policies for the waterfront," said Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council, which has submitted an alternative plan for the site.
At an hourlong meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Schaffer met with the developers and members of the Parks Council to discuss whether modifications could be made to the Muss plan. But Shelly Friedman, Mr. Muss's lawyer, said there was nothing to discuss.
"We heard their presentation," he said, "And Mr. Muss concluded that there was nothing in it that commended itself to further discussion."

Gotta Have a Gimmick? These People Can Help

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
A licensee's search for new product tie-ins can last a lifetime, or sometimes beyond. The makers of leather jackets, cowboy boots and beer have all persuaded Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle maker, to lend its name. But when a maker of gravestones asked to use its distinctive logo, the company decided that licensing should stop at the cemetery gate.
After the licensing industry's first annual sales decline on record, and several costly merchandising flops, apprehensive licensees have now hit on a novel idea: Why not come up with products that actually have some practical use? 
 The change in outlook reflects the shift to value-conscious consumption. "The tone of the times is different now," said Edwin D. Rice, an executive director of the Landor Associates marketing consulting firm in San Francisco. "If a licensed item is seen as kind of frivolous junk, then it's not likely to be successful."
 
Conference in Manhattan
 Many of the hundreds of companies gathered at the New York Hilton this week for the 12th Annual International Licensing and Merchandising Conference are choosing products more useful than the usual stuffed animals and balloons shaped like Saturday morning cartoon characters.
Several American companies whose very names connote solid, practical values were at the show for the first time, offering goods designed to last.
The Old Farmer's Almanac has licensed its name and distinctive cover image to a broad range of products ranging from fertilizers and garden hoses to eggs and oatmeal. An Old Farmer's Almanac Baking Soda Toothpaste is planned.
And the Formica Corporation, the plastic laminate company, is planning to license a full line of cups, wastebaskets, fabrics, napkins and wall paper, based on designs in its archives. Since Formica just signed a licensing deal last week, products are not expected for a year or two.
Last year, licensed products emblazoned with images ranging from Playboy bunnies to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles accounted for $63.5 billion in sales, according to the Licensing Letter, a Brooklyn newsletter that tracks this huge industry. But this total represented a 4.5 percent drop from 1990, the industry's first decline in the 15 years that it has kept records. The culprits were the recession and the failure of several movies to live up to their sales-generating expectations.
Marketers are now careful not to lend their name to products that might sully their image. During the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, the commission was approached by a coffin maker wanting to sell commemorative coffins for people who died during the statue's centennial year.
 
Occasional Close Calls
 Such notions are usually rejected outright, but occasionally a product gets dangerously close to the shelves before alarms go off.
Warner Brothers licensed Street Kids Inc., a Los Angeles company, to make and sell corn chips in the shape of the Batman logo, with the distinctive name Bat Chips. Warner recently demanded that the snack be named Batman Tortilla Chips instead.
Not that all the talk of practicality will keep licensees from churning out the usual knickknacks, whose value can be expected to last at most a season. The talk of the licensing conference, which ends today, has been the huge up-front guarantees that Warner Brothers is demanding from companies that want to sell shirts, jackets and mugs tied in with the release of "Batman Returns" next week. The original Batman movie was a merchandising phenomenon, accounting for $500 million in sales, nearly twice the box office take.
It is not clear whether the sequel will compel consumers to buy more Bat products. "The whole world of licensing is holding its breath," said Seth Siegel, president of the Beanstalk Group, a licensing consulting firm in New York.
 
Huge Deal for Batman T-Shirts
 Licensing experts point to "Willow," "Hook" and "Dick Tracy" as movies that failed to live up to their merchandising expectations.
In such an uncertain business, licensing executives were stunned by the reported $6 million advance payment that the Shirt Shed Inc. T-shirt company of Wabash, Ind., gave Warner Brothers to make "Batman Returns" shirts.
Lance Walsky, president of the United Brands International clothing company, said the $6 million guarantee was the largest apparel licensing deal he knew of. About 20 million T-shirts were sold in conjunction with the first Batman movie. Mr. Walsky estimates that Shirt Shed has to sell 11 million to 14 million shirts to break even.
No matter whether bats rule the licensing industry this summer, a number of companies are betting that dinosaurs will next year. MCA/Universal is already signing up toy and video game companies for next summer's release of "Jurassic Park," a Steven Spielberg movie based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel about an experiment with dinosaurs.

Money Market Funds Show Continuing Declines in Yield

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered on money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down in the latest week.
Analysts said that tax-exempt money fund yields, down for the fifth time in six weeks, were showing the effects of a shortage in new municipal issues that seemed to be accelerating. 
 About the general level of interest rates, Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, said: "There are some in the market that believe good inflation numbers and weak money supply will force the Fed to make an accommodation and lower rates further. Unfortunately, I don't share those feelings."
The seven-day compound average yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 22 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.71 percent, as the simple yield dropped a similar amount to 2.67 percent. During the same period, the 30-day compound average yield fell 11 basis points, to 2.94 percent, and the simple yield was down a like amount, to 2.90 percent.
Analysts at Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios was down by one day, to 50.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.76 percent, while the equivalent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.92 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund provided the best return, at 3.63 percent, but still more than 10 basis points below last week's best and in line with what happened to yields in the category.
The Salomon fund, of course, had the highest yield among funds that invest only in New York issues, while Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Porfolio, gave the best return for funds dealing in Connecticut paper, at 3.04 percent. For New Jersey it was the Calvert Tax Free Reserve New Jersey Portfolio, with a yield of 3.14 percent.
 
Taxable Funds' Assets Drop
 In tracking the taxable funds for the week ended yesterday, Donogh ue's said assets declined by $4.8 billion, to $488.1 billion. Out of that, institutional assets accounted for a $4.4 billion drop, to $164.6 billion, while retail assets were down by $400 million, to $323.5 billion.
For taxable funds the average seven-day compound and simple yields were each down 4 basis points, to 3.51 percent and 3.45 percent, respectively, while the 30-day compound and simple average yields, which lag by a bit, were both down a basis point, to 3.55 percent and 3.49 percent, respectively.
And as in the previous week, the newly formed Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the best return of the funds surveyed, with a yield of 4.48 percent.
By comparison, the average yield on bank money market accounts, a prime competitor of the money funds, stands at 3.37 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Go Lower Again

BYLINE: BY KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved lower and interest rates inched higher again yesterday, but the movement carried little weight because trading volume remained extremely light.
The pace of business should quicken today, because the Government is expected to release fresh economic statistics, including retail sales and producer price data for May. 
 Concern that those figures may be more robust than consensus estimates was behind the selling that took place yesterday, some traders said.
"The market is afraid of the numbers," one government-securities trader said. "You can almost taste the worry."
In advance of today's reports, most analysts are estimating the Producer Price Index rose by three-tenths of a percentage point last month, and that retail sales increased by five-tenths to six-tenths of a percentage point.
 
Fed Changes Policy
 Market participants paid little attention yesterday to comments by a Federal Reserve Board governor, John P. LaWare, who confirmed before the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank had suspended its policy of cutting interest rates to invigorate the economy.
Similarly, traders and analysts said there was little reason to put much credence in Congressional efforts to produce a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget.
"If there were some enforcement provisions in the amendments, the market would have taken note," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But there is no timetable. I think there is hope for a real attack on the deficit, but it won't be mounted by the current leadership in Congress."
Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, said that unlike the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing legislation of the 1980's, the current amendments would have no immediate impact.
"At the outset Gramm-Rudman was not purely symbolic, because initially it was a vote for budget cuts now," he said. "The current effort is all symbol, and the market is wary of it," he added.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 1016/32 , down 7/32 , to yield 7.89 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Tuesday.
 
Treasury Notes
 Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 1003/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 7.34 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 1003/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 5.07 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills rose marginally.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.67 percent, up one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.80 percent.
New-issue activity remained heavy in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, as just under $1 billion worth of new debt securities were priced.
Among the issuers was New York State, which sold $250 million worth of general obligation bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Chemical Securities Inc. won the securities.
They were reoffered to investors with yields from 4.10 percent on bonds maturing in 1994 to 5.15 percent in 1997, 5.95 percent in 2002 and 6.50 percent on bonds maturing from 2013 through 2022.
The issue is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Corporate Bond Issue
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Shearson Lehman Holdings Company priced $200 million of five-year noncallable notes through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
The 7 5/8 percent notes were priced at $99.408 to yield 7.77 percent, 1.18 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt bonds said that prices of most outstanding bonds in both markets were little changed on very thin trading.

HEADLINE: Countrywide Credit's Net Soars in Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif., June 10

 BODY:
Countrywide Credit Industries, the nation's largest independent mortgage banker, said today that its earnings rose sharply in its fiscal first quarter as it made a record number of loans.
The company reported earnings of $29 million, or 81 cents a share, in its first quarter ended May, compared with $9.1 million, or 36 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. "Countrywide's record production for the first quarter of $6.5 billion and a servicing portfolio that topped $33 billion is an achievement that results from our steadfast commitment to being a low-cost and efficient producer and servicer of mortgage loans," said David Loeb, Countrywide chairman. 
 Following the earnings report, Countrywide's stock gained $1.50 but settled to a gain of 12.5 cents, closing at $31.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company also announced a 3-for-2 stock split, which is subject to shareholders' approval of a sharp increase in the number of common shares to 240 million from 40 million currently.
Countrywide said the $6.5 billion in loans written in the first quarter represented a sharp increase over the $1.8 billion a year ago, when the recession weighed on the economy, particularly on the real estate market.
The economy has registered steady growth since February and economists are betting that second-quarter growth will exceed the first quarter's.
Many believe the Federal Reserve will succumb to election year pressures and move to lower interest rates again, adding vitality to the real estate market.
The company said its revenues climbed to $103.6 million, from $43.7 million in the first quarter of 1991.
The company sells and services loans for single-family homes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher yesterday in technically driven trading. Gold prices were mixed.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $337.90 a troy ounce, off 40 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $337.75. 
 The dollar rose at the expense of the German mark, which came under profit taking after a week of steady gains. The mark has drawn repeated support from Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty for European political and economic union.
"Some of the concerns over monetary union have dissipated," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "So the movement of funds into marks has faded a little bit."
Some traders were awaiting the release today of producer prices and retail sales figures for May to lend the dollar some direction. But others said the dollar was likely to remain in a narrow band as uncertainty remained over European unity.
 
Late Dollar Rates
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.42 yen, up 0.19 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.60 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.55 yen, up from 127.50 yen on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5925 German marks, up from 1.5915; 1.4520 Swiss francs, down from 1.4550; 5.3590 French francs, up from 5.3550; 1,204.25 Italian lire, up from 1,204.00, and 1.1928 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1924.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $337.75 a troy ounce, from $338.15 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $337.75 an ounce from $337.65. In Hong Kong, gold rose 44 cents an ounce to close at $338.48.
Silver for current delivery on the Comex in New York settled at $4.052 a troy ounce, up from $4.041 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Pop Concerts Shake Off Last Summer's Malaise

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
With summer about to take center stage, the seasonal crush of pop concerts is on. The Grateful Dead will play Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday and Monday, and U2, Guns 'n' Roses and Metallica will follow them to the stadium in the next two months. Bruce Springsteen, meanwhile, will kick off a six-city North American tour with 11 concerts at the Brendan Byrne Arena in the same complex starting July 23.
That such big names are even touring this season qualifies as a positive sign. Last summer was the worst in memory for live pop performances. Stadium tours were virtually nonexistent as many of the bigger acts in rock chose to stay home, postponing record releases and tours in the hope that the faltering economy would improve this year. 
 The dearth of top-drawer names and of discretionary income kept fans away. Some shows were canceled because of poor ticket sales while others limped along with less-than-capacity houses. Promoters went bankrupt.
Compounding the situation were higher costs of producing shows, caused in large part by the promoters' fierce competition for the talent that was available, which drove up artists' fees and ticket prices.
The result was that gross ticket sales declined close to 25 percent, to $830 million from a record of $1.1 billion in 1990, according to Pollstar magazine, a trade publication that covers the concert industry. Only 37 concerts grossed more than $1 million last year, compared with 92 the previous year.
 
Listing the Worst
 Things were so bad that the North American Concert Promoters Association, comprising the country's leading promoters, took the unusual step of identifying its members' 10 least profitable tours last year and saying that rising booking costs for artists had contributed to the dismal summer. The association said that its members lost more than $4 million on 47 acts it surveyed.
While not providing figures on individual acts, the association identified the least successful tours as those of Diana Ross, Huey Lewis and the News, Whitney Houston, David Lee Roth and Cinderella, the Doobie Brothers, the Operation Rock 'n' Roll show with Alice Cooper and Judas Priest, Amy Grant, Alabama, Steve Winwood and the Club MTV Tour, which featured Bell Biv DeVoe, Tony! Toni! Tone! and C & C Music Factory.
The most notable exception in last year's dismal climate was the Grateful Dead. The group's large and intensely loyal following of Deadheads pushed it to No. 1 on Pollstar's list of the 50 top-grossing tours of 1991. The Dead, who sold out nine consecutive shows in Madison Square Garden last summer and were virtually the only act to play stadiums, brought in $34.7 million for their approximately 75 North American dates in 1991. This year their Sunday show is sold out but there are still seats available for Monday.
The year had a sobering effect on many promoters, some of whom predict that ticket prices in most cities will go no higher than last year's level, which averaged about $25, and that promoters will think twice before paying high guarantees. Jim Koplik, the president of Metropolitan Entertainment, a large concert-promoting concern in Montclair, N.J., said last year's experience made his company "much more conservative."
"We're passing on a lot more artists this year than we normally do," said Mr. Koplik, whose company is one of the nation's highest-grossing concert-promotion organizations. "We're saying no to high guarantees that artists are asking."
 
Competition Still Strong
 Nevertheless, competition for artists is said to remain intense, especially among promoters who have built expensive amphitheaters, warm-weather stages whose whole year can depends on the success of summer shows. These arenas are known as sheds in the trade and typically range in size from 10,000 to 20,000 seats, compared with the 60,000-plus seating capacity of stadiums. (Amphitheaters in the New York area include Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, L.I., and, in New Jersey, Waterloo Village in Stanhope, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel and Meadowlands Summerfest, a temporary setup on the grounds of the Byrne Arena.)
To stay afloat financially, many amphitheaters try to squeeze in as many shows as possible in the summer, banking not only on ticket sales but also on income from concessions, especially the three P's: popcorn, peanuts and parking. "They're looking to get as much traffic into their buildings as possible," said Jane Cohen, an associate editor of Performance, a concert and touring trade journal.
"Because they don't want any empty nights, they end up booking acts that may not be appropriate," she said. "So a venue with 16,000 seats might end up half full. They drive up their own costs by competing against one another, which can give artists a false sense of what they're worth. It becomes a vicious cycle and the promoters wind up being their worst enemy."
Harry Leff, vice president of Beaver Productions in New Orleans, one of the nation's top promotion organizations, said of promoter-owned amphitheaters, "They will book just about anybody."
Added the company's president, Don Fox: "There's a saying, 'When the band is dead, play the shed.' "
Nevertheless, some of the bigger names in pop, including Jimmy Buffett, John Mellencamp, Natalie Cole and Bonnie Raitt, play the amphitheaters; all of them will appear at the Jones Beach amphitheater this summer.
 
Problem of Guarantees
 In the concert business, artists receive a percentage of the gross receipts but are guaranteed a minimum fee. Some top-tier groups demand as little as $25,000 for an arena show, but guarantees can go as high as $250,000 for groups with a large following, even if they haven't attained superstar status. The site of the concert is also get a guarantee. The promoter, who puts up the guarantees, takes whatever is left, typically 15 percent.
Bidding in some markets with more than one amphitheater is said to be so aggressive that acts used to settling for $20,000 elsewhere can get as much as $150,000. Even many booking agencies, whose job it is to obtain high fees for the performers they represent, are concerned about the situation. Ian Copeland, a partner in the Intertalent agency, whose clients include R.E.M. and Sting, said that fees "in some cases have been exorbitant" and that people in the concert industry owed it "to each other to protect the environment so that we don't kill the golden goose."
Besides the comeback of the stadium tour, this summer will offer more concert "packages": Guns 'n' Roses with Metallica, for instance, the Blue Music Festival '92 tour, which will feature Ray Charles, B. B. King, Buddy Guy, Dr. John and the Fabulous Thunderbirds, and the Flavor Unit Tour with Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature, Black Sheep and House of Pain.
Last year's most successful package, the Lollapalooza tour, will be back, too, but with a different cast of characters. The 1991 version had as its headline act Jane's Addiction and packed arenas by presenting an assortment of art-rock, psychedelia, rap, hard-core and collegiate rock. Acts included Ice-T, Nine-Inch Nails, the Henry Rollins Band, Living Colour and Siouxsie and the Banshees, most of whom had rarely been heard on commercial radio stations, some, never. There was a nonmusical element, with political organizations, body piercers, craftsmen and others hawking their wares.
This year's lineup includes the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ice Cube, Ministry, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and the Jesus and Mary Chain, as well as charity gambling booths, organizations on both sides of the abortion debate, the National Rifle Association and groups advocating handgun control, AIDS awareness, voter registration and other causes.
"Concert promoters are entrepreneurs looking for a new way to attract an audience," said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar. "The advantage of Lollapalooza is that they're trying to do more than provide a musical experience. It's something of a cultural event. That was a strong factor in successful concerts in the 70's. Going to a concert used to be an experience, a cultural statement. That's one reason the Grateful Dead are so successful; they're a cultural phenomenon."

A Cheaper Tape
The rapid drop in price of many videocassettes from $20 to under $15 over the last year raises the possibility of further reductions. Could there be, for instance, a $10 movie?
The answer is yes, but there is a catch. Rank Video Services America, the largest tape duplicator in the country, is putting movies on tape using a process that could lower the cassette price to $9.95. The problem is that the video and audio quality are not as high as on standard tapes. 
 Rank, which makes standard tapes for many studios, is working to improve a tape-recording process called extended play, sometimes referred to as superlong play. Extended play slows the recording speed by one third so more images can be packed into less tape. The crowding markedly reduces quality.
David Cuyler, Rank's executive vice president, said in a telephone interview that several small adjustments in manufacturing had greatly improved the image. "It's not as good as standard play," he said, "but it's acceptable."
At present the old extended-play format is used for some categories of B and public-domain movies and some children's programming. Studios have had little or no comment on Rank's new version. Because of studio economics and extended play's reputation for poor quality, big movies, new and old, are likely to remain in the higher-priced standard-play format.
But Rank and the studios do envision using improved extended play for releases of less popular catalogue films that might find a market at a low enough price.
"There are a lot of unreleased films in our library from the 60's and 70's with limited appeal that we might try at the extended-play price," said George Feltenstein, vice president of MGM/UA. "But never a classic."
 
A Niche in the Extinct
 Like many small video companies, First Run Features has found a niche. The New York theatrical film and video distributor specializes in, among other things, reissues of films that were released and dropped years ago and now are hard or impossible to find in video stores.
Past examples include Bertrand Tavernier's "Coup de Torchon" and most recently there is "Hester Street" (1975), Joan Micklin Silver's critically acclaimed film about a young Jewish immigrant who fights to keep her identity on the Lower East Side in the 1890's.
First Run Features began by distributing tapes to individual customers who asked for them. "Now we've pushed into stores," said Lisa Burkin, director of video sales. Titles are for rent and are priced accordingly ("Hestor Street," for example, is $59.95). "We've even gone to four-color boxes," Ms. Burkin said.
 
New Video Releases
 
Naked Lunch
1991. Fox. $94.98. Laser disk, $39.98. 1 hour 55 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
With a flair for the grotesque, David Cronenberg turns William S. Burroughs's autobiographical novel into a monster movie all his own. Bill Lee (Peter Weller), a New York exterminator, and his wife, Joan (Judy Davis), ingest a narcotic bug powder that makes large insects of their associates and eventually leads Bill, like Burroughs himself in 1951, to shoot and kill his wife during a performance of their William Tell act. Fleeing to a region called Interzone, Bill tries to write "Naked Lunch." Wisely avoiding the hallucinatory rantings of the book, Mr. Cronenberg concentrates on the writer's life and comes up with a "screen style as audacious as Mr. Burroughs is on the page" (Janet Maslin).
 
The Ballad of the Sad Cafe
1991. Columbia Tri-Star. $89.95. 1:40. PG-13.
Simon Callow's film faithfully follows Carson McCullers's novella about a raw-boned, strong-willed Southern woman in the 30's (Vanessa Redgrave) who takes leave of her hard-headedness long enough to fall for a hunchbacked dwarf (Cork Hubbert). Ms. Redgrave's ranking as an English lady of the theater doesn't stand her in good stead here, nor does McCullers's firm prose, which takes routes through the romantic imagination no adaptation can readily follow. In the hands Mr. Callow, a fellow Briton also poorly matched to the material, the film is "not silly as much as it's majestically wrongheaded" (Vincent Canby).
 
The Wages of Fear
1953. Home Vision. $39.98. LD (Voyager/Criterion), $59.95. 2:28. French with English subtitles. No rating.
A new digitally mastered tape offers a fresh look at a classic thriller about four losers who jockey two truckloads of nitroglycerin, threatening to blow at every pothole, across 300 miles of wild terrain. Mario (Yves Montand) dominates the quartet, which includes an aging Parisian con artist (Charles Vanel), a sentimental Italian (Folco Lulli) and a German loner (Peter van Eyck). Henri-Georges Clouzot's film has about everything from basic violence to a whiff of existentialism and homosexuality (in parts cut from the original in the 50's but restored here and newly subtitled). But the star is the truck ride, "one of the most remarkable examples of nonstop movie wizardry ever seen" (Canby).
 
The Wolves
1971. World Artists. $79.95. 2:11. Japanese with English subtitles. No rating.
The Japanese have their gangster films, too, and in this one rival gangs in the 1920's battle each other with swords and daggers over matters of family and gangland honor. Confusing but never boring, Hideo Gosha's film is "a most peculiar mixture of stylized prettiness and blood and gore" (Canby).
 
Truffaut's Passions
 This week Home Vision, a Chicago distributor, announced a new Francois Truffaut series with nine of the director's films on remastered tapes with newly translated subtitles. The first of the videocassettes, $39.95 each, will be released in August, and the rest are to follow over the next six months. They will be available on disk as well from Voyager/Criterion.
THE 400 BLOWS. In the first of Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films, the troubled teen-ager Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud) turns to crime. 1959. 1:44. No rating.
SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER. The target (Charles Aznavour) plays in a bar and tangles with gangsters. 1960. 1:25. No rating.
JULES AND JIM. Jeanne Moreau heads a tortured triangle in France before World War I. 1962. 1:50. No rating.
THE SOFT SKIN. A writer (Jean Desailly) has an affair with a stewardess (Francoise Dorleac). 1964. 1:58. No rating.
LOVE ON THE RUN. In the final Doinel film, Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud) reviews his checkered love life. 1979. 1:30. PG.
THE LAST METRO. This is the first version to be subtitled instead of dubbed. A theater director's wife (Catherine Deneuve) hides her Jewish husband from the Nazis. 1981. 2:13. PG.
THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR. Married to other people, a man (Gerard Depardieu) and his former lover (Fanny Ardant) become next-door neighbors and resume their affair. 1981. 1:46. R.

HEADLINE: Tall Ships to Sail Nationally on Public TV

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
The procession of tall ships scheduled as the highlight of the Fourth of July weekend activities celebrating the 500th anniversary of the journey of Columbus is to be broadcast nationally on public television, via WNET-Channel 13.
The station stepped in this week to become the official broadcaster for Operation Sail, the group organizing the weekend events, after negotiations with the national broadcast networks fell through. 
 "We had hoped to sell the rights to one of the networks to be our official broadcaster," said Alfred Vanderbilt, the chairman of the television committee for Operation Sail, "but with the present economic and world situation, that didn't work out."
Channel 13 acted at the urging of its president, William F. Baker, who proposed what he called "a kind of C-Span coverage," featuring a single strategically placed camera to capture the entry of the tall ships into New York Harbor.
"Then I learned even minimal coverage might cost us as much as $850,000," Mr. Baker said. The financially strapped WNET could never have covered that expense.
Operation Sail then called together all the local television stations in New York and suggested a coverage pool, in which each station would take a different camera position, and all the coverage would be sent through Channel 13. Each station would then take whatever amount of coverage it wanted. Channel 13 is to provide five hours of live, continuous coverage, beginning at 9 A.M.
"Every station in the city has agreed," Mr. Baker said yesterday. "This represents the entire television media of New York coming together to help with what should be a happy event for the city. New York has been on its tail for some time. New York needs something like this to be a happy event."
Channel 13 has also reached an agreement with WQXR-FM radio to simulcast the event and provide a classical music background to accompany much of the coverage.
Mr. Baker himself is to act as host of the event for Channel 13, which will make the coverage available via satellite to every public television station in the country and to whatever foreign broadcasters are interested.
The station's cost will still be about $200,000, Mr. Baker said, but he expects contributions from corporations to cover that amount. Among the companies that have already agreed to back the project are McGraw-Hill, Chubb Insurance, Goya Foods and Circle Line Tours.

HEADLINE: Still Punishing Haitian Victims

 BODY:
Only one consistent principle seems to drive the Bush Administration's approach to Haiti: Make life harder for ordinary Haitians -- whether they are struggling to survive at home, escape by sea or keep up hope in barbed-wire refugee camps.
Has America grown so impotent or indifferent that it will not face down the thugs who hijacked Haiti's infant democracy last September? Has the lamp of liberty so dimmed that desperate Haitians now cannot be granted the same temporary safe haven offered to Cubans, Dominicans, Liberians, Kuwaitis and other uprooted peoples? 
 The Bush Administration's behavior invites the ugly conclusion that diplomacy and America's best traditions have been subordinated to an election-year determination to appease the farthest far right in Florida. It's now up to Congress to demand decency for refugees and a more determined approach to restoring democracy in Port-au-Prince.
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's seven-month rule was dangerously flawed. Father Aristide openly condoned vigilante violence and scorned the elected legislature. Still, his Government was one of the most honest and least violent Haiti has ever had, and certainly the most democratically legitimate.
A revived democracy will require new safeguards against political vendettas. That probably means stationing an international peacekeeping force in Haiti for a long transition period. But the precondition to any acceptable solution is to compel the September coup-makers to accept President Aristide's return to power.
Washington's half-hearted efforts could be taken more seriously if the Administration pressed its European allies to support economic sanctions. The present effect of the sanctions is perverse. The military regime is still getting oil, the rich can still buy luxury goods, but the rural poor are suffering new hardships.
Haitians have been fleeing their country's poverty and violence for years. The coup added new terror. The Bush Administration, even as it condemns the coup and imposes sanctions, stubbornly denies this reality to avoid its obligation to provide temporary safe haven.
In its panic over refugees, the Administration abuses principles America has struggled to uphold elsewhere. Claiming that the Haitians are mostly economic rather than political refugees, it sends them back, ignoring credible reports of reprisals against returned refugees. Refoulement, diplomats call this abhorrent practice, turning people back to face persecution. That violates human decency and international law. Yet that's what America has been doing.
Now the Administration does still worse, intercepting refugee boats as they leave Haiti. The occupants are sent, or taken back, given no chance even to seek sanctuary. Such callousness evokes the "Voyage of the Damned" of 1939, when the Roosevelt Administration turned back a ship full of Jews fleeing Hitler.
Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, has introduced legislation to halt this shameful interdiction policy. It would grant Haitians temporary safe haven until democratic rule is restored and expand refugee processing facilities. The Democratic leadership has been slow to schedule action. The bill deserves quick and wide support.
Something more important than election-year politics is at stake. Call it human decency.

HEADLINE: Growing

BYLINE: By Anne Raver

 BODY:
AN iris likes to sit on the ground the way a duck sits on water: half in, half out.
"That's what the old-timers say," Cousin Bobby said. "Irises like sun on their rhizomes, so set them so they show through the soil." 
 I remember my first iris, wondering what to do with the knobby root that isn't a root at all, but a rhizome or stem that is planted horizontally just beneath the surface of the soil. Shoots grow up from this stem; the roots grow down. And somehow, I never felt very confident about setting it in the ground until the duck analogy.
We'd taken a ride over to Bobby's Maryland farm at the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain to see his irises. He has 500 kinds (they're like potato chips, he says: you can't have just one), all in raised beds, each with an engraved metal tag. Names like Loop the Loop (white with dark purple edges) and Spartan (deep red with chocolate overtones) and Touche (a beigy-lavender-bluish-violet affair that looks like Billie Holiday singing in a bar).
But even a silky deep purple beauty like Dusky Challenger has a hard time competing with a mountain. Sugar Loaf is like Maryland, more rounded than craggy, and the hills of Bobby's farm flow toward it like green waves. It's hard to do much else but look.
"When I moved in here 25 years ago, I knew this is where I'd spend the rest of my life," said Bobby, who spent 30 years as an extension agent for Montgomery County in Maryland. He's 60 years old and retired now, but he still keeps about 25 Holsteins. (His cow Amy was grand champion at the state fair in 1974; she was like living art, Bobby says, just like his irises.) And even his big sister Janice, who's only a year older, says that Bobby's soil beats hers.
"It's the raised beds: he can till that soil with his hands," she said, staring at one of Bobby's favorites, Touch of Blue. It's like the sky on a clear day.
We had come to see the irises, but there were so many other distractions, like the deep pink and white lupines rising like so many flowered church steeples on the slope facing Sugar Loaf.
Come by in a week or two, Bobby said, when the seeds are ripe: "I'll give you some pods. All you have to do is roll them around in your hands and scatter the seeds." His voice drifted off as we watched a chimney swallow perched at the round door of her nesting box jab food into a number of pink gaping mouths.
"I want to see a bluebird," said my mother, with that same longing one feels when the smell of the ocean wafts into the car but you're still miles away.
And I kept wandering back to the vegetable garden to have another look at the six great blue-green cabbages growing to perfection in a tiny four-by-five-foot raised bed, the hefty Vidalia onions, the mounds of bronze fennel that just keeps reseeding itself every year, the lovage that looks like a tree-size stalk of celery (put a few leaves in with the fresh trout when you're poaching it, Bobby says), the chamomile, which like the Johnny-jump-ups has turned into a welcome weed here.
It's not any one thing at Bobby's place that weaves the spell. It's everything together. Like learning how to put a little borage in with the chamomile when you make tea. Or how to set a few pieces of black rubber hose around the strawberry patch. They look like snakes, and the birds don't stop for berries. Janice taught him that.
There is a feeling of deep contentment emanating from this land and from Bobby, who, like Janice, was born a farmer and will die one.
"After I graduated from college, I came home to help Dad on the farm," he said. "But you know how it is when you have a lot of brothers and sisters, and they all have different ideas about the place. . . . Leaving was one of the hardest things I ever did."
But when you long for something, it may come to you in a different form. Bobby got a master's degree in agricultural economics in the early 1960's when farm land was disappearing so fast the state was losing 10,000 acres a year. "Every morning at the extension office, we'd talk about what farm had caved in," he said.
And the speculators, to keep their taxes down -- to farm levels -- were asking farmers to farm the land they no longer owned. "I was a moonlighter, farming at night," he said. And he plowed the foot of Sugar Loaf for years, without knowing about the house. Then one day, deer hunting, he came upon it: A low-slung house with huge windows, lost in the brush.
"It was all grown up like a wilderness," he said. "The door was open, and the heat was on." A little foot trail led from the house to an old shack up on the hill. If you have only an outhouse, an unoccupied bathroom is irresistible.
Bobby moved in that winter and started bush-hogging the briars. And two years ago, when the investors put it up for sale, he bought the farm in cooperation with a land trust, so houses will never be built on these fields. Which is another reason for the deep contentment here.
But back to irises, which don't like fancy soil.
"I just went out with my bucket loader and took soil from the field and dumped it on top of the ground here," Bobby said. (You may not have a plain old field or a bucket loader, so just hold off on the aged manure.)
The beds are about eight inches deep, and the irises stand 15 to 18 inches apart.
"They do not want anything on those rhizomes except sun," Bobby said. "So keep the beds clean."
A little lime discourages rot disease, which sometimes attacks the rhizomes, especially if it's been rainy. But just scrape the rot out, he said, and soak the infected rhizome with a solution of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water.
Irises are really very easy to grow, Bobby says, once you realize something. That a plant -- or a cow like Amy -- is not an "it" at all, but a Thou.

HEADLINE: A Corporate-Tax Approach To Curbing Executives' Pay

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Of all the recent proposals on ways to rein in executive pay, the one included in the recently passed House unemployment bill was perhaps taken less seriously by business than just about any other.
Yet, for all its problems, its progress in the House underscores that the solution it proposes makes some economic and political sense. 
 The much-misunderstood provision is aimed at helping the Government raise an estimated $2.1 billion of the $5.8 billion that the House bill would cost to provide extended unemployment benefits. The change in tax rules, which is expected to raise corporate taxes by about 2 percent, would apply to companies that pay individual executives more than $1 million in any one year.
Though it would not prohibit companies from paying whatever they felt appropriate, it would limit the amount they could deduct from their corporate taxes to $1 million an executive.
Until Tuesday, when the House passed the bill by a strong margin, many people involved in the executive-pay debate, from academicians to compensation consultants, were quick to scoff at any attempt to dictate an arbitrary limit on what companies should pay top executives, and to use the tax code to back it up.
And they were confident of their ability to convince Washington that such a proposal would be completely ineffective in curbing high pay, since companies would either find ways around the legislation or simply expect shareholders to shoulder the added cost.
"Will it make any difference?" asked Michael H. Walsh, chief executive of Tenneco Inc., of the House initiative. "No. Companies will still have to pay what the market requires."
He, for one, said it would simply promote a "new craft of consultants who can figure out compensation that's legal but not included" for purposes of the bill.
Even one of the more prominent critics of executive pay, Graef Crystal, predicts that the bill will be a "dismal failure" as an incentive for companies to curb high pay. He noted how little the Government's recent efforts to disallow lucrative severance agreements affected behavior: companies absorbed the costs on their own tax returns and even paid executives more to compensate for the extra taxes they would owe personally.
Still the bill's defenders say the proposed changes would be far more fair than the system now in place, because, they say, it would shift the burden of those high salaries to the shareholders who employ those executives and away from taxpayers at large.
Shareholders, who until now may have been complacent about policing those salaries, would suddenly have an incentive to pay more attention to the bottom line and complain when compensation deviates from performance. And if they still felt that this or that executive was worth millions, their companies would be free under the law to pay it.
"Shareholders are going to hold the company more accountable than the taxpayers are," said Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research center that supports the provision. "In terms of general tax fairness, and who is bearing the brunt of the costs and who is receiving the benefits, it seems appropriate."
The proposal is also often attacked as being inferior to several others making their way around Washington and corporate board rooms. They include improving the information that companies routinely disclose to their shareholders and to regulators in Washington and beefing up the powers of the Internal Revenue Service to more closely scrutinize executive compensation at specific companies.
That said, there is nothing stopping lawmakers or Corporate America from adopting any other measures they think helpful, in addition to the one in the job bill.
 
Symbolism Called Valuable
 "I tend to think the types of actions that others might characterize as purely symbolic, that they in fact do send important messages and do rein folks in over time," Mr. Shapiro said. And he added about the House measure, "It doesn't mandate anything but suggests that the Government thinks this is a problem and does directly decrease the incentive for a company to pay that much."
Whether the Senate agrees with that logic will become clear today, when the Senate Finance Committee considers its own unemployment bill. Because the latest version of that bill would provide $400 million less in unemployment benefits than the House bill, the Senate could decide to leave executive pay alone, though House aides say that asking the employers of some of the country's wealthiest citizens to help bear the cost of the jobless benefits is only fair.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Undeclared Candidate;
Perot Pledges No Tax Rise, Except in 'Emergency'

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

 BODY:
Ross Perot, whose position on raising taxes has shifted in recent years, said yesterday that, as President, he would "absolutely not" raise taxes, except in the case of "an incredible emergency."
Mr. Perot went on to pledge not to raise taxes in any event without some unspecified form of advance "clearance" from the American people. At the same time that he promised to hold the line on taxes, Mr. Perot also said during a two-hour television appearance that while he opposed the balanced budget amendment defeated yesterday in the House of Representatives, he would favor laws that outlaw deficit spending and require a balanced budget. 
 Mr. Perot said it would be possible both to cut taxes and reduce the deficit -- a goal that eluded President Ronald Reagan -- by forming a national "consensus" about targeting waste and cutting spending.
"Then we'll work our way down to where the big money is," he said, "and there is a huge amount of waste in the way the system works now." [Excerpts, page A14.]
With his broad-brush proposals on taxes and a wide range of economic and social issues on the NBC program "Today," Mr. Perot provided the most far-reaching plan to date for how he would govern as President. But he offered no clues on what his ideas would cost, how much they might save or how he would secure Congressional approval of them.
Those proposals, ranging from continued support for legal abortion to the prevention of foreclosure on the farm mortgages of Persian Gulf veterans, amounted to a prescription for radical changes in how the Government operates.
The undeclared Presidential candidate followed his usual practice of omitting details about budget and tax proposals and how he would shape legislation. Instead, he offered the kind of sweeping overview normally associated with party platforms.
 
A Mix of Proposals
 But taken together, the outline sketched by the Texas businessman showed that he was proposing a mix of Democratic and Republican proposals that would inject the Federal Government into the center of managing the economy and the practices of American business.
On social policy, Mr. Perot would depart strikingly from current Republican policy on abortion, which he said must be "a woman's choice."
On guns, Mr. Perot, who has yet to support any gun control legislation, repeated his assertion that he wanted to "get the guns out of the hands of violent people." But he offered no proposals to achieve that goal.
On the economic side, Mr. Perot called for something akin to the Democratic proposal for an industrial policy that would provide freer credit and tax breaks for small businesses and involve the Government in long-range planning with major corporations.
Mr. Perot saved his sharpest partisan shots for President Bush and the Republicans. He said he would outlaw lobbying for foreign governments by former Government officials, contending that the Bush campaign was rife with such lobbyists. He also accused Mr. Bush of encouraging the growth of Iraqi military power and then hiding the details of American relations with Saddam Hussein under a false cloak of national security.
The attacks on Mr. Bush drew a sharp retort from the Bush campaign, whose spokeswoman zeroed in on Mr. Perot's lack of detail and his changing tax position.
Torie Clarke, press secretary for the Bush campaign, said of Mr. Perot: "The guy is full of ambiguities and hypocricies and delusionary tactics. He's trying to make people believe things are happening that are just not true. The stuff about farmers being pulled off their farms because of the war and losing their farms when they got back, that's just not true. They're apocryphal anecdotes. A couple of years ago, he was saying tax increases are the only way to go. Now you can't tell where he is."
Ms. Clarke asserted that there were "no specifics" in what Mr. Perot has to say. "It's very hard to react to Ross Perot because you can't figure out where he is on anything," she said. "Let's have Ross Perot deliver a budget like the President's, of comparable size, with comparable specifics and then we'll talk. Let's see if he has any clue how to run this country and address the tough issues."
In 1987, Mr. Perot wrote in an op-ed article for The Washington Post: "We must cut spending and raise taxes to pay our bills. We all know it."
Yesterday, he said he would only support a tax increase during wartime. "You've got to stop raising taxes," he said. "You've got to bring discipline. So, unless there's some kind of incredible emergency that I can't envision, absolutely not."
 
'Get Rid of the PAC Money'
 He said he would "get rid of" political action committees. He and his employees have supported the committees with large contributions as far back as the Nixon Administration.
He linked such reforms to controlling spending. "Get rid of the foreign lobbyists," he said. "Get rid of the PAC money. Pass a law to stop deficit spending. Pass another law to balance the budget. He added, "If you want to raise taxes, you have to come to the people and get their clearance because you haven't been responsible."
It was unclear if Mr. Perot, in speaking of "clearance" was talking about a referendum or some kind of testing of public opinion involving his idea of televized "town hall" meetings to shape national policy.
Aides to Gov. Bill Clinton, who appeared Tuesday on "Today," said the Democrat was working this morning and did not see Mr. Perot. But these staff members said the Dallas businessman's lack of specificity showed the weakness of his candidacy.
"He's Ronald Reagan without the substance," said Paul Begala, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton. "There's just no there there."
Mr. Perot has made many of these same policy recommendations in other forums. But in sitting down for two hours and answering questions from viewers and from the co-host of "Today," Katherine Couric, Mr. Perot gave what may have been his largest audience ever its most detailed look at his economic plans.
 
On Social Security
 At the same time, the Texas billionaire, who at times appeared uncharacteristically nervous, verbally dodged and weaved when it came to issues in which his views seemed less well-formed or areas he deemed less important.
For instance, when a viewer from Vero Beach, Fla., asked whether his plan to save $20 billion in Social Security payments meant cutting off benefits for retirees earning more than $60,000, Mr. Perot spent several minutes rambling about the generosity of Americans, the people who fought in World War II and Korea and the preoccupation of people with their grandchildren. He even recited a few lyrics from "Tomorrow," a song from the musical "Annie."
"Are you satisfied with that answer?" Ms. Couric asked the caller after Mr. Perot finished.
"Well, he didn't really answer the question," the caller replied, forcing Mr. Perot to say that he might ask elderly people making over $60,000 to give up their benefits voluntarily.

HEADLINE: Balanced-Budget Amendment Fails to Gain House Approval

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
A proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget fell short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage in the House of Representatives today, after which the measure died for the year when its Senate sponsor announced he would not seek a vote there.
Though a significant majority of representatives supported the amendment, the vote was a surprising Congressional repudiation of national polls showing similar public support and of the widespread expectation here only weeks ago that House passage was certain and Senate approval very likely. But once those impressions spread around the country, opponents inside and outside Congress worked energetically to defeat the plan. 
 The amendment, which would not have gone into effect before 1998, would also have to be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.
 
Short by Nine Votes
 Responding to insistent lobbying by the Democratic leadership and groups representing retired and elderly people, as well as to arguments that the proposal would hamstring the economy, the House came up nine votes short of the two-thirds majority required under the Constitution to approve an amendment.
The vote was 280 to 153, with 116 Democrats and 164 Republicans voting for the amendment and 150 Democrats, 2 Republicans and an independent voting against it. [Roll-call, page B8.]
Some Republicans suggested afterward that while they had lost the vote, they had won a useful campaign issue. Indeed, it not only set them apart from most House Democrats, but it also distinguished President Bush, who urged passage of the amendment, from his two likely challengers, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Ross Perot, who both said the amendment was unnecessary.
Mr. Bush, who appealed for votes personally this morning before leaving for Panama, issued a surpisingly nonpartisan statement from his campaign headquarters. He praised Republicans and Democrats who "voted for America's future" and said the 153 dissenters had mistaken "the will of the American people." He emphasized that the amendment had come "within a few votes" of passage, not that it was rejected.
 
'Garlic in the Window'
 In the House, opponents of the amendment contended that it would really do nothing to reduce the Federal deficit. Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, called it "the constitutional equivalent of hanging garlic in the window to ward off vampires."
Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said: "No amendment balances the budget. No amendment makes the tough choices that need to be made."
But the sponsor of the measure, Representative Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, asserted that passing the amendment was an essential first step. "Change is in the air," he declared on the floor of the House.
Representative Bob Smith, an Oregon Republican, said passage of the amendment would show that the House believed that "fiscal responsibility is a duty, not a dodge."
After the House vote Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat who was the measure's leading supporter in the Senate, said: "There's no point in bringing it up this year. I intend to bring it up next year. Obviously, I'm disappointed."
Mr. Simon and his Senate allies could have pressed for a vote, hoping that the Senate would pass the amendment and send it to the House, where political circumstances and the approaching election might change votes. But he decided against that course, and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, welcomed his choice.
The amendment defeated today would have imposed, beginning in the fiscal year 1998, a requirement that the President propose and Congress adopt budgets in which total outlays did not exceed receipts. An exception could have been made only if three-fifths of the members of both houses had voted to allow deficit financing. An increase in the national debt would also have required three-fifths votes in both houses.
 
The Democratic Strategy
 There were several elements to the Democratic strategy to defeat the proposal. One of the most blatantly political was the assertion that the amendment threatened Social Security.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, offered a substitute proposal that would have permanently exempted Social Security taxes and payments from the budget, so there would be no opportunity to cut benefits to reduce the deficit.
While the proposal was overwhelmingly defeated in mid-afternoon, 327 to 103, it provided political cover for some nervous Democrats who voted for it and against the Stenholm measure.
Groups representing the elderly were mobilized to telephone wavering members. And Representative Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat who survived a primary vote last week despite her connection with the House bank and post office scandals, rose near the end of the debate and warned, "Don't let them raid the Social Security trust fund!"
House members were also warned repeatedly of likely tax increases if a balanced-budget amendment was made law. They further charged that it would make it impossible to deal with future recessions, because a minority could prevent deficit spending.
 
Tax Increase Predicted
 Representative Les AuCoin, Democrat of Oregon, argued it would lead to "a staggering tax increase and leave us with a wrecked economy."
Lobbying by groups such as those representing elderly and retired people helped get the Democrats to a point to block passage. Perhaps equally effective was the decision by the United States Chamber of Commerce to oppose the proposal because of a fear that it would lead to increased taxes. That provided more cover for Democrats who were uncomfortable with the amendment, but needed more reasons.
That was the especially true for the 12 Democrats who had co-sponsored the proposal but ultimately voted against it. "I'm very disappointed that many of our co-sponsors switched," Mr. Stenholm said grimly.
His office identified the 12 as Representatives Frank Annunzio of Illinois, Joan Kelly Horn of Missouri, Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania, Albert G. Bustamante of Texas, Jim Olin of Virginia, Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin, Robin Tallon of South Carolina, Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Tom Lantos and Matthew G. Martinez of California, James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado.
With only two Republicans, Representatives Bill Green of Manhattan and Benjamin A. Gilman of Orange County, voting against the measure, Democrats made an easy target for charges of partisanship.
 
Gingrich Leads the Attack
 On the House floor, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, began the barrage by saying, "If you think a huge Federal debt is O.K., vote no."
After the vote Representative Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania followed up, saying: "It hurts the Democrats badly. If George Bush picks up on this as a theme it could help him enormously. All the President has to do is remind Americans of the Democrats cheering at the defeat of something 80 percent of them want."
But the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, scolded Mr. Gingrich on the floor, saying he was guilty of "oversimplification and nonsense."
Mr. Foley said: "We all want to see the deficit reduced. We must do it." But he added, "Let us summon the courage that is rhetorically abroad in this House today and apply it to the task of reducing the deficit, of restoring fiscal sanity to the country, but let us do it by sparing the Constitution."
 
New Legislation Planned
 One early step is a promised collaboration between Mr. Panetta and Mr. Stenholm on new legislation intended to make it easier to cut the deficit, even without a constitutional amendment. Another area for Congress to demonstrate its budgetary intentions is the year's run of regular appropriations bills, which are just starting to come up for votes.
The Stenholm proposal was actually put to two votes today. First it was adopted as an amendment, after the defeat of the Gephardt proposal and two other plans. But when that vote came out at 279 to 153, it was clear that the margin was not close enough to hope for the two-thirds majority on final pasage, and Democrats cheered.
They cheered again a few minutes later when the final 280-to-153 vote was announced.
The first two proposals rejected were similar to the Stenholm amendment, but with some variations.
 
Line-Item Veto Rejected
 One of them, sponsored by two Republicans, Representatives Jon Kyl of Arizona and George F. Allen of Virginia, was rejected, with 258 voting against the proposal and 170 for it.
The proposal would have limited Federal expenditures to 19 percent of the gross national product and given the President a line-item veto that he has long called for, under which he could reject particular parts of an appropriations bill instead of having to accept or reject the entire measure.
The other proposal, offered by Representatives Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, and W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, Democrat of Louisiana, was also rejected, but by a slightly closer vote, with 227 opposed and 200 in favor.
This measure would have prohibited Federal revenue from growing faster than the increase in national income, except by another three-fifths vote, thus making it much harder to raise taxes as a way to balance the budget.

HEADLINE: Despite Distrust, Most Panamanians Seem Friendly to U.S.

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
The protests in Panama during President Bush's stopover there yesterday underscored lingering resentment against the United States in some sectors at a time when most of the Panamanian nation seems to look to Washington with friendly eyes.
The protests could have evolved from a number of sources. One would be supporters of the former military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was captured in the American invasion of December 1989 and tried and convicted in Miami on drug-trafficking charges. 
 But such people do not seem to be numerous. No one demonstrated in his favor when General Noriega was convicted this year.
A Government official recently said most Panamanians viewed the American invasion as a belated righting of an old wrong: the rise to power of General Noriega in 1981 and the long United States tolerance of his excesses in exchange for his help in gathering intelligence.
Another source of continuing distrust of the United States is a group of old-style leftist professors in the national university and their student supporters. The academic world was the brewing place for the strong nationalism of the 1960's and 70's, but it was largely quieted by the Panama Canal Treaties in which the United States promised to hand over control of the canal by the end of this century and close its military bases in the former Canal Zone.
Panamanian political leaders now say that the leftist influence in the university is on the decline and that a recent poll among academicians found that many of them share a widespread national feeling that the United States should not completely pull out of Panama when the canal passes to Panamanian sovereignty.
 
A Long Connection
 In 1903 the United States, under President Theodore Roosevelt, conspired with leaders of what was then a region of Colombia to break the area off and create the independent nation of Panama. That led to construction of the Panama Canal and produced a nation tied to the United States by an umbilical cord that is still not completely cut.
President Guillermo Endara was elected in the last year of the Noriega Government, but was denied the right to take office until the United States invaded and installed him in power.
His Government has been exceptionally dependent on American aid and advice as it rebuilds economically and politically. The President, his key aides and the American Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, have breakfast together once a week in a meeting that many Panamanians view as the place where important decisions are made.
Although Panama has made a remarkable economic recovery from the invasion and the two years of economic decline that preceded the military action, President Endara has been sharply criticized as ineffective and directionless, particularly by the Christian Democratic Party, originally an important part of his coalition.
Despite the strong economic growth in the last year, it has not been fast enough to soak up all of the unemployment. The Balboa area at the northern end of the canal has suffered the most, with unemployment there estimated as high as 50 percent, which has produced regular street protests in recent months.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Pact on Environment Near, But Hurdles on Aid Remain

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 11

 BODY:
A multibillion-dollar aid package to help save the developing world's environmental resources took shape here today as national leaders began to arrive for the Earth Summit's concluding phase.
After working through the night, negotiators were said to have agreed on almost all aspects of an ambitious package of measures to promote environmentally sustainable development in the poorer south, but officials said the United States contribution was likely to be small.
Negotiators still struggled to resolve their differences over the aid that the wealthier industrial nations of the North would offer the poor nations of the South to offset the extra cost that the latter face for safeguarding the environment and preserving disappearing forests.
 
Talks Through the Weekend
 As a result of the standoff, the Earth Summit's chief organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, announced today that negotiations would continue into the weekend so President Bush and other leaders can help shape the final compromise.
"Involving the heads of state and government personally will give us a better result," Mr. Strong told a news conference today. "By Sunday we hope they will have produced a full agreement for approval by the summit's final plenary session."
But diplomats said the decision to involve heads of state and government in the final talks reflected the intractable difficulties that had arisen and that could now be resolved only by compromises at the highest political level.
As their price for agreeing to Agenda 21, the plan for making economic development environmentally sustainable, developing countries want the industrialized world to meet a 20-year-old commitment to raise its aid to seven-tenths of 1 percent of economic output by 2000, from four-tenths of 1 percent at present.
 
How Much Is Wanted
 They also want donors to enlarge the size of the $1.3 billion Global Environmental Facility that they set up three years ago in the World Bank and to add a special "earth increment" to the World Bank agency that supplies loans on easier terms so it can provide virtually free environmental aid to the very poorest nations.
The United States, which has contributed $50 million to the Global Environmental Facility so far, is prepared to consider an increase and is ready to study an "earth increment," officials say. Washington is also offering $150 million in new aid to help developing countries safeguard their forests.
But today the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Michael Young, reiterated Washington's long-standing refusal to accept any target for its overall aid, arguing that such targets do not reflect the developing world's ability to absorb the money. He also said such loan commitments absolve poor countries from the need to attract foreign investment.
Instead, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, presented a plan to carry out quickly a new convention curbing emission of the so-called greenhouse gases; most of the plan had already been announced.
Mr. Reilly also said President Bush would propose a global inventory of biological resources when he addresses the Earth Summit on Friday.
European and other Western countries, which have all accepted in principle the aid target of seven-tenths of 1 percent, are now trying to convince leaders in the developing world that donors will increase environmental aid to secure an agreement here -- even if many will not commit themselves to reach that figure by a particular date.
Several delegations have already indicated that their leaders may present new aid offers when they address the Earth Summit. As a result, developing countries say they are waiting to see just what is offered.
"We want to see what they come up with, so the negotiations will go on for another day or two," said Jamsheed A. Marker, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations, who is also spokesman for the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves.
 
An Offer From Japan
 Japanese officials have said Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa plans to announce an increase in the amount of environmental aid that Japan offers to developing countries to $1.4 billion a year over the next five years, from about $800 million a year between 1989 and 1991 .
But in order not to embarrass President Bush, these officials say, Mr. Miyazawa will probably delay announcing plans to raise Japan's total development aid to $70 billion during the coming five years, from $50 billion over the last five years. The announcement could come in early July at the Munich summit meeting of the seven major industrial democracies.
The 12 members of the European Community are also putting together a $4.3 billion package of environmental aid projects, which they plan to present at the final sessions.
While the package will include both existing projects and some new money, European diplomats hope it will encourage developing countries to compromise on their demands.
 
Forest Talks Also Blocked
 The continuing standoff over money has contributed to the stalemate between North and South over steps to preserve the world's forests.
Tonight a senior United States official said Washington had virtually abandoned its hopes of securing a firm commitment to negotiate a binding international convention to safeguard forests.
"We are not going to get a convention," the official said. "It's too much of an article of faith for the Group of 77.
But Malaysia, which has opposed even a nonbinding set of forestry principles, was reported by delegates to be adopting a more flexible stand, and Brazil, which has the world's largest forests, was said to be anxious to promote a compromise to assure success at the meetings to which it has played host.
Thus, diplomats said, India has emerged as the developing country most opposed to any move by the Earth Summit that might imply international control of the world's remaining forests.

HEADLINE: Louisiana Legislature Approves Casino Gambling

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 11

 BODY:
A bill legalizing casino gambling in New Orleans was approved tonight by the Louisiana Legislature. The passage paves the way for New Orleans to join Las Vegas and Atlantic City as major urban gambling centers.
The bill, which Gov. Edwin W. Edwards has said he would sign, moved with surprising swiftness through the Legislature this week. The bill was voted down by the State House of Representatives last week but revived early this week, then was passed narrowly by the House on Monday evening and by a Senate committee on Wednesday. The full Senate passed it this evening by a vote of 21 to 18. 
 Approval by the Legislature assures construction of a large casino in downtown New Orleans near the French Quarter, at the site of the Rivergate, a little-used convention hall owned by the city.
 
Scoffing at the 'Do-Gooders'
 Governor Edwards has been as open in his support of a casino as he is about his own zest for playing craps in Las Vegas. After the casino measure was passed with unexpected swiftness by the House on Monday, opponents accused Mr. Edwards's legislative allies of manipulating the voting process. To quiet the uproar, the Governor went on television on Tuesday. Polls had long shown that most of the state favored casino gambling, he said, and he dismissed casino opponents as "do-gooders."
He estimates that the casino will generate 25,000 jobs and up to $250 million a year in state revenues to bolster the state's barely balanced budget. He says the new jobs will help make up for the high-paying jobs that were lost in the collapse of oil prices in the 1980's.
Casino critics say the Governor's projections are much too high and that the state is already awash in myriad forms of gambling: horse racing, off-track horse betting and bingo, along with a state lottery approved by the Legislature last year.
Last year the Legislature also approved video poker, which starts in barrooms next month, and riverboat gambling, which has yet to begin. In some more rural parts of the state there is informal betting on cockfights, which are legal.
 
Worry for the City
 Anne Milling, a New Orleans civic leader, said she feared the bill could hurt the city. "I'm not opposed to gambling," she said. "It's not a moral issue with me. I just feel the city is at risk. There is so much that's wrong with the bill. All the power rests with the Governor. There has not been a proper study about the impact of what may be the world's largest casino on a fabulous Southern city."
In a television interview Tuesday, Joseph Giarrusso, a New Orleans City Councilman and a former police superintendent, called the casino bill "a rape" of the city.
But along with the Governor, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy of New Orleans has been a chief lobbyist for a casino, saying, "We have got to create economic development" and, "I don't see any other alternatives." The Mayor, however, unsuccessfully lobbied for safeguards to keep casinos from multiplying and for a bill that would give the city direct revenues and more control over casino operation.
The bill, critics say, mandates virtually a one-man show: the Governor's. He will appoint all nine members of the state casino commission, though they must be approved by the Senate. The state will get 18.5 percent of casino revenues, or $100 million, whichever is greater, directly from the casino operator. The city will get the rent for the Rivergate property.
The bill calls for only one casino, but critics say it will be easy to pass a law next year that allows a flood of casinos. They say the city's character could be destroyed and crime encouraged.
Mayor Barthelemy wore a button saying "Just One" as he walked the State Capitol's corridors during the debate, hoping the Legislature would vote to put a casino limitation proposal before voters in a referendum next fall. The Legislature refused.
A leading Louisiana political consultant, Joe Walker, said: "South Louisiana's always favored gambling, and the rest of the state is 50-50. The casino opponents are a mixed bag: restaurant owners, people who are against gambling and people who don't really care much about gambling but who think Edwards is a crook so a casino must be bad."
Critics of Mr. Edwards who are trying to oust him point to the casino measure as proof that he has not changed. A Democrat now in his fourth term, the Governor was indicted on charges of fraud and racketeering in 1985 early in his third term. His first trial ended with a hung jury; the retrial ended in acquittal. But Mr. Edwards, elected last year partly because many simply refused to vote for his opponent, the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, is expected to withstand the recall effort.
 
Big-Name Developers Descend
 As the casino debate moved through the Legislature like an express train with the Governor steering, hopeful casino developers lined up this week, proposals in hand. They were responding to an April advertisement in The Wall Street Journal that the city, anticipating the Legislature's action, had placed to find developers for the 6.5-acre Rivergate site. Each anted up $50,000 for the privilege of submitting a proposal; $25,000 is refundable to the losers.
Expecting six developers to respond, the Mayor and City Council must now choose among 10, with help from a consultant. The bidders are Caesars World Inc., Carnival Management Services Inc., Harrah's, Hilton Hotels Corporation, ITT Sheraton Corporation, Mirage Resorts Inc., Atlantic Management Associates Inc., based in Stone Harbor, N.J., Celebration Park Inc., a new company owned by two developers from Texas and California, and the New Orleans Louisiana Development Corporation, a partnership of 10 local investors and Bally's Park Place hotel-casino in Atlantic City.
Christopher B. Hemmeter of the California-Texas group said it was proposing the world's largest casino: a $400 million, 250,000-square-foot casino in a one-million-square-foot building.
Hilton Hotels offered Monday to pay $100 million to the city or state if it opened a casino here. Other blandishments developers are offering include a donation of as much as six percent of annual casino revenue to social and community programs.
The city will announce by July 8 which of the developers will be asked to submit more details. The city will make its choice in the fall, but the state casino commission will have the final say. Before the official casino opens at the Rivergate site, the casino operator may open a temporary gambling hall somewhere else in the city.
Still, some casinos are vowing to fight on. An anti-casino lobbyist, C. B. Forgotston, said lawsuits would "definitely" be filed against the casino legislation because of a provision in the State Constitution that appears to outlaw gambling. "The State Constitution says, 'Gambling shall be defined by and suppressed by the legislature.' My question is, what have we suppressed that you can gamble on? What form of gambling have we suppressed?"

HEADLINE: Senate Won't Ban the Tactic of Replacing Strikers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
In a serious blow to organized labor, the Senate today killed a bill that would have prohibited employers from hiring permanent workers to replace striking union members.
The bill, the Workplace Fairness Act, was one of the highest legislative priorities for the nation's unions because the practice of replacing strikers has become increasingly common in recent years. 
 Senators who support big labor pointed to the recent threat by Caterpillar Inc. to replace 12,600 striking members of the United Auto Workers at its plant in Peoria, Ill., as the deciding factor in the collapse of the union's bargaining position.
But Republicans and a few conservative Democrats contended that the bill would tilt the balance of power between labor and management in favor of the unions, touching off more strikes and more inflation, while making American goods less competitive on world markets. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, called the measure "the strike breeder act of 1992."
 
5 Votes Short of Ending Debate
 The highly partisan debate pitted two conflicting philosophies on the role of government in labor disputes. While Republicans generally argued that the Federal Government must protect the rights of employers to hire who they want to, Democrats countered that the Government must guarantee the right of workers to strike as a lawful economic weapon.
Democrats failed to stop debate by a vote of 55 to 41, short of the 60 votes needed to bring the measure to a vote. The Republican success occurred despite an 11th-hour compromise amendment introduced by Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, to limit organized labor's power to strike in return for a restriction on hiring replacements.
Thirty-six Republicans were joined by five Democrats to kill the bill. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York was one of five Republicans to vote in favor of the measure.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called the vote "a tragedy for those working Americans who will lose their jobs to permanent replacements because their employers have no incentive to compromise."
The Senate bill would have banned hiring of permanent replacements in all strikes involving economic issues. It would also have made it an unfair labor practice for companies to promote employees who crossed a picket line over employees who decided to strike.
The House already passed similar legislation, but by 39 votes short of a veto-proof margin. Senior Administration officials had promised that President Bush would veto the legislation.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other unions said the bill was needed because corporations now use or threaten to use replacement workers in a third of all strikes. The practice was almost unheard of for almost 40 years until the early 1980's, when airlines began employing replacement workers regularly to end labor disputes.
 
'This Is a Power Grab'
 Under current labor law, companies do not have the right to hire replacement workers if the Government finds that their labor practices are unfair. But during the Reagan Administration, the National Labor Relations Board began ruling against unions claiming unfair practices.
"This is a power grab by the organized labor movement," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. "If you are going to have balanced negotiations, both sides have to have something to lose."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the legislation was needed because otherwise "when an employer is able to fire a striking worker by giving the worker's job to a permanent replacement, the risks suddenly shift substantially against the employee."
Had the vote to end debate on the measure succeeded, Democrats said they would have attached the Packwood amendment to the bill, opening the way for Government-supervised mediation of most major labor disputes through three-person fact finding panels agreed upon by labor and management.
Labor's endorsement of the Packwood amendment demonstrated how badly it wanted to pass some kind of limitation on hiring replacements, since the Oregon Republican's compromise would curtail the power of unions to strike in certain labor disputes.
Under Senator Packwood's measure, unions would have to notify management and the Federal mediation and Conciliation Service a week before it planned to initiate a strike. Once both the union and management agreed to allow the panel to hold hearings and mediate, the current contract would hold in place for 45 days, during which time a strike and hiring of permanent replacements would be prohibited.
The amendment would have allowed companies to hire permanent replacement workers in cases where a union refused to accept the contract recommendations of the panel. In cases where the union accepted the proposals of the panel, the employer would be prohibited from hiring replacement workers.
Shortly before the Senate vote, Mr. Kirkland said he supported the compromise, calling it favorable to workers and "consistent with their goal of peaceably resolving disputes with their employers and thereby avoiding strikes."
But, speaking in opposition, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, said, "The Packwood amendment upsets the balance between employer and employee rights, and it completely disrupts the collective bargaining process by inserting the Federal Government in situations where it does not belong."
Supporters of the bill said they would attempt cloture again shortly.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up 0.4%; Retail Sales Rise 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Retail sales edged up a scant two-tenths of 1 percent in May while prices at the producer level spurted to their biggest increase in 19 months, Government figures showed today.
Both sets of results were seen as disappointments, but analysts said they were mostly concerned about the third straight month of essentially flat sales. Combined with last Friday's report showing the job market was also weak last month, the retail sales report fanned doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery and appeared to push the Federal Reserve closer to a long-awaited cut in interest rates, which to many people would complement an earlier move by the Fed in April. 
 "Consumer spending is just very weak," said Giulio Martini, senior economic analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. "You can start to build a case that perhaps the Fed will be moved to another easing."
 
Only Superficially Upsetting
 Many analysts concurred, despite the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods. They considered the increase only superficially unsettling, because it was mostly the result of temporary special factors. Excluding a jump in tobacco prices, which came earlier in the spring than usual, the index would have risen by a quite tolerable two-tenths of 1 percent for the third straight month.
Even a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in the core Producer Price Index -- with food and energy excluded -- failed to generate much fear.
"When you peel back the onion a bit, the producer-price increase isn't all that troublesome," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. "The economy is still weak, consumers are still cautious and the recovery is still agonizingly slow," he added, pointing to the poor retail sales figures for recent months. "It's highly questionable in this environment that aggressive price hikes by producers would stick."
 
Better Data Were Expected
 In a third report today, first-time applications for unemployment benefits were unchanged at 407,000 for the week ended May 30. Many analysts had expected a modest improvement even after the Labor Department's adjustment for the holiday.
Retail sales, which account for a third of economic activity, not only trailed behind expectations for May but were also revised downward for April, the Commerce Department report showed. Moreover, when the automotive sector was excluded, last month's meager gain vanished.
"I really expected sales would be stronger," even allowing for the effects of unseasonably cold weather in much of the country, said Daniel Friel, a senior economist at Nationsbank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. His disappointment was also reflected in the broad nature of the decline, which included a 1.2 percent drop for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes that reversed an April gain.
Over all, however, durable goods posted a four-tenths of 1 percent advance as automotive dealers racked up a seven-tenths of 1 percent gain and stores selling furniture, home furnishings and equipment gained four-tenths of 1 percent.
Nondurables, which were unchanged over all, showed gains of seven-tenths of 1 percent for general merchandise stories and one-tenth of 1 percent for restaurants and bars. But this was offset by declines of eight-tenths of 1 percent for apparel and accessory stores, two-tenths of 1 percent for food stores and one-tenth of 1 percent for gasoline service stations. The sixth major category of nondurables, drug and proprietary stores, showed no change.
Sales totaled $158.8 billion last month, compared with $154.7 billion in May 1991 and $158.1 billion this past February. The rise over the latest 12 months was 2.7 percent after adjustment for seasonal, holiday and trading differences but without adjusting for price changes.
The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in prices received by producers for finished goods -- those ready for sale to the final individual or business user -- was largely the result of a 7.3 percent leap in tobacco products, a 3 percent advance for civilian aircraft and a near doubling in the increase for energy goods, up nine-tenths of 1 percent in April.
 
Big Jump in Tobacco Prices
 The Labor Department noted that tobacco prices, now 16.1 percent higher than in May 1991, have traditionally climbed most in June or July. Last month's increase was said to reflect strong demand, particularly for the export market, as opposed to higher taxes.
Partly offsetting the upward forces was a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in the price of consumer foods, with fish dropping a record 13 percent and fresh vegetables down 6.7 percent following April's 18.1 percent plunge.
Today's report also showed prices of goods at the intermediate stage of production -- like a bolt of cloth -- rose four-tenths of 1 percent in May as energy prices rose 2.4 percent, the biggest increase since October 1990. Prices for durable manufacturing materials turned up two-tenths of 1 percent, reversing April's decline, while nondurable materials rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
Goods at the crude stage -- like raw cotton -- jumped 1.4 percent last month, mainly reflecting higher prices for foods and feeds.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Quayle, at Anti-Abortion Meeting, Presses 'Cultural Elite' Attack

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., June 11

 BODY:
Vice President Quayle took his campaign for traditional values to the nation's largest anti-abortion group today, with a full-throated, almost joyful iteration of the kind of social conservatism that fired the Republican Party in the 1980's.
Greeted by chants of "Four More Years!" and posters that declared, "Murphy Brown Doesn't Speak for Me," Mr. Quayle asserted that he would press his case even though the "cultural elites" in "some of our newsrooms, sitcom studios and faculty lounges" may not like it. "We're going to speak up for life," he declared. "We're going to speak up for family values. We're going to speak up for America." 
 In a series of hot-blooded speeches in recent weeks, Mr. Quayle has fired the opening round in a new politics of values, 1992-style, which many conservatives hope will revitalize the ailing Republican coalition. "It resonates with the core beliefs of most Americans," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip in the House and one of several conservatives pushing the emphasis on values. "Think of it as a Reader's Digest versus The Village Voice campaign."
But the strategy has its critics and skeptics, in both parties.
Democrats assert that the Republicans are simply up to their old tricks, playing one more variation on flags and furloughs, the symbols used to portray Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988, as soft on crime and too much a creature of the "Harvard boutique" to sign a law requiring schoolchildren to say the pledge of allegiance.
 
Democrats Question Leadership
 "George Bush had no agenda to run on in '88, and he has no accomplishments to run on in '92," said James Carville, a top strategist for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumed Democratic nominee. "So they dust off the Republican manual, which is go to wedge issues: 'We can't lead the country so maybe we can divide it.' "
Others question how well a "values" campaign will work in the hard-bitten politics of 1992, when voters are consumed with the state of the economy and a host of other domestic woes. Don Sipple, a Republican consultant who worked for the Bush campaign earlier this year, says such appeals may help with the conservative base, but may seem "off the mark or irrelevant to the concerns" of the suburban voters who often decide elections.
Moreover, voters have a third option in 1992, which they lacked in 1988. No one is quite sure how ideological or values-based appeals will work in a three-way race, particularly since Ross Perot, so far, has shown the ability to draw support from left to right.
Some political professionals argue that both the Republican and Democratic nominees should simply move, respectively, right and left, and concentrate on galvanizing their base, since they can win with a plurality. But both the Bush and the Clinton campaigns seem aware of the dangers of that strategy, which would leave a huge opening for Mr. Perot.
 
'Uncertain and Concerned'
 Regardless of that strategic debate, advocates of Mr. Quayle's values initiative argue that it has appeal far beyond the conservative wing of the party. They say that it speaks to the bleak national mood and the sense of drift that shows up in numerous public opinion polls.
In his speeches, Mr. Quayle draws a line in the sand between the "cultural elite" and "the common sense of the average citizen," as he put it today. "The cultural elite don't want me to talk about values, but the American people do," he said. Speaking to the annual convention of the National Right to Life Committee here, he portrayed the fight over abortion as a war between these groups, with their competing values.
"People like yourselves don't just talk about the value of human life," he said, "You reflect it in your lives and enshrine it in your homes."
"Contrast that with the orientation of the cultural elite," he added. "It avoids responsibility and flees from the consequences of its self-indulgence. If, as a result of one's own actions, a child is conceived, they have a simple solution: Get rid of it. Our opponents treat God's greatest gift -- new life -- as an inconvenience to be discarded."
The abortion issue, however, points to another political danger of Republican appeals to values: Republicans themselves are divided over it.
Reflecting those political realities, Mr. Quayle's speech today emphasized putting additional restrictions on abortion, even though the Republican platform calls for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw it. "The majority of Americans support limitations on abortion," the Vice President said.
It is unclear how much Mr. Bush will focus on values this fall; he is already giving speeches on the importance of family, but they are far more muted than Mr. Quayle's. Mr. Perot, for his part, seems to be both appealing to the nation's patriotism and fondest mythology, and ready to scoff at Republican attempts to push similar buttons.
The Dallas billionaire, who delights in painting the Bush campaign as ineffectual and deeply political, all but sneers at Mr. Quayle's concern over the fictional character Murphy Brown, who became an unwed mother.
"If anybody in the world should be able to understand the Murphy Brown story, it's the Republican Party in the White House, because their whole lives are driven by ratings," Mr. Perot said this morning on NBC's "Today" program. "Murphy Brown had that baby the way she had it to get ratings."
 
Clinton Belittles Attack
 And Mr. Clinton gave a preview today of his response to a values attack. "I'm getting tired of people who have responsibility for the American people -- like the Vice President -- pretending that the only problem we have is the absence of values," he said.
"They never talk about their responsibility to the people that do observe all those values," he said. "Look at Los Angeles. Most of the people did not riot, did not loot, did not burn. But they're still faced with declining incomes and difficult lives. What about them? They are the people I'm running to help."
Asked if Mr. Quayle was attempting to drive a wedge between Americans, Mr. Clinton replied: "I think that's what he wants to do. But I'm not going to permit it."

HEADLINE: On Eve of Visit to U.S., Yeltsin Reaffirms Russia's Commitment to Reforms

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 11

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would soon issue decrees lifting some of the major barriers to privatization. But at the same time he declared he would not permit the West to dictate economic policy to Russia, even if this meant delays in Western aid.
Mr. Yeltsin made the statements in an interview four days before he leaves for a state visit to the United States in which money and arms will be the central issues. He spoke on the eve of the first anniversary of his election as Russia's President -- a day he has proclaimed a national holiday and Russian Independence Day. 
 The combination of a Russian's native pride and Mr. Yeltsin's yearning to bring democracy and economic freedom to his country came to the surface repeatedly in an 85-minute meeting with representatives of five foreign news organizations.
Mr. Yeltsin spoke with satisfaction of his invitation to address a joint session of Congress, and he declared that his relationship with President Bush "will be at least not worse, and I believe better" than Mr. Bush had with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last President of the defunct Soviet Union.
He indicated that he could use the American visit to issue decrees on private ownership of property, whose blockage by the Russian Parliament has been a major obstacle to large-scale privatization of state industries. Asked whether he was ready to use his presidential powers to override the Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin said he was, and added, "I think I will bring a surprise to the U.S."
 
Bristles at I.M.F.
 At the same time, when asked about reports that an agreement with the International Monetary Fund over a $24-billion aid package was being delayed because of questions in Washington over the progress of economic reforms -- and especially delays in freeing the price of oil -- Mr. Yeltsin became curt.
"I believe an agreement will be signed, and any delay in signing is linked only to this: that we will not sign any agreement under the diktat of the I.M.F.," he said.
The I.M.F. package is regarded as a key element in establishing a convertible ruble and in encouraging Western investment. Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged that an agreement could open the way to large-scale investment, but he argued that Russia and its reforms were unique, and that misguided I.M.F. proposals could prove disastrous.
"We have a Russia that the I.M.F. does not know, and a Russian people that the I.M.F. does not know," he said. "Therefore there is a process on this agreement. But once again, I declare that if the I.M.F. insists that we immediately release prices on fuel, we will not agree. We know cases in the world when some countries suffered a fiasco from the recommendations of the I.M.F."
 
Concern for Harvest
 Mr. Yeltsin said his main concern was that farm workers would have trouble with their harvests if fuel prices rose. "I can tell you today they would not cope," he said.
"We should not think that $24 billion will save the situation in Russia," he said. "Essentially these are our concerns, our difficulties, our problems, they are for us to resolve -- for the leadership, the president and the people."
But he agreed that if Russia did receive I.M.F. support, the reforms "would go faster, with less risk." Approval of the I.M.F. package, he said further, would open the gates "to a powerful flow of private capital."
Mr. Yeltsin also said that he expected to sign with President Bush what he called a "framework agreement on principles of deeper cuts in nuclear weapons." He said work was continuing on this document, and that final issues could be resolved when he meets Mr. Bush on Tuesday and Wednesday.
He gave no details on what levels the agreement would set, nor did he comment on the differences in the negotiations that have been reported from Washington. On Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin told a conference of senior Russian military officers that Washington was trying to gain an advantage in the talks.
 
Ministers Speak by Telephone
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev spoke by telephone today and agreed to meet at the Russian Embassy in London on Friday in a last-minute push to finish the outlines of an agreement on additional nuclear arms cuts so it could be signed by President Bush and President Yeltsin. United States officials had said that Mr. Baker would make such a trip only if the Russians gave some indication that the remaining differences might be bridged.
It is not known exactly how close the two sides are to an accord. After their talks on Monday and Tuesday in Washington, Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev said they still needed to agree on an overall numerical ceiling on long-range nuclear warheads, sub-ceilings on various different weapons and an understanding on how quickly certain missiles would be phased out.
It was unclear in the interview whether Mr. Yeltsin was genuinely annoyed at the United States stance on arms control or the I.M.F.'s views on aid, or whether he was trying to put the best political face on a summit meeting when he knows the country he leads is no longer a military or economic challenge to his host.
In the interview, as in another one published in Izvestia today, he seemed most anxious to counter any notion that he was heading for Washington as a supplicant, even while he seemed to take pride in the voyage.
 
Strength From History
 Mr. Yeltsin argued ardently that Russia's status derived from its illustrious history, and not -- as he said it was for the United States and the former Soviet Union -- from the number of its nuclear warheads.
"This is what is most important for a great power, its history," he said. "Today in every corner of the globe they know what Russia is. The people are creative, intelligent, industrious, the culture is known the world over since the 17th century, especially the 18th century."
He announced that he intended to meet, or at least telephone, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the writer who was deported from the Soviet Union in 1974, to urge him to return home. He also stressed that he was the first leader of the Soviet Union or of Russia to address a joint session of Congress, as if to underscore that his visit was of a special rank.
Mr. Yeltsin also spoke of the challenge he faced in his mission of bringing democracy and a market economy to Russia.
 
Committed to Reforms
 "We need to struggle for the implementation" of reforms, he said. "It is a very difficult process. Russia is unique, the reforms are unique. Other countries knew what private property was, but in this country such an understanding was even erased from the memories of their descendants, because we are already down to the second or third generation."
Mr. Yeltsin declared he remained fully committed to reforms and to the policies of his chief economist, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar. Questions over his policies had surfaced with the appointments of several new ministers, including managers of major industries who some believe may try to slow reforms.
"First, by no means does this mean any slowing down in the reforms, because the President of Russia is not slowing the pace of reforms," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media -- Campaign Watch;
Perot Takes Issue, While Clinton Takes On Issue

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Ross Perot did not want to "sound-bite" his answer on the deficit. He did not want to "sound-bite" his answer on gun control. And he certainly did not want to "sound-bite" his answer on health insurance.
"We've got to completely restructure the system," he responded to a question about health care reform. "You say, 'Gee, can you sound-bite it?' No. Could Solomon sound-bite it? No." 
 For two hours yesterday morning, Mr. Perot fielded calls from viewers of the NBC News program, "Today," just as Gov. Bill Clinton had for one hour on Tuesday. For devotees of early morning television, watching the two men's performances was like watching a wrecking crew and a zoning law expert discuss their disparate views of urban planning.
 
'I'll Stop at Red Lights'
 Reveling in his "outsider's" status, Mr. Perot managed in his appearance to criticize just about every aspect of the American political system, from polling (which he admitted to having done himself) to Presidential motorcades ("I will stop at red lights if I'm President," he said).
With his lively Will Rogers-like aphorisms, he suggested that the country's problems were really not as complicated as many officials have made them out to be. (Decrying the nation's high medical costs, for example, he said, "We're buying a front row box seat, and we're not even getting to see a bad show from the bleachers.")
But in protesting the pressure to "sound-bite" his answers, Mr. Perot seemed finally to protest too much. In almost two hours on the air, Katie Couric, the host of "Today," asked him to speed up his answers only occasionally, allowing him for the most part to ramble on for minutes at a stretch. Even so, he provided only sketchy details for his often dramatic proposals.
For example, when Roberta of Vero Beach, Fla., asked him about cutting Social Security to upper-income Americans, he said: "The point is, a leading economist had told me four years ago that if, he basically said this to me, he said 'Perot, if people like you would give up your Social Security and Medicare and what have you, we could make a tremendous dent in the budget.' And since that time, I have parroted that statement, because in my case, and I think the cases of most other people who don't need it - now, the real question is, Who needs it, and who doesn't need it?"
After he had finished, Roberta complained bluntly, "Well, he didn't really answer the question."
During his appearance, in contrast, Mr. Clinton seemed to be trying to make the most of his unenviable role as the candidate who still runs on issues and policies and positions. On occasion, he lapsed into bureaucratese ("First I would try to reduce Federal employment and Federal expenditures on the administrative aspects of all the administrative budgets of every Federal department," he said at one point), and his answers, complete with subparagraphs, sometimes seemed to come right out of a Democratic Leadership Council white paper.
But there was not a single question, from nuclear testing to Haitians to the recognition of Cuba, for which he did not have a ready, detailed answer.
Asked, for instance, where he was going to get the money for his proposals, Mr. Clinton said, without even stopping for breath: "Well, we're going to get the money to pay for the investment programs by reducing the defense, controlling health-care costs, reducing the administrative costs of Government by three percent a year, keeping current costs within inflation and asking the wealthy, whose taxes went down in the 1980's while their incomes went up, to pay their fair share."
Although the program's spokeswoman, Lynn Appelbaum, said viewers were free to question the candidates about "relevant" personal issues, the vast majority of callers asked about major issues of national concern, like affirmative action, gun control and abortion. This may show, as the candidates often insist, that voters simply do not care about issues of personal conduct. Or it may show that, unlike reporters, they are simply too polite to ask.

HEADLINE: Economic Needs of States Propelled Gambling Surge

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Louisiana's adoption of casino gambling yesterday reflects a trend that has accelerated in the past few years, driven less by arguments about wagering than about jobs and taxes.
"Nevada and Atlantic City had casino gambling pretty much to themselves until about 1988," said William R. Eadington, the director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. "Now it has shown up in South Dakota, Iowa, Colorado and on many Indian reservations." 
 Mississippi has also approved riverboat gambling, while slot machines are legal in some Maryland counties, and card games are allowed in California, Montana and Oregon.
Professor Eadington, an economist, likened the spread of casino gambling to the spread of state lotteries from the Northeast in the 1970's to the West and South in the 1980's. Today, he said, 34 states plus the District of Columbia operate lotteries More than 30 states also have parimutuel wagering.
Gross annual wagering from all legal sources in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available, totaled $286 billion, according to Gaming & Wagering Business magazine. But Mark Zaccharia, the magazine's managing editor, cautioned that those figures do not include revenues from more recent gambling venues, like Mississippi riverboats and Indian reservations.
In most cases, the thrust behind legalized gambling is economic: to provide more revenue without raising taxes; to provide new jobs; to finance social programs.
Taxes on gambling and fees for gambling licenses, for example, account for 40 percent of Nevada's $988.5 million general-funds budget for the fiscal year ending on June 30. Atlantic City's gross revenue tax on gambling, which yielded $240 million last year, is earmarked for programs to assist the state's senior citizens and the disabled. Deadwood, S.D., where casinos opened three years ago, uses taxes on gambling to refurbish Victorian buildings.
Much of the religious or moral opposition to gambling has eroded in recent years, and as legalized gambling continues to proliferate, economists say, cities and states will probably siphon tax revenues from each other. But that is not yet a problem, said Donald L. Tatzin, a director of Travel, Tourism and Hospitality for the Arthur D. Little consulting firm in San Francisco "Every time a new state lottery opens," he said, "total lottery revenues go up dramatically."

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 8.29 to Close At 3,351.51

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Computer-driven buy programs lifted blue-chip stocks in late trading yesterday after two days of sharp losses, but the broader market ended mixed as worries about the sluggish economy tempered buying interest.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 8.29 points, to 3,351.51, but declining shares outpaced advancing issues, 868 to 781, on the New York Stock Exchange, where the volume of 204.8 million shares was below the 210.8 million traded on Wednesday. 
 The Dow shed more than 60 points in the two previous sessions and was lower for most of yesterday after Government data showed the recovery was continuing slowly.
 
Weak Retail Sales
 Retail sales rose just two-tenths of a percent in May, far less than the rise of seven-tenths of a percent the market had expected. Producer prices climbed four-tenths of a percent in May, slightly more than expected.
David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan, said the figures reflected a very sluggish recovery, though he said the inflation rate on an annualized basis was "still a relatively low number."
A bounce-back in drug and technology stocks helped bolster the market, analysts said.
"They rallied the futures, and the market followed," said Hersh Cohen, president of Shearson Asset Management. "The market took a couple of days of serious beating, and it was led down by growth stocks. Now health care looks like it's trying to stabilize and even rally, but over all there's nothing to get tremendously excited about."
Alfred Goldman of A. G. Edwards said growth stocks were looking attractive again. But, he added, cyclical stocks, which typically do well in economic recoveries, "have gotten ahead of themselves and have gotten tired."
Advancing issues in health care included Merck, up 1 1/4, to 49 1/4; United Healthcare, 2 3/8, to 83 1/4; Medtronic, 2 7/8, to 77 7/8; U.S. Surgical, 2 1/4, to 108 1/2, and U.S. Healthcare, 2 7/8, to 50 1/4.
Among technology stocks, I.B.M. rose 1 7/8, to 92, and Digital Equipment added 1 3/4, to 40 1/2.
Mr. Holt said the market's recent decline was short term and added that high cash levels at mutual funds could refuel the market for another move higher.
Telefonos de Mexico again topped the most-active list, rising 1/8, to 52. Several Wall Street analysts repeated buy ratings after a selloff on Wednesday.
Kirschner Medical jumped 2 3/4, to 11 1/2. The company is merging with Henley International in a stock deal. Henley fell 1 3/8, to 15.
Mirage Resorts slipped 7/8, to 25 1/8. Salomon Brothers lowered its earnings estimates on the company.
 
Big Drop for Amdura
 After a two-day halt, Amdura slumped 5, to 3. It said it expected a first-quarter loss and failed to explain a recent quadrupling of its stock price.
Eastman Kodak slipped5/8, to 39 3/4, after the company released revenue data for April and May that fell short of some forecasts.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.80 points, to 409.05. The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.23, to 389.90. The Big Board composite rose 0.74, to 225.10. The Nasdaq index slid 2.03, to 567.68.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Delegates From 4 Nations Warm to a High-Profile Role: Global Powerbroker

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 11

 BODY:
Trailing clouds of reporters through the corridors of the Earth Summit convention center or forging coalitions behind closed doors, several faces have emerged from the 7,000 delegates as international powerbrokers. 
 They include an Indian minister, a Singaporean lawyer who wields a fast parliamentary gavel, a German minister who has assumed the mantle of Western leadership and a Malaysian minister whose tenacious defense of her nation's right to exploit forests has won her notoriety as the Earth Summit's "Dragon Lady."
 
The Indian
 In an inner office padded with carpets and cooled by an air-conditioner, India's Minister of Environment, Kamal Nath, sipped coffee today with two ministers from Kenya. But when conversation turned to the United States, the Indian's voice bounced angrily off the prefabricated walls, rattling paper posters printed in Sanskrit.
"At 6 o'clock this morning, the United States told us they want to remove the phrase 'right to social and economic development,' " the Indian said as the visiting Kenyans quietly whistled their amazement.
"I'm not looking for good grammar -- I'm looking for substance," the Indian said. "We must not budge from 'the right to social and economic development.' I have talked to the Chinese, they are with us. The Swedes also. Finland seems to be on the fence."
A Congress Party politician little known in the West, in Rio Mr. Nath has become a third-world spokesman who never ducks an outstretched microphone.
"We are seeking that the developed world plow a little of their prosperity back into the earth," Mr. Nath said. "We hope that by coming here Mr. Bush will understand global environmental concerns."
To the delight of his English-speaking guests, Mr. Nath ended the meeting with his joke of the day. White House infighting over an Earth Summit treaty on plants and animals shows, the Indian said, "that in the United States biodiversity is a question of bushes and quails."
 
The Singaporean
 In treaty drafts, brackets are the red flags of diplomacy. With 48 hours to go before signing ceremonies start on Friday, one 900-page document remained riddled Wednesday evening with hundreds of brackets, marking for debate language that ranged from entire paragraphs to, in one case, a single comma.
Enter Tommy Koh, a seasoned international mediator who knew how to speed proceedings with a dose of humor, a dose of patience and a surprisingly fast gavel.
"He rammed the climate chapter right past Saudi Arabia," said an American, Chip Barber, who watched Mr. Koh slam his gavel down before a Saudi delegate could win the floor to object to an energy conservation clause in a document that is to serve as an enviromental plan for the 21st century. "He cleared 100 financial provisions with one blow."
With cheers occasionally erupting from 400 lawyers and diplomats in attendance, the Singaporean kept his parliamentary freight train going until 5:30 this morning -- without stopping for a cup of coffee.
A polished graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Koh is now, at age 54, a master of the system that produced him. Currently an Ambassador-at-Large for Singapore, Mr. Koh served a total of 19 years in the United States, first as Ambassador to United Nations, then to Washington. He honed his fast gavel first as president of a sea-law conference in 1982 and then, in 1990, as chairman of preparatory committee for today's Earth Summit.
 
The German
 With the United States reveling in a Lone Ranger role at the Earth Summit, leadership of the West has fallen to Klaus Topfer, a low-key German who after five years in office is now the West's dean of environmental ministers.
Little known in the United States, the well-traveled German was recently described by Der Spiegel magazine as "Eco-Genscher" -- a reference to Germany's ground-breaking former Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
A veteran of foreign-aid missions to countries as diverse as Brazil, Yemen and Malawi, the German economist has found many friends in Rio. Today, ministers of Kenya, India, Australia and Malaysia could be seen discreetly slipping out of a conference room maintained here by the German delegation, the Earth Summit's third largest after Brazil's and Japan's.
Over dinner last week on a penthouse terrace overlooking Copacabana beach, the 53-year-old German warned that the collapse of East-West rivalries must not lead to North-South rivalries over environmental issues.
"We cannot become caught in a new confrontation between North and South just as we have succeeded in overcoming the cold war," said the minister, whose family fled eastern Germany when he was 8. "I am afraid that conservatives in the United States are picking 'ecologism' as their new enemy."
 
The Malaysian
 When American negotiators arrived in Rio proposing an international convention on forests, they fell straight into the jaws of the "Dragon Lady."
"The almost obsessional anxiety to have a forest convention is driven by concerns which have nothing to do with forests or trees," Wen Lian Ting, Malaysia's chief negotiator on forests, lectured in a pre-summit briefing. "Developed countries wish to appease their public opinion and thus get electoral mileage out of forests."
Environmental groups gave the Ambassador her "Dragon Lady" nickname after they lost several confrontations with her over Malaysia's insistence that forestry practices are a matter of sovereignty.
"Forests are clearly a sovereign resource -- not like atmosphere and oceans, which are global commons," Malaysia's career diplomat said today in the clipped tones of her alma mater, London University. "We cannot allow forests to be taken up in global forums."
Unrattled by her notoriety among environmentalists here, the Ambassador, who is currently assigned to Rome, said: "This is not just Malaysia alone. All the developing countries holde these views. The only difference is that we are more vocal about expressing our views."
And the Dragon Lady label? "I find it amusing," she said, without cracking a smile.

HEADLINE: Castro, Looking for Investors, Courts Executives From U.S.

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, June 10

 BODY:
When 125 foreign businessmen, most of them Americans, descended on Havana on Wednesday for a day of briefings on investment opportunities that remain largely off-limits because of a three-decade-old United States embargo, President Fidel Castro decided to personally assure them of a proper reception.
Along with many of his senior deputies, Mr. Castro greeted the visitors in a lavish reception in the Palace of the Revolution. From a leadership whose public face is often both distant and austere came a two-hour charm offensive that seemed to signal that the inevitability of market forces has struck home in Cuba. 
 "We find it important to absorb foreign capital," said Carlos Lage, the 40-year-old vice president of the Council of Ministers and the Politburo member who has shaped Cuba's opening to private investment from abroad. "We are not abandoning socialism, and we are not begging for the help of capitalists, but we are asking for investment on mutually beneficial terms."
 
Cuba's Economy Flounders
 Senior Cuban officials like Mr. Lage were loath to appear overly solicitous of American help in overcoming the country's worst economic crisis since Mr. Castro took power in 1959. But with Havana's once lively streets now nearly barren of vehicles for lack of fuel, food rationing growing ever stricter and most Cubans reduced to wearing faded and worn clothing, the views of younger technocrats like Mr. Lage who favor a more mixed economy rather than rigidly controlled state system seem to be gathering momentum.
In almost every conversation, the Cubans alluded to the hope that by presenting them with opportunities, American capitalists will eventually prevail upon their politicians to break the 31-year-old logjam in relations between the two countries.
Sensitive to Washington's continuing ban on business with Cuba, and wary of the mobilization of conservative Cuban-American groups against any perceived opening to Havana, few of the visiting businessmen, from executives of major corporations and their lawyers to owners of smaller companies in construction and real estate, were willing to be identified.
After seeing elaborate exhibits on Cuba's booming tourism industry and other smaller markets like bio-technology and food processing, however, many of the executives said they were returning to their headquarters with enthusiastic appraisals of the potential for doing business with the island.
"I think within 10 years this will be an important market for us," said the vice president for Latin America of a United States conglomerate who traveled to Cuba, like the other participants, via Cancun, Mexico. "It's got a lot of potential, and we'll have a lot to talk about when I get back to New York."
Mr. Castro's words suggested that neither his ideology nor his firebrand style had mellowed with time.
On whether the involvement of foreign investors would compromise his Communist revolution, Mr. Castro said, "Capital is not capitalism."
Asked if Cuba would attempt democratic reforms, Mr. Castro bristled, and asked, "Why aren't our changes democratic changes?"
After a long lecture on Greek democracy, which he said was sustainable only by slave labor, he said, "The same units that invaded Grenada and Panama were needed to invade Los Angeles, and you ask me about democracy?"

HEADLINE: Beijing Invites Chinese Abroad to Return Home

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 11

 BODY:
The Government today invited Chinese living abroad to return "to serve the construction of the motherland," but it also hinted that it might bar Chinese students from returning if they oppose Communism.
The issue has arisen because the authorities are refusing to allow Gong Xiaoxia, a Chinese student at Harvard University, to return to China for a visit. Ms. Gong, who has been critical of the Government, is waiting in Hong Kong, hoping that the Chinese Government will relent and allow her back. 
 Two weeks ago, the Chinese Government barred Dai Qing, a prominent journalist holding a fellowship at Harvard, from flying back to Beijing for the summer vacation. But a few days later -- after the June 4 anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown -- the authorities reversed themselves and allowed Ms. Dai to return.
 
Fate of the Outspoken
 In fact, thousands of Chinese have been allowed to return to China without difficulty after trips abroad, and there seems little chance that a loyalty test will be imposed. But Beijing might refuse to allow outspoken dissidents to return, forcing them into exile.
To be sure, many Chinese students would be delighted to stay in the United States. More worry about getting in trouble after returning to China than about the possibility of being turned back at the border, although that risk could concern those who have spouses or children in China.
Some 40,000 Chinese, including the children and grandchildren of many Chinese leaders, are studying in the United States. Many took part in demonstrations in June 1989 against the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, and the Chinese Government reportedly has maintained files on militants and monitored their activities in America.
Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a briefing today that he was unfamiliar with the details of Ms. Gong's case. But he added that the Government welcomed Chinese students abroad to return, notwithstanding the views they used to hold.
Mr. Wu was then asked whether the Government would allow the return of Chinese students who currently oppose the "four cardinal principles." Those principles are socialism, the people's democratic dictatorship, leadership of the Communist Party, and Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong thought.
"Whatever their past political views," Mr. Wu responded, emphasizing the word past, "we welcome them back to serve the construction of the motherland. If you study these words, you will get the correct answer."
That response suggests that China could refuse to readmit students whose present views it finds offensive.
China has more students in the United States than does any other country, and their presence has often been a source of tension in the two countries' relations. Americans have been indignant at the reported harassment by Chinese Embassy officials of Chinese studying in the United States, while Beijing has been outraged that the United States has extended the students' visas to avoid forcing them to return to China.
In a sign of the Government's enthusiasm to lure students back, at least if they do not oppose Communism, the Government is drafting a new policy that will give important privileges and better jobs to Chinese who return from foreign universities.
The new measure will allow returned students to choose any job they wish. It nullifies the agreements that many of the students were obliged to sign promising that they would return to their previous employers.
As an extra lure, the returned students will be able to move with their families to any city they want, including Shenzhen, a special economic zone next to Hong Kong. Normally, residence permits for desirable cities -- like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen -- are extremely difficult to obtain, and even if an outstanding scholar finds a job in a major city and obtains a residence permit, it may take years to get a residence permit for a spouse.
Since 1978, some 150,000 Chinese have left the country for study abroad. Only 50,000 have returned.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Sidelines;
Cuomo Won't Run but Will Talk at Drop of a Hat

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the man who won't be President but can't stop talking about the men who would be, said yesterday that Ross Perot could be ("I have no negatives to say about him"), but that Bill Clinton should be ("Even if we don't like the saxophone.")
In a strolling, stopping, standing encounter with reporters after a speech on immigration in Manhattan, the oracle of Albany alternately damned Mr. Perot with faint praise for his studied vagueness and praised Mr. Clinton with faint damns for his calculated cool, all the same insisting, "I'm not particularly good at politics." 
 It was the second time in a week that the Governor of New York had offered unsolicited public quarterbacking of Mr. Clinton's tactics, having first taken credit for suggesting that the Arkansas Governor work with Democratic Congressional leaders to put together a legislative package that could be passed in the first days of a Clinton administration.
 
Conversations With Perot
 At the same time, Mr. Cuomo defensively dismissed news reports suggesting that he had inadvertently helped foster Mr. Perot's ambitions by urging the billionaire to spread his economic views when the pair struck up a telephone acquaintance after a Cuomo speech to Fortune 500 executives last fall -- at a time when Mr. Cuomo himself was considering running for President.
Mr. Perot told viewers of NBC-TV's "Today" show yesterday morning that when he talks with Mr. Cuomo, "it's a thrill a minute -- you don't ever turn your hearing aid off for a second."
But the Governor called their conversations "not terribly frequent, not terribly important, not terribly significant, not terribly relevant."
For someone who has conceded that his recommendation that Michael S. Dukakis not respond to George Bush's negative attacks in 1988 was about the worst political counsel he ever gave, Mr. Cuomo was a regular font of advice yesterday.
Here he was on Mr. Perot's strength as a candidate: "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. If you're allowed to stay at his level of specificity, or non-specificity, then yes, anybody who is allowed to stay at that level would be a good candidate."
There he was moments later on Mr. Clinton's musical interlude with Arsenio Hall: "I don't know. You see, you show me Bill -- and I said this to his people -- with dark glasses playing a saxophone, you know, and guys like me would tell you, I don't think I would vote for Belushi, you know, for President, may he rest in peace. But who knows? Maybe there are people who like the Blues Brothers.
"I know that his campaign is one of the most professional I've ever seen. They're very good at polling. I have never been much for polling. So their polls apparently tell them that this outreach to the yuppies, or whatever it is, whoever it is that you reach, is very good for them, and I assume they are in a better position to make the judgment than I."
On public dissatisfaction with government: "We're not happy with the Democrats, because you're in Congress and you didn't do it. We're not happy with the Republicans, because you were President and you didn't do it. Unless the Democrats and the Republicans answer that challenge, Perot will be President."
On the other hand: "Mr. Perot is a good fella. I have no negatives to say about him. But Bill Clinton is going to be the President, because Bill Clinton uniquely is able to give you effective government here. Perot cannot do that. Bush cannot do that. He cannot deliver the Congress. Clinton can. The American people will figure out that this is our only chance for effective government, even if we don't like the saxophone."
Asked by a reporter how he had come to chat with Mr. Perot, the Governor said: "I don't remember. This is an important subject to you. It's not an important subject to me."
Asked if Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and chairman of the State Municipal Assistance Corporation and a longtime friend of Mr. Perot, had helped put them in touch, he said, "No, no."
Told that just hours earlier, Mr. Rohatyn said he had first given Mr. Perot the Governor's phone number, Mr. Cuomo said, "Well, then you should have told me that first, right?"
"Insofar as he has spoken on the economy," Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Perot, "I like what he has said. He likes what I have said. He certainly would never regard me as a friend, and I am not privileged to regard him as a friend. I don't have that kind of relationship with him."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In His Own Words: How Perot Would Govern as President

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
We need to take the shackles off of American business. Our foreign competitors, Germany and Japan, the two economic superpowers, have an intelligent, supportive relationship between business and government. We need that. Then once we put that in place, then the next step is to industry by industry, company by company, to develop long-term plans, not 30-minute plans, not quarter to quarter plans, long-term plans. 
 Last step. Target the industries of the future. Have an alliance between government and business to make sure that the industries of the future that will pay our people the highest standard of living are in this country. Why must we do this? Well, we must do it for our people, but forget that if you want to. We have to do it to get the taxes to pay our bills, to make our country work. Pretty basic stuff.
 
TAXES
 Raising taxes is like taking dope, for politicians. You've got to stop raising taxes. You've got to bring discipline. So unless there's some kind of incredible emergency that I can't envision, absolutely not. It has be a last ditch decision because the more money you give these boys to spend, the more they'll spend. So you've got to make money a critical resource, not a resource that allows everybody just to throw it everywhere at a whim.
 
. . .
 If we don't raise taxes we have to cut spending. Now, we will go carefully across the board. We throw more money away than you can print almost right now. And we will go through it piece by piece.
Now, you may not need me but you need a businessperson. You need a person who can go in, look at the waste, communicate that back to the American people. We've got to build a consensus. Now, if you can't stand a little pain and you can't stand a little sacrifice and you can't stand a trip across the desert with limited water, we're never going to straighten this country out.
So if you just want Lawrence Welk music, I'm not your man. We're going to go through department by department. We're going to get rid of the waste. All sacrifice will start at the top. We're going to cut out all this foolishness, money that's spent in the Congress and executive branch, and set the example. Then we'll work our way down to where the big money is, and there is a huge amount of waste in the way the system works now.
 
BALANCED BUDGET
 You don't need an amendment. See, an amendment is an excuse not to do anything. What you need to do is let's have a law, a real Gramm-Rudman law. Then let's have another one that says Congress cannot raise taxes. See, the Gramm-Rudman law, a real one, with no loopholes in it and no leaps, you'd have to balance the budget.
But now let's do some real stuff now. Get rid of the foreign lobbyists. Get rid of the PAC money. Then eliminate -- pass a law to stop deficit spending. Pass another law to balance the budget. And if you want to raise, forget balancing the budget, but if you want to raise taxes you have to come to the people and get their clearance because you haven't been responsible.
 
GUN CONTROL
 I will go night and day to get the guns out of the hands of violent people. Just registering guns won't do that.
. . . [T]he only thing that I can see that'll really clear everybody's head is have penalties for using weapons -- guns, knives, you name it, for violence, that are so severe that even if you're drunk, high and halfway crazy, you'll probably not take your gun into a 7-Eleven store if you're going to try to hold it up and shoot half the people there, and you sure wouldn't get into drive-by shootings.
We've got to cut that out. We've got to make the streets safe for the honest, decent people in this country. We'll do it. Won't be pretty but we'll do it.
 
DEBATES
 . . . [W]e're not talking about debates where newscasters ask you a question. We're talking about the old college debate where you stand out there all alone without 13 handlers and jocks sitting down there signing you, telling you when to talk and when not to talk. The point is we're talking about real debates on real issues. I don't think you could ever get the President to show up. Be interesting to see. But I would not have any interest at all in one of these, you know, blow-dried guys sitting there asking all three of us questions in a pompous way. Now, let's just get in the ring, get it on.
 
SADDAM HUSSEIN
 What happened here? For 10 years we created Saddam Hussein with your taxpayer money. But let's go back to 1982. When the Israelis went over and blew up his original nuclear capability Vice President George Bush publicly deplored that they did it.
 
. . .
 Now, come on up to just before Desert Storm. May of that year, our President, who was sending delegations over to burp and diaper and pamper Saddam Hussein and tell him how nice he was -- now, that's all public record -- now, we're July 25 just before the build-up started in August. We gave written instructions to our Ambassador to go tell Saddam Hussein that we would not become engaged in his border dispute with Kuwait and in plain Texas talk, we were saying, 'You can take the northern part of the country.' Now, only in America would you make a mistake like that.
Now, then he took the whole thing. And then the White House says, 'I can't believe he ate the whole thing.' Then we got -- our manhood was questioned and off we go into the wild blue yonder with the lives of our servicemen at risk because of 10 years of stupid mistakes and billions of dollars of taxpayer money that you and I will still have to pay because they were Federal guarantees to these various banks.
 
ABORTION
 When the dust clears, it's a woman's choice. Each human life is precious. We should not create a human life unless we want to create it. It is absolutely irresponsible for thinking, reasoning human beings to thoughtlessly create a human life they don't want.
 
HEALTH CARE
 We've got to completely restructure the system. . . . Step one, you've got to go through a logical process to put together a new plan, bring it to the people, get a consensus, do pilot programs, optimize those pilot programs, know your costs, know your benefits, build a consensus that this is the answer. Then do it.
But when you mass produce it, leave something --this is -- now, listen to me, Congress. When you mass product it, leave tremendous freedom to optimize, optimize, optimize. We freeze everything in law and that is an absolute sure way to make sure you don't get your maximum bang for your buck, and that's what the American people deserve.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Dow Is Sparkling But Is That Good?

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE Dow Jones industrial average has been the star of the stock market firmament in 1992. And that in itself may be a bad sign.
Only twice in the last decade has the Dow's performance, on a relative basis, been so much better than the more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500. And those times, notes Byron R. Wien, the chief United States equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, were not great times to buy stocks. 
 The first time was in the early fall of 1987, shortly before the October 1987 stock market crash, which hurt the Dow even more sharply than other market indexes.
The Dow did not again grow as strong relative to the S.& P. until July 1990. That new peak came just in time for a sustained decline in share prices brought on by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the onset of recession in this country.
Is that any more than a coincidence? Mr. Wien argues that it may be. The recent Dow strength has reflected the fact that the Dow has a larger representation of cyclical stocks, which have been the strongest this year as investors have bet on recovery. Mr. Wien sees that as a long-term change in leadership, and he points out that such turns rarely arrive without some market turmoil. He thinks a correction, driving the market down by 10 percent or more, may be under way.
A look at the last two times the Dow showed such outperformance does not provide exact parallels to the current situation. In the run-up of 1986-87, cyclicals were also the leaders within the Dow, with Goodyear and Bethlehem Steel the best performers. But Procter & Gamble, a steady growth stock, was among the leaders coming into the 1990 decline, along with the more cyclical Chevron and Boeing. This year the best Dow stocks have been General Motors and Union Carbide.
The basic composition of the two indexes may be one factor that could help explain the movements. The Dow, with only 30 stocks, is computed on a price-weighted basis. That is, the higher the price of a given stock, the higher its weight in the index. Thus if a $100 stock goes up $1, that is a 1 percent change, but it has the same effect on the index that a $20 stock would have if it went up 5 percent, or $1. That can mean that the hottest stocks of the era, as they rise in price, take on an added weight in the Dow and help push it up even more.
By contrast, the S.&P. 500 includes 500 stocks, and is weighted by market capitalization. That gives a greater weight to large companies, but not necessarily to ones with high dollar stock prices. A large stock that has been out of favor will still count more than a smaller one with a high dollar price, even if the smaller one has been soaring in value.
But should investors really take such charts seriously? Mr. Wien quotes Sam Steadman, a market guru at Loeb Rhodes more than a generation ago, in speaking of his own charts. "These things are to raise questions," he said. "When you go hunting, you take your dog along, but you don't give him the gun."

HEADLINE: New Jersey And Union Announce Settlement

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 11

 BODY:
The state of New Jersey and its largest public employees' union, the Communications Workers of America, announced today a tentative settlement on a three-year contract that freezes wages for 15 months.
Union officials said the contract agreement, reached before the expiration of the existing agreement for the first time in 20 years, is a recognition of bleak fiscal reality. The current contract expires on June 30. 
 Robert Pursell, director of the New Jersey Public Sector for the union, said: "Under normal circumstances, we would have demanded an increase during the first year of the contract. However, these are not normal circumstances."
The agreement, to be voted on by the union's 38,000 state workers over the next two weeks, calls for a 5 percent wage increase beginning Oct. 1, 1993, and a 6 percent increase on July 1, 1994. The union represents a range of state jobs.
Over all, the agreement means an average increase of 3.5 percent per year over the life of the three-year contract.
 
A Pattern for Other Unions?
 Mel Gelade, director of employee relations for the state, who joined Mr. Pursell in announcing the tentative agreement today, noted that the agreement also means that "any reduction in the workforce will come from attrition, rather than layoffs."
Because the communications workers union is by far the largest union of state workers, the settlement, if ratified, is expected to set the economic pattern for other contracts. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, representing 10,000 state workers, is currently in negotiations with the state.
The agreement will have no effect on the state budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Legislators are already struggling to cut $1 billion out of Gov. Jim Florio's proposed $15.7 billion budget, both because a stagnant economy has depressed the amount of tax money coming in and because of a one-cent cut in the state sales tax enacted by the Legislature over Mr. Florio's veto.
 
Gains in Economy Expected
 The contract's tentative salary increases for the following two years must be accounted for in those budgets, but both the Florio Administration and legislative leaders expect a more robust economy to make some budget growth possible by then.
Jan D. Pierce, regional vice president of the union, said that the settlement was consistent with a poll taken of the membership before negotiations began.
"That poll made clear that the membership had two primary concerns -- the protection of benefits and a fair and equitable wage increase," he said. "With this agreement, we have accomplished both."

HEADLINE: Senate Version on Aid for Jobless Falls Short of Changes in House

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee voted today to offer the long-term unemployed automatically renewable benefits, but the measure fell short of the sweeping changes in the unemployment insurance system passed by the House on Tuesday.
By giving the states wide discretion in deciding whether to grant the benefits, the Senate version could attract some Republican support and offer President Bush an opportunity to avert a politically difficult veto. 
 Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he supported the measure, although other Republican members criticized its financing provisions.
 
Choice of Unemployment Rates
 Mr. Bush would like to enact another one-time extension of unemployment benefits, which are scheduled to lapse July 4, for at least 13 more weeks. But the House voted 261 to 150 on Tuesday night to replace the current system of irregular extensions of benefits with one that would automatically grant at least 13 extra weeks of benefits in states where the unemployment rate was 6 percent or higher. In addition, it would immediately provide 20 or 26 more weeks of emergency unemployment benefits.
The Senate version is more generous in providing 26 or 33 weeks of emergency benefits, averaging $170 a week, depending on the unemployment rates and payment scales set by individual states. But it would grant many states the effective right to waive paying extended benefits.
The Senate measure would give states a choice of unemployment rates that would set off the payment of benefits. Extended weeks of benefits could be granted once a state's unemployment rate both reached 6.5 percent and was 10 percent higher than the same period in either of the two preceding years. Or states could accept the current, tougher criteria by which states qualify for extended benefits when the rate of the most recently unemployed, or what is known as the insured employment rate, both reaches 5 percent and is 20 percent higher than for the same period in the previous two years.
Congressional officials said a few conservative Southern states, which are less inclined to grant unemployment benefits, could choose the stiffer requirement.
 
Seeking Not to Raise Taxes
 Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk County and the principal author of the House bill, said: "I strongly prefer our version to theirs. I prefer a more national approach with respect to who qualifies." But Mr. Downey predicted that by the time the Senate and House versions were reconciled in conference committee, he and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who sponsored the Senate measure, "will be happy."
"If the President vetoes this, this will be part of Presidential politics," he said in an interview.
The House and Senate versions also differ in financing mechanisms. The House bill would reduce itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers by 2 percent for each $2,500 of adjusted gross income they earn above a level of $157,900 for those who file jointly. It would also limit to $1 million the tax deduction a company could declare for wages paid to its executives.
For its part, the Senate version seeks not to raise taxes. Instead, it seeks to accelerate tax collection by requiring corporations to base their estimated tax payments on 96 percent rather than 93 or 95 percent of its current year tax liability. It would also require companies to withhold 20 percent of any distribution of a pension or annuity plant that is not rolled over into a individual retirement account or similar sheltered annuity. Recipients would not be allowed to forego withholding.

HEADLINE: 'White Knight' at Sotheby's Cashes In Part of His Stake

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
In a move apparently to raise cash, A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer and shopping center entrepreneur, said yesterday that he would sell up to $103 million in stock in Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the auction house he heads.
Mr. Taubman, in a letter to Sotheby's staff, said that "while I am seeking this liquidity, please be assured that my confidence in and commitment to Sotheby's has never been greater." He noted that he would remain the largest shareholder and would keep the chairman's job. 
 Sotheby's vice chairman, Max Fisher, said he would sell up to $30 million of his stock in the auction house. Its share price has fallen 67 percent from its 1989 high as the art auction market, which soared in the 1980's, has fallen back.
The planned sale by the 67-year-old Mr. Taubman, even at depressed prices, illustrates what a phenomenal investment he made when he led a group that took over Sotheby's. His profit on his entire investment, at current market prices, is more than $275 million.
Mr. Taubman entered the battle as a "white knight" in 1983, when the auction house was fighting off a bid from General Felt Industries, and said he did not plan to play an active role in running the house. But he went on to become chairman and a dominant person in the business, although he did not take the title of chief executive.
Not all of Mr. Taubman's investments have done as well. He owns more than 5 percent of R. H. Macy, the department store chain now under bankruptcy protection. He is the sole owner of Woodward & Lothrop, the Washington-based department store chain, and Wanamaker, the Philadelphia-based chain. Those two chains, with a total of 34 stores, have suffered in the recession and are in the midst of a large capital investment program intended to preserve their market share, Chris Tennyson, a vice president of the Taubman Company, said. Because they are privately held, profit figures are not available.
"There are certainly many good things one can do with $100 million," Mr. Tennyson said when asked what Mr. Taubman would do with the money. He declined to say if any of it would go into the department stores.
 
Owner of 20 Shopping Centers
 The core of Mr. Taubman's holdings is a group of 20 shopping centers around the country, including the Stamford Town Center in Stamford, Conn.; the Mall at Short Hills in Short Hills, N.J.; Woodfield in Schaumburg, Ill., near Chicago, and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. And he owns A & W Restaurants, a chain of 500 restaurants.
Mr. Taubman's personal investment in Sotheby's in 1983 was $36.8 million, when he paid the equivalent of $1.35 a current share in taking the company private. Combined with the $47 million he got when he sold part of his stake in 1988, when the auction house went public, he will have received about $150 million if the planned stock sale goes through at yesterday's price for Sotheby's stock. The price fell $1.125, to $12.125, in New York Stock Exchange trading, as traders reacted to the planned sales.
Even after those sales, Mr. Taubman will own 13.5 million shares, worth $164 million at yesterday's price. That represents 30 percent of the total stock in the company, but because his holdings are concentrated in the super-voting class B shares he will continue to have a majority of the votes in shareholder elections and be able to control the company.
 
10 Million Shares or More
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, Mr. Taubman said he planned to sell eight million shares, and Mr. Fisher two million, but they gave the underwriters led by Lazard Freres & Company and Alex. Brown & Sons an option to sell up to an additional 500,000 shares from each of them. The figures on proceeds assume the exercise of that option.
Sotheby's rode the crest of the booming art market during the 1980's. In 1984, the first year Mr. Taubman controlled the company, its auctions took in a total of $586 million in sales of art work, antiques and other objects. By 1989, that figure had quintupled, to $2.95 billion. In 1984, the company lost $6.4 million. By 1989 it made $112.7 million, or $1.96 a share. And its shares, sold at $9 each when the company went public again in 1988, peaked in late 1989 at $37.
But as the art market retreated from the excessive prices of the late 1980's, many owners chose not to sell paintings, and artwork that did sell went for less. Since Sotheby's main source of income is commissions from those sales, its revenues and earnings plunged. In 1991, auction sales were just $1.1 billion, less than half the 1989 peak, and net income was down to $13.1 million, or 25 cents a share.
More recently, there have been signs of a modest comeback. In the first quarter -- a relatively unimportant time of the year for auction houses -- auction sales rose to $141.4 million, up 15 percent from the comparable period of 1991. But Sotheby's reported a net loss of $5.7 million, compared with $5.2 million in the earlier period.

HEADLINE: Assembly Leaders Reject Delay Enforcing Auto Emission Rules

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 11

 BODY:
An attempt in the Legislature to delay enforcing strict reductions in auto emissions appears to have been turned back, preserving a cornerstone of New York State's plan to combat air pollution in the coming decades.
The delay, strongly favored by auto manufacturers and some oil companies, passed the Republican-led State Senate in March and was gaining momentum after an Assemblyman from the Syracuse area said he had gathered 72 sponsors, just 3 short of the votes needed for passage. 
 But after a furious counterassault led by the state's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, top Assembly officials said today that the bill including the delay would not pass the house this session. Mr. Jorling has been in the forefront of a national effort to get other states to adopt the new pollution standards.
 
Weprin's Alternative
 Instead, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin intends to forge an alternative bill, under which both the new auto standards and a study on their economic consequences would go forward. Auto companies say the standards could add several hundreds of dollars to the cost of a new car. That contention is disputed by environmentalists like Mr. Jorling, who say the cost will be about $100.
Although the compromise plan may include a provision requiring the state board that approved the new regulations to recertify its decision after the study is completed, that would appear unlikely to result in a reversal. Mr. Jorling is chairman of that panel, known as the State Environmental Board.
Michael J. Bragman, the Syracuse Assemblyman who sponsored the bill that would have required a delay pending further study, declined to discuss the negotiations. But, he said, "I think we have made substantial progress toward a responsible compromise, one that will strike a balance between the economy and the environment and that will be in the best interests of the people of this state."
The Assemblyman who most vigorously fought Mr. Bragman's bill, Maurice D. Hinchey, an Ulster County Democrat and chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, said he was confident that the compromise plan would not include any delay. "Whatever support there may have been for that is dissipating," he said.
 
California Standards
 The new emission requirements, widely known as the California standards because they were first developed in that state, would require that increasing numbers of cars sold beginning in 1995 meet tougher pollution-control requirements. They will have to emit less carbon monoxide and fewer chemicals that cause smog. By 2003, 10 percent of the cars in New York would have to be so-called zero-emission vehicles, probably electric cars.
The reductions were agreed to by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and several other Governors in the Northeast last year.
Another figure in the controversy was New York City's Mayor, David N. Dinkins, who successfully lobbied several Democrats from the city to back away from the delay.
Environmental groups reacted with cautious praise to news that the emissions standards would remain in place.

HEADLINE: Scores in Math Test And in Reading Fall In New York Schools

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
After two years of rebounding academic results in the New York City school system, reading and mathematics scores dropped sharply this spring, many of the city's superintendents say.
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez has not yet completed an analysis of the results of standardized tests that elementary and junior high school students took in April and May. 
 But reports from half of the city's 32 district superintendents indicate that the school system's recent upbeat trend that saw a decline in dropout rates and a rise in attendance may be faltering.
Local school officials said the slide was a result of several factors, including the painful budget cuts the school system had to absorb this year and the departure of many of its most seasoned teachers and principals because of a money-saving early-retirement plan.
The superintendents, conducting their own informal tabulations of scores sent to students in recent weeks, told of disappointing and sometimes perplexing districtwide declines of as much as 3, 4 and 5 percentage points in reading and mathematics achievement. Such swings are far larger than the typical year-to-year fluctuations, the superintendents said.
Last year, Mr. Fernandez trumpeted a rise of 3 percentage points in the proportion of students reading on or above the norm for their grade and a jump of 4.9 percentage points in math. He said those results, coupled with improvements in attendance and the dropout rate, demonstrated that he had begun to turn the city's long-troubled school system around since taking its helm in January 1990.
Yesterday, however, Mr. Fernandez's press secretary, James S. Vlasto, said only that any "reports on the citywide results are pure speculation" and promised that an official report would be released within 10 days.
Just two weeks ago, Mr. Fernandez seemed to try to discount the significance of the results by asking Board of Education members to consider abolishing the annual rankings of schools by reading tests, though not of the reading scores themeslves.
Education experts say reading and math scores from standardized tests are only one indicator of how well a school system is doing. However, a variation of 3 points is considered a big drop.
Some superintendents blamed vagaries in the tests themselves, wondering why the drops in reading scores were most acute in the third and fifth grades, or else they said the tests were more difficult than those given the year before.
Some superintendents, like Harvey Garner of District 18 in Canarsie and Flatbush in Brooklyn, said the influx of 100,000 immigrants into the school system over the last three years who speak English poorly had weakened the pool of students taking the test. The impact of that immigration wave would have been felt more keenly this year because immigrant students are required to take the test two years after enrolling in the school system.
But many superintendents blamed the budget cuts. Max Messer, superintendent of District Eight in the East Bronx and the head of the superintendents' association, laid the blame squarely on the budget cuts that prompted Mr. Fernandez to seek the early retirement of the 4,200 most senior -- and expensive -- teachers and more than 200 principals -- one of every five. Mr. Messer's district suffered a drop of 4.6 percentage points in reading and 2 points in mathematics after years of steady improvement.
"We have a large number of beginning teachers who are taking spots vacated by people who went out on early retirement," Mr. Messer said. "We have to train these people all over again as well as training newcomers, with decreased resources and the elimination of supervisors."
Mr. Messer and others recalled that in two years the system has been battered by more than $750 million in cuts imposed by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo as they coped with tax revenue shortfalls resulting from the national recession. In many districts, classes have become more crowded, supplies are hard to come by and there are few guidance counselors and security guards to cope with unruly children.
The reading test -- Degrees of Reading Power -- is designed by Touchstone Applied Science Associates of Brewster, N.Y. Its president, Bertram Koslin, said in an interview that Connecticut had used the same test for its schools and that the Connecticut results this year paralleled scores in previous years.
"I would be surprised, given all the budget cuts that have taken place in New York, that the scores wouldn't go down," he said. "If they didn't go down, there would be something wrong. Making deals with senior people for early retirement would have a terrific impact because they're the socializers for new teachers."
Superintendents or other officials of Districts 1, 3, 4 and 5 in Manhattan, Districts 8, 9, 11 and 12 in the Bronx, Districts 13, 14, 18 and 21 in Brooklyn, and Districts 26 in Queens all reported declines from a year ago in their scores on the test that was given in the second through the ninth grades. An official of District 2 on the East Side of Manhattan said there had been no change there.
Last year, only two districts slipped in performance from the preceding year. This year at least a dozen did, the superintendents said.
Officials of other districts had not taken tallies, did not respond to telephone messages or could not be reached.
"Frankly, I'm disappointed," said Anton Klein, superintendent of District 3 on the West Side of Manhattan. "We've been making steady progress over the last five years. This year we slipped. This is a kind of setback for us."
 
Less Resources
 Dr. Angelo Gimondo, superintendent of Disrict 30 in Long Island City, Queens, while not certain of the results for his district, said overcrowded classes and a decline in experienced teachers had begun to take their toll.
"You can't expect a brand new teacher out of college to do as good a job as more experienced teachers," he said. "You tell me how you can expect a teacher with less resources to do as good a job as some of her colleagues in the suburbs who have 15 or 16 kids in a class with all kinds of suppportive services."
The reasons for any one year's swing in the test are hard to pin down. Over time, students tend to do better on a test format with which they become familiar, and intense preparation for the test seems to lift scores slightly. Influxes of immigrants, changes in the numbers of students assigned to learning-disabled classes, and changes in the ethnic and racial makeup of the system all affect the outcomes.
Some superintendents were reluctant to assign blame to outside factors. Eric J. Ward, the deputy superintendent of District 13 in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene in Brooklyn, said he was not "looking for excuses" for his district's drop of 4 percentage points in reading and 2 points in mathematics.
"Ten years from now, students have to go looking for work and they cannot say I did poorly because of the budget cuts," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Post Modest Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
New economic reports that seemed favorable for fixed-income investors were largely ignored by credit market participants yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities rose only modestly in light trading.
On the surface, the reported four-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Producer Price Index in May, the largest monthly gain in the last 19 months, was a nasty surprise. 
 But analysts characterized the increase as an aberrant blip caused largely by a sharp increase in tobacco and commercial aircraft prices. Excluding those two categories, the index was up only one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
'It Is Only One Month'
 "I wasn't fazed by the report because it is only one month, and one month does not make a trend," said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data, a Boston-based provider of fixed-income and foreign exchange analysis. "You will see greater volatility of prices at this level than with consumer prices, because it is the purpose of wholesalers to absorb risk."
Joseph Carson, chief economist at Dean Witter Financial Services, said: "The best news on inflation is behind us, but this report overstates what is going on. The inflation outlook is still good."
More troubling to analysts was the meager two-tenths of 1 percent gain in retail sales reported for May, accompanied by downward revisions in the February-through-April period.
Retail sales "are coming in weaker than anyone projected," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America in San Francisco.
"Based on their comments over the last couple of weeks, the Fed believes the economy is still moving ahead at a sustainable pace," he added. "But a number like this has to raise eyebrows."
 
Fed's Monetary Policy
 The retail sales number seemed to revive the thought among market participants that the Federal Reserve Board may move to ease monetary policy once again, because short-term Treasury notes and bills performed better than longer-dated securities.
In addition, "with business so quiet, people are beginning to take a look at how the election is shaping up, and what they see unsettles them," a government securities trader said. "A big reason why short maturities are so popular is because of the uncertainty of what could happen between now and November."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10113/32 , up 1/4 point, to yield 7.87 percent, compared with 7.89 percent late Wednesday.
Among outstanding note issues, the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 10030/32 late yesterday, up 6/32 , to yield 6.52 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/8, up 3/32 , to yield 5.05 percent.
 
Rates on Bills Drop
 Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.63 percent late yesterday, down four basis points, or four-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.75 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 3.95 percent, down four basis points.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that two measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended June 1, while M-3, the broadest monetary aggregate, fell by $10.6 billion.
The money numbers were in line with consensus estimates and had virtually no effect on prices in the credit markets.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was slow, traders said. Prices of most outstanding corporate bonds were unchanged on the day.
Meanwhile, participants in the municipal bond market said prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up about 1/8 point.

Dollar Ends Sharply Lower On Weak Economic Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against key foreign currencies yesterday, hurt by unexpectedly weak domestic economic news.
Gold prices advanced. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fetched $340.50, up $2.60 from Wednesday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, bullion was quoted at $340.00 as of 4 P.M., up $2.25 from Wednesday. 
 Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's drop was largely attributable to the Commerce Deparment's report that retail sales rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in May, far below the expected rise. Moreover, the department said sales in April advanced only four-tenths of 1 percent, not nine-tenths of 1 percent as it originally reported.
"The retail numbers were very disappointing," said Carl Forcheski, a trader at Chemical Bank's foreign exchange desk in New York. "It showed a faltering of the consumer sector, and that drew some concern in the market."
The dollar is particularly sensitive to signs of economic weakness, which raise the possibility of lower interest rates. Lower rates in the United States hurt the value of dollar-denominated investments.
The Federal Reserve has said it will scrutinize the economy's slow recovery from the recession, suggesting it is prepared to ease interest rates if there is any danger of a relapse and if inflation is not a threat.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.38 yen, down 0.04 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar fetched 126.35 yen. By the close in New York the dollar fetched 126.35 yen, down from 127.55 yen on Wednesday.
The British pound fetched $1.8475 in London, up from $1.8335 late Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.8505, up from $1.8340 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: 2d Key Republican in House Says He Won't Run Again

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
In the second resignation this week by a Republican in New York State's House delegation, Representative David O'B. Martin of the state's northeastern corner, who has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to win Federal projects for his economically distressed district, announced today that he would not seek re-election.
The six-term Congressman, a Marine Corps fighter pilot in the Vietnam War and the only New York Republican on the influential committee, said he decided to step down now instead of serving another two-year term so that his successor would have a chance to begin accruing seniority and because of the job's excessive demands. 
 "Living a couple of hundred days a year out of a suitcase is not something you want to do," Mr. Martin said in noting that his 13,500-square-mile district is larger than nine states. "You have to work with the zeal of a crusader, which I think I've done. The only promise I made my constituents is to work 60 seconds every minute, which I think I've done."
He was one of just three Republicans to oppose Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plan to cancel the Marine Corps' Osprey aircraft and the Navy's F-14D fighter, a major program on Long Island, where the plane is built by the Grumman Corporation.
But perhaps his biggest impact came in 1985 when he overcame the Army's concerns and pushed the service into basing a new light infantry unit, the 10th Mountain Division, at Fort Drum. As the ranking minority member on the Military Installations subcommittee, he obtained $1.3 billion for construction at the post for some 25,000 soldiers and their families. That made Jeffferson County the fastest-growing county in the state.
 
Huge House Turnover
 Mr. Martin's decision adds to the upheaval reverberating through the House in the wake of voter dissatisfaction and the checking scandal. So far, 70 Representatives have announced their retirement or have been defeated in primaries, insuring the greatest turnover in the House since World War II.
Mr. Martin said it was the large turnover that convinced him to step down now, even though he was considered certain to win re-election in the district, one of the most solidly Republican in the state. "If I had served two more years, whoever succeeded me would have been very junior, entering after the biggest class in history," he said. And that, he noted, would have doomed his successor to serving on inconsequential committees.
But in the short run Mr. Martin's decision will undercut New York's influence in the House. His announcement came two days after Raymond J. McGrath, also a six-term Republican and a ranking member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, said he would not seek re-election. In addition, two influential Democrats, Matthew F. McHugh and Robert J. Mrazek, have decided to step down.
Mr. Martin said he had not decided what he would do in the future but noted that he had always wanted to teach and greatly enjoyed a short stint this year as an instructor at the Naval Academy.

HEADLINE: Jobless-Benefit Claims Are Steady at 407,000

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The number of new claims for unemployment benefits remained at 407,000 for the week ending May 30, the Labor Department said today.
Analysts were disappointed by the failure of jobless claims to show any improvement, especially given the fact that there was one fewer day to file claims because of the Memorial Day holiday. 
 A four-week moving average, however, did decline slightly to 406,000, down from 410,750 and the lowest level in 19 months.
Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the continued improvement in the moving average of claims reflected a stronger tone to the labor market compared with the beginning of the year, when jobless claims were stuck above the 450,000 level.
The Labor Department reported last week that the unemployment rate shot up to 7.5 percent in May, higher than at any time during the recession, as a flood of summer job seekers overwhelmed the weak economy's ability to create jobs.
Economists said they still believed that the jobless rate would show improvement in coming months although the most pessimistic forecasters said the improvement was likely to be at such a slow pace that the jobless rate would be likely to remain above 7 percent well into 1993.
For the week ending May 30, Ohio had the largest increase in applications for unemployment benefits, a rise of 1,009.
California had the largest decline in benefit applications, a drop of 6,332 that was attributed to the shortened filing week. The Labor Department said 420 new claims were attributed to layoffs caused by the Los Angeles riots.
Other states with big declines in jobless applications were Michigan, down 4,536 because of fewer layoffs in the auto industry; New York, down 3,794; North Carolina, down 2,767; New Jersey, down 2,288; Illinois, down 2,005; Washington, down 1,699; Florida, down 1,620; Pennsylvania, down 1,601; Oregon, down 1,556; Georgia, down 1,526, and Mississippi, down 1,019.
The national figures are adjusted for seasonal variations but the state figures are not.

HEADLINE: Building Homes and Hope in Watts

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Amid a bustle of workers and clouds of dust, Thad Williams surveys the site where a kind of mini-suburbia is going up in the heart of Watts: a one-mile stretch of $150,000 houses intended, he says, to bring the black middle class back home.
The project, the first commercial single-family subdivision built in Watts since World War II, is a point of special pride in this neighborhood in a city where many blacks complain that black contractors are relegated to secondary roles in big private projects, even with the influx of government money to rebuild this riot-torn city. 
 The 114-house project is being built without government financing by a small black-owned company. The houses are for sale, not rent. The parts already built got through the riots unscathed, and Mr. Williams says that despite the riots, middle-class customers keep coming to see and buy houses that sell at a fraction of the price they would fetch in the suburbs.
The project's backers hope that the arrival of 114 new middle-class families will begin to provide a customer base for the area's businesses and help end the economic isolation of the area's youths.
Mr. Williams and his partner, Marvin Greer, said they were able to get the backing of the Wells Fargo Bank by convincing the bankers that they understood the demographics and market potential of the area as no outsider could. There is money to be made in inner-city real estate, they argued.
Persuaded, the bank put up nearly $12 million in financing for construction on a sliver of land a mile and a half long and 100 feet wide that the partners bought for $1.5 million from the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1990.
"This project makes sense on a free-market basis," said Mr. Williams, a 41-year-old developer who grew up in the area. "The black middle class made the decision to leave because there was no choice of a good place to live. But now a person with a $50,000 income who is renting in a middle-class area may have to go an hour and a half outside the city if he wants to buy."
"If minorities are going to begin to rebuild an economy here," Mr.
Williams added, "I believe we are going to have to do it ourselves."
Mr. Williams says his tiny company, the Williams Greer Group, used its experience in building smaller projects in the area as a selling point with the bank to get the loans for the development, called Santa Ana Pines.
Mr. Williams, a former engineer with the Northrop Corporation, and Mr. Greer, a redevelopment expert who once worked with the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in New York, completed a 130-unit rental town house development in Watts in 1990 that is fully rented.
"We are very confident of their ability to know what sells," said Andrea Berkeley, a vice president at Wells Fargo. "These people's expertise is in creating enclaves of good, solid, lower- or middle-class housing. As a bank, we believe the right risk-reward ratio is there."
 
A Previous Exodus
 Middle-class and lower-middle-class areas like Inglewood, Culver City and Baldwin Hills are flush with refugees from Watts, who left in the years after the riots of 1965.
Social scientists, like William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago, have said that for the neighborhoods left behind, the flight of middle-class blacks is something like the building of a wall around the young people, who no longer can see successful role models or make job contacts.
But in Los Angeles now, Mr. Williams argued, high real estate prices outside the inner city could create a countertrend.
Middle-class families, with incomes of $40,000 to $60,000, find that the cost of a three-bedroom house within an hour's drive of downtown is $225,000 or more. Some are choosing to buy in towns as far away as Palmdale and Lancaster, in the northeast end of Los Angeles County, where the commuting time can be as much as three hours round trip.
 
A Relative Bargain
 By contrast, Watts, close to downtown, is one of the few areas in Southern California where, simply because of location, the average home price has stayed low.
According to Dataquick Information Systems, a real estate information service, the median price for a home in 11 ZIP codes in Watts and South-Central Los Angeles rose to $125,000 in 1992 from $79,000 in 1987, an indication of increasing buyer interest in the area. Recently, sales have held steady or even risen as real estate sales dropped off sharply elsewhere in Southern California.
Such statistics helped Mr. Williams and Mr. Greer persuade Wells Fargo to back the plan, after a number of government agencies said they were not interested in financing private houses for middle-income buyers.
On land where railroad tracks used to run, contractors have nearly completed the first dozen of 114 Spanish-style houses with red-tiled roofs. The houses are two-story split-levels, most with four bedrooms, and all with 1,600 square feet of interior space, central air-conditioning, two-car garages with automatic door openers and dishwashers.
The homes are built shoulder to shoulder with small yards; the plan calls for street-side grass and lines of trees to create a green corridor intended to conjure up images of a serene suburban life. The project, community groups say, is already raising the value of homes on the surrounding streets of drab rundown bungalows.
The plan calls for two acres of the site to become a cultural center and park and for the building of about 15 retail stores. So far, Mr. Williams said, 10 homes have been sold, and even after the riots, the sales office has been receiving 12 telephone calls and 5 visitors a day. The project is expected to be completed in 1994.
On a tour of the site, Mr. Williams pointed to four untrained workers he hired from among the unemployed in the neighborhood. His company pays them each $10 an hour, and offers them to his contractors as free labor with the understanding that the contractors will pay something if they find their work valuable.
This practice, Mr. Williams said, along with hiring inner-city contractors when possible, addresses a point of growing tension in Los Angeles these days as residents of poor neighborhoods see outsiders, often white, employed in the reconstruction of their neighborhoods.
 
The Time to Buy
 "We tell people that if you can't afford to buy a single-family home now during a real estate recession, you probably won't in the future, " said Carlos Mesa, the project's sales manager. "True, there is crime and gang problems, but that is true all over Los Angeles. You are not going to solve it by running away."
Richard McKinley, a black social worker living in a one-bedroom condominium in Long Beach, found that argument hard to resist. At 33, he said, he could not afford a house anywhere in the Los Angeles area. The best contribution he could make to helping poor blacks, he said, was to become a neighbor.
"I really feel that a middle-class person going back into the community can change the thinking of people," said Mr. McKinley, who expects to move into his new home sometime in the summer. "Children can see your life style, and see that a black person has made it."

HEADLINE: The Serious Business of Comedy Clubs

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
"THERE are too many comedians," Rita Rudner declared recently. "Pretty soon the Government is going to pay you not to be a comedian the same way they pay you not to grow wheat." Ms. Rudner, who is one of the country's four or five most successful young female comics, was commenting on the glut of performers in a field that until Eddie Murphy's ascent to superstardom and the proliferation of comedy on cable television was difficult to break into.
Then in the early 1980's, comedy became "the rock of the 80's," as Caroline Hirsch, the owner of Caroline's -- New York's most prestigious comedy club -- called it a decade ago, and the stampede began. 
 "Nowadays, when children tell their parents they want to be lawyers, their parents say, first learn how to be a comedian so you'll have something to fall back on," Ms. Rudner said.
Ms. Rudner is currently making her first New York appearance in four years at Caroline's, which recently moved from the South Street Seaport to gleaming new headquarters on Broadway at 49th Street in mid-Manhattan.
Her comedians-are-a-glut-on-the-market observations join a long list of jokes about the profession's overcrowdedness that some trace back nearly a decade to Randy Credico's quip: "Every time a steel mill closes in Pittsburgh, another comic joins the work force." But there is a painful side to the jokes about the superabundance of stand-up comedy. Although the comedy boom hasn't exactly gone bust, the bubble has burst. Several months ago, an article in Spy magazine re-christened stand-up comedy "the disco of the 90's." Around the country as well as in New York City, comedy clubs that until 1989 were almost guaranteed moneymakers are struggling for survival.
Many in the club business attribute the sagging box office to cable television, where uncensored comedy has become a thriving staple.
Two of the highest-rated programs on the Arts & Entertainment Network are the stand-up shows "An Evening at the Improv" and "Caroline's Comedy Hour." Comedy is a staple of Home Box Office, Showtime and MTV. And Comedy Central, a 24-hour cable network that was formed a year ago by the merger of the Comedy Channel and the Ha! network, reaches 22 million homes.
Campbell McLaren, a television producer of comedy specials who has been affiliated with several major New York comedy clubs, worries that Spy's description of comedy might be prophetic. "I'm working to make sure that comedy doesn't become the disco of the 90's, which it has a fair chance of doing," he said. "There are similarities. A lot of comedy has become more generic. Just as Ethel Merman and everybody else did a disco record in the late 1970's, now everybody wants to be a comedian. The garage band has been replaced by the garage comic."
This anyone-can-do-it esthethic may have helped reduce the comedy-club audience. Barry Weintraub, a San Francisco comic who publishes "The Comedy U.S.A. Industry Guide," a who's-who to clubs, performers, agents and managers, said that around the nation attendance at comedy clubs had plummeted.
"Although there are still more than 400 full-time comedy clubs around the country, people are selling cut-rate tickets, papering the house, anything they can do to stay in business," he said. "People are telling me they have to work twice as hard to stay even."
Ms. Hirsch, of Caroline's, blames the economy for the decline in comedy-club attendance. "It's more than a recession," she insisted. "There's a depression going on right now."
In New York City, two comedy clubs -- Comedy U and Who's on First -- have folded in recent years, and the Improvisation, one of the city's oldest and most beloved clubs, recently filed for bankruptcy, but is still operating. Although the owners of New York's other clubs report that their business isn't bad, they agree that it could be better.
Another negative sign for the industry was the closing three months ago of Spotlight Enterprises, a small, aggressive talent agency based in New York and specializing in stand-up comedy. And two comedy magazines, Laugh Track and Rave, have folded for lack of advertising.
 
'Can Negotiate You to Death'
 As business has declined, so has the price of talent. Around the country, Mr. McLaren said, the amount that clubs are willing to pay comedians has fallen by $500 to $1,000 a week in the last two years.
"If you're a performer who can put people in seats, you can command your price," Mr. Weintraub said. "If you don't, a club owner can negotiate you to death. An owner would rather pay $1,200 for a comic to come in and try to build a following than $2,000 to $4,000 for a headliner who isn't drawing well."
Everyone is quick to point out that the crisis is relative, and comedy is still very big business. Like the rest of big-time entertainment in America, it has also become internationalized. Next month, the Just for Laughs Festival, an 11-day marketing convention that is similar to the Cannes Film Festival, will celebrate its 10th anniversary in Montreal. The event, which lasts from July 30 to Aug. 9, is expected to involve 200 comedians from 18 countries.
And if the fees being paid to comics have declined somewhat, they are still hefty. In Manhattan, a particularly popular headline act at Caroline's, like David Alan Grier, earns $7,500 to $10,000 for three nights of work. A relatively unknown headliner at a smaller showcase club like Stand-Up NY earns $1,500 a week.
Richard Fields, the owner of the Manhattan showcase club Catch a Rising Star, said the comedy club business was going through a shakeout.
"You had a lot of people attracted to the business because they thought it was easy access," he said. "I saw rooms converted from discos into country-and-western bars and then into comedy clubs. In Chicago some people in the roofing-and-siding business decided to get into the comedy club business and opened up a big club and decided not to charge admission. They looked at it as a short-term investment and devalued the experience for everyone in the city."
"From my standpoint," he added, "the shakeout we're going through is very valuable because it will drive the short-term players out of the business who shouldn't have been here in the first place."
 
The Next King of Comedy?
 This shakeout has not only affected club economics, but performance styles as well. With the bursting of the club bubble, the general trend in the tone of stand-up comedy has grown more cautious. In the early 1980's, the hottest young performers in clubs were so-called weird or conceptual performers like Pee-wee Herman, Steven Wright and Emo Philips. Then in a rush of rock-star energy came performers like Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Kinison who brought a macho, heavy-metal energy to the field.
Within the comedy industry, it is generally agreed that Jerry Seinfeld, with his friendly observational humor, has superseded Mr. Clay as the king of comedy.
Mr. McLaren attributes the rise of stars like Mr. Seinfeld, Richard Lewis, Paul Reiser and Carol Liefer to what he called the suburbanization of comedy. For around the country, as in Manhattan, the predominant audience for urban comedy clubs comes from outside the city.
Spurred partly by the success of Home Box Office's late-night show "Def Comedy Jam," black comedians who follow the raunchy tradition that descends from Redd Foxx through Eddie Murphy also continue to be very popular. And slowly but steadily, the respect given to women in a field that for decades was male-dominated continues to increase.
"I remember that when I was starting out, clubs would allow only one female onstage a night," Ms. Rudner said. "Now we're thought of as just comedians, and it's not unheard of to put two women back to back.
"It used to be that a male comic would get up and say, 'My wife is so fat, my wife is so horrible,' and because women are used to laughing at themselves, we would never think he was talking about us," she continued. "But when we started getting up and saying, 'My husband does this, my boyfriend does that,' the men would go 'wait a second.' I think that men have learned to laugh at themselves much more easily."
 
Back in the Good Old Days
 Although female comedians are flourishing, she sees the slump in the club business and cable television's demand for comedy as helping to lower the standards of professional humor.
"When I was starting out, people had to work very hard to get a shot on television," said Ms. Rudner, who took up stand-up comedy in 1981 after working as a professional dancer for 10 years. "Now because of all the cable channels, people only have to get five minutes together, and all of a sudden they're on TV, and they think they've made it. Then they don't have another five minutes, and then they're gone. They haven't put in the years to develop a style."
Ms. Rudner approached the role of comedian like a graduate student doing research.
"I listened to all of Jack Benny's radio shows and at the Lincoln Center library I watched his television shows," she said. "I studied Woody Allen's record 'The Stand-Up Years.' I would sit there and diagram things. My favorite thing was Jack Benny's using the least words one can say to get a laugh. To me the ultimate is to be able to stand there and not say anything and get a laugh."

HEADLINE: Review/Theater; Richard III;
McKellen's Richard Is for This Century

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHEN Shakespeare's Richard III refuses to eat dinner until he is brought the head of the allegedly traitorous Lord Hastings, his henchmen hustle poor Hastings offstage to do the dirty deed. But in Richard Eyre's Royal National Theater production of "Richard III," transported to the 1930's and ignited by Ian McKellen's transcendent star performance, the audience's dinner is in jeopardy as well. Hastings's severed, silver-haired head, unceremoniously dumped into a red fire bucket, is soon set before Mr. McKellen, who idly pokes a worming finger into its bloody muck as if he were searching its orifices for buried treasure or, worse, private pleasure.
What exactly Richard hopes to find in Hastings's head remains a mystery perhaps best left unsolved, but that strange, ghoulishly funny bit of business is typical of Mr. McKellen's uninhibited approach to the Shakespearean villain the 20th century has long since sadly recognized as its own. Without relinquishing any of the evil in the part, the actor finds some of the malicious humor in Richard that Brecht and Chaplin once found in Hitler. Neither a crookback nor sexually overheated, Mr. McKellen's king is a stunning antiheroic alternative to the archetypal Olivier image. He is something to see, and quickly, for "Richard III" is stopping at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for only two weeks before taking off on a cross-country tour. 
 The troupe surrounding the star, it must be said, is very much a road company. Except for some minor players, it is not the same supporting cast (then led by Brian Cox's Buckingham) that initiated this production in London two years ago, and its quality, often bland and sometimes poor, is far below the high National Theater standard visible right now at its home base in such productions as "Angels in America," "The Madness of George III" and Mr. Eyre's own staging of "The Night of the Iguana." Yet even at its worst, and even as it must battle royally with an acoustically inhospitable opera house, this cast can only dull, never obliterate, the rigorous intellectual and visual conceits that give this "Richard III" its distinct chill. Mr. McKellen's performance, meanwhile, seems to have gained in grotesque detail, only occasionally at the price of mannered excess, since its London debut.
Governing both the star and the staging is Mr. Eyre's typically inventive and very British vision of his updated setting. This is not another literal-minded "Richard III" set down in Nazi Germany or Il Duce's Italy. As sparely designed in black, white and blood-red by the superb Bob Crowley, the play unfolds in a paranoiac, inky, pre-World War II England atmospherically reminiscent of a contemporaneous Graham Greene novel like "The Ministry of Fear" or a Hitchcock movie like "The Lady Vanishes."
Interrogation lamps hang from above, faceless walls imprison the action, and fascism looms as an idea that the aristocracy is all too willing to entertain. Without being explicit, Mr. Eyre reminds the audience of how Edward VIII, Neville Chamberlain and Oswald Mosley might have pushed England into the fatal embrace of totalitarianism. As the weak, titled collaborators in Richard's criminal ascent to the throne meet at candle-lit formal dinner parties or dissemble in elegant Westminster cabinet rooms, they often share the stage with tableaux of plebeian thugs silencing those few citizens who bravely dissent.
It's in keeping with this scheme that Mr. McKellen is a regal English military man who is first seen marching rigidly toward the audience in uniform, braying about the winter of his discontent with the equine hauteur and dry pitch of a Colonel Blimp rather than in the addled tones of a madman. It is not until he takes off his cap or slithers in profile that we notice the deformities of his left side: a withered arm, a twisted spine and a mottled temple that recalls the gargoyle makeup of Michael Crawford's Phantom of the Opera or perhaps Jack Nicholson's Joker. Unlike most Richards, Mr. McKellen's does not truly match the physical traits others attribute to him -- those of a "bottled spider," a "bunch-backed toad" -- until that deep, unhinged point in the play when he is finally "so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin." It is also late in the evening when Mr. McKellen's voice at last roars at a dictator's pitch (in "I am not in the giving vein today") and his face devolves into a grinning, demonic death mask recalling the Weimar caricatures of George Grosz, not to mention latter-day photographs of Kurt Waldheim.
Since Mr. McKellen has few of a typical Richard's physical gimmicks to fall back on, and since this early Shakespeare melodrama (a tragedy in name only) does not give his part the psychological complexity of a Macbeth or Iago, he has lots of creative space in which to fashion an original characterization. Mr. McKellen fills it brilliantly by presenting a most contemporary tyrant, one who gets what he wants by sheer gall and the relentless, shameless push of his sharp though warped intelligence. When his Richard woos Lady Anne (Anastasia Hille) over her own husband's corpse, he wears her down with sheer wily persistence and a battering-ram personality, not charm or eroticism. Indeed, Mr. McKellen seems the smartest person on stage in every scene, with only Charlotte Cornwell's Queen Elizabeth fleetingly proving an equal antagonist.
The humor and terror in this Richard are inseparable. A cigarette dangles from Mr. McKellen's mouth at a sly Noel Cowardesque tilt even as he solicits the "happy" news of the murder of King Edward's two young sons. In the ominous Nuremberg-like rally that precedes intermission, Mr. McKellen wields a pocket Bible to adopt the public pretense of piety, then discards it with a contemptuous flick of a wrist so that he might lead the masses in a Black Shirt salute. While his Richard is, as he must be, a chameleon, faking emotions from grief to avuncularity, Mr. McKellen's highly sophisticated sense of theater and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims' strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not.
What the star cannot do in "Richard III" is show a New York audience how much his acting has grown in emotional depth in the dozen years since his last bravura performance here, as Salieri in the Broadway "Amadeus." Except for one brief (and beautifully done) mea culpa near evening's end ("My conscience hath a thousand several tongues"), Mr. McKellen is not allowed any introspection by this particular Shakespearean text, and the low, autumnal notes responsible for his triumph as Uncle Vanya at the National Theater this year remain unrevealed.
In a different way, this production offers only a small hint of the National's prowess under Mr. Eyre's extraordinary four-year tenure as its artistic leader. Not only is the stock supporting company (Miss Cornwell excepted) of this "Richard III" unrepresentative of the National, but so is "Richard III" itself only a tiny taste of the eclectic repertory fielded by the company on its three London stages. In our long winter of recession, both the National and the Royal Shakespeare Company have all but ceased to visit the United States. As Mr. McKellen's frighteningly insidious portrayal of a Machiavellian politician will make clear to a national audience in this election year, theater of this ferocious immediacy is one import this country should not do without.

HEADLINE: Folly Defeated, by Nine Votes

 BODY:
Things looked bad this week. One after another, proponents of a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget rose on the House floor to celebrate their supposed discipline.
Some discipline. The earliest possible effective date was 1998. And "effective" could only refer to jeopardizing the economy and trivializing the Constitution. 
 But then yesterday afternoon the tide turned, in good part because of the tireless efforts of Speaker Thomas Foley and Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, and the House did itself proud by denying the proposed amendment the two-thirds majority it needed to pass. True, the nine-vote margin of victory was small. But at least for now, the economy and the nation's founding document are safe.
The amendment, sponsored by Charles Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, and vigorously supported by President Bush, produced fatuous debate. It turned mostly on irrelevancies -- the sin of running deficits, the certainty of economic collapse, the vulnerability of America's grandchildren. Virtually no one dealt with the damage that the actual language would do, once enshrined irremediably in the Constitution.
Yes, Congress needs to control the deficit. But not by amendment and surely not by Mr. Stenholm's approach. Where his language is specific, it is specifically harmful. And where it is general, it would invite constitutional crisis or cynical evasion.
The amendment would have required the Federal budget to be balanced unless three-fifths of both houses voted a waiver. It called on Congress to pass implementing legislation. In other words, to amend the Constitution in ways to be determined later. Who would do the enforcing, the President, wielding a line-item veto? Or the Federal judiciary, responding to a blizzard of lawsuits? None of the proponents seemed to care enough to offer a clear answer.
To appreciate the recklessness of the proposal, consider what might have happened had such an amendment been in place in 1990. During the year, the deficit rose $100 billion-plus above initial projections. Congress would have had to slash spending or raise taxes by that amount.
That would have pushed an uncomfortable downturn into a disastrous depression, from which the country probably would not yet have emerged. So much for Mr. Stenholm's self-proclaimed fiscal prudence.
Oh, but there's a safety valve, proponents insist. Congress could waive the amendment by super-majority vote. Yes, but only if it were sufficiently clairvoyant to anticipate a recession's length.And only if it didn't mind handing over the power to tip the outcome to a political minority.
Yesterday's vote was no stake through the vampire's heart; the idea of trying to lock the refrigerator through the Constitution rather than with real discipline has enduring appeal to reckless legislators. But for the moment at least, the House has defeated folly.

HEADLINE: The Courage to Bend in Rio

 BODY:
Is President Bush an environmental pariah doing his best to scuttle important treaties at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro? Or is he the only world leader with the courage to stand firm against a flood tide of environmental extremism?
The answer is, a little of both. On specific issues, like global warming, biodiversity and forest preservation, the Bush Administration has taken reasonable, even principled, positions. But in its overall approach to this conference the White House has shown little zeal for protecting the global environment and little desire to compromise for the greater good. 
 Rather than find ways around sticking points in proposed treaties, the Administration has sought political advantage by posturing against "extremes" in the environmental movement.
Today, when Mr. Bush addresses the conference, he will have a final chance to salvage the nation's reputation as an environmental leader. If he is wise he will make it clear that the United States is ready to join the rest of the industrialized world in fighting for global conservation.
The signs for a late conversion are not good. On the eve of Mr. Bush's departure, his aides seemed eager to milk the President's isolation at Rio for domestic political advantage, arguing that a tough stance would please development interests and workers concerned about losing jobs because of environmental regulations.
The global warming treaty, the only one Mr. Bush will sign at the summit meeting, illustrates both the strength and weakness of the Administration's intransigence. Almost singlehandedly, the U.S. forced other industrial nations to abandon a firm commitment to stabilize the emission of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead the treaty requires nations to institute programs to reduce emissions.
This is a rational approach that avoids the danger of crippling economic growth to meet an arbitrary target. Even if the U.S. could hit the target in the year 2000, it might have great difficult stabilizing at that level thereafter. Better to make a good-faith effort to curb emissions than to adopt an unreachable goal.
But the Administration's good faith was called into question when it leaned on small European countries to drop a non-binding statement criticizing the treaty and calling for stronger action. Worse yet, the Administration's own plan for curbing emissions is far too weak, avoiding the most potent weapon available, a carbon tax.
Mr. Bush will almost certainly not sign the other major treaty, designed to protect biodiversity. Again, he has reasonable objections. The treaty has troublesome clauses that seem to threaten patents and intellectual property rights, valuable principles that the U.S. has fought hard to protect for many years. Other clauses would set up a financing mechanism that could give far too much power to receiving countries, leaving donor countries little leverage to prevent waste.
But the treaty is riddled with escape hatches that call for action when appropriate or mutually agreed upon. European nations seem willing to sign and then issue separate statements interpreting troublesome clauses. But instead of going the extra mile to protect global resources, the Administration finds fearsome risks everywhere.
It may be too late to make substantive changes in the U.S. position. But it's not too late for Mr. Bush to pledge greater efforts to preserve biodiversity and additional financial contributions toward global environmental protection.

'Macedonia' for Greece

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: ATHENS

 BODY:
What's in a name? Ghosts or real historical demons. Perhaps war or peace. Nothing and everything.
The name in question is Macedonia, birthplace of Alexander the Great and Aristotle. Some 1.9 million souls who used to constitute a republic within Yugoslavia now insist they must have that name for their newly independent state. Greece, with its own province of Macedonia, says it will recognize the new state, with its capital of Skopje -- but only if "Macedonia" appears nowhere in its name. 
 From the Balkan wars of 1913 to the Greek civil war of 1946 to 1949, when Greek and Macedonian Communists tried to unite the two Macedonias into Yugoslavia, tens of thousands have died over this obscure pinch of land. And over this issue today, Greece is united as it has rarely been throughout what Greeks here call their 2,500 years of democracy.
This history and situation would be quite unremarkable save for one very curious occurrence: Most West European nations and the U.S. are not supporting Greece in the matter. That fence-sitting is curious, even mysterious, because the West has every incentive to back reform-minded Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis -- whose two-seat majority in Parliament surely will collapse unless he can bring the Macedonian issue to a successful conclusion.
The question of Western neutrality and even quiet opposition saturates newspapers, television and daily conversation in this low-slung, white city on the Aegean.
The conservative Mr. Mitsotakis is the most pro-American Greek leader in a very long time. He consummated a controversial naval base agreement with the U.S. He recognized Israel and got tough on terrorism. Surprisingly, he delivered Greek help for the war against Iraq. He has the full weight of the powerful Greek-American lobby behind him, a lobby with close ties to President Bush. Not least, the alternatives to Mr. Mitsotakis are the notoriously anti-American Socialists.
The 12-nation European Community, of which Greece is a member, also has strong reasons for helping Mr. Mitsotakis out. Greece has become the poorest E.C. nation, a basket case constantly in need of E.C. economic aid. And though E.C. leaders feel that this gentle Prime Minister has not gone far or fast enough in making reforms, they greatly prefer him to Andreas Papandreou, his old and bitter Socialist rival.
Mr. Mitsotakis does not have a good explanation for his plight either. "Perhaps Greece didn't provide enough historical information soon enough to the West" before their positions were staked out, he said in an interview in his office, sitting behind his desk flanked by the Greek and E.C. flags with tables adorned by proud pictures of his extensive family.
He recalled that months ago he offered compromise names like Slav-Macedonia, only to be rebuffed by Skopje and Greek politicians and ignored by the West. Pressed for further explanations, he responded: "I would prefer not to explain."
In the Balkans, answers are always elusive. Perhaps the West does not like the friendly relationship between Mr. Mitsotakis and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Though the Greek fully supports E.C. sanctions against Serbia. Perhaps the West fears the two will divide Yugo-Macedonia between them. Though it is now known that Mr. Mitsotakis rejected just such a Milosevic offer. Perhaps the West thinks of Skopje as a democracy. Though it is run by a bunch of Communists who still look to Serbia. Perhaps the West reckons that independence for Skopje can work only if it has the name Macedonia. Though these "Macedonians" are mostly Slavs, and though Macedonia is largely a geographical expression and not a tribal reality. Perhaps Britain and Turkey are secretly conspiring against Greece, as many Greeks darkly suggest.
Or maybe the explanation for Western neutrality is tragically simple -- Greece no longer counts. Once at the center of Western civilization, it now seems a backwater.
But such a judgment would be shortsighted. Greece is the one true democracy in the Balkans. And it is led by a man trying to rid the Greek economy of bureaucratic Socialism and who is also working with Turkey toward a solution of the long-festering Cyprus problem. These are not prospects to throw away over a name. Let the West tell Skopje to be "Skopje," and let "Macedonia" be Greek.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Needs Us. We Need Yeltsin.

BYLINE: By Richard Nixon; Richard Nixon, the former President, is honorary chairman of the Fund for Democracy and Development. He visited Russia and Ukraine last week.

DATELINE: PARK RIDGE, N.J.

 BODY:
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia will come to the summit meeting in Washington on June 16 and 17 not looking for a handout but to join hands in a new partnership based on shared democratic values. The U.S. must seize this opportunity not only because of our ideals but also because of our interest in peace and progress.
Those who question President Yeltsin's commitment to democracy and free-market reforms and urge the West to keep Russia at arm's length make a tragic mistake. 
 In my meeting with him a week ago, President Yeltsin exuded enthusiastic and unequivocal commitment to free elections, free markets and free peoples. He has the magnetic power of a major charismatic figure and has assembled a first-rate team of policy experts. Most important, because those who oppose his reforms have no leader and no program, there is no better alternative.
President Yeltsin has dramatically demonstrated his commitment to reform through deeds and words. He showed not only personal courage in facing down the card-carrying killers in the August coup but also political courage by adopting painful but necessary economic reforms such as freeing prices. He has slashed defense spending, offered dramatic nuclear arms reductions, cut off aid to anti-U.S. regimes such as Cuba and Afghanistan, accepted the independence of other republics of the former Soviet Union and established full diplomatic relations with them.
President Yeltsin is the most pro-Western Russian leader in history. Therefore, the U.S. should lead the West in forging a partnership for economic development with the new Russia. The biggest roadblock to such a partnership is the obstructionism in the Russian Parliament, which President Yeltsin inherited from Mikhail Gorbachev and is dominated by old-line Communists who took office without competitive elections.
President Yeltsin made it clear to me that he is determined to implement his reforms. He will try to do so through the existing Parliament; if that fails, he will impose them by decree or dissolve Parliament and hold elections for a parliament that has a mandate for reform.
In the meantime, Congress should stop its foot-dragging and pass President Bush's Freedom Support Act, which provides for America's contribution to $24 billion in Western aid. Congress's approval of International Monetary Fund assistance will create an incentive for the Parliament to approve the Yeltsin reforms. If we link our aid to passage of those reforms, we will give President Yeltsin greater leverage in his battle.
One indispensable reform is to make the ruble fully convertible. As the architect of economic reform, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, has argued, without a free-floating ruble at a fairly stable exchange rate, trade will be stymied and foreign companies will not want to invest in Russia.
While the International Monetary Fund must prescribe strong medicine, it should not be so strong that it kills the patient. I.M.F. prescriptions assume a market economy already exists, but in Russia such institutions are only embryonic. President Yeltsin will not backslide, but we must be realistic about the economic austerity the Russians can bear without triggering social unrest that will abort reform.
A high priority must be placed on debt relief. Russia's economy is straining under the burden of repaying loans Western banks and governments recklessly made to President Gorbachev's Communist regime. If we do not reschedule the $81 billion debt, new aid will be recycled into Western banks without strengthening Russia's economy. It would be unconscionable to ask the U.S. taxpayer to bail out bankers who made bad loans to the former Soviet Government.
But foreign aid is only a small part of the solution. Our primary goal should be to unleash the American private sector's potential investment in Russia's emerging private sector. Because every Western country is going into or coming out of recession, government-to-government assistance will be severely limited by budgets. But private-sector investment will be limited only by opportunity.
Western aid should focus on developing Russia's private sector; it must not be used to prop up failed state-owned enterprises. It should be used for technical assistance to guide Russia in creating property, tax and commercial law conducive to the growth of a free market. We should also channel funds into loans to new small businesses, which will not only hire unemployed workers but also begin the essential accumulation of domestic capital.
President Yeltsin is committed to establishing the kind of legal framework and economic environment for private enterprise found in the West. Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, the agricultural exporter, estimates that when President Yeltsin achieves that goal, Western companies will commit themselves to investments of $100 billion in the first 18 month period, $200 billion in the second such period and $400 in the third.
The major advantage of private rather than government assistance is that private assistance brings the management expertise, training and new technology needed for the transition from a command to a free-market economy.
A new American-Russian partnership is not charity. Forty-five years ago, the U.S. adopted the Marshall Plan to insure the survival of freedom in Western Europe. By doing so, we gained allies in the cold war and trading partners who fueled our postwar prosperity with purchases of American products.
Those same interests, peace and progress, are at stake today. If President Yeltsin's reforms succeed, we will save tens of billions of dollars in defense spending and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs to supply Russia with the new capital and consumer goods it will require.
If the reforms fail, a new despotism will take power in Russia, threatening its neighbors, sending our peace dividend down the tube and providing aid and comfort to totalitarian rulers in China and elsewhere.
President Yeltsin has shown extraordinary political skill in trying to bring about his reforms. Despite Russia's severe economic hardship, his popularity remains extraordinarily high. By telling the Russian people that conditions would be hard and get harder, he has held their confidence; by embracing Western values, he has given them hope and inspiration.
For 75 years, the Soviet state imposed sacrifices on the people in order to provide a better life for the Communist elite. Today, the Russian President is calling for sacrifice to build a better future for all families and Russia. He can succeed because he has given the people a cause they can believe in.
Many in America's foreign policy establishment underestimated President Yeltsin because they preferred the more sophisticated President Gorbachev. Some portrayed President Yeltsin as an uneducated boob. President Gorbachev's reforms made President Yeltsin possible. But President Yeltsin holds President Gorbachev's place in history in his hands. If President Yeltsin fails, President Gorbachev fails with him.
Both were born peasants. President Gorbachev became a man of the world. President Yeltsin remained a man of the people. President Gorbachev, preoccupied with foreign policy, lost touch with the people. President Yeltsin has revolutionized Russia. Unlike President Gorbachev, he has repudiated Communism and Socialism. If he keeps placing top priority on his problems at home, he can become a statesman who will change the world.

 BODY:
The legislative shepherd who guided the constitutional budget-balancing amendment in the House of Representatives is a conservative Texas Democrat who played a starring role a decade ago in making Reaganomics a reality.
 But the Congressman, Charles W. Stenholm, wants it known that he no longer considers himself a Reagan disciple. Today, he bitterly regrets having mustered the crucial support of Southern Democrats, known as the Boll Weevils, for Mr. Reagan's economic policies, which piled up mountains of debt. 
Why, then, is he leading the charge for the constitutional amendment, one of Ronald Reagan's dreams? Essentially, he is taking a gamble that two wrongs will make a right.
 "We got carried away with tax cuts in 1981, and we've paid a high price for that mistake," said Mr. Stenholm, a former cotton farmer and cattle rancher who speaks with a West Texas drawl and wears boots with his Brooks Brothers suits. "But the problems of doing nothing now about the deficit raise far greater risks than do the problems of trying to restrain our ability to borrow with a Constitutional amendment."
 He says he regrets the need to amend the Constitution but sees it as necessary. The gamble is, he says, that the potentially terrible consequences of the amendment, including what he calls the "horror" of involving courts in setting budgets, would force members to put aside their parochial differences on spending and agree on a way to get the government back in the black.
 Mr. Stenholm even asserts that a balanced budget would not necessarily cause severe anguish. He contends it could be done if all Congress did was freeze spending at one percent below current levels for six years.
"It sounds benign," said Paul N. Van de Water, the deputy assistant director for budget analysis at the Congressional Budget Office. "But that would amount to a 25 percent real cut in every program," he said, basing that estimate on an annual rate of inflation of about 4 percent.
 
Farmer-Lawmaker
 Charles Walter Stenholm was born Oct. 26, 1938, in Ericksdahl, a farming community just north of Abilene that his grandparents and other Swedish immigrants had settled at the turn of the century. He was the only child of Lambert and Irene Constance Stenholm, and he grew up on their 2,000-acre farm. "I still do my best thinking on the tractor," Mr. Stenholm said.
 Mr. Stenholm said his family led a simple life of farming cotton and wheat, herding cattle and taking part in events that revolved around the Bethel Evangelical Lutheran Church.
 In 1961, the year Mr. Stenholm graduated from Texas Tech University in Lubbock with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, he married a classmate, Cindy Watson, an education major from Dumas, Texas.
 "The first time I saw him, he was pitching softball for his fraternity," said Mrs. Stenholm, who is 53, the same age as her husband.
 
Budget a Longtime Priority
 Mrs. Stenholm said she taught second grade and Mr. Stenholm taught agriculture at a vocational high school, and both worked the family farm every spare moment they had. Mr. Stenholm edged into the political world in 1965, when he became a lobbyist for the Rolling Plains Cotton Growers Association. The Stenholms have three children: Chris, a 29-year-old lawyer in Fort Worth, Cary Watson, who is 26 and operates the family farm, and Courtney Ann, who is 20 and a sophomore at Texas A & M University.
 In 1978, the retirement of Omar Burgerson, a 16-term Congressman from the 17th District, gave Mr. Stenholm a chance to run for public office. His campaign included a pledge to work on balancing the budget, and he won by a narrow margin.
 In Congress, he organized the Conservative Democratic Forum, a group of about 45 Southerners who provided the swing votes necessary to enact President Reagan's tax policies. In recognition of the growing influence of conservatives, the House leadership appointed Mr. Stenholm a deputy whip in 1989. But apart from his sponsorship of the budget amendment, which he has plugged since 1982, he has had a rather obscure legislative career focused on agricultural issues and rural health care.
 Mr. Stenholm is seeking re-election this year and is facing the first serious challenge since his first campaign. His Republican opponent, Jeannie Sadowski, 41, has not raised any money yet and has never run for public office before. She said she intended to make an issue of the 88 overdrafts Mr. Stenholm wrote on the now defunct House Bank and two votes that were unpopular in West Texas. Mr. Stenholm voted against a Constitutional amendment forbidding desecration of the flag, and he supported a seven-day waiting period before purchasing a handgun. "It's time for a change," Ms. Sadowski said.
 Mr. Stenholm conceded he had ruffled feathers, but he said he expected that his work on the constitutional amendment would help his re-election effort. "I will go as far as my ability and my friends will take me," he said.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
PRESIDENT, IN RIO, DEFENDS HIS STAND ON ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12

 BODY:
President Bush told world leaders at the Earth Summit today that he had no apologies for his Administration's environmental record and called for a "prompt start" to carry out the accords signed here.
"America's record on environmental protection is second to none, so I did not come here to apologize," Mr. Bush said, rebutting the criticism heard since the Rio summit meeting began 10 days ago. 
 He also vigorously defended his opposition to a treaty to protect rare and endangered plants and animals, a position that put the United States outside a vast consensus of support by almost all of the 172 nations represented at the talks.
 
Principles on Forests
 "That proposed agreement threatens to retard biotechnology and undermine the protection of ideas," Mr. Bush said. "It is never easy to stand alone on principle, but sometimes leadership requires that you do." [Excerpts, page 5.]
The President's defiant speech came as the pace of events at the talks accelerated with the arrival of dozens of world leaders, many of them offering decidedly different views of environmental issues in speeches at the conference hall.
A major development of the day was an agreement among negotiators, after days of talks, to adopt a voluntary set of principles in favor of preserving the world's forests, which had been a goal of the United States and other wealthier countries.
But the agreement omitted a call for a treaty to be negotiated that would make such principles binding. [Page 4.]
 
Global-Warming Treaty
 Other negotiators were still in session this evening, racing a Sunday deadline to try to come up with an accord on a multibillion-dollar aid package that would enable the third-world countries to preserve their environmental resources.
In another arena of activities, Mr. Bush and other leaders signed the treaty intended to reduce the threat of global warming by limiting emissions of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. The treaty had long been viewed as a centerpiece of the summit talks, despite widespread criticism for its lack of specific timetables for emission curbs.
In contrast to other Western leaders speaking here today, Mr. Bush did not make public any major financial initiatives, although the United States called for creation of a long-term $1.4 billion fund to monitor climate change, and for other money to help poor countries pay for preservation of their forests.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a nation widely seen to have assumed a major leadership role here, promised to increase Germany's aid for development of poor countries to 0.7 percent of its gross national product, nearly double its current level, and promised accelerated reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent to 30 percent by the year 2,005.
In another move seen as upstaging President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain called for the World Bank fund that provides environmental aid to be increased from the current level of $1.3 billion to at least $3.3 billion in the next several years.
In yet another pledge for aid that contrasted with the American caution on financing, the 12-nation European Community also promised $4 billion to further the Earth Summit's goals. It was unclear how much of the European money was new money or money that had already been appropriated.
Mr. Bush, trying to mend fences with environmentalists, met in the morning with a delegation of American leaders of environmental groups and in the afternoon posed for photographers in a rain forest near Rio.
It was unclear whether his efforts would succeed, since the many private environmental groups gathered in Rio continued to excoriate what they characterized as American inaction and even hostility to the goals of the summit talks.
 
'Viva Fidel!'
 One group, the Friends of the Earth International, said the world's leaders had "squandered an historic opportunity."
Inside and outside the main conference hall, the biggest applause went for Fidel Castro, who proved his durability as a tribune for anti-American sentiments among many people in impoverished countries.
"Viva Fidel! Viva Cuba!" shouted passers-by Thursday night when the Cuban leader arrived at his luxury Copacabana hotel, the Rio Palace. Seeming to take aim at President Bush in his speech today, Mr. Castro drew cheers when strode to the platform to denounce the industrialized countries as guilty of most of the world's environmental problems.
"Consumer societies are fundamentally responsible for environmental destruction," said Mr. Castro, calling for what he said should be a more just distribution of wealth in the world. "The ecological debt should be paid, not the foreign debt."
President Bush, who gave Mr. Castro's speech a few perfunctory hand claps, seemed to be picking up the gauntlet thrown down by one of the last Communist leaders in the world.
"There are those who say that it takes state control to protect the environment," he said. "Let them go to Eastern Europe, where the poisoned bodies of children now pay for the sins of fallen dictators -- and only the new breeze of freedom is allowing for cleanup."
The speeches and activities of the world leaders virtually shut down this coastal city of five million. Schools closed, supermarkets stood empty, but long-feared traffic jams never materialized, as Rio's population either left town for a four-day weekend or stayed home to watch the parade of world leaders on television. With gray skies, scattered showers and temperatures in the 60's, Rio's beaches were largely deserted.
Virtually all visiting leaders were lodged in high-rise luxury hotels facing the crashing surf of Rio's southern beaches. Long lines of orange-and-white traffic cones blocked off beachfront avenues, creating high-speed access routes for motorcades carrying heads of state to Rio Central, the conference center 20 miles south of Rio's downtown.
Along the routes, rifle-toting army soldiers guarded bridges and tunnels and scanned hillside shantytowns with binoculars. Adding to this resort city's militarized air, light tanks were posted below several slums and helicopters thundered up and down the beaches.
Although no major incidents were reported during the day, security was not as tight as it appeared.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
With Climate Treaty Signed, All Say They'll Do Even More

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12

 BODY:
With President Bush's signing of the landmark treaty on climate today, the world's nations have embarked on the lengthy and uncertain road of trying to avert the feared warming of the globe from the continued buildup of of heat-trapping gases.
The White House has long taken a cautious approach to the threat of global warming, and weakened the treaty targets sought by the Europeans. But today Mr. Bush called for speedier action on the treaty, and the 12 countries of the European Community prepared to go beyond the treaty's mild requirements. 
 In a pledge expected to be signed Saturday, the 12 will agree to stabilize emissions of the chief heat-trapping gas, carbon dioxide, at 1990 levels by 2000.
Though critics here continue to chide Mr. Bush and his Administration for weakening the treaty, many experts see the accord as a long-term framework that can become a forceful instrument for controlling heat-trapping gases.
"The foundation for meeting the challenge is there, but it needs the mortar and the bricks to get beyond the basement," said Scott Hajost, a former official of the Environmental Protection Agency now with the Environmental Defense Fund.
On signing the treaty, Mr. Bush immediately challenged other industrial nations to join the United States by Jan. 1 in laying out detailed plans for controlling emissions. The proposal, he said, is intended to accelerate the treaty's practical effects.
 
A Question of Pace
 But Margaret Brusasco-Mackenzie, head of the environment division of the European Commission, said Europe was undertaking a series of programs that would take time to be adopted. "We have a deadline for the end of the century," she said. "That is our deadline, and that is the one we intend to meet."
Some Governments, like Germany's, have committed themselves to reduce carbon dioxide emissions after 2000 to levels even lower than those of 1990. The Bush Administration, by contrast, successfully avoided setting targets and timetables because of costs.
Washington's fears may be ungrounded. Several experts, including some in the Administration, say the United States economy, simply for competitive reasons, is already improving its energy efficiency so rapidly that it could outstrip the European timetables.
One United States official here even predicted that with no cost to the economy, the United States might be able to commit itself to stronger measures "as soon as that becomes compelling enough," perhaps in two years.
"I think the world will move beyond what the convention requires," said William A. Nitze, a former State Department official who left his job as chief negotiator on the treaty some months ago after disagreeing with the Administration. Mr. Nitze is now head of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit coalition that promotes investment in energy efficiency.
He said the treaty "will lead to very rapid progress, because when countries really look at the options, they are going to find lots of ways to reduce emissions, just as we have in this country."
The Administration has compiled a list of completed or imminent actions that it calculates will hold emissions to very nearly the level favored by the Europeans.
 
What the U.S. Is Doing
 The several dozen measures include tougher efficiency standards for appliances and equipment, incentives for electric utilities to improve efficiency instead of building new power plants and Government encouragement of alternative-fuel vehicles.
"That doesn't include any of the things that are going on at the state or local level, or individual actions utilities are taking to improve efficiency, or any other initiatives we take between now and the year 2000," said Alden Meyer, the director of the program on climate change and energy of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who is attending the Earth Summit.
The drive for energy efficiency "is moving fast enough to allow us to make absolute reductions in emissions in most of the industrialized countries," he said, "and I think the United States is probably likely to exceed the European goals, even though we won't commit to them."
 
An Optimist on Ratification
 Nearly 150 governments will have signed the treaty by the end of the conference on Sunday. Ratification could prove harder, given the vagaries of domestic politics.
But Michael Zammit-Cutajar of Malta, the executive secretary of the international negotiating committee that produced the treaty, said the ratification process was off to "a flying start." He said he expected the treaty to be in force within two years.
The agreement, a product of 15 months of intensive negotiations between 143 nations that ended last month in New York, is remarkable in that it tackles a danger whose full dimension is unclear and unproved.
Scientists know that greenhouse gases, so called because they trap heat in the atmosphere, have been rising steadily since the Industrial Revolution. Though they fear the climate could become disastrously hotter some time in the next century, the state of their art does not yet enable them to make accurate predictions.
 
The Climate Numbers
 An international group of scientists convened by the United Nations predicts that if human societies continue to spew forth greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane at the current rate, the Earth's average surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century. The average temperature has risen by only 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age, which ended 11,000 years ago.
Climatologists have no clear proof that human-induced warming has begun. Early signs are easily smothered by the wide natural swings in climate. The 1980's were an unusually warm decade, and 1990 and 1991 the warmest years since global record-keeping started in the mid-19th century. But even those peaks could be natural swings.
A small amount of human-induced warming might not be so bad. Crops would grow faster, for example. But if the warming is as great as some members of the United Nations science panel say it could be, then ice caps and glaciers could melt, causing seas to rise and flood coastal areas and some island nations. Some studies also predict violent storms and destructive droughts.
Even if human societies and agriculture managed to adjust, many scientists fear that natural ecosystems would fail to adapt fast enough, and many would collapse, with a widespread loss of species.
Signers of the treaty are to examine one another's performance six months after the it goes into force and again in 1998 at the latest. The process, described by Mr. Zammit-Cutajar of Malta, the coordinator of the talks, as peer review in which every country must put its cards on the table for inspection by everybody else, is the principal means of enforcement for the treaty.
 
 
 
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CLIMATE TREATY
Overall objective:
 To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous interference by humans with the climate system. This level should be achieved soon enough to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to insure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.
 
National requirements:
 * All parties are required to formulate and regularly update national programs to mitigate climate change by addressing human-generated emissions of greenhouse gases.
* Industrialized countries are required to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases, to protect greenhouse gas sinks like forests and to demonstrate that they are taking steps toward meeting these objectives.
* Within six months of when the treaty takes effect and periodically thereafter, all parties are required to report on what they have done "with the aim of returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels" of emissions.
* Industrialized countries are required to help finance and provide technology to developing countries to meet general commitments, initially through the Global Environmental Facility, a new international aid program.
* Periodic review of progress and scientific knowledge about climate change is required with a view toward taking whatever action is necessary.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
QUAYLE SAYS PEROT DISPLAYS CONTEMPT FOR CONSTITUTION

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle today delivered the Bush campaign's most direct and forceful attack yet on Ross Perot, calling him a "temperamental tycoon who has contempt for the Constitution of the United States."
As the Bush team searches for weapons to use against Mr. Perot's undeclared independent candidacy, the Vice President offered voters what amounted to a political ultimatum: elect a Republican Congress to work with President Bush in a second term, or choose a Democratic President. 
 "Electing Ross Perot wouldn't fix the deadlock between the elected branches, it would make this worse," Mr. Quayle said in a speech here to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization.
 
Power to the Party
 "So let us return to the tried and true," he continued. "Let us elect a President -- Republican or Democrat -- and give him a Congress that responds to Presidential leadership. Give one party the authority and responsibility to govern."
James Squires, Mr. Perot's spokesman, said: "Mr. Perot never suggested any contempt for the Constitution, only for the quality of leadership in Washington. That characterization is typical of the kind of distortion that has dominated the political dialogue in Presidential elections over the last decade or so."
He said Mr. Quayle's description of Mr. Perot as "temperamental" was "an effort to distort his persona in the public mind," and added, "That, too, is a key tactic of Republican Presidential politics."
 
Outline of G.O.P. Strategy
 The Vice President's speech, which was coordinated with the President's top campaign advisers, was the latest in a series of addresses Mr. Quayle has been giving to force conservative views into the forefront of the Bush campaign message at a time when Mr. Quayle's advisers believe the Republican right is deserting to the Perot camp.
The Vice President's arguments foreshadowed a Republican strategy of depicting Mr. Perot as too risky a choice to replace a safer, if less exciting, Mr. Bush.
Mr. Quayle's go-for-broke argument, with its implicit suggestion that a Democratic White House and Congress would be preferable to Mr. Perot, gave voice to the fear that Mr. Perot's candidacy has ignited in the political establishment in both major parties.
The Vice President's remarks made him the highest-ranking official in the Administration to attack Mr. Perot directly. Mr. Bush has refused to do so himself.
 
Some Earlier Barbs
 Mr. Quayle has hurled a few off-the-cuff barbs at Mr. Perot when asked about him by reporters. And Mr. Quayle's wife, Marilyn, recently accused the Dallas billionaire of trying to "buy the White House," prompting a retort from Mr. Perot that the Bush team was "hiding behind their women." But up to now the Vice President had not made the sort of frontal assault that he offered in today's speech.
"There's no doubt that he has tapped into a deep well of frustration in this country," he said of Mr. Perot. "He draws his appeal largely from the claim that he is a man who can 'get things done,' even if he's reluctant to say exactly what 'things' he has in mind -- other than nullifying representative democracy with a bizarre scheme of government by polls."
Mr. Quayle, apparently referring to Mr. Perot's concept of an "electronic town hall" that would use telephones and television to allow public comment on major decisions, called Mr. Perot "a false solution to our problem."
 
'Add to the Gridlock'
 As President, Mr. Perot "would add to the gridlock, then compound the people's frustration by elevating the blame game to an art form," Mr. Quayle said.
Then, in an allusion to Mr. Perot's billionaire status that brought laughter from the audience, he added, "I'd like to say 'talk is cheap,' but somehow that doesn't capture the spirit of the Perot campaign."
Mr. Quayle said Mr. Perot has "an interesting approach to that most wonderful work, the U.S. Constitution," quoting Mr. Perot as saying: "Germany and Japan are winning. Why are they winning? They got new constitutions in 1945."
"Mr. Perot, we do not need a new constitution," the Vice President continued. "Our Constitution has served us well. My friends, it would be a very bad idea to replace a genuine statesman with a temperamental tycoon who has contempt for the Constitution of the United States."
 
TV Transcript Cited
 Mr. Quayle's office provided a transcript of remarks that it said Mr. Perot made on the ABC News program "Good Morning America" last Oct. 22. According to the transcript, Mr. Perot did make the remarks that Mr. Quayle cited, but did not suggest rewriting the Constitution.
The remarks came in response to a question from the host, Charles Gibson, who asked Mr. Perot what advice he would give Mr. Bush to "jump-start the economy."
The transcript showed that Mr. Perot noted that the United States had helped write the constitutions for Germany and Japan and added: "This was at a time when the industrial revolution had occurred. Our Constitution was written 200 years ago, before it occurred."
Mr. Perot did not elaborate on his constitutional views, nor did Mr. Gibson ask him to. He went on to say that Germany and Japan "have an intelligent relationship between business and government."
White House officials said Mr. Quayle's attack on Mr. Perot was discussed at a meeting this morning attended by the Vice President, his chief of staff, William Kristol, and the chairman of the Bush-Quayle campaign, Robert M. Teeter.
"It was discussed at some length," one official said. "There has been talk about different ways to peg Perot a little bit, and the combination of him being temperamental and compounding the gridlock are recurrent themes."

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Talks in Rio Wrap Up Principles For Preserving the World's Forests

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12

 BODY:
Environment ministers at the Earth Summit finally wrapped up a set of voluntary principles aimed at preserving the world's dwindling forests, a goal that was a United States priority at the conference, and were working feverishly tonight on a global cleanup plan.
The Administration did not obtain a commitment to turn the forest preservation principles into a binding international convention, but the document, approved early today, leaves open the possibility of a new forest treaty in the future.
The document describes the forest principles as an "authoritative" statement insuring that all countries have a right to use their forests to advance their economic development, but that they should do so only "on a sustainable basis."
The principles thus chart a tortuous middle course between the desire of countries with tropical forests, like Malaysia, India and Brazil, to assert theirsovereignty over a valuable natural resource and the wish of most Northern countries to define forests as a global asset.
William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, expressed some disappointment with the outcome today, saying the principles were "not as strong as we would have liked."
But some other Western officials said the principles went further than they had expected at the start of the summit talks.
"They don't close off the possibility of a convention, and closing it off was the objective of Malaysia," an official said.
It was also suggested that the proposed new Sustainable Development Commission, which will monitor compliance with commitments made at the Earth Summit, could call for negotiations on a binding treaty when it reviews the way the world's forests are being managed.
"The talk around the ministers' meeting last night, though it couldn't be said in there, was that this should be a priority for the Commission on Sustainable Development," another Western official said.
In negotiations, many developing countries said the industrial world only values tropical forests for the carbon dioxide they absorb because this reduces the sacrifices the North must make to avert global warming.
The principles call for "environmentally sound national guidelines" for development and recognize that while forests meet many economic, social and cultural needs, they also act as "carbon sinks and reservoirs" that slow climate change.
These same representatives of the world's rich and poor countries worked tonight to resolve outstanding issues over aid and atmospheric pollution that are blocking completion of the new global cleanup plan, known as Agenda 21, which the summit hopes to endorse on Sunday.
 
Vows to Do More
 To encourage developing countries to compromise on these issues, the United States, Canada, Germany and the 12 European Community countries, speaking as a bloc, all pledged to do more to help poorer nations safeguard the environment.
But it was impossible to judge immediately how much new money they were really offering.
Developing countries want the Western industrialized nations to make good by the year 2000 on a promise they made more than 20 years ago to raise development aid to 0.7 percent of their economic output.
None of the Western heads of state or government who addressed the summit today would make such a promise. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said he wanted to reach that target "as soon as possible," and in the meantime committed his Government to an unspecified "increase in official development aid."
President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada both said they would increase the amount of aid to help poorer countries protect their ecological systems. But it was unclear whether this involved new money or reapportioning existing aid budgets.
 
Europeans Pledge $4 Billion
 Prime Minister John Major of Britain made no mention of development aid when he addressed the summit. But the 12 European Community countries, as expected, said they would give $4 billion, including some "new and additional resources," to finance key aspects of Agenda 21, describing this as "an initial contribution."
By making these offers, Western leaders say they are seeking to convince developing countries that they mean to help them cope with the extra bills they face for making development environmentally sustainable and thus encourage them to accept the goals set in Agenda 21.
But negotiators are still trying to settle on wording that encourages aid donors to reach the 0.7 percent target by the end of this century without actually committing them to do so.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia continues to oppose passages in Agenda 21 encouraging countries to use "economic measures" to promote energy savings, fearing that this will lead to the introduction of new carbon fuel taxes that would reduce the world's appetite for oil.

HEADLINE: Russia and U.S. Trim Gap on Arms Cuts

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, June 12

 BODY:
Russia and the United States announced today that they had narrowed their differences over an agreement to radically reduce their nuclear arsenals. But they said further negotiations would be necessary at next week's summit meeting between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d flew to London today and met his Russian counterpart, Andrei V. Kozyrev, for three and a half hours of talks that were scheduled at the last minute in an effort to wrap up a new arms accord before the summit meeting. But the two men emerged to say that though both sides had offered new compromises, gaps still remained. 
 The two officials hinted that the gaps involved sensitive political and security questions and could only be closed in bargaining between the heads of state when they meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday.
"I think that we made good progress," Mr. Baker said in a news conference he attended with Mr. Kozyrev. "I think what happened is that we have seen some movement by both sides in an effort to bring about an agreement that would lead to deep reductions in strategic weapons and reductions in the most destabilizing of those weapons."
 
Cut Which Missiles?
 But he quickly continued: "We are not there yet and there are still some questions that have to be decided. So good progress should not be translated into automatically meaning that there is an agreement."
Russia and the United States are seeking an agreement that would cut their nuclear arsenals below the levels that they had agreed to in the recently signed strategic arms reduction treaty. The United States would go from about 8,500 nuclear warheads to 4,700, and the Russians from about 6,500 warheads to about 4,400.
The disagreement has been over which missiles those warheads should be stripped from and at what pace. The United States had been demanding that the Russians eliminate all of their most potent land-based, multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missiles. Those would pose the greatest danger to the United States in any nuclear confrontation.
The Russians have been insisting on keeping 25 percent to 30 percent of their warheads on land-based multiple-warhead missiles, like the advanced SS-18 and SS-24, as long as the United States insists on retaining about two-thirds of its multiple-warhead missiles based on submarines.
 
Eager for an Arms Pact
 But at the same time, with Mr. Yeltsin coming to Washington seeking economic aid, the Russians are clearly concerned about not creating the impression that they are still fighting the cold war.
"We made good progress," said Mr. Kozyrev. "At any rate we did our best. The rest will depend on our Presidents."
Mr. Baker and Mr. Kozyrev, who met this week in Washington on this same issue, said that if the Presidents cannot agree on the final details of deeper cuts when they get together in Washington, they will at least try to issue a general statement outlining such an agreement and leave the details to be negotiated later. Clearly, they are both extremely eager to have some major arms control agreement to show for their summit meeting, even if it has to be a vague one.
"I think we have a good chance but there is not as yet an agreement and there won't be an agreement until the two Presidents have had an opportunity to review what has been discussed here today," Mr. Baker said. "If we cannot get all of the t's crossed and all of the i's dotted, then I think broad parameters would be better than nothing at all."
Mr. Baker said the two officials also discussed cooperation in bringing an end to the bloodshed in Yugoslavia.
 
U.S. Role in Yugoslav War
 The Secretary said he told Mr. Kozyrev that the United States was "prepared to cooperate as much as we can in the provisioning of humanitarian assistance to the people who are suffering in Bosnia."
Mr. Baker continued, "I made the point to him that we have sent our military planners to New York to consult with the United Nations, that we are increasing the provisioning of intelligence support to the United Nations and that generally speaking, in principle, the United States is ready to support all phases of the humanitarian assistance effort."
While Mr. Baker seemed to be hinting at some sort of direct American military involvement in Yugoslavia, every time he was pressed to elaborate on that point he drew back. He stressed that the United States believes it should only get involved on the ground in Yugoslavia to help provide humanitarian aid in the context of a cease-fire among all the parties.
"If you mean is the United States likely to resort to the unilateral use of force to shoot our way into Sarajevo, that is a nonstarter," Mr. Baker said. "When I say we are prepared to support all phases of the United Nations humanitarian effort, I do think it is appropriate to note that the United Nations humanitarian effort calls for the initiation of a cease-fire so that the effort can be carried through."

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT;
Excerpts From Speech By Bush on 'Action Plan'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 12

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from a speech by President Bush before world leaders at the Earth Summit:
This is truly a historic gathering. And the Chinese have a proverb, if a man cheats the earth the earth will cheat man. And the idea of sustaining the planet so that it may sustain us is as old as life itself. We must leave this earth in better condition than we found it, and today this old truth must be applied to new threats facing the resources which sustain us all, the atmosphere and the ocean, the stratosphere and the biosphere. Our village is truly global. 
 Some find the challenges ahead overwhelming. I believe that their pessimism is unfounded. Twenty years ago, at the Stockholm Conference, the chief concern of our predecessors was the horrible threat of nuclear war, the ultimate pollutant. No more. Upon my return from Rio I will meet with Russian President Yeltsin in Washington and the subject we will discuss is cooperation, not confrontation.
Twenty years ago some spoke of the limits to growth, and today we realize that growth is the engine of change and a friend of the environment. Today an unprecedented era of peace, freedom and stability makes concerted action on the environment possible as never before. . . .
There are those who say that cooperation between developed and developing countries is impossible. Well let them come to Latin America, where debt for nature swaps, or protecting forests in Costa Rica and funding pollution control in Chile.
There are those who say it takes state control to protect the environment. Well let them go to Eastern Europe, where the poisoned bodies of children now pay for the sins of fallen dictators, and only the new breeze of freedom is allowing for cleanup.
There are those who say that change can never come because the interests of the status quo are too powerful. Well let them come right here to Brazil, where President Collor is forging a new approach that recognizes the economic value of sustaining the rain forest.
 
Quibbles on Biodiversity
 There are those who say that economic growth and environmental protection cannot be compatible. Well let them come to the United States, where in the 20 years since Stockholm, our economy has grown by 57 percent and yet we've cut the lead going into the air by 97 percent, the carbon monoxide by 41 percent, the particulates by 59 percent. We've cleaned up our water and preserved our parks, wilderness and wildlife.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We come to Rio with an action plan on climate change. It stresses energy efficiency, cleaner air, reforestation, new technology. And I'm happy to report that I've just signed that framework convention on climate change. And today, I invite my colleagues from the industrialized world to join in a prompt start on the convention's implementation. I propose that our countries meet by Jan. 1 to lay out our national plans for meeting the specific commitments in the framework convention. Let us join in translating the words spoken here into concrete action to protect the planet.
We come to Rio with a proposal to double global forest assistance, and we stand ready to work together respecting national sovereignty on new strategies for forests for the future. As a down payment, we will double U.S. forest bilateral assistance next year. And we will reform at home, phasing out clear-cutting as a standard practice on U.S. national forests, and working to plant one billion trees a year.
 
Preserving Species
 We come to Rio with an extensive program of technology cooperation. We stand ready -- Government and private sector -- to help spread "green technology" and launch a new generation of clean growth.
We come to Rio recognizing that the developing countries must play a role in protecting the global environment, but will need assistance in pursuing these cleaner growth. So we stand ready to increase U.S. international environmental aid by 66 percent above the 1990 levels, on top of the more than $2.5 billion that we provide through the world's development banks for Agenda 21 projects.
We come to Rio with more scientific knowledge about the environment than ever before, and with the wisdom that there is much, much we do that's not yet known. And we stand ready to share our science and to lead the world in a program of continued research.
We come to Rio prepared to continue America's unparalleled efforts to preserve species and habitat. And let me be clear, our efforts to protect biodiversity itself will exceed, will exceed the requirements of the treaty. But that proposed agreement threatens to retard biotechnology and undermine the protection of ideas. And unlike the climate agreement, its financing scheme will not work. And it is never easy, it is never easy to stand alone on principle, but sometimes leadership requires that you do. And now is such a time.
Let's face it, there has been some criticism of the United States. But I must tell you, we come to Rio proud of what we have accomplished and committed to extending the record on American leadership on the environment. In the United States, we have the world's tightest air-quality standards on cars and factories, the most advanced laws for protecting lands and waters, and the most open processes for public participation.
And now for a simple truth. America's record on environmental protection is second to none. So I did not come here to apologize. We come to press on with deliberate purpose and forceful action, and such action will demonstrate our continuing commitment to leadership and to international cooperation on the environment.
We believe that the road to Rio must point toward both environmental protection and economic growth, environment and development. And by now it's clear.

HEADLINE: Canada Ending Phone Monopoly on Long-Distance Calls

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 12

 BODY:
Canada, taking a leaf from the United States, today ended the century-old monopoly of Bell Canada and provincial telephone companies in long-distance service.
The decision by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission, the counterpart to the Federal Communications Commission, gives two Canadian enterprises a toehold in the $7.5 billion annual long-distance market. 
 Keith Spicer, the commission's chairman, said the ruling meant lower long-distance rates and should "help the whole economy."
Although Canada bars foreign ownership of telecommuncations carriers, the increased competition, analysts said, is a major step in opening Canada's market and could eventually bring additional business to American companies.
But the primary beneficiaries are two Canadian joint ventures -- Unitel Communications Inc. of Toronto, which is controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd. of Montreal and Rogers Communications Inc. of Toronto, and BCRL, a joint venture of B.C. RailLtd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Call-Net Telecommunications Ltd. of Toronto.
Richard Stursberg, Unitel's senior vice president for law and government affairs, said the decision "means real competition in Canada; consumers get better prices and business will have the telecommunications tools to remain competitive."
 
No Breakup Foreseen
 The arguments here mirrored those in the United States when the MCI Communications Corporation was granted the right to compete with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1971, a decision that in the next decade led to the breakup of the American Bell System.
The Canadians, however, do not envisage breaking up their telephone companies.
The biggest loser here is Bell Canada, no relation to A.T.& T. It is controlled by BCE Inc., a Montreal-based conglomerate. Bell Canada has the long-distance monopoly in Ontario and Quebec. It works closely with other monopoly companies in the other provinces, including the British Columbia Telephone Company, in which the American-based GTE has had a controlling stake since the 1950's, several decades before the policy excluding foreigners took effect.
Dorothy Byrne, vice president for legal and corporate affairs of British Columbia Telephone, said the decision was "unlikely to have any impact" on the Government's policy regarding foreign ownership.
Bell Canada and the other companies have contended that lowering long-distance rates will mean higher charges for local service, which is what A.T.& T. said in the 1970's.
"We're disappointed," Jean Monty, chairman and chief executive of Bell Canada, said. "We believe the C.R.T.C. will have to face the reality of higher local rates for residential service."
 
Subsidies Required
 Mr. Spicer of the Canadian commission said there was "no reason for competition to have a damaging impact on local rates because competitors will be required to subsidize the costs of local service."
The commission's decision requires companies competing in the long-distance market to contribute part of their earnings, based on market share, to the telephone companies to keep local rates down. It also enhances competition by giving more freedom to resellers -- companies that lease long-distance facilities from the phone companies at bulk discount rates and resell the services to other businesses at discount prices.
Many analysts said the lower long-distance rates should significantly cut the cost of doing business in Canada.
Canadian companies have long complained that they were at a disadvantage with American companies, whose long-distance rates have been on average 50 percent lower.
Suzanne Berman, A.T.& T.'s director of public relations in Toronto, said: "In our experience, competition strengthens the telecommunications industry, and based on our experience, we think there will be similar results in Canada."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Platform;
Democrats Begin Drafting a Blueprint They Hope All Can Follow

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., June 12

 BODY:
Faced with a different kind of tension from the ones that have divided their party in the past, a small group of Democrats began today the quadrennial chore of trying to draft a party platform so general that all elements of the party will accept it and yet specific enough to distinguish Democratic principles from Republican ones.
Unity now prevails, more or less, on issues like civil rights, military aggression and abortion that once split the party and led to sit-ins, walk-outs and even riots. 
 But some of the old-timers who fought those fights feel somewhat left out now that the party no longer stresses redistributing wealth to the less affluent but instead emphasizes overall economic growth.
 
'Party Has to Change'
 At one point this morning, during the first day of a two-day meeting of the platform-drafting subcommittee of the Democratic platform committee, Ken Young, once the chief lobbyist of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and now retired, complained gently that early versions of this year's platform did not "make it clear people are crying out for help."
And Mary Frances Berry, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, said, "We need to say more about the reality of people's lives."
But the Democratic baton has passed from the old labor-civil rights coalition to a more moderate one represented by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has clinched the Presidential nomination. Mr. Clinton's representative on the drafting subcommittee, Al From, said, "There's a sense the party has to change."
Still, unlike the situation in years past when principle was often put ahead of party, no one today seemed prepared to press differences with the Clinton camp. "I just want to win, so we can use whatever words are necessary," said Carmen Perez, a California labor leader who is a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
 
Specter of Perot
 Unlike the situation in some parliamentary democracies, party platforms in the United States are binding, and often forgotten soon after they are written. But many politicians believe they are important, not so much for their specifics but because they give the parties definition.
The specter of Ross Perot, who is organizing an independent candidacy and is now ahead of Mr. Clinton in national polls, pervaded today's debate. Arguing that Democrats should stress efficiency and competence in government, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said, "Part of the phenomenal appeal of Ross Perot is the desire to put somebody in the Government who will make it work."
But no one seemed sure what issues the party should emphasize to counter Mr. Perot's sudden popularity. An underlying question that was on many minds but was never explicitly confronted today was whether Democrats should concentrate on generating enthusiasm among their most solid supporters -- blacks, union leaders and the elderly -- or whether they should take those votes as given and reach out to middle-class voters, who now seem more likely to vote for President Bush or Mr. Perot.
There was no mistaking that these were Democrats and not Republicans. From the outset, it was clear that the Democratic document would favor legal abortion, oppose discrimination against homosexuals as well as against women and minorities, support national health insurance and endorse higher taxes on the wealthy. The platform is sure to say that environmental protection should not take a back seat to economic development and that workers should have guaranteed time off to handle family emergencies. This kind of language would be unheard of in a Republican platform.
 
Addressing Tax Breaks
 But words appear in an early draft of the Democratic platform that could never have been there even a few years ago. "Workers must be prepared to give up outdated job descriptions and work rules and become more open to change," it says, for example.
Whether this kind of language will survive as the document goes through a long process of rewriting and editing is another matter, but no one could doubt that the party's center of gravity has shifted.
The first specific issues addressed today were tax breaks for businesses and investors, normally flowers in the Republican bouquet, and the Democrats talked a good deal about the need for personal responsibility and family values. "This platform gets at some of the things Dan Quayle has been talking about," Senator Lieberman said, referring to the Vice President's recent speeches about matters like welfare dependency and births out of wedlock.
After the drafting work is done, the next step will be for the full platform committee, with about 200 members, to vote on the document in Washington on June 27. The platform will then be debated on the second night of the Democratic National Convention in New York on July 14.
Representatives of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California and the Rev. Jesse Jackson sit on the 25-member drafting subcommittee. But nothing will get in the final document that does not have Governor Clinton's stamp of approval.
Issues on which the Democratic Presidential candidates fundamentally disagreed are likely to be left out of the document or discussed only in the most general terms. Among these issues are the details of a national health insurance plan, international trade policy and a tax cut for the middle class.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Are Flat

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Falling food prices and the first drop in drug costs in nearly two decades helped to offset higher gasoline prices in May, as consumer prices inched up just one-tenth of a percent, the Labor Department said today.
It was the best showing for the Consumer Price Index since January, and it helped to ease fears raised on Thursday when the Government reported a worse-than-expected jump of four-tenths of a percent in wholesale prices for May. 
 At the consumer level, prices declined for items including vegetables and airline tickets. Prescription drug prices fell for the first month since March 1973. While the drug price decline was a tiny one-tenth of a percent, analysts said it showed that even in health care, the sector that showed the biggest price increases over several years, there has been some price moderation this year.
For the first five months of this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of just 3 percent. That was in line with the 3.1 percent increase turned in for 1991.

HEADLINE: 7 Giants Of Finance May Share Quarters

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In a development project that could bring all of New York City's major financial exchanges under the same Wall Street roof, executives of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the city's five commodities exchanges are holding preliminary talks about building a new trading complex.
The proposal, acknowledged yesterday by several senior executives, is being advocated aggressively by City Hall. 
 Officials said the plan could insure that New York's most important financial institutions remain committed to the city long into the next century, give an economic boost to lower Manhattan and enhance the city's stature as a leading financial center.
"If this is doable, there is no question it would be a great thing for New York," said Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
 
Circulating for Months
 The plan, which was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal, has been circulating privately at City Hall and among the stock exchanges for months. It envisions a new office and trading complex that would cover the full block bounded by Wall Street, Broad Street, Exchange Place and William Street. The site is just east of the 89-year-old New York Stock Exchange building.
That part of the complex would be occupied by the two stock exchanges, officials said. If the five commodities exchanges commit to the project, those close to the negotiations said, they would probably be housed in a separate structure to be built across Exchange Place, with a bridge above street level to link it to the stock exchange center.
"We would really like to see it happen," said William D. Strauss, the chief financial officer of the American Stock Exchange, which is four blocks west of the proposed complex.
The proposal is ambitious even in a city where complex financial strategies involving huge tax breaks and other public subsidies have become routine in commercial development. If the new complex is built, "It will require a very large public commitment," Mr. Sullivan said.
The idea for the complex was hatched more than a year ago by Olympia & York, the development company that built much of the World Financial Center and other large towers in lower Manhattan but has since encountered serious financial difficulties and received bankruptcy protection for its operations in England.
Olympia & York has proposed that the company be designated by the city and the exchanges as developer of the project. The company has spent more than $1 million on planning documents, according to those close to the negotiations. It has retained Skidmore Owings & Merrill, the architectural firm, which has prepared renderings of the complex.
Joining Oympia & York as the plan's chief proponent has been J. P. Morgan & Company, which owns more than half the existing office space, including its former headquarters, on the site being proposed for the complex. J. P. Morgan moved to a new Wall Street tower a block east of the site in 1989.
Under the plan, all buildings on the one-and-a-half-block site, including others owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance company and smaller landlords, would be bought and demolished to make way for the complex.
 
Posssible Hitch Is Seen
 One snag may come in persuading the New York Stock Exchange to move, since it has spent $600 million over the last decade to install new computers and upgrade the trading floor at its building at Broad and Wall Streets.
The city's five commodities exchanges may also balk at the plan. The exchanges are the New York Merchantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange.
All provide markets in futures contracts and have grown rapidly in the last decade. They have outgrown their current quarters in the World Trade Center and have been exploring sites in TriBeCa and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Pact Reached On Reducing Tax Incentives

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins and New York City Council leaders announced an agreement yesterday to eliminate many tax breaks for new office towers in midtown and lower Manhattan as part of an overhaul of the city's largest tax incentive program for developers.
While cutting off tax breaks for new construction in Manhattan south of 96th Street, the revamped program would bolster incentives for developers who renovate existing buildings in Manhattan over the next two years. It also would retain significant tax breaks for new construction or renovation above 96th Street and in the other four boroughs. 
 The idea is to reward developers who want to modernize existing office space, encourage development outside Manhattan and discourage new towers when Manhattan is facing a glut of office space, city officials and Council staff members said.
"We don't want to encourage additional, speculative, new construction in Manhattan because we think that's unnecessary," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
 
State Action Required
 The agreement, announced at City Hall yesterday, will be sent to the State Legislature, which under the State Constitution must pass a law before the City Council can enact any changes in tax incentives, city officials said.
Spokesmen for the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly said it was too early to tell whether the bill had a good chance of passing, though both houses have supported previous incarnations of the program. They said it would be unusual for lawmakers to reject a local measure supported by both the Mayor and the Council.
The city is also seeking authority from the state to require that a fifth of work in construction projects spurred by the program will go to businesses owned by women and minorities, city officials said.
The Industrial Commercial Incentive Program, as the plan is called, is the city's largest single economic development program and has been a boon for developers for nearly eight years.
Critics, including the Mayor and Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, have charged that the program has amounted to handouts for some developers in Manhattan who would have built there anyway.
Since 1984, when the program was started, developers have received hundreds of millions of dollars in exemptions that free them from tax increases normally levied on any improvements to a building or site. Some of those taxes are merely deferred, meaning the city receives the revenues many years later. In the current fiscal year, city officials estimate, the exemptions and deferrals total $110 million for more than 700 projects.
Depending on location and project, developers have enjoyed anywhere from a three-year deferral of all property taxes, with the obligation to pay taxes back 11 to 20 years later, to a full exemption for 13 years, phased out slowly over nine years.
The agreement announced yesterday would slash all tax breaks for new construction in Manhattan south of 96th Street. In some parts of midtown, developers used to enjoy a three-year tax deferral. Instead, the city would give developers who renovate older buildings an exemption from higher taxes for eight years, with a gradual phasing in of taxes over the next five years. In other areas the incentives remain essentially the same.
Stephen Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said developers welcomed the incentives for renovation, but he questioned the wisdom of cutting all incentives for new construction. With the automatic incentives, he said, the city will end up cutting more special deals for businesses that threaten to leave.
"We told the city it's a mistake," he said. "This is sending the wrong signal out that we don't want to see some kind of growth."'

HEADLINE: Demand Up, Inventories Increase 0.1%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Business inventories edged up one-tenth of a percent in April, the third consecutive increase, according to a Government report released today. Some analysts said it reflected slowly growing customer demand.
"The business inventory number will probably start to show some larger increases" by the third quarter, contended Michael P. Niemira, an economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York. "The demand is there." He also said that regional reports suggested demand was picking up. 
 Intentional restocking of shelves and backlots could reflect growing optimism that demand would remain strong. It could also mean increased production and more jobs.
 Still, business sales slipped two-tenths of a percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $548 billion, the Commerce Department reported. It was the first decline in four months and wiped out an advance of two-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
Inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $816.1 billion, up from $815.7 billion in March, the report said. They have risen each month since falling five-tenths of a percent in January.
But despite the buildup in inventories, the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at a low 1.49 for the third straight month. That means it would take 1.49 months to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace.
The inventory growth was centered in the retail sector, which saw a 1.1 percent increase after rising 1 percent in March. Inventories fell three-tenths of a percent on the manufacturing level.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
In His Own Words: How Clinton Would Deal With National Problems

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Excerpts from remarks by Gov. Bill Clinton in Pittsburgh today during a televised question-and-answer session with telephone callers, as transcribed by Reuters.
 
JOBS
Here's what I think we ought to do. We ought to take every dollar by which defense is reduced and put it into investing in American jobs: into high-speed rail, into fiber optics, into new water and sewer and road systems, into new highway systems and new airplane systems -- building an economy for the 21st century.  
 We ought to change the tax system. We ought to say to business and to wealthy people, we want you to have more tax incentives, but only if you invest in this country. So here are more incentives for new plant and equipment, for new businesses, for housing. But we're going to take all those ridiculous incentives out of the tax bill that are there now that actually encourage people with your tax money to shut plants down and move them overseas.
We're going to have a tough trade policy that says we want to expand trade, but you got to treat us fair.
We're going to educate and train our people as well as any country in the world, and we're going to control health care costs and provide health care to all our people so we can be competitive.
 
TUITION TAX CREDITS
I do not favor tuition tax credits or vouchers. I do favor public school choice. My state was the second state in the country to give parents and their children more choice of the schools that they attend at the public school level. We do provide for vouchers for people to go to private child care centers before public schools, and we provide scholarships in my state that are available for both private and public universities.
 
HOMELESSNESS
Think back 10 or 11 years ago when we didn't have much of the homeless problem. It was really unusual, wasn't it, to see someone sleeping on the street? Now you see it in all cities of all sizes. That is because we've gone for more than a decade without a national housing policy. Housing is not much different than highways. You've got to have some sort of investment policy -- except in America, we have both public and private dollars going into housing.
I favor a homeless strategy that would give more funds to cities to design their own homeless programs, and would emphasize the lowest possible cost in solving the problem -- which is to take these buildings that the Government owns, like we foreclosed on all these savings and loan properties. H.U.D. has foreclosed on a lot of buildings, other Federal agencies. We own houses. Those houses ought to be rehabilitated and made available for homeless shelters. We ought to take people who are out of work and let them work in return for public assistance and have them rehabilitate these houses and then open them for the homeless.
 
HEALTH CARE
Here's my idea. Every American ought to have a comprehensive package of affordable health care. You ought to be able to get either through your job or, for the self-employed, the poor and small business who can't buy insurance, the Government ought to offer an affordable insurance package. And every American ought to be guaranteed a comprehensive package.
Then the payment ought to be the same, state by state, whether the Government provides it or whether the employer provides it. And everybody ought to be involved in the system. There ought to be some incentives for cost controls, but the main thing we have to do is to take on the big insurance companies and the health care bureaucracies, drug companies that are raising drugs at three times the rate of inflation. These things are unforgivable.
You need to know that your country spends, conservatively, $70 billion to $80 billion on health care totally unrelated, unrelated, to providing you health care because we don't have a system. And let me say, listen, I'm very suspicious of government. I know that there are things government can't do.But no nation has solved this problem without the government taking the lead and controlling costs and guaranteeing health care. I will do that, if I'm elected President. We have to do that. I will do that.
 
FEDERAL BUDGET
If I were President, I would submit a balanced budget plan over a five-year period. I don't think you can go from $400 billion to zero in a year. In this recession, you'd have to raise taxes and cut benefits; you'd make the economy worse.
The reason I opposed the balanced budget amendment is I thought it was a gimmick and a put-off so nobody'd have to really make any decisions for six years, and because it did not make a distinction between investment and consumption. That is, most of you have borrowed money for homes, for cars, for businesses, right? If the Government borrows money to put us to work and we'll get it back, that's O.K. But we're eating our seed corn, as we say in the farming country. We're borrowing money to go to dinner at night. That's what's wrong.

New Chief At Mervyn's

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, June 12

 BODY:
The Dayton Hudson Corporation said today that Joseph Vesce, president of its Mervyn's division, would take on the added job of chief executive, succeeding Walter Rossi, who resigned.
Mr. Vesce, 43 years old, joined Mervyn's in 1975 from R. H. Macy & Company. He became president of the division in 1988. 
 Mervyn's, a moderately priced department store chain, has 247 locations in 15 states, and is one of three Dayton Hudson divisions. Mervyn's has a strong presence in California and has suffered as that state's economy ground to a halt, although sales have improved recently.
Mr. Rossi, 50, joined Mervyn's in 1976 after 12 years with Abraham & Straus of New York. He became president of the division in 1987, chief executive in 1986 and chairman in 1988.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 2.85 to Finish at 3,354.36

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market weathered some afternoon selling to post a modest advance yesterday in response to better-than-expected news on inflation.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.85 points, to 3,354.36, cutting its loss for the week to 44.33 points.
At its peak early in the session the average was up nearly 30 points. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by 1,026 to 668 in the daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume came to an estimated 181.9 million shares as of 4 P.M., down from 204.8 million in the previous session.
The Labor Department reported the Consumer Price Index edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in May, in contrast to analysts' expectations of a three-tenths of 1 percent gain.
 
Reassurance for Traders
 That provided reassurance to traders who had been unsettled by recent increases in the price of oil and some other commodities, and by word on Thursday of a larger-than-expected four-tenths of 1 percent rise in producer prices of finished goods last month.
The news received a warm welcome in the bond market, which is very sensitive to changes in the inflation picture.
Still, stock traders seemed unable to shake off completely the wary mood engendered by the market's declines earlier in the week.
Gainers among the blue chips included I.B.M., up 1 at 93; Philip Morris, up 1 7/8 at 74 1/4; International Paper, up 1 3/8 at 67 3/4, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 1 1/4, to 96 1/2.
Minnesota Mining announced plans late Thursday to buy back as many as six million shares.
Oil stocks, by contrast, declined broadly. Exxon dropped 1 3/8, to 61 7/8; Texaco 3/4 to 65 1/8, and Chevron 1 3/8 to 72, combining to reduce the Dow's gain by nearly 8 points.
Callaway Golf fell 1 1/2, to 22 1/8. The company plans a secondary offering of some 2.95 million shares to be sold by four groups that had been venture-capital investors in the business.
Toro, which said it expects to break even or record a small loss for the fiscal quarter that ends next month, dropped 1 1/4, to 14 3/8.
American depository shares of Banco Comercial Portugues, among the volume leaders, traded unchanged at 16 1/4.
 
Gold Stocks Rise
 Precious-metals issues were mostly higher on the strength of a rallying gold price over the last couple of sessions. Newmont Gold rose 3/4, to 44 3/4; ASA Ltd. 1/4, to 45 1/4, and Homestake Mining 1/8, to 13 3/4.
Aura Systems, traded in the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, tumbled 1 5/8 to, 3 1/2. The company said Deloitte & Touche had resigned as its independent auditors because of disagreements over unspecified accounting matters.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.84, to 569.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up 1.42 at 391.32.

HEADLINE: Court Limits Legal Standing in Suits

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today dismissed a challenge to the Interior Department's interpretation of the Endangered Species Act, ruling that the environmental group that brought the challenge was not sufficiently injured by the policy to be entitled to file a lawsuit.
In limiting its decision to the issue of legal standing to sue, the Court did not take a position on the substantive question in the case: the validity of a regulation issued during the Reagan Administration that limits the reach of an important provision of the Endangered Species Act to within the United States. 
 The regulation, which the Bush Administration supports, rejects the original interpretation by the Carter Administration, which required all Federal agencies to insure that no endangered or threatened species would be harmed by Federal activities overseas.
The decision today, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, left the Reagan Administration regulation open to challenge in a later lawsuit, if requirements for legal standing are met.
At the same time, the Court made clear that the lower Federal courts are to apply the rules of legal standing rigorously. Justice Scalia said that the courts should not permit lawsuits challenging a Government policy unless those bringing the challenge can show that the policy is "likely" to cause them direct and imminent injury.
The Court's decision on standing, supported by a 6-to-3 vote, applies to suits against Government policies generally and is not limited to the environmental area. But the long-running legal debate over standing has been particularly vigorous in the field of environmental regulation.
The environmental policies adopted during the Reagan and Bush Administrations have spawned many lawsuits, and those bringing the challenges often lack the direct economic interests that would automatically confer standing to sue. Obstacles to standing on the part of those who can claim little more than a general aesthetic or scientific concern could have the effect of making Administration policies of this sort unreviewable by Federal courts.
The Supreme Court has been cutting back on standing in environmental cases, and today's decision was a continuation of that trend. The majority's tone was notably hostile in its rejection of the concept of standing based on "procedural injury," an idea accepted by the lower court in this case to permit lawsuits by those who had not themselves suffered any concrete harm from the Government policy they were challenging.
Justice Scalia said that even if Congress opens the door to lawsuits of this sort through the inclusion of "citizen suit" provisions, such as a provision in the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the Federal courts would be barred from hearing such cases under Article III of the Constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to concrete "cases" and "controversies."
 
'One More Nail in the Coffin'
 Both the standing issue in the case and the underlying dispute about the Endangered Species Act had attracted widespread interest in the environmental community. Lawyers for environmental groups predicted today that the challenge to the regulation was likely to be renewed in a lawsuit designed to overcome the hurdles that the Court established today. But they said that given the Court's mood and the Bush Administration's willingness to press the standing issue, the long-term outlook was unfavorable.
"This is one more nail in the coffin of citizen standing," said Robert Houseman, a lawyer for the Center for International Environmental Law, which filed a brief in the case.
The decision, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, No. 90-1424, overturned a 1990 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. That court had granted standing to an environmental group, Defenders of Wildlife, to challenge the regulation limiting the Endangered Species Act to domestic projects.
The appeals court then found the regulation invalid and ordered the Interior Department to issue a new one that applied the law overseas. The Bush Administration appealed to the Supreme Court, both on the issue of standing and on the validity of the regulation.
Justice Scalia's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Byron R. White, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas.
Justice John Paul Stevens concurred in the outcome of the case because, he said, he believed the Endangered Species Act was not intended to apply overseas. However, he disagreed with the decision on legal standing.
 
Blackmun and O'Connor Dissent
 Justice Harry A. Blackmun filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. They said they would not join what they called "a slash-and-burn expedition through the law of environmental standing."
Defenders of Wildlife supported its claim to standing with affidavits of two members, who had visited areas in Egypt and Sri Lanka where Federal funds were being used for large public works projects. The two members said the projects posed threats to the habitats of several endangered species. They said they planned to return to the areas at some time in the future and would be injured by not being able to see the animals.
In his majority opinion, Justice Scalia said: "Such 'some day' intentions -- without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day will be -- do not support a finding of the 'actual or imminent' injury that our cases require."

HEADLINE: Inflation Nearly Vanishes; the Fed Has Its Cue

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that consumer prices rose a barely perceptible one-tenth of a percent in May. The positive inflation news seems likely to nudge the Federal Reserve closer to the elusive "final" easing of monetary policy that has been widely anticipated for more than two months.
Not only has inflation been held to a 3 percent pace so far this year, giving the Fed the room to move, but there were signs of renewed weakness in the economy in the spring, especially in the crucial retail and housing sectors. Moreover, the M-2 money supply, cited by the Fed in April as a reason to ease policy, continues to lag far below target. 
 But no such easing of monetary policy -- by adding money to the banking system and thereby lowering short-term rates -- is yet in sight, both Fed officials and private monetary experts say, because it might be counterproductive. In fact, Wayne D. Angell, now the most senior Fed governor in length of service, said in an interview today, "Easing short rates under the wrong conditions can cause long rates to rise."
 
 
Action Unlikely Before July
 Should easing occur, the betting among private analysts is that it would not come before the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 30 and July 1 and the publication on July 2 of employment and unemployment figures for June.
"I think they should not -- and will not -- ease again," said David M. Jones, one of Wall Street's top Fed watchers. He declared that the central bank was in a "wait and see mode," having cut rates 22 times since mid-1989, 16 of those cuts since the recession began in the summer of 1990.
For one thing, analysts note that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other Fed officials continue to indicate that they believe the economic recovery, albeit subdued and lacking momentum, is likely to continue. For another, M-2, which consists of currency, checking accounts and some savings accounts, is an increasingly dubious guide to policy, its growth held back by artificial factors like investors' shifting of huge amounts of money out of rate-shrunken certificates of deposit and into higher-yielding bond funds.
But the main reason for the Fed's reluctance to ease policy is that long-term interest rates are what really matter for a recovery. Long-term rates are a significant factor in whether a chemical company decides to expand a plant and whether a young couple decide they can afford a new house.
 And the Fed can do almost nothing, at least in the short run, to bring down long-term rates, which are determined mainly by the expectations of inflation over the next two or three decades.
In fact, injecting money into the banking system serves to make investors nervous about the Fed's long-term commitment to controlling inflation. Today's exceptionally steep yield curve -- long rates four full percentage points above short rates -- already reflects such jitters, Mr. Greenspan and others have noted.
Or as Mr. Angell put it, "The bond market is just scared."
Another Fed governor, who insisted on anonymity, also pointed out that further easing might damage anti-inflation confidence and thereby raise long-term rates. This governor implied that the Fed had already done enough, despite continuing advice from an election-minded Bush Administration that the central bank take out an "insurance policy" on the economy.
Indeed, the Fed is strongly believed to have switched at its May policy meeting to a neutral stance, from its bias toward easing since last year.
Some Fed officials seem to be taking setbacks in the economy, like flat retail sales over the last three months, with equanimity. Their rationale is that both the expansion and the recession were marked by unevenness -- as to both geography and economic sector. Under such circumstances, they say they could accept an uneven recovery.
Analysts tend to dismiss, almost entirely, the May rise in the unemployment rate, a lagging indicator that reflects a rise in the number of people deciding it might be fruitful to resume their search for work.
In addition to the risk of driving up long-term rates, analysts said, little would be gained by pushing short-term rates, which are already less than 4 percent, down another notch.
"Does it help to have short rates lower? I don't think so," said Alan C. Lerner, a money-market analyst at the Bankers Trust Company.
People borrowing for a matter of weeks or months "have already borrowed what they're going to," Mr. Lerner said, adding that another quarter-point reduction would spur much new activity. And the lower short-term rates go, he said, the more eroded are the incomes of retirees and others whose spending is greatly dependent on interest from certificates of deposit, money market funds and savings accounts.
Still, a rate cut cannot be ruled out. The likely timing, however, is a relatively brief period between early July and the Republican National Convention in early August. After that, the Fed's overwhelming desire will be to do as little as possible until Nov. 3.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Adopts Guide To Control Future Sprawl

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 12

 BODY:
After more than six years of debate and revisions, New Jersey adopted statewide land-use guidelines today that are aimed at forcing growth into compact population centers and away from random sprawl.
State and local regulatory agencies are expected to base decisions about development according to the plan's five planning areas, from densely populated urban districts to environmentally sensitive, off-limits areas. 
 A developer might still be able tobuild in an area designated for agriculture, for example, but the state could invoke the plan to prevent the development from being served by sewers or roads.
"It's up to the agencies, and their leader is the Governor," said James W. Gilbert, chairman of the State Planning Commission, after the panel unanimously approved the plan. New Jersey is the latest of a dozen or so states to adopt land-use guidelines.
Gov. Jim Florio has already said he will support the plan's goals, which are intended to break the familiar pattern of having each successive housing project leapfrog over the last one, moving deeper into the state's diminishing farm and open space, while leaving cities and older suburbs hollowed out by vanishing investment. New Jersey has lost nearly a million acres of farmland to development since 1950, about half of the total farmland it had then, according to a Rutgers University report.
The plan's adoption today was a triumph for advocates of managed growth. On Thursday the Senate rejected a bill that would have postponed the plan's effective date for nine months for further study.
The Assembly is scheduled to vote on a similar measure on Monday; its sponsors are uncertain of the outcome.
However the vote turns out, questions will remain about how the plan will deal with providing housing, work space, shopping and transportation for the half-million more people expected to move into the state by the year 2010. Although the state planning map is based largely on local master plans, opposition to directed growth could come particularly from the already built-up suburbs, which the plan envisions becoming more crowded so that adjoining open areas may remain unspoiled.
"The no-growth communities will adopt the plan right away, and the growth communities will fight and scream all the way to the planning board," said Ara Hovnanian, president of Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., one of the biggest builders -- and consumers of open land -- in the state. He was addressing a symposium on the plan last week in Princeton, which is mapped for moderate growth under the plan.
 
Will Princeton Aid Hopewell?
 "We will be saying to Princeton Township that they will have to change the nature of their community and accept this new density because out in northwest Hopewell, they don't want any development at all," Mr. Hovnanian added. "It is going to be very, very painful."
Mr. Hovnanian and other developers have also pointed out -- and planning groups concede the truth of it -- that the plan's restraints on development will go into place immediately, while the plan's promises to make it easier to build in designated areas, where local resistance may be fierce, are nowhere in sight. Such measures, aimed principally at cutting red tape for builders who follow the land-use plan, may require legislative action.
Maurice H. Hageman 2d, a Hights town real-estate broker and president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, warned in an interview that New Jerseyans may object to losing the suburban elbow room that came with sprawling development, and may move to New York or Pennsylvania, where no state development plans exist.
Even some rural municipalities that like being designated low-density housing areas, a plus to homeowners, will object to being denied the office park developments that are property-tax gold mines, said Paul Matacera, the Mayor of North Brunswick and president of the New Jersey League of Municipalities.
The Planning Commission helped dampen some of the strongest opposition to the measure last week when it adopted its first policy statement: that landowners should perhaps be compensated for the lost value of land taken out of development. The resolution won a yes vote from the last holdout on the commission, Arthur R. Brown Jr., Commissioner of Agriculture, whose farm constituents' land is potentially worth far more as subdivisions than as orchards or cornfields.
But while skeptics and outright opponents of the plan continue to resist its methods, defenders of the planning, which involved six years of debate, compromise and acceptance among the state's 21 counties and 567 municipalities, take heart from some recent developments.
An economic impact assessment, released in February, concluded that the plan would save billions by forestalling the need for new roads, sewers, schools and the like, and would create many new jobs by pushing new investment into existing urban cores. Meanwhile, public opinion polls have shown strong support for state planning.
"No state in my experience, and I have been in almost every one of them, has ever treated more seriously and more thoroughly an important public issue," said Mark B. Lapping, dean of the Center for Urban Planning and Policy Development at Rutgers University, in describing the state plan. "There are socially and economically important land-use decisions that simply have to move beyond the incremental, parochial level, where everyone simply looks at their own corner of the map."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Issues;
Abortion Foes See Pivotal Voting Role

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., June 12

 BODY:
At the National Right to Life Convention here this week, cheerful women's voices floated through the air, mingling with religious hymns, children's laughter and an unswerving faith that President Bush will be re-elected this fall because anti-abortion voters will put him over the top.
And though every special-interest group might like to think the same about its influence and its candidate, political analysts say the prospect of a three-way race pitting Mr. Bush against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, who both support a woman's right to choose abortion, may mean that argument is not too far from the truth. 
 Around the convention center, Mr. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle peer from an advertisement on the back of the seminar catalogue thanking them for making "America's children much safer tonight."
"President Bush has done everything he could for the babies," said Carol Long, director of the National Right to Life Political Action Committee. "Now the message of Right to Life to the Republican Party and to pro-life voters is that we should help him."
 
Dependable Voting Bloc
 In fact, with the President's approval ratings falling with each new public opinion survey, the anti-abortion movement may be the one large political bloc he can count on unequivocally. Many members say they really do not care much about his record on other issues, including the economy, education, jobs and health care.
"Stopping abortion is such a big part of my life that nothing else is important," Mrs. Long said.
Public opinion polls since 1988 indicate that 14 to 19 percent of voters identify themselves as opposed to abortion. Now National Right to Life leaders believe the group is big enough and dedicated enough to make the difference for Mr. Bush.
At a workshop on the 1992 campaign, Darla St. Martin, the group's associate director, said: "We very much believe that the pro-life vote is a tremendous advantage to a candidate. We have a lot more people with a depth of dedication on this issue that is holding firm."
"Even though statistics indicate the population is divided" over abortion, she said, abortion foes "will vote on the issue more than the opposition will."
And Joleigh Little, an animated University of Wisconsin student who said she had been a volunteer against abortion since the age of 13, was even more blunt. "I am a Republican because of the pro-life plank," said Miss Little, who is now 21 and critical of recent attempts within the party to modify its abortion position. "If they abandon that plank, they can forget about my support. I am a single-issue voter."
It is precisely that commitment that leads Bush campaign strategists to believe that the election could pivot on the support of anti-abortion voters. And some political analysts tend to agree.
"In a very paradoxical way, pro-life supporters may well be able to lay claim to an important role in the Bush campaign this time around," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, the research organization.
Because of the candidacy of Mr. Perot, the Texas businessman who is likely to run as an independent, "Mr. Bush is no longer looking to win 50 percent, but a plurality of the vote," he said. Voters who favor a woman's right to choose abortion may split their votes between Governor Clinton of Arkansas and Mr. Perot, and such a split could work to Mr. Bush's advantage.
"If it were a Bush-Clinton race, abortion would be more of a problem issue," Mr. Mann said, since polls indicate most Americans favor some access to abortion. "But given Bush's weakness across the board, the Republicans are gambling that the intensity of the 20 or so percent on the pro-life side will prove more electorally relevant than the majority whose position on abortion more reflects the Clinton-Perot positions."
In recent years, New York Times/ CBS News Polls have shown that roughly 2 out of 10 Americans believe that abortion should not be permitted at all, in contrast to 4 out of 10 who say that it should be available to all who want it. Another 4 in 10 say abortion should be available, but under stricter limits than those that now exist.
But the polls suggest that the abortion opponents are more likely to vote on the basis of the issue than those favoring abortion rights. For example, in The Times/CBS News Poll last March, 18 percent of those who would ban abortion said it was the most important issue influencing their votes, as against 4 percent of those who would make abortion available to all who want it.
Karlyn Keene, a public opinion researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington, said in an interview that in the last two elections, abortion opponents "voted much more Republican than the population as a whole in every test that we have of voters."

HEADLINE: Woman Killed and 2 Injured By Man Looking for His Wife

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHOENIX, June 12

 BODY:
A man apparently looking for his estranged wife opened fire in a city personnel office on Thursday, killing one city employee and wounding two others before the police killed him, officials said.
The man, Leroy Johnson, a 36-year-old unemployed salesman, began shooting a .45-caliber pistol after being refused confidential information on an individual, said Detective Leo Speliopoulos of the Phoenix police. 
 Broadcast reports said Mr. Johnson had demanded information about his estranged wife, Judith, who formerly worked in the city prosecutor's office. An administrator in the office said Mrs. Johnson had moved from the Phoenix area earlier this year with her two children to hide from her husband.
The dead city employee was identified as Anne Moerder, 56 years old.

HEADLINE: Judge Gives New Jersey 2 Weeks to Appeal Order on Health Care

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 12

 BODY:
A Federal judge today gave New Jersey two weeks to appeal his order to change its system of financing health care for the poor, rather than five months to change the system.
The ruling allows the state to ask an appellate court to review his May 27 order to change the state's system of adding a 19 percent surcharge to the bills of patients in many insurance plans to finance other hospital debts. 
 Judge Alfred M. Wolin of Federal District Court refused the state's request to delay the effect of his order until Nov. 30. He cited the failure of the Governor and legislative leaders to promise to hold a special session to deal with hospital finances.
His decision last month absolved 2.4 million people from paying the surcharge and set the stage for a financial crisis that threatens the survival of at least some of the state's 20 inner city hospitals.
Judge Wolin had promised a longer stay if Gov. Jim Florio, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian delivered a signed "statement of principles" outlining their plans for a new financing system and promised to hold the special legislative session.
No such statement or promise was delivered in court today by First Assistant Attorney General Edward Dauber, but he pointed out that the Governor and the lawmakers have pledged to enact a new health-care financing plan by Nov. 30. He also said that the New Jersey Legislature is in session all year.
But Judge Wolin said it would be a "cruel hoax" to lead people to believe they could go to Trenton during the summer and find the Legislature in session.
Following the latest stay, Louis P. Scibetta, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said a delay that keeps a flawed payment system in place is no solution. "The only real solution to paying for care for the poor is adopting a broad-based tax that most of society pays, not just sick people," he said.
Brenda Bacon, state director of Policy and Planning, said New Jersey will appeal Judge Wolin's ruling because it affects state and Federal programs outside the health-care field. But she said administrative and legislative staffs will begin meeting to come with a financing plan the Democratic Governor and Republican lawmakers can support.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower On a Possible Cut in Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower on world currency markets yesterday, continuing a downward trend that was made worse by fresh economic data that could set the stage for lower interest rates.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $342.90 an ounce, up from $2.40 on Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold added $2.50 an ounce, to a late bid price of $342.50. 
 The dollar sold off in foreign markets overnight and continued to falter when trading shifted to the United States.
Selling intensified after the release of a Government report showing consumer prices rose a tiny one-tenth of 1 percent in May, the best showing in four months, as a drop in food costs helped to offset higher energy prices.
"That reduces inflation fears, but it also at the same time probably increases the option for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, and that's a negative for the dollar," said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors, thereby reducing their need for the dollar.
Another report showing business inventories rose at the retail level during April also does not bode well for economic growth, Mr. Donney said.
The European currencies, particularly the German mark, remained strong, while the Japanese yen fell in the face of the country's continually weakening economy.
Midway through the session, technical buying of dollars appeared, but it was not enough to allow the currency to close with gains on the day.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 126.67 Japanese yen from 127.38 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 126.47 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 126.60 yen, up from 126.35 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8550, from $1.8475 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.8510 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.8505.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Investing in Russia Likely to Be Eased

BYLINE: By John H. Cushman Jr.

 BODY:
ONE obstacle impeding United States private investment in Russia is likely to be lowered during Boris Yeltsin's visit to the United States next week: taxes. President Yeltsin and President Bush plan to sign an income tax treaty.
The treaty would limit Russian taxes on subsidiaries of American companies. More important, it would let American companies reduce their United States taxes to compensate for income taxes levied by Russia on retained earnings, dividends paid to the American owners, or interest payments by companies in Russia to American lenders. In general the changes would bring business relations between the United States and Russia into conformity with similar arrangements among most other countries. 
 Philip Morrison, the Treasury official who led the American negotiators, said that for some companies the treaty "can make the difference between making an investment and not."
But the pact, whose details will not be disclosed until it is signed next week, by no means solves all the problems facing potential investors.
"There are all kinds of things that need to be right before people are going to invest in Russia," another tax official said. "The treaty eliminates one hurdle, but not the only hurdle by any means."
For example, the income tax treaty does not deal with a stiff tax the Russians want to impose on oil exports. That tax has discouraged many American companies from investing in the Russian industry with the biggest potential for foreign partnerships. Although Treasury officials jawboned on the issue, the export tax is not an income tax and therefore lies outside the treaty's purview.
"It's great to have these pieces of paper," said Robert Ebel of the Enserch Corporation, a Dallas-based oil company. "But Russia has put on a series of taxes which, if you add them all up, make it difficult to make a profit. They are so desperate for hard currency, and they look upon the oil industry as the golden goose. But they have to be careful that they don't kill the golden goose."
Nor is the treaty likely to do away with another feature of the Russian tax code: its effective tax rate of about 60 percent on the personal income of any foreigner who resides permanently in Russia. The same tax applies to Russian citizens, so the main thing the treaty could do would be to provide that people who are not really permanent residents, like salespeople working from hotel suites, are not taxed.
The trickiest part of the negotiation, according to American officials, was finding a way to allow American companies to get tax credits at home to offset the taxes imposed by Moscow. New Russian laws establishing enterprise taxes were drafted in a way that precluded offsetting credits because the levies did not meet the American definition of an income tax.
While the details of the Russians' new tax structure are not yet clear, it apparently does not allow wages and interest payments to be deducted from income when taxes are computed. Under American regulations, foreign taxes that do not fit the definition of an income tax, like a sales tax or a levy on royalties, cannot be credited directly against American tax obligations, although they can be deducted from taxable income.
United States negotiators are not permitted to waive American tax rules to accommodate another country's tax code, but it appears that the Russians have agreed to modify the taxes they impose on foreign companies in order to qualify them for compensating credits.
"I'm sure the final resolution would insure that some kind of creditability is allowed," said Edwin J. Reavey of Coopers & Lybrand, the head of the international taxation committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. "There wouldn't be much in it for a U.S. company that had to pay both a Russian tax and a United States tax."
 
Defeat for New York
 New York's highest state court has thwarted an effort by the state's Department of Taxation to tax the gain earned by a pension fund that sold land for a profit.
Since 1985, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, trustee of the American Motors Corporation Union Retirement Income Plan, has been fighting the tax. In a decision this week, the Court of Appeals in Albany ruled that Federal pension law pre-empts the tax, even though it is not aimed solely at pension funds.
John A. Corry of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, who represented Morgan, said that if the case had gone the other way, the tax-starved state could have enjoyed an open season on pension funds. Most of the increases in assets projected for retirement plans in the coming decade are likely to come from the sales of existing assets, the court noted.

HEADLINE: Using Bonds to Prepare for Future Needs

BYLINE: By JAN ROSEN

 BODY:
Mark F. Cavalier, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, is building a ladder -- a financial ladder -- to pay for his children's educations. It is a simple technique that he also recommends to others to improve their return on savings without excessive risk.
"Laddering" simply means buying bonds and notes of different maturities, so that they do not all mature at once. When planning for the children's educations, for example, he matches the maturities to the years they are likely to be in school so the amount of money available each year can be projected accurately. 
 Retirees can also use the technique. With money-market funds and savings accounts now yielding only 3.5 percent, some retirees have seen their interest income sliced in half in the last year. They can lock in better yields by moving part of their savings into longer-term securities, which now offer significantly higher yields -- five-year Treasury notes (when priced for retail customers, not institutions) were yielding 6.34 percent earlier this week; 10-year bonds, 7.24 percent, and 30-year bonds, 7.77 percent. Because prices and interest rates fluctuate in the bond market, yields can vary from the interest rate set in the original coupon.
"We just don't see short-term rates coming back up for the near term," Mr. Cavalier said, because of the low-interest-rate policy the Federal Reserve has been following to stimulate the economy. "Laddering lets people use longer rates than they are accustomed to, but not so far out they would be afraid. They can move out to a longer maturity and catch a more attractive yield."
Mr. Cavalier, part of whose job at the firm is to help financial consultants put together the right combinations of investments for individual clients, developed a laddered portfolio of Treasury securities with an average maturity of 5.14 years and an average yield to maturity of 6.11 percent for conservative "buy and hold" investors. That is 2.61 percentage points ahead of the current yield on money-market funds.
Tim Kochis, a partner in Kochis & Fitz in San Francisco, said, "Laddering, or matching maturities, is a very simple, straightforward, uncomplicated, fail-safe way of funding near-term objectives."
Mr. Kochis whose financial consulting firm sells only advice, not bonds or other investments, added, "It's an important concept in the work we do for our clients, matching maturities for needs that aren't covered by other sources of income, like salary or Social Security."
For example, he said, suppose a client has a child entering college next year. He might recommend buying bonds that mature in each of the next four years with enough principal and interest to cover the annual costs.
For a retired client who is tolerant of risk he might recommend holding enough in a laddered portfolio of bonds to provide income for six to eight months; for risk-averse clients, he might recommend bonds that would provide six to eight years' income needs. He would recommend putting the balance of retirement savings into stocks.
"If these needs are covered by risk-free investments," Mr. Kochis said, "they can afford to take risks" with other money. He pointed out that historically stocks have outperformed bonds in total returns -- that is, growth of capital plus dividends or interest earned, when held longer than five years. But in the short term stocks tend to be more volatile.
 
Part Bonds, Part Stocks
 "Many retirees go all to bonds at retirement," he said. "That's a mistake. Someone retiring at 65 today may have 20 or 25 years ahead," and for most people pensions and Social Security are not enough. Therefore, he added, he recommends putting part of an investment portfolio into bonds for near-term needs and the bulk into stocks -- he favors a mutual fund that mirrors the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. With capital appreciation on the stocks, there will be more money to replenish the bond portfolio as it is used.
"It's a dynamic process," he said, "always slicing off a portion of the equities."
Mr. Kochis recommends buying only Treasury securities or the highest-quality corporate or municipal bonds. He advises investors to buy bonds directly and to avoid bond mutual funds "because you never get close to maturity." Funds tend to hold bonds with longer maturities to get higher yields, he said, but that means the amount of the principal could fluctuate.
Treasury notes and bonds are generally considered the safest of all bonds because they are issued by the Government and have no risk of default. An investor who sells a bond before maturity could have a gain or loss, depending on market conditions, but the Treasury will redeem an issue held to maturity at full face value, so "buy and hold" investors do not risk losing their savings.
Of course, if interest rates were suddenly to rise, people who had bought bonds today would have their money in assets that were earning less than future issues could be expected to pay. But one reason for laddering is that as each security in a portfolio matures, it can be reinvested at current rates to minimize such differences.
 
Concept for Higher Yields
 "In the 1980's, investors became conditioned by high-yielding C.D.'s and money market funds, and now they believe that short-term securities offer the best balance between risk and return," Mr. Cavalier said. "This is a concept people have to get away from if they want to capture higher yields in today's market."
Indeed, a couple of years ago, Treasury bills and other short-term holdings yielded more than long-term bonds -- in Wall Street jargon, there was an inverted yield curve -- but that was an anomoly and conditions today are far more typical.
Mr. Cavalier said Shearson offers a free booklet, "Five Ways to Beat Low Interest Rates," available by calling (800) 233-7741.
Of course, aggressive investors who enjoy playing the market might make more money by trading in longer-term, more speculative bonds, or by using sophisticated techniques to hedge in futures and options markets; but such investors might also lose a bundle. The laddered portfolio is for conservative investors who want to put their savings to work to achieve a specific financial goal with minimum risk.

HEADLINE: THE EARTH SUMMIT: PRESIDENT, IN RIO, DEFENDS HIS STAND ON ENVIRONMENT;
Clinton Cites Bush 'Errors'

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas continued to direct his oratorical fire at President Bush today, asserting that the White House had committed "grievous errors" in failing to commit to global agreements on the environment proposed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.
"George Bush is out of touch with this new era," Mr. Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, said at a news conference in Washington. "He doesn't understand that rising global temperatures can threaten our standard of living." 
 Mr. Clinton has consistently criticized Mr. Bush for his reluctance to take part in the environmental accord being proposed in Brazil. Today's statements were intended to focus a negative spotlight on the President on a subject the Democrats hope to lay claim to in the fall general election.
"If I had been President over the last year, today's ceremonies would have capped a year of energetic United States leadership rather than a year of grudging participation and general denial of the problems that exist and the phenomenal opportunities before us to create a real new world order rooted in economic prosperity and environmental protection," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton, who has acknowledged that he has frequently made trade-offs between protecting the environment and encouraging business growth while Governor of Arkansas, maintained today that both goals can be accommodated.
He said, for example, that he sought to cooperate with Mr. Bush's Environmental Protection Agency director, William K. Reilly, on a wetlands policy that would exempt cleared farmlands from new controls.
But Mr. Clinton, who was locked at the bottom of many polls in a three-way race with Mr. Bush and Ross Perot, had little good to say about the Bush Administration's environmental policies today.
The President Mr. Clinton said, was the "lone holdout to environmental progress" at the Earth Summit.
In particular, he faulted Mr. Bush's decision not to sign an agreement to limit carbon-dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
