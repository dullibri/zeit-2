HEADLINE: New Airport May Be Due, Officials Say

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The number of travelers passing through New York's three major airports each year is racing toward the 100 million mark, leading the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to consider whether it is time for a fourth regional airport, Port Authority officials said yesterday.
 The authority, which operates La Guardia, Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International Airports, predicts that traveler traffic at the three airports will increase more than 6 percent this year, to about 100 million passengers, said William R. DeCota, the agency's director of aviation. In the next 10 years, the number of passengers is expected to grow to 124 million. 
 By then, he said, the three airports would be near their estimated maximum capacity, adding that La Guardia, the smallest of the three, was already handling about 85 percent of its estimated capacity.
 The steady growth, caused by airline competition and a robust economy, has prompted the Port Authority to analyze where all the passengers are coming from, and to ask about the need for a fourth airport and where it might go. 
 The authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, raised those questions when he addressed legislators in Trenton last week at a hearing about accidents at a smaller airport in Teterboro, N.J., that the agency operates. But he said yesterday that he did not have any answers.
 ''I think it's actually irresponsible of me to say where we're going to put this airport'' if one is eventually built, Mr. Coscia said. ''I want the experts to spend the time and analyze this. But you don't need to be a genius to realize that air travel is growing at a very fast pace. If we don't accommodate that growth, the growth will be a negative, not a positive.''
 It seems clear that there is no room for a new airport in the boundaries of the Port Authority's district, which encompasses the area within 25 miles of the Statue of Liberty.
 If the Port Authority were to decide to build an airport outside that zone, it would have to get approval from lawmakers in Trenton and Albany to amend the compact that created the agency in 1921, Mr. Coscia said. Amendments have previously been made: for example, to allow the authority to build the World Trade Center, he said.
 The Port Authority has not seriously considered adding a fourth big airport in more than three decades since a former chairman, Austin J. Tobin, was thwarted in his effort to build one near Morristown, N.J., Mr. Coscia said. 
 The newest major American airport, Denver International, is 10 years old and sits on 34,000 acres, about four times the total space of all three big New York-area airports.

HEADLINE: Principal Hid Fraud on Tests In Brooklyn, Officials Say

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
A Brooklyn high school principal covered up a widespread effort to inflate grades on the Regents exams in social studies in 2002 and 2003, education officials said yesterday, and he will face termination. 
 The principal, Lennel George of the Cobble Hill School of American Studies, was removed this week after a 14-month investigation involving state and city officials.
 The authorities also said yesterday that Kathy Pelles, a local superintendent in Brooklyn responsible for supervising the school, would be formally reprimanded for failing to properly supervise the investigation into cheating allegations and for failing to promptly report the allegations.
 Officials said an assistant principal had directed teachers to change failing grades to passing on dozens of exam papers. 
 The finding is the latest blow to the state's Regents testing system, which has been plagued by cheating and other problems. And it called into doubt the state's longstanding practice of letting schools grade their own test papers. 
 Earlier this week, an official in the Jericho school district on Long Island was charged with official misconduct, accused of providing his son, a student at John Glenn High School in the Elwood district, with answers to the Regents exam in global history. 
 Last week, state officials lowered the score needed to pass the Math B Regents exam after they said they had erred in scaling the test results and that too many students would probably fail. In recent years, there were similar problems with the Math A and physics tests.
 In the Brooklyn case, an investigator for the city school system, Louis N. Scarcella, determined that the assistant principal for humanities, Theresa Capra, had directed staff members to tamper with the results for the Regents exams in global history and in American history, by raising grades on the essay portions of the exam. 
 In his report, Mr. Scarcella said that three teachers had admitted changing grades by engaging in a process called ''scrubbing,'' in which grades just below the 65 passing mark are bumped up. 
 In some cases, teachers said that papers with grades in the low 50's with no chance of passing had also been lifted above 65. A statistical analysis by the State Education Department in April 2004 found that ''the aggregation of scores assigned in the 65-69 range as compared to the 60-64 range for students of the Cobble Hill High School goes beyond any dispersion, magnitude or directionality that is likely attributed to chance.'' 
 According to Mr. Scarcella's report, Ms. Capra denied the allegations but refused to be interviewed during the investigation. She resigned in May 2004. 
 Darren Dopp, a spokesman for State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, confirmed yesterday that the case had been referred to his office and that officials were considering criminal charges against Ms. Capra. The removed principal, Mr. George, said he was fighting his dismissal but declined further comment. Efforts to reach Ms. Capra and Ms. Pelles last night were unsuccessful.
 The Cobble Hill case left city and state education officials struggling to explain why the investigation took so long. 
 Because of the delay, at least 50 students at Cobble Hill were apparently permitted to graduate even though their Regents scores were fraudulent. 
 Alan Ray, a State Education Department spokesman, said the agency did not require scores to be changed unless errors were found within one year. While the department had initial statistical evidence of irregularities at Cobble Hill, the city's investigation was not concluded until last month.
 At the heart of the case was Philip Nobile, a social studies teacher and the union chapter leader at the Cobble Hill School, who pressed allegations of misconduct by Ms. Capra in repeated complaints to the principal, Mr. George, and later in formal complaints to officials in both the City and State Education Departments. 
 Mr. Nobile passed along an e-mail exchange with Ms. Capra that took place prior to the June 2002 Regents exams in which he expressed concern that many students would fail. 
 Ms. Capra replied: ''Let's try to focus on getting these kids a 65. Teach them to do the essays first before the multiple choice. In a pinch they can get points from writing any old garbage down.'' 
 That sentiment, while starkly put in the e-mail message, reflects an understanding among educators that they have more latitude in grading essay portions on Regents exams. 
 Mr. Ray said state officials routinely audited about 10 percent of Regents test papers. ''We are certain that this kind of cheating is not widespread,'' he said. 
 Mr. Nobile said he saw exam grades being changed in June 2002 but did not complain to the principal until April 2003 out of concern for the teachers involved. 
 Mr. Nobile said that Ms. Capra retaliated against him, by giving him unsatisfactory reviews. In March 2004, he complained to state officials, who ordered the city to investigate. Around the same time, another teacher hand-delivered his own complaint to officials in Region 8 in Brooklyn, which was led at the time by Carmen Farina, now the city's highest ranking instructional official. 
 Jerry Russo, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein, said, ''While an isolated incident, this behavior is entirely unacceptable.'' 
 Mr. Nobile said city officials should do more to protect teachers who report corruption.
 ''The system is stacked against a whistle-blowing teacher who can be subjected to retaliation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Republican Lawmakers Fire Back at Judiciary

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
Stepping up their assault on the federal judiciary, Congressional Republicans announced efforts on Thursday directed at overturning two recent Supreme Court decisions, one that allowed government to claim private property for economic development and another that stripped Kentucky courthouses of the Ten Commandments.
 ''This Congress is just not going to sit by and let an unaccountable judiciary make these kinds of decisions,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican leader.
 At a news conference, Mr. DeLay called the property ruling a ''George Orwell novel of a court decision.'' 
 Mr. DeLay appeared with members of the House and Senate who are proposing bills to sharply restrict the government's power of eminent domain.
 Hours after he spoke, the House voted 231 to 189 to approve a measure that would prohibit federal financing for property seizures. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois praised the move, an amendment to a spending bill covering transportation and housing, as ''an important first step'' to protecting private property, though it was not clear if the measure would survive in the Senate.
 Illustrating the broad discontent in the House over the court ruling on property rights, House members voted 365 to 33 late Thursday night in support of a resolution expressing ''grave disapproval'' at the court decision.
 Earlier in the day, Representative Ernest Istook, Republican of Oklahoma, stood on the Supreme Court steps to announce a constitutional amendment, backed by 109 House members, including 5 Democrats, that would protect references to God on public property.
 ''This amendment will protect displays of the Ten Commandments, in Kentucky as well as in Texas,'' Mr. Istook said in a prepared statement. ''It will protect the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance. It will protect the ability for schoolchildren to pray at school, individually or together. It will protect our national motto of 'In God we trust.''' 
 The moves reflect a growing discontent among conservatives with the federal judiciary, which has angered them with rulings on hot-button topics like same-sex marriage and end-of-life care. Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation in a direct challenge to the judiciary, directing a court to review the case of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who died after her feeding tube was withdrawn by court order.
 Passions grew even more intense this week, with the court's decisions on the Ten Commandments and eminent domain. In twin rulings that Mr. DeLay later characterized as confusing and hypocritical, the court allowed a monument of the Ten Commandments to remain outside the Texas Capitol, but ruled that copies of the Ten Commandments could not remain hanging in the corridors of two Kentucky courthouses.
 In the eminent domain case, the court cleared the way for New London, Conn., to proceed with a plan to replace a faded residential neighborhood with offices for research and development, a conference hotel, new homes and a pedestrian ''riverwalk.'' The project is to be leased and built by private developers.
 On the day of the ruling, Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, introduced an amendment to an appropriations bill seeking to strip $1.5 million from the Supreme Court's budget. The move was a symbolic protest, Mr. King said then, against ''the injustice done to the 15 property owners in the case.''
 The bills that try to overturn the ruling would achieve that goal in different ways. In the House, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is proposing to withhold federal financing from projects in which municipalities try to take private property for economic development. The measure would also bar the federal government from using its right of eminent domain to claim private property for economic development.
 In the Senate, John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, is proposing legislation that declares the power of eminent domain available only for ''public use'' and says such use cannot be construed to include economic development.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Unchanged in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer spending stayed level in May and incomes increased less than forecast, according to a government report released yesterday.
 Consumer purchases were unchanged last month after rising 0.6 percent in April, the Commerce Department reported. 
Spending had been forecast to rise 0.1 percent in May, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
Incomes were up 6.7 percent last month from May 2004, paced by a 7 percent gain in wages and salaries, the department said. Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 0.2 percent in May after a 0.5 percent rise the previous month, and they were up 3.2 percent in the last 12 months.
 The personal savings rate, which weighs current income from wages, salaries, dividends, businesses and government payments against spending, rose 0.6 percent, up from a pace of 0.5 percent. The number does not take into account borrowed money, income from investments or withdrawals from prior savings.
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that workers filing first-time jobless claims fell 6,000 last week, to 310,000, the lowest since April 16. Economists had been expecting a rise to 325,000, the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
 Federal Reserve policy makers, declaring the expansion to be ''firm,'' raised the benchmark interest rate yesterday for a ninth consecutive time.
 ''The economy is a lot stronger today than most people realize,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, N.C. ''The Fed is safe in pushing rates up.''

HEADLINE: Fed Board Keeps Its Measured Pace for 9th Time

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Thursday, the ninth consecutive increase and almost certainly not the last.
 As investors expected, the central bank raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks a quarter-point, to 3.25 percent. 
In a statement that accompanied the announcement, policy makers gave no hint of when they might slow or stop their march to higher rates.
 They repeated previous declarations that monetary policy is ''accommodative,'' which means interest rates are still lower than officials want, and they again said rates could still rise at a ''measured'' pace. 
 The Fed has been using those words as a form of advance guidance that it will continue raising short-term rates a quarter-point at each policy meeting until it says something different.
 That left investors locked in the same debate about whether the central bank would take a breather at some point in the fall. 
 ''They didn't answer any questions today,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. ''My feeling is that we will hear some things in July, but they certainly didn't want to indicate that now.''
 Thursday was the one-year anniversary of the Fed's effort to reverse the easy-money policies it followed after 2001, when it was fighting an economic slowdown and a collapse of the stock market bubble.
 Investors hoped that Fed officials would offer some hint that they were getting close to a ''neutral'' rate, one that would neither stimulate inflationary pressures nor put a brake on growth.
 But policy makers made only minor changes to their description of the economy, and those served to reinforce the case for more rate increases.
 ''Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually,'' members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, said in their statement.
 That was consistent with the views of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and it implied that the Fed did not have to fight off a possible slowdown.
 The statement also mentioned continued concern about inflation. ''Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term expectations remain well contained,'' the central bank said.
 Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, set off tremors in financial markets in early June when he remarked that the Fed was in ''the ninth inning'' of its rate-raising campaign.
 But Mr. Fisher's comments were at odds with those of most other officials, including Mr. Greenspan. 
 The Federal Reserve has steadily nudged up the overnight lending rate from a low of 1 percent in June 2004. It is now significantly higher than the European Central Bank's benchmark rate, which is 2 percent.
 The most recent economic data suggest that economic growth remains strong and inflationary pressure remains low, despite surging oil prices and rising labor costs.
 That has given the Federal Reserve considerable room for maneuvering -- and for disagreement. For policy makers who worry that the cost of borrowing is still too low, the apparent resilience of the economy makes it easier to argue for tightening policy.
 Supporters of higher rates received fresh ammunition on Wednesday, when the government reported that the economy grew 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared with its previous estimate of 3.5 percent.
 But inflation has also been milder in recent months, despite the rise of oil prices to more than $60 a barrel early this week.
 On Thursday morning, the Commerce Department reported that the Fed's favorite gauge of inflation edged up slightly in May but was still well within the central bank's unofficial comfort zone.
 The Commerce Department reported that its price gauge for personal consumption expenditures, excluding energy and food, was up 1.6 percent in May over the year before. That was slightly higher than the year-over-year increase in April, but within the range of 1 percent to 2 percent that policy makers appear to favor.
 But in recent public statements, top Fed officials have indicated increased worries about evidence of bubble-like prices in the housing market as well as the nation's rapidly rising foreign indebtedness.
 Housing prices have soared over the last year, partly because long-term mortgage rates have declined even as the Fed has been raising short-term rates.

Nicholas Minucci is no stranger to violence. He was arrested after shooting paintballs at Sikhs on Sept. 11, 2001, and a year later was charged in the stabbing of another teenager. Now 19, unemployed and living with his mother, he cruised the streets of Queens in a new Cadillac S.U.V., blaring music and wearing a diamond-encrusted gold necklace. He counted the grandchildren of the mobster John Gotti as friends, even appearing on their reality television show.
 Glenn Moore, 22, also ran with a tough crowd growing up. He left to join the Army, but a year later was back with his old friends in his old neighborhood in Brooklyn, jobless and staying with his mother. Though he had no history of violent crime, he was charged with trying to steal a car in 2003.
 When the two came together at 3 a.m. Wednesday on an otherwise deserted street in Howard Beach, the collision was violent and, according to the police, driven by racial hatred. Mr. Moore, who had been walking with two other young black men, was chased and beaten with a baseball bat until his body was bloodied and his skull fractured. Mr. Minucci, one of two young white men arrested, was charged with first-degree assault as a hate crime. 
 Exactly what happened, and why, is likely to be at issue for some time. But the details of the men's lives that have surfaced so far suggest that despite the difference in race, they had a number of things in common. 
 Although neither had any steady work, both had a taste for luxury items, from the Prada shoes that Mr. Moore was carrying to the Rolex watch that Mr. Minucci was wearing. Both were out that night, as they were many nights, with friends who had criminal records. Each had had brushes with the law, and the two may even have had an earlier brush with each other. 
 Such similarities are not unusual in outbreaks of street violence, and in the hands of each side's partisans, they can be used to smudge the boundary between attacker and victim. Even in the notorious Howard Beach attack of 1986, when a black man died after being chased by a group of white men, neighbors of the defendants tried to shift culpability by pointing out that the victim had had cocaine in his system.
 Yesterday, some defenders of Mr. Minucci said the attack was justified; they said they believed that Mr. Moore and his friends had been roaming the neighborhood for something to steal. ''They are low-life animals,'' said Chris Ruiz, 19, a friend of Mr. Minucci's. 
 The picture that has emerged of Mr. Minucci is clearer than that of Mr. Moore. Muscle-bound, with closely cropped hair, Mr. Minucci -- who is known as Fat Nick -- was described by friends, neighbors and relatives as reveling in the image of a young man leading the thug life. In fact, his friendship with the children of Victoria Gotti was well known in the neighborhood.
 ''He is friends with all three sons,'' said a neighbor who would identify himself only as Larry. ''They would go on camping trips.''
 Friends and neighbors said Mr. Minucci had a walk-on role in at least one episode of the TV show ''Growing Up Gotti,'' in which he encouraged one of the Gotti sons to get a tattoo, saying it would make him a man.
 Mr. Minucci did not graduate from high school, and the only job his friends and family recall him having was a brief stint making deliveries for a local bakery. Mr. Minucci told investigators that he sold his route for tens of thousands of dollars and used a large portion of that money to buy his $60,000 Cadillac Escalade, which was registered to a family member, according to Brian E. Kohm, an assistant Queens district attorney.
 Mr. Minucci grew up in Lindenwood, which borders Howard Beach, and still lives there with his family on a quiet, tree-lined street of two- and three-story brick houses. His uncle, Anthony Minucci, said he played Little League baseball as a boy.
 Nicholas Minucci's first run-in with the law came when he was 15, on the night of the 2001 terror attack, when he and a young man were arrested after shooting paintballs at Sikhs as they came out of the Sikh Cultural Center in Richmond Hill, Queens, said several law enforcement officials who insisted on anonymity because Mr. Minucci was a juvenile at the time and the case record was sealed. The officials said he was found in a car with a paintball gun and a bat. 
 A year later, Mr. Minucci and a friend, Frank Ambrosio, got into a fight with another Howard Beach teenager, John J. Rich, 15, who was stabbed. The two friends were charged, but before Mr. Rich could testify in the trial, he was killed by an elevated subway train, falling onto the tracks in what the police determined was an accident. 
 ''I heard Nick Minucci threw a party when John died because he thought he was going to beat the charges,'' said Mr. Rich's uncle, William O'Connor. In the end, Mr. Minucci pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to five years of probation, according to a law enforcement official who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
 Even while on probation, Mr. Minucci continued to live a lush life. Friends said his grandfather lavished gifts on him. During the attack on Wednesday, Mr. Minucci was wearing a Rolex watch worth $6,000 and a necklace worth $4,000, said Mr. Kohm, the Queens prosecutor.
 Mr. Minucci admitted that he had attacked Mr. Moore and that a friend had shouted racial epithets, the police said. But in a statement, Mr. Minucci denied any racial motive. All of his friends and relatives who were interviewed yesterday said he was not racist.
 Lauren Wright, 33, a cousin of Anthony Ench, who was with Mr. Minucci during the attack and surrendered to the police yesterday, noted that her husband is black. ''We come from a culturally diverse family,'' she said. ''These same guys had been coming into the neighborhood and robbing people. It didn't have anything to do with anybody's skin color.''
 But Mr. Moore's mother, Chandra Eison, said her son was just visiting his girlfriend, Andrea Gordon, and their 6-month old daughter, Amiyh. After leaving her apartment, he met up with two friends, including Richard S. Pope, who said in an interview that he had gone to the neighborhood that night to steal a car. He said Mr. Moore was not aware of his plan.
 Mr. Moore's mother said he had no reason to steal, and was about to receive a settlement for a car accident he had been in as a child. Mr. Moore, who was 9 at the time, suffered seizures afterward, said a friend who would not give his name. 
 Ms. Eison described her son as an average student who played basketball in high school and was not sure what he would do for a living. Among his friends, she said, he was the only one to graduate, and when approached by an Army recruiter he decided to join up in 2000.
 Friends said he trained to drive tanks, but he was discharged a year later after injuring his finger, and received disability payments. He briefly attended New York Technical College to learn about computers, they said, but dropped out. He had recently taken the test for the New York Police Department, his mother said.
 ''He has been kind of confused, and recently he has been between careers,'' she said.
 In July 2003 he was accused of trying to steal a car and pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property, a misdemeanor that carried no jail time.
 He was hanging out more and more on what his friends referred to as ''the block,'' a corner on Blake Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn. ''He did not want a penny-ante job,'' his mother said. She said the birth of his daughter encouraged him to get serious about his life again, so he could take care of his family.
 When he was attacked, he was carrying the little girl's sneakers, Air Jordans that he planned to hang on the wall with the rest of his Air Jordan collection, his mother said.
 It remains unclear when Mr. Minucci and Mr. Moore first encountered each other; Mr. Minucci said that the black men had tried to rob him earlier that night. But no matter what Mr. Moore or his friends were doing in Howard Beach, Ms. Eison said, there was no excuse for what happened. After visiting her son at the hospital, she said: ''I am so tired. I am exhausted at this situation.''

HEADLINE: Change or End Urged for Terror Insurance Law

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
A three-year-old federal law that provided a backstop to insurance companies in the event of a terrorist attack should not be extended in its current form, Bush administration officials said yesterday.
 The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act was approved in the wake of the attacks of 2001, when many insurers stopped providing terrorism coverage or made it extremely costly. Scheduled to expire at the end of this year, it requires the federal government to cover 90 percent of combined damages in excess of $15 billion and up to $100 billion. 
In a letter delivered yesterday to Congressional leaders, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said the law had achieved its ''temporary objectives'' of stabilizing the private insurance market during a period of economic uncertainty. Now that the economy has improved, Mr. Snow said, the administration will not support a backstop unless the insurance industry is willing to shoulder more of the risk.
 In an assessment of the law, also released yesterday, the Treasury acknowledged that eliminating the backstop was likely to result in ''less terrorism insurance written by insurers, higher prices and lower policyholder take-up.'' But in time, it said, the industry could increase its capacity to insure terrorism risk.
 Martin L. DePoy, a spokesman for the Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism, made up of trade associations, corporations and nonprofit groups, called this reasoning ''flawed.'' No one, he said, could predict the losses and other economic repercussions from an attack. 
 Kevin J. Madden, managing director of the real estate practice for Aon, the global insurance brokerage company, said that without the government backstop, insurance premiums for owners of big office buildings in high-risk cities like New York, Washington and Chicago could double or triple. ''The insurance companies are already concerned that they may be overextended in those areas as it is,'' he said.
 But J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, agreed with the administration that the existing program is too generous. ''We're concerned about taxpayers not getting compensated for taking on huge amounts of risk that the insurance companies could afford to take on for themselves,'' Mr. Hunter said.

HEADLINE: Leaders Reach Budget Deal In New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30 

 BODY:
Saying that they had ironed out differences that had threatened to plunge New Jersey into a fiscal and political crisis, Democratic legislators reached broad agreement Thursday night on a $28 billion budget that would give away more than $1 billion in property tax rebates and take in at least $130 million in new taxes.
 The deal, announced by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey and more than 20 members of the Senate and General Assembly, came hours before a legal deadline to pass the budget. But because many details had not yet been worked out, pending discussions on Friday by committees, the budget cannot be formally adopted until Saturday, at the earliest. That will make this budget the tardiest in the state's history, even though the governor's office, the Senate and the Assembly are controlled by one party. 
Until Thursday night, Mr. Codey -- who is also the Senate president -- had been engaged in a tug-of-war with Assembly Democrats, led by the majority leader, Joseph J. Roberts Jr. of Camden County, and Speaker Albio Sires, of Hudson County. Republican leaders said that the impasse demonstrated that the Democrats could not govern effectively.
 But on Thursday night, Democrats praised one another for finding common ground.
 ''It was our version of family feud,'' Mr. Roberts said, before embracing Mr. Codey.
 ''The past four months have not been easy, but they have produced a better budget than the one I introduced in March,'' Mr. Codey said.
 He had proposed to shrink, by more than $1 billion the size of the rebate program, because of the state's shaky finances. But as the economic outlook improved, Assembly Democrats -- who face election in November -- countered with a proposal to restore all of the rebates.
 While many details remained sketchy, Mr. Codey said that everyone who received a property tax rebate last year would receive one this year. The elderly would receive $1,200, the same amount as last year, while others would receive roughly $200 less than the average rebate last year, which was $800, officials said.
 The proposed budget would add $45 million by ending pension deductions for people making over $100,000, Social Security income excluded. A tax on H.M.O.'s would net $55 million, while a tax break for Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield would be eliminated and net $30 million, according to officials.

HEADLINE: How a Japanese Master Enlightened the West

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Legend has it that mid-19th century French artists discovered the wonders of the Japanese woodcut when they examined papers used to wrap imported Japanese ceramics. Today, looking at the prints of Utagawa Hiroshige and Katsushika Hokusai, the greatest of Japanese woodcut printmakers, it is hard to fathom that their works could have been viewed as the equivalents of our funny pages.
 And it is easy to see how Modernists from Manet to Bonnard could find in the lucidity and technical and formal economy of those Japanese artists inspirational guides for escaping the suffocating conventions of Beaux Arts and Victorian painting.
 Now an exhibition at the Phillips Collection here illustrates the influence of Japanese prints on early European and American Modernists. ''East Meets West: Hiroshige at the Phillips Collection'' interweaves the print series that made Hiroshige famous -- ''The Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido'' -- with paintings from the museum's collection by famous artists like Cezanne, Whistler and Braque, as well as by artists of less sturdy repute like Augustus Tack, Ernest Lawson and Maurice Prendergast. 
 It is not a great show as a whole because many of the European and American paintings are of indifferent quality, especially seen next to Hiroshige's work. But it is, nevertheless, an instructive and illuminating one. And it does offer a rare chance to see a complete set of ''The Fifty-Three Stations'' in pristine condition. It is on loan from a private Japanese collection. 
 Published around 1833-34, the series is made up of 55 views along the Tokaido Road, the eastern coastal highway that connected Edo -- now Tokyo -- and Kyoto. There is one print for each of 53 established post-stops and villages along the way and one each depicting bridges at the start and at the end of the journey.
 Going by the works drawn from the Phillips Collection, it appears that what Western artists took from Hiroshige and other Japanese printmakers was mainly formal: compositions that appear cropped or leave much empty space in central areas, that emphasize flat design rather than illusory depth and that simplify detail in favor of clear shapes, patterns and linear rhythms.
 For the Impressionists, these qualities served the realization of the canvas as a kind of hypersensitve retinal screen that registered visual sensation with an almost photographic lack of visual and compositional discrimination. With Post-Impressionists like van Gogh and Cezanne, there is a shift from the rendering of visual sensation to a self-reflexive interest in the grammar of picture-making. This is not contrary to Japanese tradition, which evolved not by increasing its ability to imitate nature but by the increasing refinement of traditional conventions of representation.
 Part of what is so wonderful in Hiroshige is how he gently nudged the schematic abstraction of his fine, prehensile cartoon outlining and flat colors in the direction of naturalism, achieving with pellucid economy naturalistic effects of light and weather and specific descriptions of natural features of the landscape.
 In a sense East and West met as they were going in opposite directions: the East toward greater naturalism and the West toward greater abstraction.
 Hiroshige's work was a last great flowering of traditional Japanese printmaking. When Japan was forced to open itself to trade with the West in 1853, an influx of Western art and photography rendered Japanese styles of representation obsolete. Meanwhile, Western Modernism took what it needed from the East and sailed on into uncharted realms of abstraction.
 Because the Western works in the Phillips Collection are collectively so dull by comparision, the exhibition's main effect is simply to highlight how great Hiroshige is. The experience is visceral: each time you shift your gaze from one of the Western paintings -- whether it is a Bonnard, a Prendergast or a Kokoschka -- back to one of Hiroshige's perfect, glowing jewels, you feel a kind of physical relief and a rush of pleasure. It would be different had the West been better represented -- Manet, Cassatt, van Gogh and Vuillard are among the missing -- but in the presence of inferior competition, the Hiroshiges really shine.
 In focusing on the Hiroshige prints, you discover something that the Modernist preoccupation with form and abstraction overlooks: how terrifically entertaining they are. Hiroshige was not a mandarin composing pictures for purely aesthetic contemplation by the cultivated few. He was an enormously popular artist. Images from the Tokaido were produced and sold in such numbers -- over 10,000 in some cases -- that many of the blocks wore out and had to be recut to keep up with demand.
 Reasons for that popularity are easy to see. Hiroshige was a wonderfully skillful, witty and generous caricaturist. Almost all the tiny people that populate his landscapes are delightfully particularized in their bodies and their gestures; and though the series features no main protagonists, as illustrations for a novel would, he gives each of his little people a vivid sense of purposeful humanity: the man running after his hat that was blown off by the wind; the women trying to drag prospective customers off the street and into the inns where they work; the men lounging in tea houses; the travelers struggling up and down a mountain slope under a driving rain.
 Moreover, Hiroshige conjures the feelings of going on journeys. His prints literally depict all kinds of people in transit and they describe all kinds of places along the way, but they are more than just 19th-century scenic postcards. In almost every print, Hiroshige uses formal devices to enhance a sense of movement through and into space. As paths zigzag from near to far, the eye follows where they lead and the mind wonders where they go beyond the frame of the picture.
 In many images, bridges sweep across the space of the picture making you think about where the people crossing came from and where they are going. And bridges often lead into villages so that you feel what the weary traveler feels upon arriving at his destination: anticipation of warmth, food and relaxation. Sometimes destinations are far away, like the castle town at the foot of a distant mountain range that beckons the party of travelers resting in the foreground after crossing a river. There is nothing religious about Hiroshige's imagery, but there is a subliminal sense of travel as a kind of spiritual pilgrimage. 
 Hardly any of the Western paintings in the Phillips Collection show convey that adventurous feeling of traveling through or into the picture. Ernest Lawson made Impressionist-style pictures of bridges, but leading as they do only into illegible accretions of paint, they are not bridges you feel an urge to cross. Nor does Cezanne's view of Mont Sainte-Victoire inspire a desire to hike into his world; his patchy brushwork blocks imaginative entry like a wall and directs our attention rather to the construction of the picture. 
 An exception among the Western pictures is a wonderful early painting by Paul Gauguin in which we look down from a high grassy knoll to bathers at the edge of a river and a fisherman farther away on a spit of land. You feel as though you could climb down there yourself to go for a swim or spend a few hours loafing with your own rod and reel.
 That dimension of pictorial and psychic travel was left undeveloped by Western Modernist painting, which has tended to try to arrest the eye and the mind in the empirical here and now. But Hiroshige's kind of narrative did not die out. It flourishes in comic books, graphic novels andanimated films that Eastern and Western artists continue to churn out in great volumes, transporting minds all over the world.

''East Meets West: Hiroshige at the Phillips Collection'' remains at the Phillips Collection, 1600 21st Street, NW, Washington, (202)387-2151, through Sept. 4.

HEADLINE: Conventional Wisdom Not Always Right

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WITH the year half over, the world's financial markets appear to be well on the way to demonstrating a great investment truth: When virtually everyone expects something to happen, it won't.
 This year's conventional wisdom concerned the dollar. It would fall under the weight of fiscal irresponsibility and rising trade deficits. So where are we now? The dollar is up against every major currency in 2005. 
At the end of 2003, the sure bet was supposed to be that long-term interest rates would rise in 2004. They did not, and this year they are down in Japan and Europe as well as the United States. 
 Alas, successful investing is not as easy as taking a poll and then betting against the majority. It may turn out that both the interest rate and currency forecasts were just premature, not wrong. Still, with that kind of record, it is worth asking what is the current conventional wisdom.
 There are, I think, two main parts. But in this case, they may be mutually exclusive. The question may be which will prove false first.
 The first area of growing consensus among the chattering class is that there is a housing bubble in the United States, or at least in many areas, and that it is going to burst. Even the bulls see signs of excess. Robert Toll, the chief executive of Toll Brothers, a home builder, says ''the speculating investor will be blown away from the market and then we'll continue on the trend'' of steadily rising home prices.
 The second area of consensus is that China is a growth engine that is on its way to dominating the world in virtually everything as this becomes the Chinese century. 
 China's success these days is intimately tied to the American housing boom. It takes in dollars from selling stuff cheap, and recycles them into Treasuries, holding down interest rates and stimulating American consumption, which gives China more dollars to invest. It is quite true that house prices are higher relative to income than they used to be, but it is not clear what will change that. 
 If China stays strong, the housing bubble may get bigger. On the other hand, if the bubble bursts, that could damage the American economy and slow growth in China. 
 The odds may be that little will change for some time to come. China will keep growing and will keep its currency pegged to the dollar, despite pressure from Washington. 
 If so, those who think the American housing market is about to tumble may look as foolish a year from now as the dollar bears look now. Just because something is overpriced does not mean it will correct anytime soon. 
 BANKRUPTCY is for the little people.
 Bernard J. Ebbers, who has been convicted of running the WorldCom fraud, is going to pay the company a fraction of the money he borrowed from the company -- more than $400 million -- and will be able to keep enough to support his wife. He appears to be headed for prison, but not for poverty.
 MCI, the successor to WorldCom, could have forced Mr. Ebbers into bankruptcy, but it might not have done any better. When Congress amended the bankruptcy laws this year, it did not do much about provisions that let the formerly rich keep money while stiffing creditors. 
 But Congress did clamp down on poor people who run up credit card debts while trying to keep their heads above water. It is now virtually impossible to get many of those debts discharged in bankruptcy, which will raise profits for credit card companies like MBNA. Yesterday, as Mr. Ebbers's deal was being announced, Bank of America said it would pay $35 billion to buy MBNA.

HEADLINE: British Scientists Say Carbon Dioxide Is Turning the Oceans Acidic

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Whether or not it contributes to global warming, carbon dioxide is turning the oceans acidic, Britain's leading scientific organization warned yesterday.
 In a report by a panel of scientists, the organization, the Royal Society, said the growing acidity would be very likely to harm coral reefs and other marine life by the end of the century. 
 ''I think there are very serious issues to be addressed,'' the panel's chairman, Dr. John Raven of the University of Dundee in Scotland, said in an interview. ''It will affect all organisms that have skeletons, shells, hard bits that are made of calcium carbonate.'' 
 The 60-page report was timed to influence next week's Group of 8 economic summit meeting. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, president of the group this year, has been calling for strong action to limit climate change.
 Unlike forecasts of global warming, which are based on complex and incomplete computer models, the chemistry of carbon dioxide and seawater is simple and straightforward.
 The burning of fossil fuels by cars and power plants releases more than 25 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air each year. Roughly a third of that is absorbed by the oceans, where the gas undergoes chemical reactions that produce carbonic acid, which is corrosive to shells. 
 ''That's indisputable,'' Dr. Raven said. ''I don't think anyone can get around that. It's really rock-solid high school chemistry.''
 The pH scale, which measures the concentration of hydrogen, runs from 1, the most acidic and highest concentration of ions, to 14, the most alkaline, with almost no ions. Ocean water today is somewhat alkaline, at 8.1, about 0.1 lower than at the start of the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago.
 But like the magnitude scale of earthquakes, one unit on the pH scale reflects a change of a factor of 10. The 0.1 pH change means there are now 30 percent more hydrogen ions in the water.
 Depending on the rate of fossil fuel burning, the pH of ocean water near the surface is expected to drop to 7.7 to 7.9 by 2100, lower than any time in the last 420,000 years, the Royal Society report said.
 Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian research group based in Washington that is skeptical that global warming will cause serious environmental harm, pointed out that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had been higher for 90 million of the last 100 million years.
 But Dr. Ken Caldeira, a research scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology in Stanford, Calif., and a member of the Royal Society panel, said the difference was that the current carbon dioxide release was occurring quickly, over just two centuries. In the past, water from the deeper ocean would have had time to mix, diluting the effect of the carbon dioxide. ''If we put it out over a few hundred thousand years, we'd have nothing to worry about,'' he said.
 The pH change is likely to slow the rate of growth of coral reefs, which are already suffering from warmer temperatures and pollution, the report said.
 ''By mid-century, 2050-ish, we will probably see noticeable gaps within coral reefs,'' Dr. Raven said. ''Any weakening of their skeleton can make them more prone to storm events.''
 The increased acidity could also reduce populations of plankton with calcium carbonate shells, disrupting the food chain and hurting some fisheries, the scientists said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 5, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a British scientific panel's finding that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was turning the oceans more acidic referred incompletely to the pH scale of acidity and alkalinity. It measures concentration of hydrogen ions, not hydrogen. (The scale runs from 1, the most acidic, with the highest concentration of hydrogen ions, to 14, the most alkaline, with almost no hydrogen ions. Ocean water today is somewhat alkaline, at 8.1; water near the surface is expected to be as low as 7.7 by 2100, the report said.)

HEADLINE: Shares Finish Slow Quarter, As Oil and Bonds Move Up

BYLINE: By ROBEN FARZAD

 BODY:
Crude oil prices breached $60 a barrel. Bonds gained steadily, pushing yields below 4 percent. And seemingly nothing can break the back of the real estate boom. 
 The result is a distracted stock market that is not getting many breaks as it starts the second half of the year. 
Equities turned in a mixed but largely unimpressive second quarter, with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing down 2.2 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.9 percent, but only after dipping into the red in the first quarter. For the year, the Dow is down 4.7 percent, the S.&P. is down 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq is 5.5 percent lower.
 ''People just are in a lousy mood,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards in St. Louis. ''Iraq has everyone uncomfortable, and a lot of people would rather take a miserable 4 percent on Treasuries.''
 Mr. Goldman believes that there is an excessive amount of money in real estate and bonds, at a time when he thinks that the confluence of low interest rates and steady economic growth should be pushing stocks at least 9 percent higher. ''The best time to buy equities,'' he said, ''is when you're most uncomfortable.''
 Rising energy prices have added to investor discomfort, at least for those investors not in energy stocks. The price of crude oil broke the psychologically significant barrier of $60 a barrel on Monday before pulling back -- a 50 percent gain over the last year alone.
 All of which factored into the energy sector posting a market-leading 30 percent increase in expected earnings growth for the quarter, more than four times that of the S.&P. 500, according to Thomson Financial. 
 ''You're continuing to see a lot of speculation in the price of crude, and that's driving up the stocks in the space,'' said Virginia Reynolds Parker, president and chief investment officer of Parker Global Strategies, which manages six hedge funds in Stamford, Conn. ''There will probably be a correction.''
 Another worry is how much the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates. Yesterday, it increased the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks another quarter point, to 3.25 percent, the highest rate in more than four years and more than triple the low set in 2004. 
 The Fed, moreover, is adhering to a vow it made last year to follow a path of measured rate increases, indicating that its campaign is not over yet. Shares slumped after the announcement, with the Dow declining 99.51 points, to 1,0274.97. The S.&P. 500 fell 8.52 points, to 1,191.33 and the Nasdaq dropped 11.93 points, to 2,056.96. Bonds advanced, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury falling to 3.91 percent from 3.98 percent on Wednesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 18/32, to 101 23/32. 
 But there is also increasing speculation that the Fed's drive is drawing to a close, if not immediately. The yield on the 10-year bond, widely viewed as a reliable forward indicator of economic health, has fallen a half-point from where it stood at the end of the first quarter -- prompting Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to call the divergence between short- and long-term rates a ''conundrum'' in a recent Congressional testimony.
 ''The Fed is not going to determine rates,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''The bond market will. And if the bond yield does not move up, the Fed should be done after two more hikes.''
 Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Ms. Parker said that financial stocks and the broader market were primed to rally on that news, consistent with historical pattern. Among the second quarter's best performing shares were NutriSystem, which finished 134.3 percent higher; Par Technology, up 105.5 percent for the quarter, and Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea, 95 percent higher. Among the quarter's biggest losers were Able Laboratories, down 85.2 percent; CVD Equipment, which lost 60.4 percent, and Enesco Group, 55 percent lower. 
 The dollar, meanwhile, posted its largest quarterly gain against the euro since 2001, rising 7.4 percent for the quarter as the United States economy outperformed Europe's. The dollar was also up 3.2 percent against the Japanese yen. 
 The final day of the quarter was punctuated by talk that renewed activity in mergers and acquisitions would inject new life into the market. Bank of America agreed to acquire MBNA, one of the nation's largest credit card issuers, for $35 billion in cash and shares. Just last week, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation offered $18.5 billion for Unocal, countering a $16.4 billion bid by Chevron. ''Corporations have super-strong balance sheets with a pile of buying power,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''and we're seeing that go into acquisitions and share buybacks.''

HEADLINE: Text of Fed Statement on Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a revised statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates a quarter-point:
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 31/4 percent. 
The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. 
 Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.
 The committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, Chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, Vice Chairman; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson, Jr.; Richard W. Fisher; Edward M. Gramlich; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero; and Gary H. Stern.
 In a related action, the board of governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 41/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

Previews and Openings

'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL' Opens Tuesday. This well-financed showcase of new works generated much buzz last year; now it returns for a second year with eye-catching titles like ''The Adventures of Barrio Grrrl!'' (2:00) and ''How Love Is Spelt'' (1:45). Theater Row Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.

'ICE FACTORY 2005' Opens Wednesday. The annual and well-regarded collection of new work features plays by such emerging companies as Witness Relocation Company and Favored National Theater. Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)868-4444.

'AS YOU LIKE IT' . Opens July 12. The up-and-comer Lynn Collins, who was Portia in the recent film of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' plays one of Shakespeare's most beloved heroines, Rosalind, in Mark Lamos's production in Shakespeare in the Park. Brian Bedford and Richard Thomas star (2:40). Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West and at 79th Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)539-8750.

'FATAL ATTRACTION: A GREEK TRAGEDY' Previews start today. Opens July 10. Former Goony Corey Feldman has bunny problems in this adaptation of the 80's thriller (1:10) East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street (212) 279-4200.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Charles Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)

'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'BIRDIE BLUE' The stern competence of Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on "Law & Order," is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.(Zinoman)

*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)

'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Eloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Van Gelder)

*'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Can man-shark love survive in the post- ''Jaws'' era? Adam Bock's screwy, perfectly cast play poses this and other questions you didn't know needed asking, in hilarious fashion (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. ( Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)

'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)

Off Off Broadway

'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)

Last Chance

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' The debate about evoking the proper measurements of humor and pathos in the plays of Anton Chekhov is settled evenly if dubiously in Scott Zigler's production for the Atlantic Theater Company: it fails more or less equally at eliciting laughter and tears (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

*'DISPOSABLE MEN' James Scruggs, who wrote and performed this collection of character pieces, engages issues of race in the button-pushing satirical style that Spike Lee was aiming for (yet failed to pull off) in his film ''Bamboozled.'' This multimedia show compares the way African-American men are portrayed in the media to images of monsters in classic horror films like ''Frankenstein'' and ''King Kong'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars, Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

*'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, garment district, (212)307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' This unrewarding Athol Fugard play benefits from some rewarding performances by its four actors. O'Mara Leary is Milly, who on her 50th birthday has been dumped by her boyfriend and tries to keep her spirits up by recruiting some pals to join her in what turns out to be the worst birthday party ever (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

* 'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Alan Ayckbourn's 67th play, a minor-key comedy about six Londoners leading lives of quiet desperation, is rueful, funny, touching and altogether wonderful. Sir Alan's flawless cast amplifies the emotional impact of his writing in variously subtle and hilarious ways, while respecting the depth in his literary spareness (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300, closing on Sunday.(Brantley)

'UNSUSPECTING SUSAN' Celia Imrie stars as a snobbish Englishwoman in this funny, engaging (mostly) and tragic one-woman show written by Stewart Permutt. Ms. Imrie's character frets about her troubled son, living in London with a charming man, but doesn't begin to grasp how worried she should really be (1:10). Part of Brits Off Broadway. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)

*'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)

'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Stephen Holden)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best part of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)

'DALLAS 362' (R, 100 minutes) The directorial debut of Scott Caan, the 28-year-old son of the actor James Caan, ''Dallas 362'' tracks the troubled friendship between Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) and Dallas (Mr. Caan), two boys just out of their teens whose lives have become stalled in an endless cycle of drinking, bar brawls and minor arrests. ''It's a whole thing'' is this film's catchphrase, a line the two boys use to gesture inarticulately toward the complexity of any subject they can't understand. Scott Caan's debut film is not quite yet a whole thing, but it offers up enough interesting fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for. (Stevens)

'A DECENT FACTORY' (No rating, 79 minutes, in English, Finnish and Chinese) A cursory, irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization, this documentary film was shot and directed by a Frenchman, Thomas Balmes, who tagged along with representatives of the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on a trip to one of the company's suppliers in China. (Dargis)

*'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

'5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)

*'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)

'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)

'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be THIS silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)

*'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

'LILA SAYS' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Ziad Douieri's film, about a 16-year-old French girl's provocative verbal seduction of a 19-year-old Arab boy takes the raw material of social realist melodrama and turns it into a sad and sexy pop song. (Scott)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) The sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions.(Holden)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring (Scott)

'SEX, POLITICS AND COCKTAILS' (No rating, 90 minutes) In this debut feature written, directed and edited by Julien Hernandez , Sebastian Cortez (played by Mr. Hernandez) is a 31-year-old Cuban-American filmmaker finds work making a series of documentaries bout gay culture, Sebastian asks his friend Daria (Marisa Petroro), a soap-opera actress, to introduce him to her circle of gay friends, a raucous group given to margarita-swilling and trading raunchy stories. The common theme of these scattered vignettes seems to be that, straight or gay, it's tough to find love and commitment in a world filled with venal, grasping nitwits. (Stevens)

'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)

*'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

*'TROPICAL MALADY' (No rating, 118 minutes, in Thai) Perched between two worlds, two consciousnesses and two radically different storytelling traditions, this Thai feature shows the young filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness. (Dargis)

'TWIST OF FAITH' (No rating, 87 minutes) Another demoralizing documentary about sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church (it was broadcast on HBO last week). As in so many cases in which priests have been accused of abuse, the details of the alleged crimes are maddeningly elusive. The documentary is an unhappy one, with no satisfying resolution. (Virginia Heffernan)

*'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)

BILAL (Tonight) The Philadelphia neo-soul singer Bilal has been doing his jazz-inflected thing under the pop radar for a while now, and though he never enjoyed the attention conferred on contemporaries like D'Angleo, his music will be a groovy soundtrack for a picnic-blanket chill-out.7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, $3 suggested donation.(Laura Sinagra)

TRACY BONHAM (Sunday) Back in 1966 when girls with guitars were actually played on pop radio, Ms. Bonham, a classically trained violinist, had a rock hit with ''Mother, Mother.''

CLEM SNIDE (Thursday) Though Clem Snide's nasal wiseacre frontman Eef Barzelay increasingly shows his soft side with pretty tunes influenced by love and fatherhood, the Brooklyn indie rocker hasn't lost his trademark snark. 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Manhattan, (212)835-2789. Two tickets per person distributed at 5 p.m. on the day of the show. (Sinagra)

KEVIN DEVINE (Tonight) This singer-songwriter has been the opening act of choice for brainy acts from Liz Phair to Bright Eyes. Now he needs to transcend the fashionably dark but wispy tunes that merely highlight the edginess of his headliner. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, $7. (Sinagra)

DIGABLE PLANETS, J LIVE (Thursday) Digable Planets , the groovy mid-90's ''hip-hop bebop'' group, couldn't weather the changes wrought by the decade's dominant rap styles. But now that the Roots and others have reclaimed ground for bohemian types, they've decided to revive their sassy, spacey poetry. The witty former teacher J Live opens. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $27.50, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)

EARTH, WIND & FIRE, CHICAGO (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) During the 1970's, Earth Wind and Fire was the glossy, horn-powered hit machine that covered all bases, from idealism (''Shining Star'') to dance tunes (''Boogie Wonderland'') to lover's pleas (''Reasons''). Rarely has a band so rapidly dumped its initial radicalism as the radio hit-maker Chicago, which held on to its horn section but traded early jazz-rock experiments for simpering pop. Tonight at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116 Garden State Parkway, Holmdel, N.J., (732)335-0400, $20 to $85. 7:30 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Pkwy, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $35 to $85.

ERIK FRIEDLANDER (Tuesday) This popular avant-garde cellist is bent on showing his instrument's range and applicability to diverse musical missions, veering easily from familiar deep, resonant tones to underworld shrieks and brutally sawed scrapes. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra)

JOHN HAMMOND (Thursday) The rural blues tradition of polyrhythmic fingerpicking and casually revealing vocals is being upheld by revivalists like John Hammond, who has been playing country blues since the 1960's, is a virtuoso whose songs, mostly classic blues, are feats of down-home intricacy. 7 p.m., Robert F Wagner Jr. Park, Battery Park City, free. (Pareles)

ILL EASE (Tomorrow) The low-key Elizabeth Sharp tops her rattletrap drum grooves with whispery, intentionally in-the-cracks singing that mimics the loop of a grudge mantra in a jealous brain. Her bandmate's distorted guitar provides the sonic equivalent of groggy indignance. 10 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718)797-3007, $10. (Sinagra)

WANDA JACKSON, ROSIE FLORES (Tuesday and Wednesday) Wild boys weren't the whole story of 1950's rockabilly. Wanda Jackson, from Oklahoma, was out on the road too, belting songs like ''Fujiyama Mama'' (a big hit in Japan) and ''Mean Mean Man.'' In the 1970's, she became a Christian and turned to church music. But in 1996 one of her fans, the honky-tonk singer Rosie Flores, sought her out for duets, and Ms. Jackson reclaimed her crown as rockabilly queen. Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza, 62nd to 65th Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, (212) 721-650, $15; Wednesday at 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $15, $17 at the door. (Pareles)

(Sinagra)

(Sanneh)

OMAR (Tuesday) This British neo-soul singer showed up on the scene a little early, in the mid-90's when teen pop ruled the radio. Nowadays, times are better for his romantic old school crooning and jazzed-up Motown homages. 7 p.m., Fort Greene Park, Myrtle Avenue at Cumberland Street and Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn, free. (Sinagra)

PANTHERS, IMMORTAL LEE COUNTY KILLERS (Thursday) The Brooklyn punkers in the Panthers make incendiary music conscious of both the avant-garde art landscape and grass-roots politics. Their live show encourages a kind of boogie abandon. The punk blues band Immortal Lee County Killers open. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Sinagra)

PROTO-KAW (Tuesday) A couple of years ago, members of the 70's rock band Kansas, including the founder and ''Dust in the Wind'' writer Kerry Livgren, mined the band's early demos to create a new, jazzier prog rock identity as Proto-Kaw. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20. (Sinagra)

Lately he has backed Bob Dylan in the studio. 6:30 p.m., Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center, Josie Robertson Plaza, $15. (Pareles)

THE RUB (Tomorrow) Continuing its hip mix of hip-hop, favela funk, reggaeton, dancehall, alt-rock, classic rock, kiddie-movie soundtracks and pretty much anything else these sound-crazed smart-alleck D.J.'s can think of, this Brooklyn party celebrates its third anniversary. The point is to get the crowd chuckling and dancing at once. And it works. 10 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, $10. (Sinagra)

SEK LOSO (Tuesday) This popular Thai ax-shredder patterns himself after Jimi Hendrix and sells scads of records at home. He's been working in Britain with former members of Oasis. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Sinagra)

SHADOW (Tomorrow) The ebullient dance beat of Trinidadian soca often carries lyrics that take on tough problems with a sense of humor. Shadow is one of soca's major stars, dancing through songs that address everything from AIDS to infidelity. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)

BETTIE SERVEERT (Thursday) These Dutch bohemians' combination of bright, twisty guitar work and the breathy yet plucky voice of Carol Van Dyk have made them a college-rock mainstay.

(Sinagra)

RACHID TAHA, THE EXIT (Wednesday) In this double bill of Algerian-French music, cosmopolitanism reigns. Rachid Taha dips into rai, the pop now banned in Algeria, and picks up songs from across the Arab world, singing in a ardent voice that shades into a growl. Local band the Exit opens. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $25. (Pareles)

TEAM SLEEP (Tomorrow and Sunday) Though his band, the Deftones, got famous on the frat-friendly nu-metal circuit, Chino Moreno has a reputation as a thoughtful lyricist and eclectic music fan. He's been taking things in a dreamier direction, and with Team Sleep he calls on alt-rock pals to help him move beyond hard-rock bash. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103. $15. Sunday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)798-0406. $15. (Sinagra)

THE VON BONDIES (Thursday) This Detroit garage band aims for a little more hip-shake than its local rivals the White Stripes.

And the lead singer Jason Stollsteimer can croon like an 80's Brit balladeer when he wants to. 7 p.m., Pier 54, Hudson River Park, 13th Street, free. (Sinagra)

YO LA TENGO, STEPHEN MALKMUS, LAURA CANTRELL (Monday) The Hoboken indie-rockers Yo La Tengo poignantly render the quiet spaces and explosive pathos of committed love. They can also get political. Their cover of Sun Ra's ''Nuclear War'' is a sonic flare of frustration. Sharing the Independence Day stage is the cult favorite Mr. Malkmus, whose angular lyrics and guitar squalls helped his band Pavement make the best slacker poet rock of its generation. The local alt-country singer-songwriter Laura Cantrell opens. 3:30 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Manhattan, (212)835-2789, free. (Sinagra)

This weekend, that spectrums runs from the Kander and Ebb tune ''New York, New York'' and a set of Leroy Anderson charmers (including ''Fiddle-Faddle'' and ''Bugler's Holiday'') to Bernstein's ''On the Waterfront'' Suite and jazzy ''Prelude, Fugue and Riffs'' to Copland's evocative ''Quiet City.'' Bramwell Tovey conducts, and picks up a new program on Thursday, with works by Bizet, Dohnanyi, Britten and Tchaikovsky. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5656, $19 to $49. (Kozinn)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

*AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)

*BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs, by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

*EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher, and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter).

*GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

*INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA: The Daguerreotypes of Southworth and Hawes,'' International Center of Photography through Sept. 4. The Dauguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)

*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)

MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE,' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.)(Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART:'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavanger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 60's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

'JOAN MITCHELL SKETCHBOOK: 1949-51' The 60 pages from a single notebook document an eventful period in this American painter's life, years that saw her moving between New York and Paris, and changing from a figurative to an abstract painter, consolidating a connection to French modernism, particularly to Cezanne and early Mondrian; and absorbing the spirit of the New York painters she felt closest to, Willem De Kooning, Arshile Gorky. Francis M. Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, Upper East Side, (212)472-6800 (Through July 15) (Cotter)

Galleries: 57th Street

RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multi-part bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (due to renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)

'GEE'S BEND QUILTS' Quilt's made by women of the tiny hamlet of Gee's Bend, Ala., have been making the rounds of United States museums since 2002. For those who are still unacquainted with those extraordinary works of folk art that resonate strikingly with Modernist abstraction, this small show is a good introduction. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through July 22.(Johnson)

'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute , 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing, but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)

'HOMOMUSEUM: HEROES AND MONUMENTS' With multiculturalist monuments to all kinds of minorities in place, how about a National Gay Hall of Fame, celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered culture? This group show of 27 artists could have been sharper and more exploratory than it is, but has good work and packs a lot of history. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 30. (Cotter)

'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions include a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212)463-9666, through July 22. (Johnson)

KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212)229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

*MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES' New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around hishome, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 673-3096, through July 15. (Johnson)

DANA FRANKFORT: WHAT'S SO FUNNY In her debut exhibition, this young painter tries to add her own twist to the long tradition of language-based painting by inserting familiar words and phrases into fields of bright, shiny monochrome color. ''Yes,'' ''Now'' and ''Halleluiah,'' spelled in blocky letters that fill the canvases, glide in and out of view, like towering neon signs seen through radiant fog Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)302-4702, through July 10. (Smith)

MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)

JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 14. (Johnson)

SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)

ARTHUR SIMMS A selection of works dating from 1989 to the present by a sculptor who uses rope, wire and junky found materials to create assemblages of uncommon formal and poetic power. Five Myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718)783-4438, through July 10. (Johnson)

'WOODS' Works made of and about wood and trees include miniature firs in Styrofoam planters by Carin Mincemoyer; conflations of Minimalist form and furniture-making craft by Richard Bottwin; a walk-in spiral maze by Leo Berk; Caitlin Bermingham's oddly creepy fake plants; Eric Kidhart's faux-populist illustrations made using woodburning tools; and Justin Witte's white-on-white cartoon visions of bizarre woodland activities. D.u.m.b.o. Art Center, 30 Washington Street, Brooklyn, (718)694-0831, through July 10. (Johnson)

Last Chance

CHAN CHAO: 'ECHO' Tension between the clinical and the voyeuristic animates high-definition portraits of attractive nude woman by a photographer known for portraits of young Burmese rebel soldiers. Yancy Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

MARY ANN CURRIER With a satiny, soft-edged touch and an intense attention to texture, light and detail, this 78-year-old Louisville, Ky.-based painter gives dying roses a vivid and slightly weird tangibility. Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212)628-9760, closing today.(Johnson)

MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, closing today. (Smith)

JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE-SMITH: 'CONNECTIONS' Ms. Quick-to-See-Smith is widely known for blending Modernist style, Native American themes and symbols and politics. The most impressive work in this selection of recent and older works is a protest against war: a cartoonish, brusquely painted, mural-scale picture of a canoe loaded with infernal images from Indian, Mexican and Medieval European cultures as well as figures from Picasso's ''Guernica.'' Flomenhaft, 547 West 27th Street, (212)268-4952, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

THOMAS SCHUTTE: 'ONE MAN HOUSES' Models of small, modernistic houses meant to be built full-size by collectors, who buy them and furniture made from hollow-core doors, reflect on design and consumerism but with less formal interest and conceptual wit than do the works of Andrea Zittel or Jorge Pardo. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)

'SURFACE' This engaging exhibition presents paintings and drawings that possess notable surface qualities ranging from glossy to crusty as well as Pop Art tendencies. Participants include Aaron Parazette, Torben Giehler, John Wesley, Chris Kysor, Andrew Masullo and more than 25 others. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, closing today.(Johnson)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI, 'AFRO-MUSES,' closing on Sunday. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500.

HEADLINE: Change Hits the Beach

BYLINE: By LOUISE TUTELIAN

 BODY:
PERHAPS you've heard of party-hearty Wildwood, the blue-collar Jersey Shore town of prom-night flophouse motels, dance-till-dawn nightclubs and roving packs of teenagers prowling the boardwalk. You know, Wildwood: seedy cousin of tonier towns like Stone Harbor and Avalon and traditional rite-of-passage spot for millions of East Coast young people in search of beach days and boogie nights. 
 But what about the Wildwood of Adrienne and Richard Castellano, whose townhouse, bought just two years ago for $350,000, is on the market for $650,000? (And they're likely to get it.)
 Where 65 old hotels and motels have been bulldozed in the last two years, clearing the way for 3,275 new condominiums and town houses ranging in price from $325,000 to $2 million? Where almost 1,000 properties, new and old, are at this moment on the market, with every owner trying to make a profit? 
 ''You can say that there is literally some kind of development on just about every single street,'' said Patrick Rosenello, executive director of the Wildwoods Boardwalk Special Improvement District and president of the City Council of North Wildwood. As if to confirm his words, rows of contractors' trucks were lined up one recent Saturday at Mr. D's Steaks on New Jersey Avenue, the main commercial street, while all over town, the staccato of pneumatic drills and humming of buzz saws competed with the screeching of seagulls. 
 Wildwood, a beach resort that last peaked sometime around 1960, is being discovered by vacation-home buyers from the New York City area. Sold or priced out of resort towns farther north, they are making the three-hour drive to this five-mile-long barrier island just north of Cape May. Among lifelong residents and newcomers alike -- and certainly among those who follow the real estate market -- there is a sense that Wildwood is being transformed. 
 ''It's a great vacation spot for my family,'' said Mrs. Castellano. She and her husband take their teenage son and daughter to Wildwood from their home in Verona, N.J. ''The beach is gorgeous, and we bought a boat that's being delivered this week. We love it here.'' Now the Castellanos are ready to trade up to a house closer to the beach.
 From the beach to the bay, old homes are being razed to make way for new construction in the three towns that make up the island, the City of Wildwood in the island's center, and the boroughs of North Wildwood and Wildwood Crest. Billboards of architectural drawings fill empty lots. In all, more than 3,000 new houses and apartments have been built since the boom began in 2000, said Michael Preston, manager of the Joint Construction Commission of the Wildwoods, which issues building permits for new construction and for renovations, additions and improvements to existing buildings. ''There is no sign of it slowing down at all,'' Mr. Preston said. 
 The new housing is coming in all shapes and sizes, from one-room ''condotel'' units (essentially hotel rooms with kitchenettes), to town house and high-rise condominiums to single-family homes. K. Hovnanian, a development company based in Red Bank, N.J., built the Tides at Seaboard Pointe, a 96-unit condo complex in North Wildwood, last year, and has purchased an aging landfill in hope of putting 200 homes on it. Belldons Coastal Colors on the beach in Wildwood Crest is a $65 million condo complex where prices now start at $719,000.
 Douglas Jewell of Jewell Real Estate Agency in Wildwood Crest estimated that nearly half of the shoppers now looking for Wildwood vacation homes are from northern New Jersey and New York, compared with 25 percent just a couple of years ago. 
 Justine and Ken LePino of Armonk, N.Y., bought a three-bedroom condominium at Coastal Colors last year, their second purchase in Wildwood, because they needed more room and were convinced that the community was on the upswing. Mrs. LePino said she saw ''more people with families now, and fewer kids with multiple piercings on the boardwalk.'' 
 MANY of the new buyers are purchasing properties as investments, hoping to offset some mortgage costs with rental income for at least part of the season. ''For $325,000 in Wildwood, you can still get a basic three-bedroom, two-bath condominium, close to the beach but with no upgrades,'' Mr. Jewell said. A similar property farther north on the New Jersey Shore could easily cost twice that. 
 Philip Eitman, who works for a mortgage company in Essex County, N.J., completed about 100 mortgages for clients who were buying property in the Wildwood area in the past two years. Last year, he bought a three-bedroom condominium. ''Many of my clients were telling me about the real estate values that could be obtained,'' Mr. Eitman said. ''I went down to look and was completely blown away.'' 
 Wildwood's beach is exceptional, up to a quarter-mile wide in some places, clean, protected and free to all comers. But there's also that boardwalk, two miles long and as honky-tonk as ever. It's still the home of henna tattoo parlors, carnival game barkers, monster truck rides, palm readers, paintball with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as targets and screamingly terrifying rides. The entire panorama is perfumed by pizza, French fries and funnel cake. Summer crowds, intense all over the island as the population climbs to 250,000 from 13,000 year-round, can be daunting.
 Redevelopment may already have peaked in North Wildwood, home of many year-round residents, and Wildwood Crest, always the most sedate of the three towns, probably because no liquor is sold there. It is in the City of Wildwood, boardwalk central and the tacky home of all-you-can-eat buffets (''100 Feet of Food'') and nightspots like the M.T. Bottle House, home of the Original Bud Light Beer Pong, that the main redevelopment is now taking hold, creating some odd juxtapositions. The newly rebuilt convention center sits on the boardwalk in the shadow of the Great White classic coaster at Morey's Pier, while in an empty lot across the street, front-end loaders wait for construction to start on a 25-story condominium and hotel complex. 
 This is where developers predict that property appreciation will be highest, although the boarded-up stores and hoagie shops around the corner from some new homes may suggest a need for caution. 
 Rich Shakarjian, a salesman for K. Hovnanian, likened the market to a baseball game. ''In Wildwood Crest, it's the ninth inning,'' he said. ''In North Wildwood, it's the fourth inning, and in Wildwood itself, it's only the second inning.'' When that game will end is anyone's guess; forecasts range from another year to at least five or six. 
 Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Economy.com, a research company based in West Chester, Pa., is less sanguine, noting that the low mortgage rates fueling the housing boom may rise and that speculators may be inflating the vacation-home market. ''In places like Wildwood, the recent gain in prices has been exceptionally strong, putting it at risk for a more substantial correction,'' she said. ''This is particularly true given what I suspect is a strong investor component in the market.''
 THE center of Wildwood also holds the island's architectural claim to fame, a ''doo-wop district'' of past-their-prime hotels, motels and restaurants that call the Jetsons to mind with their swooping curves and turquoise and fuchsia color schemes. (Despite the demolitions, the island still has 250 hotels and motels, with 8,000 rooms, said John Siciliano, executive director of the Greater Wildwoods Tourism, Improvement and Development Authority.) 
 Deep within the doo-wop are harbingers of what many hope will be an upscale future. The Blue Olive, its gigantic chrome martini glass lighted in neon outside, is a plush martini bar on Atlantic Avenue that offers osso buco Milanese with saffron risotto for $29.50 and chocolate-crusted coconut cream parfait for $7.50. Donna Vassallo Schlaner and her husband, John Schlaner, a graduate of the American Academy of Chefs, opened the restaurant in early May. ''We had two couples from New York here who said Wildwood needs more restaurants like this,'' said Ms. Vassallo Schlaner. ''We're incredibly encouraged.'' A few blocks away are Juan Pablo's Margarita Bar and Restaurant, a hot spot for tropical drinks and tapas; the Pacific Grill; and the MagicBrain Cyber Cafe. Amid the T-shirt shops, Carli Quinn, the young owner of Lula, a clothing boutique on Pacific Avenue, carries Frankie B jeans starting at $120. Some streets have new sidewalks, lampposts, and street signs in the shape of rockets with brightly colored fins -- more homage to doo-wop. 
 Ethel Wager, who works at the Information Center on the Boardwalk, sold her home in Wildwood and moved to another part of the island. She said the buyers knocked it down and built two duplexes. 
 In North Wildwood, too, many year-round residents were seduced by builders' offers for their homes and have moved inland. 
 Nancy and Bill Moncrief, owners of the Candlelight Inn, a 10-room bed-and-breakfast in North Wildwood, do not criticize locals who take the money and run, but lament the loss nevertheless. ''We hate to see perfectly good homes knocked down,'' said Mrs. Moncrief, a dish towel slung over her shoulder as she prepared for weekend guests. ''I like the diversity of the houses, built in different eras. When it's all cookie-cutter, you lose something.'' 
 Anthony Melchiorre, a lifeguard and year-round resident, echoed her thought. ''People are tearing down the old quaint houses with widow's walks along Atlantic Avenue and it's kind of sad,'' he said. ''It's going to be good for business, but if you lose the soul of the town, what good is that?'' 
 Even bayside West Wildwood, which can be reached only by a wooden bridge, has some people seeing dollar signs. Real estate agents are calling the area a sleeper for savvy buyers. Locals call it Wet Wildwood, since it floods in storms. Douglas Jewell sees the section as ''essentially a gated community without the gate'' because of the bridge. That's a stretch for a part of town that has clotheslines and cars up on blocks.
 Mr. Jewell is undaunted. Apparently operating under the principle of ''If you build it, they will come,'' he plans to erect million-dollar homes there within three years.

HEADLINE: Bank of America to Buy MBNA, A Prime Issuer of Credit Cards

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Seeking to grab a bigger share of consumers' business by becoming a powerhouse in credit cards, the Bank of America Corporation announced plans yesterday to acquire the card giant MBNA for $35 billion in cash and stock.
 The deal represents a bet by Bank of America that consumer spending will remain robust. This could be a risky assumption if rising interest rates leave consumers feeling financially pressed, causing growth to slow sharply in businesses like home lending and credit cards, which have been particularly profitable for banks in recent years. 
 Announcement of the transaction also comes on the heels of a security breach that may have put the credit card account data of as many as 40 million customers at risk.
 Bank of America, already the nation's second-biggest banking company in assets, would leapfrog Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase to become the country's largest credit card issuer, with a 20 percent share of the market. 
 For MBNA, the merger offers access to Bank of America's coast-to-coast network of branches to attract new customers. MBNA grew into the country's third-largest card issuer without a retail network. 
 ''The one thing that made our partnership an easy choice is the convenience and reach of Bank of America,'' Bruce L. Hammonds, MBNA's chief executive, said in announcing the deal in New York yesterday.
 ''We recognized that our limited product set would make it difficult for us to compete in the future,'' Mr. Hammonds wrote in a letter to MBNA employees. ''Being part of Bank of America gets us to where we need to be overnight.''
 Under the deal, Mr. Hammonds will become the head of Bank of America's credit card operations. It will mean a very rich payday: he could receive some $154.5 million even before he starts, according to Brian Foley, an executive-compensation consultant in White Plains. Mr. Hammonds can expect about $19.5 million in severance pay, assuming that the deal prompts a change-in-control agreement with MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del. 
 The merger will also free up about $110 million in stock options and restricted stock, Mr. Foley said. And Mr. Hammonds is entitled to a pension worth nearly $25 million, provided he is paid immediately and not when he reaches retirement. 
 An MBNA spokesman did not return calls seeking comment yesterday. 
 For its part, Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., is acquiring a portfolio made up of the lowest-risk borrowers in the industry. MBNA's strength is in marketing to affinity groups like college alumni and professional associations, whose members typically carry higher balances and pay their bills on time. 
 ''We think these strategies complement each other,'' Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said in New York. ''We are getting marketing expertise that we didn't have before. We are getting something else beyond a card portfolio.''
 While MBNA has been an industry leader, it has also come under fire for some practices. Last year, it was criticized by consumer groups for invoking small-print clauses in contract agreements that allowed it to double or triple interest rates it charged cardholders with little or no warning.
 Consumers' ire was raised further after MBNA started switching customer accounts to American Express without the card holders' permission, a tactic not unlike the ''slamming'' practices of some long-distance telephone companies in the 1990's.
 Another worry for Bank of America involves an estimated $15 billion in credit card loans that MBNA carries for rival banks, including Wachovia.
 Bank of America forecasts there could be a decline of about 7 percent in revenue from MBNA over the next couple of years as rivals withdraw card operations.
 But by eliminating 6,000 jobs and otherwise reducing costs, Bank of America estimates that the acquisition will begin adding to its bottom line in 2007. The bank said it would take a $1.3 billion charge after taxes as a result of the acquisition.
 The deal comes at a time of consolidation in the industry and may herald the end of the stand-alone credit card company. In early June, Washington Mutual said it would pay $6.45 billion for the credit card company Providian Financial. MBNA was close to a deal with Wachovia just two weeks ago. With yesterday's announcement, the 10 largest card issuers control about 87 percent of the market, according to The Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter.
 Until the merger is completed late this year, cardholders will notice no changes to their accounts. Even then, it is unclear just what Bank of America, a major issuer of Visa cards, will do with MBNA's MasterCard and American Express accounts. ''We do not know yet when the new cards will be issued,'' a Bank of America spokesman, Peter McKillop, said.
 Some consumer advocates worry that having fewer issuers could eventually hurt customers. ''Competition has kept the industry in check and has really driven these zero percent and low interest rate offers,'' said Curtis Arnold, founder of CardRatings.com, an information Web site for consumers. ''Competition is really going to be stifled when you put two of the largest issuers together. I can't see how it can be a positive for consumers.''
 The remaining big card companies, Capital One and Discover, which Morgan Stanley is evaluating for a possible spinoff, are likely targets for banks seeking to expand credit card businesses. Some analysts now suggest that Capital One, and possibly American Express, could be next on the auction block.
 ''The boardrooms at Capital One and American Express have to be humming to figure out how they fit into the new landscape,'' said David Hendler, a senior analyst with CreditSights, a securities research firm in New York. ''If you are never going to make it to the size of the elite guys, then you are really a target.''
 Shares of MBNA surged 24 percent yesterday, to $26.16, while Bank of America fell $1.30, to $45.61. The offer of $27.50 a share represented a fairly rich premium, about 30 percent, over MBNA's closing price on Wednesday. MBNA stockholders will receive 0.5009 Bank of America share, valued around $23.375 each, as well as $4.125 a share in cash.
 This would not be the first time Mr. Lewis has been accused of overpaying for an acquisition and has faced skeptics worried about his ability to integrate large financial institutions. He had big shoes to fill after succeeding the legendary acquirer Hugh L. McColl Jr., who retired in April 2001. In 1998, Mr. McColl was the driving force in the $60 billion combination of NationsBank and BankAmerica, a deal that made the merged company a national power.
 Two years ago, Mr. Lewis was criticized and Bank of America's stock tumbled in the weeks after it announced a $47 billion takeover of FleetBoston. Yet today, that deal is viewed as one of the more successful bank takeovers in recent history.
 With the FleetBoston acquisition largely behind it, Bank of America has been looking for ways to grow. Buying another United States-based bank, though, is not really an option as the company is bumping up against regulatory limits on the deposits a single bank can hold.
 That leaves Bank of America essentially three avenues for growth: It can acquire overseas financial institutions, it can buy an investment bank, or it can increase its credit card holdings.
 Two weeks ago, it announced plans to extend its overseas reach by acquiring a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank for $2.5 billion.
 Yesterday's deal doubles the number of credit card accounts it holds and significantly increases its reliance on consumer lending.
 Amid the recent turmoil at Morgan Stanley, some analysts hoped that Bank of America might acquire the firm to bolster its investment banking. Mr. Lewis said the bank needed to digest this acquisition before it considered others. ''We never want to paint ourselves in the corner,'' he said, ''but there is very low probability that we will do another deal in the next 12 to 18 months.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Suitors Nothing New in U.S. Oil Patch 

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
Members of Congress opposed to a Chinese bid to take over the California-based energy company Unocal built broader support yesterday for their campaign to block the deal on the ground that it could threaten national and energy security in the United States.
 But China is not the first foreign country to seek American energy assets. Indeed, oil industry analysts say that the effort by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to outbid Chevron for Unocal appears to pose less risk of generating domestic shortages or other energy-security headaches than other foreign acquisitions that have been approved by the government.
For more than two decades, the United States has not blocked acquisitions of energy properties by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, France, Norway and Brazil, among others. Some of those deals, particularly Venezuela's purchase of Citgo, involve access to oil supplies vulnerable to disruption because they feed refineries and thousands of American gasoline stations. 
 By contrast, Unocal has few strategic oil assets in the United States. The company, based in El Segundo, Calif., does not have refineries or gasoline stations, having sold them eight years ago. In fact, the real prizes -- more than half of Unocal's production and reserves -- that Chevron and the Chinese are after lie in Asia, particularly in Indonesia and Thailand. 
 ''The assets involved in the Unocal transaction are not of the scale or geographic location to make them of critical importance to U.S. energy security,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston. ''Many of the important Unocal assets are actually located in Asia, and the energy produced there would never flow to the United States.''
 Still, the bid has prompted strong debate in Washington. Yesterday, Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, a Democrat of Michigan, won House passage of her amendment to the annual appropriations bill prohibiting the Treasury Department from recommending the sale of Unocal to Cnooc. 
 And last night, the House approved, by a vote of 398 to 15, a resolution stating that Chinese ownership of Unocal would ''threaten to impair the national security of the United States'' and that approval by Unocal's board of the bid should result in a ''thorough review'' by President Bush.
 The resolution was presented by Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of California, whose district includes Unocal's headquarters. In his resolution, Mr. Pombo cited concerns about oil exploration technologies that have ''dual use'' in commercial and military applications. 
 ''We cannot afford to have a major U.S. energy supplier controlled by the Communist Chinese,'' Mr. Pombo said on the House floor. ''If we allow this sale to go forward we are taking a huge risk.''
 But Representative Jim Moran, a Virginia Republican, said blocking the Chinese bid was a dangerous move. ''They are holding a financial guillotine over the neck of our economy, and they will drop that if we do things like this that are not well considered," Mr. Moran said on the House floor. ''If we don't let them invest in western firms, what are they going to do? They are going to invest in Iran or Sudan and make those governments much stronger than they are today.''
 Earlier this week, 41 members of Congress signed a letter to President Bush expressing their concern about the Cnooc bid. 
 The Congressional debate so far seems to neglect the fact that only one-third of Unocal's production and one-quarter of its reserves are in the United States. And its combined oil and natural gas production is only 1 percent of total United States consumption of the two fuels. It has modest production in Texas and Alaska and is involved in costly and tough-to-develop oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico.
 Foreign companies in the United States, however, currently own 28 percent of American refining capacity, up from 15 percent in 1983, according to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the Energy Department. Nearly 14 percent of American crude oil was produced by foreign companies in 2003, up from 13 percent 20 years ago. Foreign firms doubled their share of natural gas production in that period, to 12 percent, the Energy Department said.
 United States securities regulators on Wednesday gave final clearance to Chevron's offer, leaving Cnooc just six weeks to convince Unocal's board that its own bid for Unocal is superior. Chevron says it will move to call a shareholder vote in August.
 Peter J. Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, said in an interview last week that Chevron believed that Cnooc might ''strategically focus'' Unocal's oil and natural gas assets toward China, potentially restricting supply to the rest of Asia. Since oil prices are determined by global supply and demand, China's acute needs could affect prices everywhere. But analysts say any lost Unocal production would be too small to shift prices much -- or cause any global oil shock. Unocal's production and reserves in the United States could not be easily redirected. For decades the United States government has restricted exports of crude oil from the 48 continental states, since the United States must import well over half of its oil from abroad. Then, from 1973 to 1995, it restricted exports of Alaskan crude oil. Declining production on the North Slope of Alaska and a public outcry against exporting any American oil have discouraged oil companies, including the British giant BP, from sending much Alaskan crude abroad since then, Energy Department officials said.
 Some of those opposed to a Cnooc deal, including executives at Chevron, have said China should be prevented from buying the American company because the Chinese do not ''play fair'' on oil deals and because the Chinese government is backing Cnooc's bid with low-interest loans. 
 ''You don't enter China unless it is on terms favorable to the Chinese,'' said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, an energy consultancy in Washington. ''Chinese companies are clearly advantaged.'' While potential for oil in China is not on the world scale of countries in the Middle East or around the Caspian Sea, several companies, including Chevron, have been operating in China for many years. According to BizChina, a Chinese newspaper, China's oil industry has attracted more than $7 billion in foreign investments since 1982. Indeed, Chevron is a partner with the Chinese in two medium-size deals with Cnooc. Buying a majority stake in a Chinese company, however, would be difficult, if not impossible. While no major oil company has tried, Cnooc is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, which has shown no interest in selling. Some of the United States' long-time energy partners have more restrictive access to their markets than China does. Mexico's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Mexico, or Pemex, does not allow outside foreign investment in Mexico's oil sector. Despite that, Shell Oil's American subsidiary was allowed to sell 50 percent of its 215,900-barrel-a-day refinery in Deer Park, Tex., to Pemex in 1993. Shell still operates the facility with Mexican involvement.
 One of the most delicate links in the energy chain right now are the refineries. A fire, accident or government decision to restrict supply to an American-based refinery could affect gasoline or other fuel prices fairly quickly. One of the biggest foreign owners of refining assets is Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company of Venezuela, which acquired the American oil company Citgo in the 1980's. Today it owns six American refineries and sells gasoline at more than 13,000 gasoline stations, making it the fourth-largest supplier of gasoline in the United States. 
 Since early last century, Venezuela had been one of the United States' most reliable energy suppliers, though those ties have frayed since Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. Mr. Chavez's anti-American politics and close ties to the Cuban leader Fidel Castro have irked the Bush administration, and Mr. Chavez has been steadily making investment terms worse in Venezuela for foreign companies.
 Three years ago, oil workers staged a strike trying to force Mr. Chavez from office. Citgo struggled for several weeks to obtain the crude oil it needed from Venezuela to feed its American refineries. Creditors lowered Citgo's credit ratings, creating a cash squeeze for the company. The uncertainty contributed to soaring gasoline prices, which rose 37 cents a gallon in the United States during the three-month strike, according to government figures.
 ''When it comes to national security, exploration and production assets are immaterial compared to refining assets,'' said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, a brokerage firm that recommends both Unocal and Chevron stock, which Mr. Gheit also owns in his account. ''If anything happened to refining capacity anywhere, the impact would be global and almost immediate.''
 The reason is that refining capacity is tight, especially in the United States, which does not have enough capacity to meet domestic gasoline demand and has no plans to build any large new plants despite increasing gasoline demand.
 Saudi Refining, a unit of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, formed a 50-50 joint venture in 1988 with three Texaco refineries called Star Enterprises, later renamed Motiva Enterprises. Today, the Saudis still control half of the venture, which includes Texaco gasoline stations in the Eastern United States. Despite restrictions on foreign investment at home, the Russian company Lukoil bought Getty Petroleum Marketing's 1,300 gasoline stations in 2000 on the East Coast, including some in the New York area. Lukoil executives have said that Lukoil might eventually buy an American oil refinery.

A Delay on China Bill
 WASHINGTON, June 30 (AP) -- Two senators sponsoring legislation aimed at forcing China to revalue its currency said on Thursday that they would hold off pressing for a vote at the urging of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow. 
 The senators, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, announced the delay after meeting with Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Snow. The lawmakers said they had received indications from the officials that the Chinese were on the verge of moving voluntarily to a new currency system.
 The proposed legislation would impose across-the-board penalty tariffs of 27.5 percent on goods imported from China. Mr. Schumer told reporters after meeting with Mr. Snow and Mr. Greenspan that ''they have convinced us that the likelihood of real progress with China on currency valuation is very real and could very well occur in a very short while, in the next few months.''
 Mr. Schumer said that because of these assurances, he and Mr. Graham had agreed with Senate leaders to delay a vote until at least September.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 8, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about Congressional opposition to the purchase of Unocal by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation misidentified the company that has its headquarters in the district of Representative Richard W. Pombo, who presented a resolution saying Cnooc's ownership would threaten America's national security. It is not Unocal but Chevron, which is competing to buy Unocal.
An article in Business Day last Friday about Congressional opposition to the purchase of Unocal by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation referred incorrectly in some copies to the party of Representative Jim Moran, who opposed an effort to block the takeover. He is a Democrat.
 A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems omitted the date for the figures, which ranked health insurers by enrolled membership. The numbers were based on federal securities filings through last Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Venezuela: U.S. Companies at Fair

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, is playing host to more than 200 United States companies in a bid to strengthen trade ties amid growing political tensions between the countries' governments. Venezuela expects to drum up $300 million in business during the two-day trade fair that began yesterday at the Caracas Hilton, from companies in the agriculture, electronics, chemical and mineral industries, the trade minister, Edmee Betancourt, said. 
President Hugo Chavez said in a speech last weekend that American businessmen were invited to the fair, despite poor relations with the United States. ''The only thing we ask from the U.S. government is respect, don't mess with us,'' he said. ''Now, with U.S. businessmen welcome, let's work together.'' In a speech in May, however, Mr. Chavez said ''being rich is bad'' and ''Jesus Christ was a socialist,'' and he has called for Venezuela to move away from capitalism and embrace socialism.

HEADLINE: Five Ways to Win Back Iraq

BYLINE: By Kenneth M. Pollack. 
Kenneth M. Pollack, director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, is the author, most recently, of ''The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict Between America and Iran.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IRAQ is not another Afghanistan. Notwithstanding what President Bush said in his speech on Tuesday, our primary problem in Iraq is not terrorism, and the administration's single-minded focus on terrorism may help explain why we have not yet adopted a true counterinsurgency strategy or properly tackled so many of the country's other problems.
 Nevertheless, critics of the president who make parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are equally wrong. Iraq is far more important. Because of its oil wealth, its location in the most politically fragile region of the world, and its importance in the eyes of Arab nations that wonder if democracy is possible for them too, Iraq is critical to American interests in a way that Vietnam never was.
 There is one way, however, in which Iraq is like Vietnam: how the United States is handling it. We lost in Vietnam for a complicated set of reasons. But the most important was that we refused to use an effective counterinsurgency strategy. We focused more on hunting down Vietcong guerrillas than on protecting the Vietnamese people, which in turn prevented the South Vietnamese economy from growing and giving the people an economic incentive to support our side of the war. We also tolerated a series of corrupt, unstable South Vietnamese leaders who made little effort to connect with the people and spent their time squabbling over power and graft. 
 Iraq, however, may not be doomed to the same fate. For one thing, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari and his government are far more popular and better-intentioned than President Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam and his kleptocratic colleagues ever were. And, because the Iraqi insurgents are as happy to blow up Iraqi civilians as American convoys, they do not enjoy the broad appeal of the Vietcong (let alone the firepower of the North Vietnamese Army). 
 So it is unfortunate that we are squandering these advantages by repeating many of our own mistakes from 40 years ago, and in doing so alienating the Iraqi people and raising the risk of chaos and civil war. So how do we save the reconstruction of Iraq? Again, Vietnam -- as well as Northern Ireland and other guerrilla wars -- has much to teach. There are at least five specific lessons that must be adapted to today's cause:

THINK SAFETY FIRST -- A main point of counterinsurgency operations is that ensuring the safety of the people and giving them an economic and political incentive to oppose the insurgency is more important than fighting the insurgents themselves. Insurgencies wither on the vine without popular support. Thus the first big change would be to de-emphasize chasing insurgents around the Sunni Triangle, and to instead put a higher priority on protecting Iraqis as they go about their daily lives.
 Many Iraqis will tell you that they are less concerned about terrorist attacks than about street crime and the burgeoning organized crime syndicates, which scare them into staying home and hinder the distribution of goods, paralyzing Iraq's economic and social life. 
 Meanwhile, most of our operations against insurgents have done little but further antagonize the Sunni tribes of western Iraq. We should instead be building safe zones in cities and rural areas, and guarding communications and transportation sites, to allow Iraq's political and economic life to revive. We need to shift the bulk of our troops from trying to pacify insurgent hotspots that may never support reconstruction and toward keeping the peace in areas dominated by Shiites and urban Sunnis, who for the most part want nothing to do with the insurgency but long to live normal lives. (Fortunately, Kurdish security forces are more than adequate to police their own streets without our help.)

PROVIDE ENOUGH MANPOWER FOR THE JOB -- What is going to make or break Iraqi popular support for reconstruction is safe streets, jobs, clean water, reliable electricity, ample gasoline and the provision of other basics. Achieving these goals will require more than the 155,000 troops in the country, and it is time for the Bush administration to bite the bullet, whether by deploying additional standing forces, calling up reserves, or spurring recruitment by increasing pay and benefits (and maybe even providing a rationale that the American people would buy).
 Moreover, we need to relearn the lessons that the marines and Green Berets learned in Vietnam and the British learned in Northern Ireland. American troops need to be on the streets, patrolling on foot with Iraqis, to reassure civilians. This is the only way to create a safe ''space'' for Iraq's economy and society to revive.

LET THEM LEARN -- When Lt. Gen. David Petraeus took over the training of Iraqi security forces last year, he told me that it would take three to five years before they could take over from American troops. He is still right. Unfortunately, we have regularly rushed Iraqi units into frontline duty before they were ready to try to make up for the shortfall in our troops.
 It is not just that these Iraqi units need time to train; they need time, years perhaps, to develop command relationships, unit cohesion and a sense of commitment to the community. Another reason to have American forces deploy in mixed formations with the Iraqis in the populated areas that support reconstruction is that this will create safe zones in which newly trained Iraqi formations can cut their teeth before being thrown into the forbidding terrain of the Sunni Triangle. History guides us here as well: while conventional wisdom holds that South Vietnamese troops were virtually worthless, many units that fought alongside American forces eventually proved quite effective.

GET BEYOND BAGHDAD -- The capital has become a giant bottleneck for everything going on in Iraq. This has been true throughout history to a certain extent, but there is no reason to perpetuate it. Iraq's transitional government consists of a large number of political parties whose true popularity is unclear at best. Many Shiites, for example, voted for the United Iraqi Alliance list because Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani encouraged them to do so, not because they necessarily liked or knew much about its constituent parties. Many other political groups have even less claim to popular support. Yet, unsurprisingly, many of these parties are using their positions to secure as big a piece of Iraq's economic pie as possible and to insure that they have a lasting role in future governments.
 Perhaps the most underreported story in Iraq today is the theft of its oil revenues. Thanks to the high price of crude, Iraq should make well over $20 billion from oil sales this year, yet almost none of this money seems to be going to actual reconstruction projects. One senior Iraqi official told me recently that the theft of oil revenues today is making Saddam Hussein's regime look frugal by comparison. 
 Moreover, in their determination to snuff out competitors, many politicians have fought tirelessly to prevent any delegation of authority or direct distribution of money or supplies to provincial or local officials. This tendency to keep things centralized is reinforced because the American Embassy's personnel cannot leave the capital's heavily fortified ''green zone,'' and thus focus most of their efforts on the central government. 
 Reconstruction is most likely to succeed if it can grow from the bottom up. Certainly the top-down approach we are now employing has rarely worked in the past. We need more American civilians and international aid workers to move about in Iraq and find out what the people are getting and what they desperately need. And we need to push resources out from Baghdad or circumvent it, shipping supplies directly into the hands of the Iraqis who can help at the local level.

BUY OFF THE SUNNI SHEIKS -- There is no question that bringing the Sunni population -- particularly the tribes that are the principal supporters of the insurgency -- into the Iraqi government and making them feel that they have a stake in the system is critical to long-term stability. In the shorter term, however, we can put a big dent in the insurgency by reaching out to Sunni tribal leaders and paying them protection money.
 Buying your enemies may sound un-American, but it is a time-honored tradition in Iraq. A great many of the insurgents are Sunni tribesmen. Many were members of Saddam Hussein's security services who have been thrown out of work and marginalized under the new Shiite-Kurd dominated government. Others are fighting on the orders of their sheiks, who also feel threatened by the new order and have been given no incentive to work with us. But throughout the history of modern Iraq, these chieftains were paid by whoever was in power in Baghdad (the Turks, the British, the dictators, the Baathists) to refrain from attacking the roads and government facilities and to keep other groups from doing so. Already some prominent Sunni sheiks have made overtures to the American authorities and the Iraqi government; they are willing to keep the peace if the price is right.
 THE course we have adopted in Iraq so far is not working particularly well and it could fail altogether. To date, most of the changes offered by both sides of the political aisle amount to little more than tinkering with the current strategy. But if we're going to succeed in stabilizing Iraq and defeating its insurgency, we are going to have to make a radical shift to a traditional counterinsurgency strategy, even though it could be politically very painful. No matter what one thinks of the invasion, it is clearly in our best interest, to say nothing of the Arab world's, that we succeed in Iraq. To do so, we will have to apply some lessons we learned from bitter history.

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes New Spending To Assist Poor Africans

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
President Bush proposed initiatives on Thursday to help Africa, calling for increased spending to fight malaria, help more children attend school and ensure the rights of women.
 The proposals were the latest in a series of steps by the White House to provide more aid to Africa, partly in response to pressure exerted by other world leaders, including Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
 Mr. Blair has made addressing poverty and disease in Africa the main focus of a summit meeting of the world's major industrial nations in Scotland next week that Mr. Bush will attend. The White House has been scrambling to come up with plans so that the United States can be shown to be doing its share in the face of international criticism that it has been too stingy. 
 The president put the proposals in the context of broader imperatives for the United States, from the national security implications that stem from economic and political disorder in poor nations to the moral demand of helping the world's neediest people. 
 ''We fight the war on terror with our power; we will win the war on terror with freedom and justice and hope,'' he said in announcing the new programs during a speech in Washington to an invited audience that included African diplomats at the Freer Gallery of Art. ''We seek progress in Africa and throughout the developing world because conscience demands it.''
 Mr. Bush also made some of his strongest comments yet on the killing in the Darfur region of Sudan, as the government has tried to crush a rebel movement, saying the violence ''is clearly genocide'' and reiterating the support of the United States for African peacekeeping efforts there. 
 He outlined three new efforts to address some of Africa's worst problems. He said the United States would spend at least $1.2 billion over the next five years in an effort to reduce by half the deaths from malaria in 15 African countries. More than a million people a year die of malaria each year, most of them children and most in sub-Saharan Africa.
 He called for spending $400 million over the next five years on a program to improve the quality and accessibility of education in Africa by training teachers, providing scholarships to girls, distributing textbooks and expanding job training. 
 The president also announced a $55 million program, to be carried out over the next three years in four African nations, to help combat sexual violence against women and to address related issues of justice and health care.
 The decision to propose a major new program to battle malaria amounted to a policy reversal by Mr. Bush, who five months ago sent Congress a budget request for next year that would have cut funds for antimalaria programs. The administration sought to cut financing for antimalaria programs administered by the United States to $58 million from the $90 million enacted by Congress for this year.
 The House Appropriations Committee has already approved legislation keeping financing at $90 million for next year, and the Senate is seeking an increase to $105 million.
 Before Thursday's announcement, the United States had already agreed to help wipe out the debts of some poor nations in Africa and elsewhere, and to double aid from last year's levels by 2010 by expanding existing programs to battle AIDS and encourage economic development in Africa.
 Some advocacy groups that have been pressing the administration to do more praised Mr. Bush for moving in the right direction, even as they said they would continue to push for even more money.
 ''While the numbers aren't as bold as the words, we like his support for these heroic efforts,'' said Jamie Drummond, executive director of DATA, a group that has been pressing the administration to act aggressively to fight poverty and disease in Africa. ''When the president puts his seal on an issue, it helps get more money for it, even if the president's numbers aren't that much.''
 Other experts said Mr. Bush had missed an opportunity to take bold action that would make a substantial difference in Africa.
 ''It's another step forward, but a very, very small and disappointing step in light of the hopes that something major would happen on education in Africa at this summit,'' said Gene Sperling, who headed the National Economic Council under President Clinton and is now director of the Center for Universal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations.

HEADLINE: Republican Party Is Backing Black Candidates in Bid to Attract Votes

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: CLARION, Pa. 

 BODY:
Lynn Swann, the Hall of Fame former wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, stood before a nearly all-white Republican crowd at the Holiday Inn here recently and blasted Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, Edward G. Rendell, for failing to reduce property taxes. Then, without prompting, Mr. Swann suddenly turned the subject to race -- his own.
 ''I'm not here to be the poster child for the Republican Party, to say they're being inclusive by running an African-American,'' said Mr. Swann, 54. ''That's not why I'm here. I'm here to win.'' 
 Still, to many prominent Republicans, Mr. Swann, a commentator for ABC Sports, is much more than a potentially strong contender for governor in 2006. He is, they hope, part of a new crop of prominent black candidates who could help the Republicans crack, if not break, Democratic domination among black voters in several important states. 
 In Maryland, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, black Republicans -- all of whom have been groomed by the national party -- are expected to run for governor or the United States Senate next year. Several other up-and-coming black Republicans are expected to run for lower statewide offices in Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Vermont in 2006.
 It is not clear that local Republican organizations will embrace all of those candidates, and several face primaries. But national Republican leaders have been enthusiastically showcasing those blacks' campaigns, saying that whether those candidates win or lose, the party can still gain if blacks believe that Republicans are seriously courting their votes. 
 ''You've got a Democratic Party which I think has repeatedly demonstrated that it assumes it will win the African-American vote, but doesn't work for that vote,'' Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said. ''It takes African-Americans for granted. And I think folks in the African-American community see that. There is a real opportunity here for the Republican Party.'' 
 Mr. Mehlman has been traveling the country raising money for black candidates, speaking at historically black colleges and promoting religion-based programs with black churches. He has created an African-American advisory panel that includes virtually all the statewide black candidates. And he recruited blacks to campaign with President Bush last year, including Mr. Swann, who was co-chairman of African-Americans for Bush National Steering Committee. 
 The Republican activities are catching the Democrats' attention.
 ''This is a very challenging moment for the Democrats,'' said Donna Brazile, chairwoman of the party's Voting Rights Institute and one of the Democrats' leading strategists on black voters. ''For the first time in my history, they are in my community. And that's not a pleasant feeling.'' 
 Republicans still face an uphill battle with black voters. Surveys of voters leaving their polling place show that Mr. Bush won 11 percent of the black vote in 2004. And although that was three percentage points better than his black support in 2000, it was no better than the average for Republican presidential candidates since 1964, which was 11.7 percent. (Mr. Bush polled better than that average among black voters in several swing states, including Florida, Michigan and Ohio last year.) 
 Republicans assert that their focus on private ownership, social conservatism and school vouchers appeals to blacks, but polls suggest that those issues are not enough to overcome historic mistrust of the party. 
 Still, Ms. Brazile, who managed Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000, said that, unlike 1998, when the Republicans ran large numbers of black candidates but did little to help them, the Republicans were now recruiting and training stronger candidates, helping them raise money and building ties to black institutions, particularly churches. 
 The Republicans' statewide candidates have not been champions of traditional civil rights issues, a factor that might hurt them with black voters, Ms. Brazile said. And Republican efforts to weed out voting fraud is viewed as racially discriminatory by many blacks, she said. 
 But Ms. Brazile also said several black Republicans could be formidable opponents, appealing not only to some black voters, but also to the party's conservative white base.
 In Michigan, for example, Keith A. Butler, a former member of the Detroit City Council who is running for the United States Senate, is the founder of a 21,000-member church and is supported by many social conservatives. He also has the endorsement of the Republican attorney general, Mike Cox. Similarly, the Ohio secretary of state, J. Kenneth Blackwell, who is running for governor, is the most conservative candidate in the Republican field and has the backing of many of the state's most influential Christian conservatives.
 ''All of a sudden,'' Mr. Blackwell said in an interview, ''you have folks who can move the Republican Party into being competitive in a community that has been a cornerstone of the Democratic house.'' 
 Some analysts and Democratic leaders dismiss the threat.
 ''African-Americans don't necessarily believe the Republican Party takes their interests seriously,'' said David A. Bositis, senior political analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, a group that studies black issues. ''They think the Republican Party remains a Southern white party more than anything else.'' 
 But Julian Bond, head of the N.A.A.C.P., who has sharply criticized Mr. Bush, welcomed the Republican effort. ''We're happy the Democratic Party may have to compete a little harder for votes it may have take for granted for the last several years,'' he said. 
 Republican strategists say the party does not have to win a large chunk of the black vote to achieve success. Expanding the party's support by a few percentage points in both presidential and statewide races could be devastating to the Democratic Party in swing states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, they say.
 Although many of the black candidates face primaries next year, several are given a strong chance of winning those races. Mr. Swann, for instance, opposes abortion while his leading primary opponent, former Lt. Gov. Bill Scranton, has supported abortion rights, which could hurt him among Republican voters. 
 In Maryland, Lt. Gov. Michael S. Steele, who is considering running for the Senate, would probably become the consensus candidate of the state's Republican establishment -- led by his close ally, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. -- if he runs.
 Mr. Blackwell, on the other hand, represents a potential problem for the Republicans' strategy. Closely allied with conservatives, he has clashed repeatedly with the centrist leadership of the state party, including Gov. Bob Taft. For that reason, some Republicans say party leaders might try to push him out of the race in favor of one of his more moderate primary opponents, either Attorney General Jim Petro or Betty D. Montgomery, the state auditor. 
 Here in Pennsylvania, Mr. Swann has yet to declare his candidacy formally and has not explained his positions on many issues, but he has met with dozens of Republican leaders around the state, hired campaign staff and begun raising money. 
 At two events in western Pennsylvania in late June, Mr. Swann sounded very much the candidate, attacking Mr. Rendell as a weak leader and pledging to run a fiercely competitive race. ''We need to kick him out of office,'' he said. 
 He also provided insight into how he would run, saying he would take the fight to Mr. Rendell's base in southeastern Pennsylvania, including the heavily black precincts of Philadelphia. 
 ''I think I can go into Philadelphia and I can get Republicans to vote Republican, go after the independent voter and then go after Democrats who cross over,'' Mr. Swann said. 
 Republicans say Mr. Swann would start out as an underdog against Mr. Rendell. 
 Although it is too early to say whether Mr. Swann can make inroads among black voters, he is clearly gaining support among white Republicans. After meeting with Mr. Swann, Gregory Mortimer, chairman of the Clarion County Republican Committee, said he had already endorsed him. ''He's just what we need,'' Mr. Mortimer said. ''Someone fresh, new and exciting who can beat an incumbent.'' 
 As he tries to court those white Republicans, Mr. Swann walks a fine line, mentioning his race but not focusing on it. 
 ''It's not real freedom unless you have an option,'' he said, referring to Democratic domination of the black vote. ''But I'm not trying to run just because I'm African-American. I'm running to win.''

After a bitter and prolonged battle over the promises and perils of foreign trade, the Senate voted on Thursday to approve the Central American Free Trade Agreement.
 The vote of 54 to 45, which came after weeks of efforts to placate angry sugar producers and other interest groups, was a major victory for President Bush at a time when Republicans and Democrats alike have been alarmed about soaring imports from low-cost countries.
 The vote set the stage for an even more difficult fight in the House, where opposition to the trade pact is strong among lawmakers from textile regions in the South, manufacturing states in the Midwest and sugar- producing areas like Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota and Wyoming.
 The pact would eliminate most trade restrictions on about $32 billion in annual trade with the Dominican Republic and the five Central American nations of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. 
 Though the volume of trade involved is tiny in comparison to that with China or Europe, both Mr. Bush and his opponents have viewed the pact as a crucial touchstone to the broader challenges of globalization.
 For President Bush, the agreement is important as a model for bigger trade deals that would expand export opportunities for American farmers and factories. Mr. Bush and his supporters also say the pact would provide crucial support to fragile democracies that have close economic and political ties to the United States. A defeat would have seriously impaired his credibility as the White House is entering difficult international negotiations on ending agriculture subsidies and opening up global trade in services.
 ''This is a gateway to other agreements,'' said Rob Portman, the United States trade representative. ''If this agreement goes down, it will signal to the rest of the world that America's leadership role in trade is being abdicated.''
 Critics, including most Democratic lawmakers, charged that the deal would accelerate the shift of American jobs to countries where workers earn a few dollars a day and where labor-protection laws exist mostly on paper.
 As recently as Tuesday, several Republican senators were threatening to rebel against the trade pact because it provided too little protection to sugar producers and too little enforcement of labor standards in Central American countries.
 Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the fight over Cafta had been more difficult than that over any other trade bill ''in my memory.''
 But after intense negotiations between White House officials and leading lawmakers, wavering Republicans settled for modest extra protections and heeded veiled warnings about reprisals to those who balked.
 ''Up until two days ago, I looked at Cafta and thought it would do more harm,'' said Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota who had been demanding more protection for sugar producers. 
 To placate sugar producers, White House officials agreed to limit imports for another two years by paying Central American producers not to export to the United States. The United States would pay with surplus farm products accumulated through its other subsidy programs.
 But White House officials also warned sugar producers that they could be punished for their opposition when protections under the current farm bill come up for renewal in 2007.
 ''Everything will get a fresh look in '07,'' said Vice President Dick Cheney, in a radio interview on Thursday. ''Sugar will be treated the same as everybody else at that time.''
 Sugar producers, who have been heavy contributors to both parties, are bitterly opposed to the pact because it would slightly relax import quotas that keep American sugar prices much higher than world prices.
 Democratic lawmakers, including many who voted to open up trade with China and to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, were overwhelmingly opposed to the Central American trade pact.
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, charged that the agreement offered little to ensure that Central American nations would enforce their own labor and environmental laws. 
 ''Shouldn't we be doing trade agreements with countries that have labor standards?'' Mr. Dorgan complained during the Senate debate on Thursday. ''Shouldn't we decide on behalf of American workers that we care first and foremost about American workers?''
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement and walked a very careful line during last year's presidential campaign, called the deal a ''giant step backward.''
 Democrats charged that although the deal provided tough new mechanisms for protecting patents for pharmaceutical companies and copyrights for movie and music producers, it provided little way to enforce labor laws.
 Administration officials said the pact is tougher than previous trade agreements in requiring countries to enforce their own laws. In a deal struck earlier this week with Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, the administration also agreed to spend $40 million a year to help Central American countries beef up enforcement of their own laws. But even supporters of the pact acknowledged it would have a limited impact on wages and working standards.
 ''I'm concerned about environmental concerns in these countries, and the labor concerns in regard to these countries,'' said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas. ''But trade agreements are not the appropriate forum for addressing these issues.''

Ex-Chief of WorldCom To Surrender Most Assets
Bernard J. Ebbers, the founder and former chief executive of WorldCom who was found guilty of fraud in March, agreed to surrender nearly all of his personal fortune -- about $40 million -- to investors who lost billions when the company spiraled into bankruptcy. The deal was made in advance of his sentencing, scheduled for July 13.
 MCI, the successor company to WorldCom after it emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, will also share in the proceeds from the sale of Mr. Ebbers's assets, although the company stands to receive nowhere near the $338 million that he owes it. BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1

HEADLINE: Saving Lives in Africa

 BODY:
With President Bush's announcement yesterday of $1.2 billion for a five-year campaign against malaria in Africa, this mosquito-borne disease is finally getting the high-level attention it deserves. The wonder is that it took so long. This ancient scourge is so deadly and pervasive, and effective remedies are so cheap, that there is no justification for the world's past indifference. 
 Malaria kills more than a million people a year, 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Most victims are children under 5. Malaria sickens hundreds of millions a year, leaving many survivors with lifelong problems that impair their ability to work. 
 Africa's economic losses from malaria are about $12 billion a year. The toll could be cut in half by spending only $3 billion a year for such things as insecticide-treated bed nets, preventive drugs and early treatment. Still, that amount is well beyond the means of the most affected poor African nations. 
 If Congress delivers on Mr. Bush's promises -- and it should -- the new program will provide tens of millions of dollars to three African countries in the first year, eventually expanding to $1.2 billion for 15 countries where 175 million people are at risk. At next week's international summit meeting in Scotland, Mr. Bush should work out ways to coordinate American efforts with those of other rich nations to maximize their overall effectiveness. 
 Malaria is not the only health crisis in Africa needing international attention. The economic, social and human devastation wrought by H.I.V. and AIDS is enormous. More than 300 million Africans lack access to clean water. More than 400 million lack adequate sanitation. Some 200 million suffer from intestinal worms that could be treated for just 25 cents per person. All of these issues need to be addressed in Scotland next week. Mr. Bush's malaria announcement represents an admirable start.

HEADLINE: Against Expectations, Bank Resumes Its Buying Ways 

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Kenneth D. Lewis has quietly emerged as the deal maker to beat in the banking business.
 When he became chief executive of Bank of America four years ago, he promised to steer the company away from the frenetic takeover activity that had become its trademark.
 But instead, Mr. Lewis, 58, has taken competitors and investors by surprise with big purchases. 
 ''He is a stealth deal maker,'' said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Company. ''No one expected him to do aggressive deals like these.''
 Yesterday's $35 billion agreement to purchase MBNA, the giant credit card issuer, comes on the heels of last month's $2.5 billion acquisition by Bank of America of a 9 percent stake in China Construction Bank. That purchase was the largest investment to date by a foreign bank in China.
 Mr. Lewis tackled the deals after overcoming critics who said his company had overpaid when it agreed to acquire FleetBoston Financial for $48 billion in 2003. Bank of America paid a 40 percent premium to Fleet's share price before the announcement, outbidding rivals like Wachovia, Bank One and Citigroup.
 Bank of America's shares initially dropped after the FleetBoston announcement, but they have gone on to outpace those of competitors. Its stock is up 7.8 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 2.5 percent increase for other banks during the period, according to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW index.
 With his latest purchase, Mr. Lewis is once again paying a steep premium: 30 percent above where MBNA's shares were trading before the announcement. He reached an agreement with MBNA just days after Wachovia walked away from merger negotiations with the credit card company, after determining that the price MBNA sought was too high.
 Bank of America's shares fell 2.8 percent yesterday to close at $45.61.
 Once again, Mr. Lewis shrugged off his critics. ''Let me dissuade you of your view that this is a high price,'' he told reporters yesterday. ''Think about it: you are getting a card portfolio and marketing expertise for the price of a card portfolio.''
 Mr. Lewis took advantage of the fact that two larger competitors in the credit card business, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, were preoccupied and unable to tackle any big purchases, Mr. Bove said.
 The Federal Reserve suggested in March that Citigroup should put off making any ''significant'' acquisitions for the near term while management tightens the bank's controls, and J.P. Morgan is still preoccupied with assimilating its merger with Bank One.
 Executives who know Mr. Lewis said yesterday that they were confident he would be just as successful in pulling off this latest deal as he had been with past acquisitions. 
 ''He's done an excellent job,'' said Hugh L. McColl Jr., who, as Mr. Lewis's predecessor, made his own dizzying string of deals. ''The results speak for themselves.''
 Mr. Lewis lacks the colorful personality of Mr. McColl, a former marine known for keeping a hand grenade on his desk. Mr. Lewis, who is married and has a grown son and daughter, has spent his entire career at Bank of America and its predecessors. He started out as a credit analyst in 1969, just after getting his bachelor's degree from Georgia State University. 
 As Mr. McColl expanded the company from its base in North Carolina, Mr. Lewis was behind the scenes making it all work, running operations in various sites, including Florida and Texas. Soon after Mr. McColl pulled off the $60 billion merger of Bank of America and NationsBank in 1998, Mr. Lewis rose to president and heir apparent.
 But by the time Mr. Lewis took over as chief executive, Bank of America was suffering in a slowing economy and saddled with fallout from its many mergers. Mr. Lewis promised that his focus would be internal, rather than on making acquisitions.
 ''We are changing the basic thrust of the company from an acquisition and thus, expense-driven, model to a customer-focused, revenue-driven organization,'' he told investors at a December 2000 conference. 
 Just after the FleetBoston purchase was announced, that quote resurfaced on a Web site, Bankstocks.com, run by Thomas K. Brown. Mr. Brown is an investor and longtime critic of Bank of America and its predecessors. 
 ''How could you, Ken Lewis?'' Mr. Brown wrote in a commentary at the time. 
 Yesterday, Mr. Brown repeated his criticism of Mr. Lewis. ''This is all about ego, and not what's best for shareholders,'' he said. 
 Some defenders of Mr. Lewis say that critics misunderstand his approach. 
 ''His long-range strategy is still to expand the bank through organic growth,'' said Walter E. Massey, president of Morehouse College and a member of Bank of America's board. Mr. Lewis ''has turned down many other opportunities'' to do deals, he said.
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lewis shrugged off his critics.
 ''Sure, it gives you a bit of a chip on the shoulder,'' he said. ''But it also makes you want to prove you can do it to them one more time.''

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits High Against Euro On Strong U.S. Economic Data 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar reached a 13-month high against the euro yesterday after faster-than-expected expansion in manufacturing reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates. 
 Manufacturing has now registered 25 consecutive months of expansion, according to figures from the Institute for Supply Management. 
The June increase followed six straight months of slowing growth, the group said.
 In Washington, the Fed raised its federal funds rate on Thursday by one-quarter percentage point to 3.25, as was widely expected. The increase was the ninth since June 2004 and policy makers reiterated that rates would probably continue to rise at a measured pace. 
 Higher interest rates lift the return on investments denominated in a particular currency, raising its allure. 
 In late trading in New York, the 12-country euro traded for $1.1947, after falling as low as $1.1941 earlier in the day. It was down from $1.2083 in New York late Thursday. 
 The dollar strengthened further against the Japanese yen, trading at 111.70 yen after hitting a high of 111.78, up from 110.95 yen late Thursday. 
 The British pound traded at $1.7694 late yesterday after falling as low as $1.7685, down from $1.7887 Thursday, after the British economy grew just 0.4 percent during the first quarter. That raised fears the Bank of England may step in next week and cut interest rates from the 4.75 percent they have been at for nine months.

HEADLINE: Drug Lobby Got a Victory in Trade Pact Vote

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
The sidewalk between the drug industry's headquarters in Washington and the United States trade representative's office has been taking a pounding from the wingtips of industry lobbyists.
 The work of these drug industry courtiers, who represent what is arguably Washington's biggest and wealthiest lobby, appears to have succeeded in the Central American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement would extend the monopolies of drug makers and, critics say, lead to higher drug prices for the mostly impoverished people of the six Latin American countries it covers.
The accord cleared the Senate on Thursday but faces a difficult floor vote in the House of Representatives this month. The agreement's pharmaceutical provisions are a sideshow in the Congressional debate, eclipsed by concerns of the textile and sugar industries and the labor unions that their interests would not be protected. 
 In contrast, the agreement's pharmaceutical provisions, which provide five years of market exclusivity to brand-name drugs, have been front and center in Guatemala, where poor AIDS patients have marched in the streets to protest.
 The six countries affected by the pact ''understand that the net effect of these pharmaceutical provisions will be to raise the price of medicine,'' said Frederick M. Abbott, a professor of international law at Florida State University. ''The way they have to view it is that they're getting something out of the agreement that will give them a net trade benefit.''
 The problem with such an analysis, Professor Abbott said, is that the textile employers and agricultural producers gain, but the economic benefits may never flow down to the people who cannot afford medicines.
 According to Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, the trade agreement is an example of how the pharmaceutical lobby rarely loses on trade issues, often by quietly working behind the scenes. 
 ''A voter walking down the street would never think of the pharmaceutical industry's influence in another country through the U.S. trade representative,'' said Mr. Brown, who has criticized how the industry and other corporate interests shaped the trade accord.
 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry association, is the single biggest influence group at the trade office, according to a new analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, a government watchdog group. The analysis is based on the sheer number of reports, 59, filed by lobbyists for the group since 1998.
 The reports do not have to disclose how many individual contacts the lobbyists made.
 The industry's primary interest at the trade office is protecting its intellectual property, which Peter R. Dolan, the chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb, recently called the ''lifeblood'' of the industry.
 Like movies and software, pharmaceuticals require a lot of time, money and creativity to develop, yet they are fairly simple to replicate. The industry association estimates that intellectual property infringement in 21 countries costs its members $7 billion a year. Therein lies the problem for drug makers, and the reason they are fighting a global war to protect their patents.
 In defending their efforts to extend intellectual property protection abroad, industry officials point out that pharmaceutical companies subsidize treatment for millions of people in developing countries. Bristol-Myers, for example, has invested $150 million to set up AIDS clinics and other charitable programs in Africa, a figure that does not include the low-cost drugs the company distributes there.
 The industry association also argues that extending its patent protections worldwide will result in greater access to medications by encouraging drug makers to enter those markets. 
 ''It provides certainty for companies to be able to market and sell their medicines in those particular markets,'' said Mark Grayson, a spokesman for the trade association.
 The certainty, according to Professor Abbott of Florida State, results from the agreement's ''highly restrictive market exclusivity rules which allow the originator companies to block any registration.''
 One of the most contentious provisions in the trade pact is a requirement that gives brand-name manufacturers market exclusivity for five years after a drug is registered in the countries, even if the 20-year patent has expired. A similar five-year period exists in the United States, but the trade agreement would require countries to enforce the five-year period even if the exclusivity period in the United States has already expired. 
 During that period, manufacturers who ultimately wanted to register a generic equivalent to the drug in that country would be barred from using the animal and human test data submitted for the drug's approval, a provision that critics say could delay the approval of generics beyond the five-year period. 
 By protecting marketing exclusivity, the industry says, the trade agreement would also spur innovation and encourage pharmaceutical companies to register drugs in the small countries, ultimately helping deliver those drugs to the needy.
 It is a philosophical argument that the United States trade representative's office has embraced. 
 ''Trade rules that protect innovation and research foster a system that produces the types of medicines American health consumers and health consumers around the world use and need to fight diseases,'' said Richard Mills, a spokesman for the trade office. Former Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, was sworn in to the cabinet-level trade post that runs the trade office in May.
 The issue of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals has been highlighted in the last week with the Brazilian government's threat to break Abbott Laboratories' patent for the AIDS drug Kaletra by authorizing one of its domestic drug manufacturers to make a copy at roughly half the cost. 
 The Brazilian government currently buys Kaletra for about 180,000 citizens with AIDS. Abbott Laboratories charges Brazil $2,500 a patient annually. That represents a special price break from the company, which charges $6,000 to $7,000 for the drug in other developed countries, according to figures supplied by the company. Despite the special deal his government is getting, Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, wants the drug cheaper. 
 If President Lula goes through with his threat, he would invoke rarely used ''compulsory licensing'' provisions of a 1994 World Trade Organization agreement on intellectual property. The agreement forced countries to adopt American-style patent rules for pharmaceuticals, but allowed flexibility in cases of overriding public health issues by giving countries the right to order compulsory licenses.
 Citing the Brazilian example, Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat, referring to the industry trade group, said, ''My guess is that Pharma's worry is that one of these countries will say, ' To hell with you,' and start making their own drugs.''
 Critics of the trade agreement say it sets up barriers to compulsory licensing in the countries it covers -- the Dominican Republic as well as Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The combined gross domestic product of the six countries amounts to a third of the annual revenues of major drug makers. 
 The pharmaceutical industry has also been successful in influencing trade ''priority lists'' and ''watch lists'' issued by the trade representative in recent years, according to the Center for Public Integrity analysis, released this week. Inclusion on the trade watch lists constitutes the first salvo in a trade war. 
 Last year, the pharmaceutical trade group requested action against 38 countries for infringing on American patents, producing counterfeit drugs and releasing confidential test data. Of those, 31 found their way onto some level of the trade watch list, according to the center's analysis. 
 The report for 2005, released in May, again showed the extent of the industry's influence. Of 41 companies recommended for inclusion by the industry, 32 made it onto one of the trade lists, the center said. 
 The trade representative's office disputes the analysis, however, saying the office complies with exact pharmaceutical industry requests involving the priority and watch lists only about half the time.
 The 59 reports filed by lobbyists for the pharmaceutical association do not count dozens of reports filed by individual companies. The analysis revealed that Pfizer lobbyists had filed reports about lobbying the trade office 32 times during the same period; Bristol-Myers, 27 times; and Wyeth, 19 times.
 Over all, the various representatives of the pharmaceutical association and its individual companies filed 289 reports of lobbying at the trade representative's office since 1998, making pharmaceuticals the fourth-largest lobbying interest group, behind miscellaneous manufacturing, business associations and agriculture, according to the center's analysis. 
 Mr. Grayson said extensive lobbying efforts by his industry were a good sign.
 ''If we're not doing a lot, we're not doing our job,'' Mr. Grayson said.

HEADLINE: Hot Stocks and Hooters Inc.

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
LOW interest rates are terrific if you need to finance a car or buy a house. They are not so great if you are counting on interest income to help pay the bills -- or buy that car or house in the first place.
 Certificates of deposit, the most humble of interest-generating vehicles, for example, have rates of return only as high as 4 percent -- and that's if you hold them for five years. Kiplinger's has a handful of practical ideas for earning higher yields with relative safety. ''You'll still need to take chances to earn an 8 percent yield,'' Jeffrey R. Kosnett writes in the July issue, but, he adds, ''you won't have to take extraordinary risks.'' 
While the magazine offers the usual places to find higher yields -- REIT's, bond funds and closed-end mutual funds -- in each case, the article ''Pump Up Your Yields'' offers an unexpected twist.
 For example, ''the best-known real estate investment trusts own property,'' Mr. Kosnett writes. ''But to get super-high yields, consider REIT's that dabble in mortgages by making commercial loans at high interest rates, trading mortgage debt or using borrowed money to exploit the spread between their own cost of funds and the income they collect from loans.'' 
 The article cites Newcastle Investment and RAIT Investment Trust as examples.
 As for bond funds, the article suggests looking for mutual funds that invest outside the United States. ''Although emerging-markets bonds don't pay as generously as they once did, they still yield four percentage points more than Treasury bonds on average,'' the article notes. T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond fund is an example.

EVERYTHING OLD -- One ''easy'' way to increase returns is to find stocks that are going to outperform the market. Smart Money reports this month that some investment professionals have begun fishing in a long neglected stream: growth stocks.
 It is easy to see why growth stocks, which are roughly defined as equities whose earnings are increasing faster than the market's as a whole, fell out of favor. Their performance has been awful. 
 As the article by Beverly Goodman notes, the average growth mutual fund ''has lost 32 percent since April 2000.'' In contrast, funds that invest in value stocks are up 19 percent over that time.
 But it is because growth stocks have fallen so far so fast that they are attracting attention. Many growth stocks, according to the experts quoted in the article ''The Sweet Spot,'' are extremely inexpensive. One expert says that ''growth stocks have not been this cheap in 30 years.''
 Among the companies mentioned positively by the fund managers are Abbott Laboratories, Citigroup, MetLife and Wal-Mart. Not surprisingly, given how far technology stocks have fallen in recent years, names like Cisco, Dell, EMC and Intel are also cited. 

DIVINE INSPIRATION -- As in many industries, book publishers are finding sales hard to come by, yet Business 2.0 reports in its July issue that a division of HarperCollins, Zondervan, the world's biggest Bible seller, ''has experienced double-digit growth in the last two years by repackaging the Bible, effectively turning it into a young-oriented lifestyle accessory.''
 The company has promoted its Bibles -- one version is presented in contemporary English, another has the text reworked into a ''Tolkienesque epic called 'The Story'''-- in advertising in Rolling Stone and on MTV.com.
 ''When Zondervan released its downloadable MP3 Bible, the reading remained consistent with the brand's youth-oriented sensibility,'' Georgia Flight reports. Different chapters are read by voices of different ages, sexes, accents and nationalities.

FINAL TAKE -- Chow, a new food magazine, reports that roughly 30 percent of the people dining at Hooters, the chain noted for its ''waitresses in tiny hot pants and logo T-shirts stretched across their breasts'' are women. And one table in 10 has children sitting at it, reports Lessley Anderson. What gives? Hooters hasn't changed. But apparently the world has.
 ''You see so many scantily clad people these days,'' says one female Hooters manager. ''In the beginning the uniform seemed risque but not today.'' PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Big Media's Power Plays

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
THE legal battles over the future of copyright in the digital age are often cast as innovation versus the status quo, and in many ways, that's true. MGM v. Grokster is a case in point. MGM's lawsuit lives on, thanks to the Supreme Court, which decided this week to toss out summary judgments in favor of the file-sharing companies Grokster and StreamCast Networks, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.
 Whether in victory or in defeat, opponents of big media often come to the same conclusion: the inexorable march of technological innovation will severely erode the power of giant media companies. ''In the end,'' Wired News (wired.com) said in an editorial, ''the business model in the entertainment industry is going to change, and these companies can either find a way to insert themselves into the new order, or risk finding themselves frozen out forever.'' 
But media companies seem less interested in inserting themselves into someone else's new order than they are in creating and controlling their own. Most media executives by now realize that their methods will have to change. Their maneuvers -- suing file-sharing networks or inserting ''broadcast flags,'' which restrict copying and otherwise limit what media consumers can do with video content -- aren't about trying to protect hoary business models; they're about keeping the wolves at bay. 
 ''I think that the major media companies are trying to cement their control of media distribution and want to cut off competition in lots of forms,'' Wendy Seltzer, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation who argued the case for the Grokster side, said in an interview with Mad Penguin (madpenguin.org). ''So while they say that they are aiming to cut off piracy of their works, I think it's no accident that they are also striking out against technologies that can be used by anyone to create competing cultural products.''

THE SCIENCE SANS THE DISMAL -- Mark A. Thoma, a University of Oregon associate professor of economics, got some attention in the blogosphere last week on his blog Economist's View (economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview). In it, he took on Robert J. Samuelson, a political columnist for The Washington Post, who wrote a column, ''Time to Toss the Textbooks,'' which seemed to argue that because macroeconomics is a huge, complex, amorphous area of study that is always subject to unpredictable variables, its basic principles are meaningless, and it's just too difficult to understand.
 The columns assertions included: ''Economics textbooks once described the U.S. economy as mainly self-contained Globalization has shattered this model More industries face foreign competition or depend on foreign markets Savings and investment have also gone global All this alters the U.S. economy.'' 
 Nonsense, Mr. Thoma wrote: ''I hate to be the one to break it to him, but we've been adding terms like net exports to our models for a long time. Even principles books now routinely cover this, something that wasn't true 20 or more years ago. I'd guess that's somewhere around the age of the textbook he references when he writes his columns. If I thought it would help, I'd send him a new one.''

AD HOMINEM -- The technology guru and journalist Doc Searls took a look at online advertising in a recent entry on his new blog, IT Garage (itgarage.com). Almost nobody thinks blocking obnoxious pop-up ads is a bad thing. But what about software that blocks regular banner ads -- the lifeblood of free online media? Mr. Searls recognizes the problematic nature of this option, but in the end he favors it. ''This here is my browser and I can customize it any way I please,'' he wrote. The entry led to a spirited, wide-ranging discussion among his readers about the future of advertising in the digital age.

FALLING INTO BAD PATTERNS -- The gambling blog Die is Cast (dieiscast.com) features a gallery of casino carpet patterns from gambling dens around the country. ''No one demanded it, but I felt the need for it,'' wrote the blogger, David G. Schwartz. Those who opted for the $3.95 prime rib special at the Lucky Duck are advised to wait an hour before viewing.

HEADLINE: Rancher's Burden of Dreams: Staging Opera About Blackfeet 

BYLINE: By JOE ASHBROOK NICKELL

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Mont., July 1 

 BODY:
In all his years running cattle on the high plains of northern Montana and Alberta, Sherm Ewing didn't give much thought to opera. He never saw one performed, and he certainly never thought he would have any hand in bringing one to the stage. 
 ''I'm not really an opera fan at all,'' said Mr. Ewing, 79, a retired rancher. 
 But on Thursday, Mr. Ewing spent a brilliant summer evening sitting in the auditorium of the Great Falls Civic Center, watching a performance of an opera that hadn't been staged since its premiere 95 years ago. And were it not for his efforts, the work would probably never have been performed again.
 That an opera of any sort would be produced in this economically struggling agricultural town of 57,000 in north-central Montana is an oddity in itself. It has been two decades since locals pulled together a homegrown production. And while a few touring companies have passed through, opera has never been a mainstay of culture here.
 ''We have to overcome this stereotype that people have developed over what we're calling this show,'' said Gordon Johnson, the artistic director of the Great Falls Symphony and the conductor of the performance. ''It's an opera, but I don't ever say the O-word. I refer to it as the legend of Scarface told through acting and singing and lighting.''
 The story of how the O-word came back into local parlance begins in the late 19th century, when an adventure-seeking Yale graduate, Walter McClintock, ventured into Blackfeet Indian territory in Montana. He wrote a book about his experiences, ''The Old North Trail,'' which chronicled the great Blackfeet legends.
 In 1903, he persuaded Arthur Nevin, a young composer from Pennsylvania, to develop an opera based on the story of Scarface, or Poia, an outcast villager who brought salvation to his people by teaching them the importance of humility and respect for the tradition of the sun dance. Nevin spent two summers in Montana, recording traditional Blackfeet songs. By 1909, the opera ''Poia: The Blackfeet Story of Scarface'' was completed, and a concert performance took place at Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh.
 Critics attending that first performance fairly gushed in their praise. ''Arthur Nevin's Indian opera is destined to take its place among the greatest of the world's musical classics,'' a critic from The Cleveland Leader wrote.
 But no American staging ever materialized, though Nevin played the music in a private performance for President Theodore Roosevelt. Instead, the staged premiere took place in Berlin in 1910. It was a disaster.
 ''There was a scandal such as there has never been in the Royal Opera House,'' Vossische Zeitung in Berlin reported the next day. ''The public committed veritable excesses of hissing and whistling and sarcastic 'da capo' calls.''
 That might have proved the last of ''Poia.'' Nevin disappeared from the public eye after the debacle and never wrote another full-scale opera. McClintock, too, gave up on his dream of bringing ''Poia'' to the American stage.
 Then along came Sherm Ewing. In the mid-1980's, while reading McClintock's ''Old North Trail,'' he noticed a mention of Nevin's opera buried in an appendix. He asked his friend Gordon Johnson whether he had ever heard of the opera. 
 Mr. Johnson knew nothing of it, but his interest was similarly piqued.
 ''The whole spirit, the essence of this story took place right where I'm standing,'' Mr. Johnson said, gazing out his window at the Rocky Mountain Front, which serves as the backdrop to the opera. ''Well, that resonates. Something about it made me really intrigued by the whole thing.''
 Mr. Ewing tracked down a copy of the score in the Library of Congress. He paid, sight unseen, to have a facsimile shipped to Montana.
 ''I can still remember the day Sherm showed up and handed it to me,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''His eyes were big as saucers. I don't think he had any idea how much it would cost to have all those copies made.''
 Mr. Johnson played through the score several times and liked what he heard. ''There is so much glorious music in there,'' he said. ''It was really beyond me why this opera was so neglected.'' But he knew better than to think of producing an unknown opera in Great Falls. Once again, ''Poia'' was shelved.
 In 2002, organizers of a bicentennial commemoration of the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery voyage through Montana asked Mr. Johnson whether he had any ideas for a cultural event to tie to the celebration. Mr. Johnson saw his opportunity.
 ''I sort of in a shy manner proposed this opera,'' he said. ''To my surprise, they agreed to it.''
 Suddenly, Mr. Johnson found himself with an $80,000 budget and a charge to pull together an opera company for the production. He offered David Cody, a University of Montana music professor from Missoula, the position of stage director. Mr. Cody read through the score and nearly bailed out.
 ''The music had so many great moments,'' Mr. Cody said. ''But the text was so Victorian, with such dated language: all these 'thou arts' and 'thees' and such. It just seemed laughable.''
 Mr. Cody suggested an updating of the libretto, and Mr. Johnson agreed. They hired another University of Montana music professor, Anne Basinski, to modernize the language.
 After that it was a quick three years to Thursday, when 800 people descended on the Great Falls Civic Center to attend the invitation-only opening of ''Poia.'' Some came in jeans and cowboy boots, others in their Easter best. A few wandered the hall in early-19th-century garb: leather leggings, fur hats and knife sheathes.
 ''I love coming up here,'' said Jack Christensen, a Denver resident wearing a black cowboy hat and tweed jacket, ''because things always get back to basics in Montana. You can always tell the men from the women here. Nobody tries to be what they're not.''
 Maybe, but people like Sherm Ewing can still be full of surprises.

The only public performance of ''Poia'' will be given tomorrow night at 7:30.

GYMNASTICS
Hamms Focus on Education
 Paul Hamm, the Olympic gold medalist, and his twin brother, Morgan, have decided to focus on education instead of gymnastics for the next 18 months. The twins, 22, have not ruled out competing in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
 The brothers transferred to Ohio State before the Athens Olympics but did not start classes until the spring semester. Paul Hamm is working toward a degree in health and fitness management, and Morgan Hamm is studying physical therapy. They are about two years from graduating.

PRO FOOTBALL
Owens May Not Join Kings
 The Sacramento Kings will not allow Terrell Owens to play for their summer-league team next week unless the Philadelphia Eagles approve, the Kings said yesterday.
 Owens, the All-Pro receiver who is embroiled in a contract dispute with the Eagles, had recent discussions with the Kings about another foray into basketball, his favorite sport.
 But the Kings said they would not add Owens to the roster for the Las Vegas summer league unless the Eagles give their consent -- something they are unlikely to do, given Owens's value and contract status. The Kings' first game is July 10.
 Owens, a 6-foot-3 shooting guard with a quick first step, was a backup on his college basketball team at Tennessee-Chattanooga. 

OLYMPICS
Countries to Share Facilities
 China agreed to open its world-class sports facilities to India's athletes yesterday after the nations signed sports cooperation agreements. The pacts between the two governments and their respective national Olympic committees will help India receive Chinese coaching while boosting bilateral sports exchanges.
 China and India are two of the world's fastest growing economies, but their international sporting successes are a study in contrast. China is gearing up to stage the 2008 Olympics after it earned the second highest medal tally at the 2004 Athens Games. India, the world's most populous nation after China, has won just one medal at each of the last three Olympics.
 The Chinese will also help guide India in staging major games. India, which will be the host for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, has also bid to stage the 2014 Asian Games and plans to bid for the 2016 Olympics. (Reuters)

PRO BASKETBALL
Bucks Sign Bogut
 The Milwaukee Bucks signed Andrew Bogut, the No. 1 pick in this week's N.B.A. draft, to a multiyear contract yesterday. Bogut, 20, who earned college player of the year awards at Utah, will participate in the Bucks' summer camp workouts and play in the Minnesota Summer League this month, General Manager Larry Harris said.
 Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Bogut's agent, David Bauman, previously said he expected Bogut, a 7-foot center, to earn about $4.2 million in his first year.

U.S. Takes Airbus Case to W.T.O. Despite Commitment to Negotiate
The United States government took its dispute over government aid for the European airplane maker Airbus SAS back to the World Trade Organization, just two weeks after officials indicated they were committed to negotiating a solution. The United States Trade Representative's Office in Washington said it made its request on Thursday to begin legal proceedings on its Oct. 6 complaint that European government loans to Airbus amount to an illegal subsidy and should be stopped. The European Union has a countersuit, claiming the Boeing Company receives unfair financial incentives. The two governments had been trying since October to avoid a W.T.O. confrontation. The most recent attempt at talks broke down May 31 because of differences over a timetable to phase out the use of financial incentives and launch aid, according to past statements from the trade ministers. (Bloomberg News)

United Airlines said yesterday that it would submit a plan next month to exit bankruptcy this fall. In a court filing, the airline's parent company, the UAL Corporation of Elk Grove Village, Ill., detailed its timeline for filing the documents that will form the blueprint for its emergence from two and a half years of Chapter 11. United said it planned to submit two documents that would spell out how it would settle claims with lenders and other parties and detail its business model. UAL asked in its filing for the court to schedule a hearing in early September to approve a disclosure statement, which will detail United's current business and sketch out its financial model. (AP)

A union representing mechanics at the Northwest Airlines Corporation has authorized a strike vote as the airline attempts to cut annual labor costs by $1.1 billion. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association said yesterday that its members at Northwest would be sent ballots and have until 10 a.m. July 19 to cast their votes on whether to authorize a strike. They agreed to consider wage cuts last month and have proposed a package that the airline, based in Egan, Minn., contends falls short of what it needs. (AP)

The America West Holdings Corporation's proposal to merge with the US Airways Group and bring it out of bankruptcy protection did not attract any competing bids, clearing a hurdle to its planned completion in about three months. No other offers were submitted before the deadline of 5 p.m. yesterday set by Judge Stephen Mitchell of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., US Airways said. The proposal still needs approvals by creditors, the bankruptcy court, America West shareholders and the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. US Airways, based in Alexandria, Va., filed its plan on Thursday to leave court protection through the America West merger, a deal that would be financed by $1.5 billion from outside investors, suppliers and others. (Bloomberg News)

Citigroup Completes Sale of Travelers to MetLife
Citigroup said it completed the sale of its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance businesses to MetLife Inc. and will realize a gain of about $2 billion in its third quarter. Citigroup said it received about $10.8 billion in cash and $1 billion in MetLife's common shares. The $2 billion represents an after-tax gain. MetLife said it expected the deal to provide a modest addition to earnings in the second half of 2005. MetLife agreed to buy Travelers from Citigroup on Jan. 31. (Reuters)

Stun Gun Maker Accuses Newspaper Publisher of Libel
The stun gun maker Taser International Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a libel lawsuit against USA Today's publisher, Gannett Company, for publishing an article that Taser said misled readers about the safety of its products. Taser, which has been under scrutiny over the safety of its stun guns, said it filed suit in Arizona Superior Court accusing Gannett of libel, false light invasion of privacy, injurious falsehood and interference with business relations. Tara Connell, a spokeswoman for Gannett, said the company, based in McLean, Va., had not yet seen the complaint and did not have a comment. The lawsuit centers on a USA Today article from June 3, which Taser said overstated the level of electrical output of one of its stun guns. (AP)

Pfizer Abandons Development of Two Drugs
Pfizer Inc. said yesterday that it is abandoning development of two experimental drugs after they posted poor trial results -- an H.I.V. therapy that was in advanced studies and a treatment for asthma and lung disease that the company was developing with Altana of Germany. Pfizer said it dropped the capravirine H.I.V. drug because two studies failed to show that it significantly helped patients. The company will return rights to the compound to its developer, Shionogi & Company of Japan. Separately, Pfizer ended a collaboration with Altana on its Daxas drug, a treatment for asthma and a lung disorder that is usually caused by smoking. (AP)

LaBranche Names a Chief Financial Officer
LaBranche & Company, the largest market maker on the New York Stock Exchange, named Jeffrey Chertoff, a former Cantor Fitzgerald executive, to succeed its chief financial, Harvey Traison. Mr. Traison, 65, retired Thursday along with an executive vice president, S. Lawrence Prendergast, 63, LaBranche said. Mr. Chertoff, 50, is a former chief financial officer of Cantor Fitzgerald and its electronic bond-brokerage arm, ESpeed Inc. (Bloomberg News)

HEADLINE: The Lawyer Companies Love to Hate

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
SITTING in the back of a town car this past Wednesday, as his driver pulled away from the federal courthouse and headed toward his hotel in Midtown Manhattan, William S. Lerach reached for a ringing cellphone in the pocket of his natty suit. How had his day gone, asked the person on the other end. ''We went two for two,'' said Mr. Lerach, the most aggressive, feared and controversial plaintiffs' lawyer in the land. ''It was a good day.''
 No, he didn't mean he'd won two cases -- but what he'd won was almost as important. In two hearings, Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins, Mr. Lerach's San Diego-based firm, had been named lead counsel. For Mr. Lerach -- indeed, for every big-time lawyer who makes his living suing companies on behalf of an aggrieved ''class'' of shareholders -- being named lead counsel is the key to everything. The lead counsel controls the case. He negotiates the fees. And best of all, the lead counsel takes most of the lawyer's cut: 20 percent to 30 percent of whatever he ultimately extracts from the big bad corporation.
Of course you can't become lead counsel in a securities fraud case unless you're representing some shareholders who have been hurt by a company's misdeeds. And it now appears that Mr. Lerach's courting of shareholder plaintiffs has landed him in hot water with the Justice Department. 
 Late last week, a federal grand jury indicted Seymour M. Lazar, who had long been -- how to put this nicely? -- a regular in the stable of Mr. Lerach's former firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach. (Last year, Mr. Lerach and Melvin I. Weiss, a co-founder of Milberg Weiss, split the firm in two. Mr. Weiss's firm, based in New York, is now known as Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman.) The government contends that over the years, Mr. Lazar received some $2.4 million in kickbacks from Milberg Weiss for lending his name to literally dozens of stockholder class-action lawsuits brought by the firm. Mr. Lazar's lawyer maintains that his actions were ''ethical and appropriate.'' While neither has been charged, both Mr. Lerach and Milberg Weiss have denied any wrongdoing. Typically, though, Mr. Lerach's camp has been the more aggressive in pushing back. 
 The people in Mr. Lerach's camp have been quick to cast the investigation as politically motivated, an example of a pro-business Republican administration going after a scourge of corporate wrongdoing -- and a big contributor to the Democrats to boot. Besides, doesn't Mr. Lerach currently have a shareholder suit against Halliburton, one that even points the finger at its former chief executive, Vice President Dick Cheney? Hasn't he extracted so far $4.7 billion for the beleaguered shareholders of Enron, the company once run by President Bush's old friend ''Kenny Boy?'' 
 Mr. Lerach's lawyer, John Keker, said in a statement that ''Bill Lerach has done more to protect shareholders than this S.E.C. and the Department of Justice combined''-- and made ominous references to Mr. Lerach's ''powerful enemies.''
 While I have no way of knowing whether Mr. Lerach is innocent of the charges he may soon face -- or whether the investigation is politically inspired -- I do know that Mr. Lerach is hardly a candidate for canonization. For much of his career, he made his living playing a dirty game.
 He would watch for the stocks of companies to drop, especially volatile high-technology stocks that missed their earnings estimate, and then he would round up a small shareholder like Mr. Lazar and race to the courthouse to be first in line to file a suit seeking class-action status. And then, usually with little else to go on, he would essentially torture the company with discovery motions and deposition requests and legal filings until it finally settled to make him go away.
 And he was so gleeful about it! And so taunting! And so vindictive! He sued 3Com five times. Intel, too. He would tell executives of the companies he was suing, ''I'm going to take away every penny you own.'' Once when Alan Shugart, the C.E.O. of Seagate Technology, which was being sued by Mr. Lerach, started a campaign against ''abusive litigation,'' Mr. Lerach sent him a note that said, ''Dear Al: More is coming.''
 John Doerr, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has called Mr. Lerach ''a cunning economic terrorist.''
 In 1995, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, whose purpose, in part, was to put Mr. Lerach out of business. Under the new law, in order to be named lead counsel, it no longer mattered if you arrived at the courthouse first with a suit; what mattered was whether your client was a big shareholder who had lost a lot of money. The law also made it much more difficult to sue companies simply because they reported bad news and their stock prices went down. Plaintiffs' pleadings had to have some, you know, facts. 
 For a while Mr. Lerach floundered. Other firms quickly forged alliances with big pension funds and stopped filing frivolous lawsuits, searching instead for actual fraud. Mr. Lerach, meanwhile, had his own troubles to deal with, especially a lawsuit brought by an expert witness who testified for the defense in shareholder lawsuits, and who asserted that Mr. Lerach had tried to litigate him out of business. Milberg Weiss wound up paying $50 million to settle the case. 
 But Mr. Lerach eventually figured out how to make his way in this new environment. Which is why, when Enron came along, a real fraud by any reckoning, he could claim the University of California Regents as his client, and land the coveted lead counsel spot. 
 If Mr. Lerach's pre-1995 behavior shows him at his worst, the Enron case shows him at his best. Put aside his flamboyant histrionics -- Mr. Lerach surrounded by cameras, holding a box of ''the shredded evidence,'' as he called it. Focus instead on his legal tactics. The money Mr. Lerach has won for shareholders has come largely from the banks and investment banks -- including Citicorp and J.P. Morgan Chase, which recently settled with Mr. Lerach for $4.2 billion combined -- that did Enron's bidding. (And there are more banks, including Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, that will probably be settling with Mr. Lerach in the not-too-distant future.)
 Yet he has won this money despite a clear-cut 1994 Supreme Court decision that banks cannot be held liable for aiding and abetting a securities fraud -- something they clearly did in the Enron fraud. Knowing this, Mr. Lerach cleverly wrote a 500-page complaint that never once used the words ''aiding'' or ''abetting,'' but asserted instead that the banks and Enron had ''schemed'' together to defraud investors.
 Larry E. Ribstein, a law professor at the University of Illinois, called Mr. Lerach's brief ''a masterpiece: he made the most convincing case that could be made.'' By the time all the banks he's suing have settled, Mr. Lerach will have probably generated upward of $6 billion for shareholders, and he'll keep 8 percent of that. (He cut his usual fees to get the case.) 
 In his town car, I asked Mr. Lerach about the effect of the 1995 law. His answer was not surprising. ''I think the law contributed to the scandals,'' he said flatly. ''When the new law was passed, some very fine cases got thrown out. That emboldened executives.''
 To which I say, ''Baloney.'' The 1995 law did exactly what it was supposed to do. It made it much more difficult to win the kind of lawsuits that used to be Mr. Lerach's stock and trade: the ones that were never about corporate wrongdoing, but were about cost-benefit analysis. Much of the fraud now being prosecuted took place because we were in a bubble, and greed overtook fear. And strangely, the law wound up helping Mr. Lerach, because when the big cases like Enron came along, he had one of the few plaintiffs' firms with the money and talent and wherewithal to run with them. He finally got to play the good guy for real.
 And yet I couldn't help noticing that even now, Mr. Lerach's firm files a lot of lawsuits that seem to be based on not much more than some bad news and a big drop in the stock price. Eastman Kodak, OfficeMax, DreamWorks SKG and dozens more companies are facing that kind of lawsuit from him. He also has a new version of the small shareholders he used to have in his hip pocket: various plumbers' and pipe fitters' unions in places like Tennessee and Kentucky. 
 Mr. Lerach gave an unapologetic shrug when I asked him about these suits. ''We like to have a lot of cases,'' he said. ''That's our business model. It keeps you sharp. It's good training for your young lawyers.'' He described some of his competitors in the plaintiffs' bar, the ones who stick to big institutional clients and only file lawsuits against the likes of American International Group and WorldCom -- as ''living off the low-hanging fruit.''
 With that, Mr. Lerach hopped out of the car and walked into the hotel. The old dog knows some new tricks. He really does. His problem now is that he can't stop using the old ones.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Joseph Nocera column on Saturday, about the career of the lawyer William S. Lerach, who has made a living suing companies on behalf of shareholders, omitted a phrase. It said that Mr. Lerach declined to comment on a Justice Department investigation into his dealings with some former clients. In addition, the column should have noted that Mr. Lerach and his former firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, through separate representatives, denied wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: Heating Demand Pushes Oil Up $2.25 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Crude oil rose more than $2 a barrel in New York yesterday, pulled higher by record heating-oil prices created by concern that refiners will not be able to meet peak demand during the winter. 
 Demand for distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, has surged because of a growing global economy. 
 ''It's unusual to see heating oil lead the complex in the middle of the summer,'' said Jason Schenker, an economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. ''There are two things leading the heating-oil rally, concern about heating-oil supplies this winter and strong diesel demand.''
 He said a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing an increase in manufacturing in June indicated that industrial consumption would continue to grow strongly. 
 Crude oil for August delivery rose $2.25, or 4 percent, to close at $58.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain since June 1. 
 Heating oil for August delivery rose 7.5 cents, or 4.6 percent, to close at $1.7111 a gallon in New York. Gasoline for August delivery increased 8.27 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $1.6485 a gallon in New York, the biggest gain it has seen since Nov. 19.

HEADLINE: The Pot And Kettle, Both Black

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
THE sun glowered, the traffic crawled, and the bay air reeked of salt on a wound. Things were hot again in Howard Beach, and there was nothing to do yesterday but wait once more for Sharpton. Wait, wait, wait.
 Two days earlier, a young white man named Nicholas Minucci had used a baseball bat to beat a young black man named Glenn Moore, who had the misfortune to stumble while being chased out of a white residential neighborhood at 3 in the morning. If he had doubts about the honor of Mr. Moore's intentions, Mr. Minucci could have called 911 -- but that might have summoned painful memories of 9/11, when he honored the fallen by shooting paintballs at Sikhs. 
 Now Mr. Minucci was in jail, charged with a hate crime; Mr. Moore was in the hospital, with a fractured skull; and Howard Beach was in the spotlight, forced to deal with a pale approximation of that defining 1986 episode, when a young black man was struck and killed by a car while being chased by a pride of white youths.
 The Rev. Al Sharpton came to prominence by deploring racism in Howard Beach then, and now he was returning -- as sharp and as flawed as ever -- for an emergency meeting of healing with elected officials and community leaders at a Cross Bay Boulevard restaurant called Carosello. It is also an arcade.
 Shortly after noon, after other leaders had already walked through the media gantlet and into the restaurant, Mr. Sharpton stepped out of a dark Chrysler 300 -- the same model of car that one of Mr. Moore's companions was supposedly in the neighborhood to steal that night. He shook hands with a well-wishing white man, endured the shouts of an agitated white woman, pressed a cellphone to his ear, waved and walked inside.
 The meeting of furrowed brows could finally begin, but now Howard Beach had to wait for its conclusion and, again, for Mr. Sharpton. The sun scowled, the air reeked, and things began to be said and done on Cross Bay Boulevard. 
 Maria Prosa, 53, stepped forward to tell the assembled news media that she had been on her way to the beauty parlor when she saw the commotion outside Carosello, and felt inspired to defend Howard Beach. 
 ''We're not making it a black-and-white issue, so why's he doing that?'' she said. Her powerful voice steadily rose above the noise of traffic to say that Mr. Sharpton should be ashamed of himself for making an isolated incident into a racial one. 
 ''He wants it all!'' she shouted.
 Her words emboldened other women of Howard Beach to speak up. They said that this wasn't 1986, that people respect one another, and that a recent spate of black-on-white crimes in their neighborhood was receiving nowhere near the same attention. The preferred anecdote involved two black men stealing children's bicycles from a second-floor terrace.
 ''So people take things into their own hands, unfortunately,'' said Charlotte DiPalma, 60. ''Hey listen. Things happen all over. Know what I mean?''
 Sandy Adovic, 40, agreed. ''He went a little overboard,'' she said of Mr. Minucci. ''But that's about it.''
 The women of Howard Beach took a cigarette break in the restaurant's narrowing shade; their green room. An aide for Anthony D. Weiner -- congressman, mayoral candidate and meeting attendee -- kept a scorecard of media outlets present. A restaurant worker stepped into the heat to ask the crowd not to block the entrance. ''I have lunch customers; I have a kids' party,'' she said. ''The kids are getting nervous.''
 The long, steamy wait seemed to be getting to some people. Ms. Prosa ranted about the lack of diversity in Mr. Sharpton's staff -- ''Not a white person do I see in there! Not even a Hispanic!'' -- while a woman in the Dunkin' Donuts said she'd like to punch Mr. Sharpton in the face.
 SOON two young men came strutting down the boulevard with military purpose. The taller, stouter one sported a ''Free Fat Nick'' sign taped carefully to his blue T-shirt. His hunched companion just popped Dot candies into his mouth.
 The stout one handed out ''Free Fat Nick'' signs, but demurred when asked his name; he clearly desired that his missionary work for Mr. Minucci be done anonymously. Meanwhile, a young woman confided, ''I know people that have pictures of him on their dashboard.''
 When Mr. Sharpton finally emerged, then, to speak of a ''very positive and very open'' meeting, he still stood in a place where an unemployed miscreant can be seen by some as a martyr: ''Fat Nick'' Minucci, who swung a bat so that others might live in peace.

HEADLINE: Like Sharpton Himself, City and Its Fears Have Calmed Since '86

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
They came to the Rev. Al Sharpton by telephone and in person -- New York politicians looking for advice and reassurance about the latest racial attack in Howard Beach, Queens. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the night the news broke, and the men talked about the city's response. Others, like the Democratic candidates angling to replace Mr. Bloomberg, were looking for more direct cues. Fernando Ferrer, for instance, read Mr. Sharpton his prepared statement and welcomed advice.
 ''I told him I thought it was strong,'' Mr. Sharpton said after the two men spoke on Thursday. ''Just right.''
 Mr. Sharpton, who 20 years ago was the provocative force stirring the uproar that followed the 1986 Howard Beach killing, is now possessed of a different power to drive events. 
 So far, he has applauded the mayor, and drawn distinctions between the attack 20 years ago and this time, seemingly looking to calm things more than incite them. He is, in a sense, more of the ultimate insider, not the loud, outsider voice of outrage.
 Mr. Sharpton's stature, and emerging status as an arbiter of racial disputes rather than a protagonist, is not the only thing that is different from the earlier attack, and that set of differences -- a mayor who draws support from minorities, and a city with far less crime of all kinds, including bias attacks -- may well influence how long, and how loudly, the latest Howard Beach drama plays out.
 Mr. Bloomberg, polls show, does not engender the hostility of an Edward I. Koch or a Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the current police commissioner enjoys considerable standing among blacks and Latinos. The nature of the city -- ever more integrated by ever more immigrants -- has changed, and polls show that many New Yorkers believe that racial tensions are low. Crime, which made the city more of a tinderbox in the 1980's, is at its lowest point since the 1960's.
 ''In 1986,'' Mr. Koch said, ''there were people who were looking to escalate racial tensions and to take advantage of any incident and make it worse.'' He added, ''I don't think Al Sharpton today is the Al Sharpton of 1986 who wanted to escalate it.'' 
 Mr. Sharpton made clear he thought the changes went well beyond him. ''The tone of the city is different today,'' he said. ''The fact that this happened before makes all of us approach this wiser than when we were a city of strangers. We may not all be on the same page, but we know the book.'' 
 Yesterday, a second suspect was arraigned on hate crime charges, and his lawyer repeated the claim that the violent attack by whites on three blacks early Wednesday morning had been provoked by the black men.
 And early in the afternoon, Mr. Sharpton held a lunch, full of symbolism, with several elected officials in the heart of Howard Beach, emerging to joke about the relatively small number of residents who had showed up to heckle him.
 It was a scene that would have been all but unthinkable 20 years ago.
 Then, a confluence of factors practically assured that any racial events would touch a much deeper nerve. Whites had been slowly losing their majority status in the city, and felt threatened as more neighborhoods hit a tipping point as minorities moved in. Crime, bolstered by the crack epidemic, was increasingly adding to the sense of insecurity about a city out of control. And a series of explosive events -- crystallized by Bernhard Goetz's shooting of four black teenagers he thought were about to mug him on the subway -- heightened festering tensions between the races.
 The 1986 Howard Beach attack was sandwiched between the unprovoked murders of two black men in white neighborhoods in Brooklyn: Willie Turks, a black transit worker who was killed when he had stopped at a bagel store in Gravesend, and Yusuf K. Hawkins, who was slain by a group of whites in Bensonhurst while he was shopping for a used car.
 As a white enclave in an increasingly multiethnic borough, the Howard Beach of 1986 was an island in a sea of demographic change. Indeed, in 1986, voters in the district that included Howard Beach elected the borough's first black congressman. Surrounding neighborhoods, like South Ozone Park, were increasingly drawing immigrants.
 So when the car of three black men broke down one night in December 1986, and they wandered to a Howard Beach pizzeria, the stage was set. A gang of whites attacked them, and one was chased to his death in traffic on the Belt Parkway. Mr. Sharpton, distrustful of the ability of Queens officials to vigorously pursue the case, demanded a special prosecutor and would not allow the surviving victims to cooperate with investigators.
 Indeed, back then, Jim Sleeper, an author who writes about racial issues, recalled that a black friend defended the refusal of lawyers representing the victims of the Howard Beach attack to cooperate with prosecutors, saying: ''This isn't about fairness and intellectual integrity. It's about power.'' 
 That power was manifested in the appointment of Charles J. Hynes as a special prosecutor to pursue the Howard Beach case, a political triumph for Mr. Sharpton. 
 The racial maneuvering that dominated the headlines in the wake of the killing roiled a city that was in the grips of change. Sometime in the 1980's, New York became a majority-minority city. Those changes were reverberating politically, and in 1989, New Yorkers elected a black candidate, David N. Dinkins, as mayor for the first time, after he pledged to heal the city of its racial divisions.
 Now, Queens has a black borough president. And where there was once widespread black mistrust of law enforcement, that is slowly changing. This year, a majority of the latest graduates of the Police Academy are from one minority group or another. 
 In 1988, a New York Times poll found that only 25 percent of New Yorkers and 19 percent of blacks said that race relations in the city were generally good. In 2002, 63 percent of New Yorkers did, including 53 percent of blacks. 
 Since the first Howard Beach attack, the police and prosecutors, armed with new powers, have focused more on hate crimes. In recent years, at most two bias crimes against blacks have been reported annually in the 106th Precinct, which includes Howard Beach. Citywide, the number recorded dropped to 27 last year from 45 in 2001. 
 ''Race is still involved,'' said Andrew Hacker, a Queens College government professor, ''but the race I would focus on is a group of young, white New Yorkers who haven't kept up with your demanding times. They are 'losers,' and white losers have always been the sort who try to get their manhood by turning on blacks.''
 Spike Lee captured the tensions that led to Howard Beach in his 1989 film, ''Do the Right Thing.'' Yesterday, Mr. Lee was working on his latest film, ''Inside Man.'' It stars Denzel Washington as a police officer. 
 The political tone of the city has also changed. In 1986, Mayor Koch, still reeling from municipal corruption scandals that happened under his watch, denounced the Howard Beach assailants as a ''lynch mob.'' But to some blacks, his oratory was overcompensating for perceived insensitivity to minorities. Any overtures by the mayor to blacks were undercut by his mandate to reduce spending -- epitomized by his closing of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. Mr. Koch, at times, seemed to embody the polarization that characterized disputes ranging from school decentralization, low-income housing and police brutality. 
 ''There was anger in the black community because the city was cutting its budget and the people who suffer the most are the poor and the people who are the poorest are black and Hispanic,'' Mr. Koch said this week. ''Today the atmosphere is different. Even the disparity in black unemployment is much less. People feel better about the chances of success for their children. People have evolved, and those who haven't are not acceptable to their own communities. And you have a mayor who is perceived by everybody as someone who isn't interested in color.''
 Mr. Dinkins, who was mayor when tensions escalated into violence between blacks and Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, credited Mr. Bloomberg with the improved climate. ''It's a vastly different city under this administration than in 1986,'' he said Thursday in a telephone interview from London, where he was watching the Wimbledon tennis tournament. But, referring to Mr. Koch and Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins added, ''although I am not suggesting Ed was anything like Rudy in race relations.'' 
 Many say that Mr. Bloomberg has gone far to defuse lingering racial tensions from the Giuliani years. Despite the decline in crime in neighborhoods under Mr. Giuliani, the police were viewed as heavy-handed and were criticized by blacks for engaging in racial profiling. His tenure was punctuated by several cases, including the shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx and the assault by police officers on Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house. 
 In 2000, a Times poll found that only 3 percent of black voters in New York City said Mr. Giuliani cared about the needs and problems of people like them. In a Times poll completed last week, 51 percent of blacks said Mr. Bloomberg cared.
 No one can say how the latest Howard Beach event will reverberate. Mr. Sharpton plans to announce on Monday or Tuesday a march in Howard Beach, possibly next weekend.
 Despite the progress in race relations, black and white leaders said, the latest event is nonetheless leading some in the black community to vent concerns that they feel City Hall and others have not solved.
 ''People say race no longer influences the future of this city, but of course it does,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''Politicians still have to face up to race. There are black men who don't have jobs. There is crime, there are hate crimes. It may not be the same city as in '86, but race is still very alive as an issue.'' 
 C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and the only major black candidate in the mayoral race, concurred that the turmoil in Howard Beach should lead to citywide debate and action about the need for more jobs, particularly for minorities and the poor, and the persistence of racial and ethnic segregation in neighborhoods, housing projects and public schools.
 ''You can't help but notice how segregated the city is, how segregated the city schools are,'' Ms. Fields said yesterday. ''The lack of opportunities to experience each other's cultures and traditions is a real problem, and it can lead to problems like these attacks.''

HEADLINE: A Bond Maven Consults His Crystal Ball

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
WILLIAM H. GROSS, the chief investment officer at the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco, is probably the biggest single influence on the direction of bond prices after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
 Mr. Gross manages the $85 billion Pimco Total Return bond fund, the third-largest mutual fund in America. He has a hand in investing more than $500 billion in bond portfolios managed by Pimco, which is based in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 Mr. Gross had been bearish on the prospects for government bonds until March of this year, when he reversed course and started buying Treasuries after concluding that the growth of the economy was slowing.
 Even with the Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in interest rates on Thursday, Mr. Gross said that he was convinced the Fed could begin lowering rates as early as next year. 
 Last week, over breakfast at the Morningstar investment conference in Chicago, Mr. Gross discussed what a continuation of low interest rates means for investors. Following are excerpts from that conversation:

Q. Your forecast is for yields on 10-year Treasury notes to be in the range of 3 percent to 4.5 percent.

A. Believe it or not, that's a three-to-five-year forecast. We are expecting inflation at 1 to 2 percent, down from 2.8 percent. That ultimately is positive for bonds.
 There are two dominant reasons. Asian labor has been arbitraged by U.S. corporations hoping to contain wages here at home. The next big piece is the expectation that Asians will continue to buy into our markets. The Chinese and Japanese have been huge buyers of Treasuries and the demand from them is partly responsible for the artificially depressed yields we see today.

Q. If your forecast is right, what would burst the housing bubble?

A. If interest rates stay low, there's no reason there has to be a disaster in housing. But if housing prices stop going up, which would be my forecast, that makes a substantial difference. Individuals have banked on that appreciation every year. You should come to a point where owners of houses realize we're in never-never land and stop buying on a speculative basis. Markets many times fall of their own weight. That's what happened with the Nasdaq in 2000.

Q. What does your forecast mean for investors?

A. In this new world in which inflation is 1 to 2 percent, returns on all assets, from stocks to bonds to hedge funds and private equity, will be low. A lot of investors will throw up their hands and say, why are we pursuing this seemingly endless struggle to produce double-digit returns when it can't be done? We might as well buy Treasuries and sleep well. If yields are going lower, today's 4 percent rate on Treasuries will look attractive 12 months from now.

Q: What is the outlook for corporate bonds?

A: If inflation comes down it means that profits will come down, too, and corporate cash flow may not be as plentiful. That is not an ideal environment to own a corporate bond.
 That doesn't mean there can't be an attractive situation. In May we were buyers of three to four billion dollars of auto finance bonds.

Q. You run the largest bond mutual fund.

A. You pin a little badge of pride to your chest.

Q. Is it a problem for you to invest that much money?

A. It's not. The bond market is $24 trillion, so our $500 billion in total assets is about 2 percent of the whole pie. There have been innovations in derivatives. The mortgage market is so large, and then there's international markets. The European bond market is probably 4 to 5 times deeper than the U.S. Treasury market.
 I will say this. One reason why rates are doing what they are doing has to be in part self-reinforcing behavior on the part of Pimco. When Pimco at $500 billion turns from bearish to bullish, even if we move in a measured way, we probably move that market 10 basis points. You look in the mirror and say, Can that be true?

Q. I hear you do yoga to relax from the pressures of managing money.

A. I get in around 5:30. After three hours on the trading desk, I walk across the street and do an hour's worth of yoga. It's not a meditative thing, but more of an exercise thing. It does clear the cobwebs, and that's what you need in this business.

HEADLINE: After a Brief Shock, Advocates Quickly Mobilize

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER; Lynette Clemetson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
Around 9:30 Friday morning, C. Boyden Gray, founder of the Committee for Justice, a conservative group that is a leading ally of President Bush, was sipping coffee at his Georgetown residence and confessing mild frustration to a reporter for The New York Times about the waiting game for a Supreme Court retirement. Suddenly he got a text message and expressed that emotion rare for stage-managed Washington: surprise.
 ''An O'Connor resignation was not one we took seriously,'' Mr. Gray said, rushing out the door to begin deploying his troops. 
 At the abortion rights group Naral Pro-Choice America, organizers were sending e-mail alerts to 800,000 activists within 15 minutes after the announcement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's resignation. ''Don't let Bush take away your choice!'' they declared. 
 On Capitol Hill, senators of both parties quickly made their way to the floor and the galleries for a morning of speeches and briefings, hailing Justice O'Connor and trying to frame the debate to come -- Democrats stressing a need for consultation and consensus, Republicans emphasizing a need for a fair process.
 By midday, nothing less than a national political campaign had begun.
 The retirement of Justice O'Connor, a moderate who has been a crucial vote for a constitutional right to abortion, began a struggle with incalculable political implications -- for the interest groups, for the parties and for the president. 
 ''This is the pivotal appointment,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 Advocates on the left and the right, who had prepared for this moment since the last Supreme Court vacancy was filled 11 years ago, agreed that the ideological balance of the court was up for grabs. Advocacy groups bought advertising on television and the Internet, and issued millions of e-mail alerts, waves of direct-mail fund-raising appeals and pre-emptive blasts at those viewed by the groups as either obstructionist Democrats or extremist Republicans.
 ''This is one of those moments in American history,'' said Ralph G. Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way. ''No matter what side you're on, everything you've believed in, everything you've cared about, everything you've fought for is at stake. It's such a closely divided court.''
 Social conservatives saw a chance finally to translate their political successes -- the election of allies to the White House and the top of the Congress -- into greater influence on the court. They immediately reminded Mr. Bush of his campaign promise to appoint judges in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. They roused the grass roots, reminding their constituents of the court's decisions on the display of the Ten Commandments in public places, on gay rights and, most of all, on abortion.
 ''Today marks a watershed moment in American history,'' declared Dr. James C. Dobson, founder and chairman of the conservative Focus on the Family, ''the resignation of a swing-vote justice on the Supreme Court and the opportunity to change the court's direction.'' 
 Lest there be any doubt about the high expectations of religious conservatives, Dr. Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, declared, ''For President Bush, social conservatives and the senators they helped elect, the moment of truth has arrived.''
 Liberal advocacy groups found themselves confronting what they had feared and warned about since the 2000 election: the prospect of a Bush court. They called on the president to nominate a consensus moderate, someone ideologically and judicially close to Justice O'Connor. But they were preparing for something else. 
 Nancy Keenan, president of Naral, asserted that there could be no ''stealth candidates'' -- that any nominee must be asked for a position on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision declaring a constitutional right to abortion, and that any nominee must answer.
 Notwithstanding much of the rhetoric, Justice O'Connor's retirement will not end the court's majority for Roe, which stands at 6 to 3.
 But her successor could narrow that majority, and open the door to new abortion restrictions. For example, the Supreme Court ruled by only 5 to 4 that a ''partial birth abortion'' ban was unconstitutional; Justice O'Connor's vote was among the five in the majority.
 Another version of that ban, which applies to a type of abortion performed in the second or third trimester, is being challenged in lower courts and may end up before the justices.
 Justice O'Connor's successor could change the balance on other issues as well, among them affirmative action and legislative redistricting. But it is abortion that will drive many activists in this nomination struggle.
 A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court among Republicans was closely tied to their views about Roe v. Wade; those who want to see the decision overturned are twice as likely to give the court an unfavorable rating.
 Nothing mobilized the modern religious conservative movement more than Roe, said John C. Green, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron.
 ''If you talk about judicial tyranny with any of the Christian conservatives, Roe v. Wade comes up immediately,'' Dr. Green said. ''Some will talk about school prayer, but that was a long time ago.''
 The issue has a painful history for many opponents of abortion, who have felt betrayed by the string of Republican appointees, including Justices O'Connor, David H. Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy, who have ruled for abortion rights. Indeed, while much of Washington was awash in praise for Justice O'Connor on Friday, Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life Committee, said in an interview that ''Justice O'Connor has not been good for unborn children, so we do see any change as being positive.''
 Abortion rights groups are hopeful that the coming struggle will re-energize their supporters. They note that the last great surge of abortion rights activism occurred in the early 1990's, when it appeared that the court might be moving to overturn abortion's constitutional protections.
 Most Americans support legalized abortion, polls show, though many would also like to see more restrictions on it. ''This will take the issue back to the fundamentals,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works for Naral.
 This struggle over fundamentals -- another battle in the culture wars -- poses challenges for both parties. Many Democrats have tried to moderate their party's image in recent months, especially on values-related issues like abortion. Many Republicans, meanwhile, have tried to return to bread-and-butter economic issues, worried about polls showing that large numbers of voters see the party as out of touch with their concerns, after months dominated by fights over judicial filibusters.
 But this judicial campaign will not be stopped, all sides agree, and there is a sense of foreboding about it.
 ''This is enormous,'' said Senator Feinstein, one of many trying to adjust to retirement by Justice O'Connor rather than Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. ''It's different from Rehnquist. It is enormous.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rebound From Rate Increase to Finish Week Flat 

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
This week, the market only had eyes for Alan Greenspan. But that could change in the coming weeks, as investors turn their attention to second-quarter earnings reports.
 On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced, as expected, that it was raising short-term interest rates a quarter-point, to 3.25 percent. But the Fed gave no hint of halting its rate increases. Stocks dropped just ahead of the Fed report and immediately after it, as the market digested the outlook for rates. 
But yesterday, stocks rebounded, as a better-than-anticipated report on manufacturing growth indicated that the economy was weathering the higher rates. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence index was also up for June.
 Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,194.44. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,303.44, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.41 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,057.37.
 The markets ended the week basically flat, with the S.&P. 500 up just 2.87 points, while the Dow rose 5.6 points and the Nasdaq composite index gained 4.1 points 
 The major market indexes held their gains yesterday despite an increase in the price of oil, which closed at $58.75, up $2.25 a barrel. Still, investors could take some comfort in that price, which is below the 52-week high of $60.54 reached Monday. Financial markets will be closed Monday in observance of the Fourth of July.
 Yields on 10-year Treasury notes edged higher, closing the week at 4.05 percent, compared with 3.92 percent a week earlier.
 Now that the Fed has spoken, Wall Street will turn its attention to assessing what effect higher energy costs and rising rates are having on corporate profits. 
 ''Earnings are ultimately the most important variable for the price of stocks,'' said Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors, a money management firm based in Albany. ''When we talk about Fed policy, oil prices, the housing bubble or China, we are really talking about the risks to the economy and earnings.''
 Early profit reports so far have been ''a mixed bag,'' Mr. Johnson said. This week, Oracle and Walgreen both reported stronger-than-expected profits for the quarter ended in May, while other companies, including General Mills and Monsanto, announced weak results.
 But as profit announcements pick up steam in the coming weeks, investors could be pleasantly surprised by what companies have to say. Analysts have been steadily increasing their profit expectations in recent weeks, and collectively are now forecasting 7.4 percent growth in profits for companies in the S.&P. index in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, according to Thomson Financial, a research firm. 
 But when all the results are in, the growth rate could be more than 10.5 percent, said Mike Thompson, Thomson's research director.
 That growth rate is less than the quarterly increases of more than 20 percent that investors had grown accustomed to through the middle of last year, Mr. Thompson said. But it is still comfortably above the historical average growth of 7.5 percent for S.&P. 500 companies, he said.
 ''We are seeing sustained growth in corporate profits,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But I don't think the Street is excited. They want to see 20 percent-plus growth in profits,'' an unlikely outcome at this stage in the market cycle, he said. 
 Solid earnings are acting as a ''stabilizing force'' for stocks when investors remain concerned with the price of oil and the direction of interest rates, said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, an investment firm. By the fall, he expects worries about interest rates and oil prices to dissipate. ''Then you will really see earnings shine,'' he said.
 Investors will be looking to see how profits were affected by rising energy prices and interest rates, Mr. Johnson said.
 Another variable is the recent rebound in the price of the dollar. Many companies that do business overseas were helped by weakness in the dollar last year, he said. ''Now, with the dollar rising, we will have to see what the impact is.''
 Yesterday, the dollar hit a 13-month high of $1.1947 against the euro. 
 Even if corporate profits for the latest quarter are as good as analysts expect, investors should listen carefully to forecasts for the second half of 2005, said Charles L. Hill, whose consulting firm, Veritas et Lux, analyzes corporate profits.
 Currently, analysts expect profit growth of 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively, for the third and fourth quarters, he said.
 ''I am suspicious of those numbers,'' he said. If analysts end up having to pull back their estimates, that could be bad news for stock prices, he said.

HEADLINE: Fight Grows Over a Stamp U.S. Sees as Racist and Mexico Adores

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 1 

 BODY:
The dispute over a series of new postage stamps labeled racist by United States officials threatened to turn into a full-blown culture war on Friday, even as sheets of the stamp, featuring a comic book character, sold out quickly.
 Mexicans, including President Vicente Fox, argued that calls to ban the stamp, which shows Memin Pinguin, a black child with caricatured features, were based on ignorance. 
 Ruben Aguilar, the president's spokesman, said Friday that the images were not racist and that the cartoon, which is still published, was constructive. ''This cartoon helped this country to become less racist and opened a space for sympathy for people of color,'' he said. 
 On Thursday the White House added its objections to those first raised by civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
 Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said: ''Racial stereotypes are offensive, and I would say racial stereotypes are offensive no matter what their origin. The Mexican government needs to take this into account. Images such as these have no place in today's world.''
 But in an interview on Friday with The Associated Press, Mr. Fox weighed in, noting that he himself had grown up with the comic books, in which Memin, which made its debut in the 1940's, is portrayed as lazy and mischievous. The stamp shows a ''character very loved in Mexico and that has absolutely nothing discriminatory about it,'' he said.
 ''Frankly I don't understand the reaction,'' the president said. ''I would suggest to them that first, read the magazine, get the information and then express publicly their opinion.''
 Calls for the stamps to be pulled from circulation may be moot. Post offices around the country soon sold out of the stamps on Friday. There are five stamps in the series, and a total of 750,000 were printed.
 ''They're all gone already,'' said a postal clerk, raising her arms in mock despair when a visitor walked into the small post office in the Roma neighborhood in Mexico City. 
 On eBay, a set of 50 stamps was selling for $200. 
 In a country where comedians in blackface still perform on television, and nicknames like ''Fatty'' or ''Blackie'' are common, Mexicans are sometimes mystified at what they perceive as extreme sensitivity in the United States. 
 In May, Mr. Fox initially refused to apologize for stating that Mexicans cross the border to take jobs that ''not even blacks'' want. The comment led to a meeting with Mr. Jackson and a rapprochement. 
 The current controversy, however, has touched many Mexicans in a way that Americans might not have expected. As Mexico becomes increasingly dependent economically on its northern neighbor, the country's cultural distinctness remains a source of enormous national pride. 
 ''In popular Mexico, censoring Memin Pinguin is like submitting this little black boy, who has fought racism so much, to a new form of discrimination,'' wrote the columnist Sergio Sarmiento in the daily newspaper Reforma.

HEADLINE: Consistently, A Pivotal Role

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
The O'Connor Court.
 The phrase has been used so many times over so many years to describe the Supreme Court that it is nearly a cliche. Yet the simple words capture an equally simple truth: to find out where the court is on almost any given issue, look for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. 
 If you are a lawyer with a case at the court, pitch your arguments to her. If your issue is affirmative action, or religion, or federalism, or redistricting, or abortion, or constitutional due process in any of its many manifestations, you can assume that the fate of that issue is in her hands. Don't bother with doctrinaire assertions and bright-line rules. Be meticulously prepared on the facts, and be ready to show how the law relates to those facts and how, together, they make sense. 
 And it is because Justice O'Connor has played such a pivotal role on the court for much of her 24-year tenure that her unexpected retirement is such a galvanizing event. Much more than the widely anticipated retirement of the predictably conservative Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, her departure creates an opportunity for President Bush to shape the court.
 The last such defining moment occurred with the retirement in 1987 of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., whose position on the court then resembled Justice O'Connor's today. President Ronald Reagan nominated a polarizing conservative, Robert H. Bork, whose defeat by a Democratic-controlled Senate after a protracted battle still resonates today.
 A list of the issues on which Justice O'Connor has held the balance of power goes far to explain why holiday weekend preparations screeched to a halt in Washington on Friday morning as word spread of her decision to retire. 
 Just two years ago, she wrote the opinion for the 5-to-4 majority that upheld affirmative action in university admissions. Earlier, in a series of decisions interpreting the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, she led or joined 5-to-4 majorities that viewed with great suspicion government policies that took account of race in federal contracting, employment and electoral redistricting. Her view was that the government should not be in the business of counting by race.
 But in Grutter v. Bollinger, the University of Michigan case decided in 2003, she became persuaded that affirmative action in university admissions was still justified. ''Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized,'' she wrote.
 Until the pair of Ten Commandments decisions this week, which found her in dissent from the ruling that upheld a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas Capitol, she had occupied a central position on the role of religion in public life. 
 Beginning with her earliest years on the court, Justice O'Connor adopted her own test for evaluating whether government policy amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion. Instead of a three-part test that the court used, she asked whether the government policy under review conveyed to nonadherents the message that they were ''outsiders, not full members of the political community.'' 
 This led her to vote to prohibit public prayer at high school graduations and football games, but to insist on equal access for student religious publications and clubs. In 2002, she voted with the 5-to-4 majority that upheld the use of publicly financed tuition vouchers at religious schools. In her opinion this week concurring with the 5-to-4 majority that declared framed copies of the Ten Commandments hanging in Kentucky courthouses to be unconstitutional, she said the Constitution's religion clauses ''protect adherents of all religions, as well as those who believe in no religion at all.'' 
 On the other most intensely fought social issue of the day, abortion, Justice O'Connor's successor will not be in a position to move the court away from its support of the core right to abortion, now at 6 to 3. But in the court's last major abortion ruling, five years ago, Justice O'Connor provided the crucial fifth vote to strike down Nebraska's ban on what were called ''partial birth'' abortions.
 She has been a loyal ally of her Stanford Law School classmate Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in the court's continuing reappraisal of the relationship between the states and the federal government, joining the five-member majority in a series of cases that have insisted on greater respect for the sovereignty of the individual states while limiting the role of Congress.
 One of the few federalism cases in which she and Justice Rehnquist parted company came last year in Tennessee v. Lane, on whether states were immune from being sued for failing to make their courthouses accessible to people with disabilities. Justice O'Connor provided a fifth vote against immunity, while Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented. The plaintiff was a man who used a wheelchair and who had been forced to crawl up the stairs to reach the courtroom in a Tennessee county courthouse.
 To the extent that Justice O'Connor had an overall judicial philosophy, she might have expressed it most directly in an opinion dissenting from a 1995 decision that authorized public school districts to subject student athletes to drug testing without any suspicion of individual wrongdoing. The policy was justified to deal with rampant student drug use, the district had argued in Vernonia School District v. Acton.
 In her dissenting opinion, Justice O'Connor warned that judges should be wary of overreacting to such arguments. 
 ''Some crises are quite real'' but some are not, she said. ''The only way for judges to mediate these conflicting impulses is to do what they should do anyway: stay close to the record in each case that appears before them, and make their judgments based on that alone.''
 Sandra O'Connor's pragmatic approach to life and the law was probably born in the stark and isolated desert of the Southwest that she described in vivid detail in ''Lazy B,'' a childhood memoir she published three years ago. The Day family ranch, 250 arid square miles straddling the Arizona-New Mexico border, ''was no country for sissies,'' she wrote. 
 The house, 35 miles from the nearest town, had neither electricity nor running water. Her companions were horses and ranch hands, and her goal as the first-born child was to be useful around the place and to please her hard-driving, perfectionist father. When things broke, they needed to be fixed. There was little room for discussion and none for theorizing.
 Fulfilling her father's own ambition that had been thwarted by the lack of money, she attended Stanford University and Stanford Law School, where she graduated third in the class of 1952 at the age of 22. The top honors in the class went to a World War II veteran more than five years her senior, William H. Rehnquist. He went on to a Supreme Court clerkship. As a woman, she could not get a job with the law firms to which she applied, receiving offers of secretarial jobs instead. 
 She turned to the public sector as a lawyer for state and local governments, while raising three sons with her husband, John, who had been a fellow law-review editor at Stanford. The couple settled in Phoenix, where civic activities led her to a career in Republican politics. The Arizona governor appointed her to a vacant seat in the State Senate in 1969, and she later twice won election. She became majority leader, the first woman in the country to hold such a high leadership position in a state legislature.
 In 1974, she was elected to a seat on the state trial court. Five years later, Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, appointed her to the state appeals court, where she was serving when President Reagan, who had promised to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court, chose her in July 1981 for the first vacancy to occur during his term. She was confirmed unanimously, forever to be known as the first woman on the Supreme Court, or F.W.O.T.S.C., as she has put it dryly.
 Although hardly a feminist in terms of political activism, Justice O'Connor demonstrated from her earliest years on the court a sensitivity to issues of sex discrimination that she maintained throughout her tenure. 
 One of her first majority opinions, in 1982, came in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. The 5-to-4 decision declared unconstitutional the exclusion of a male applicant from a state-supported, women-only nursing school. Her opinion warned against using ''archaic and stereotypic notions'' about proper roles for men and women.
 On several occasions, including this year, she joined the four more liberal justices to uphold a broad interpretation of a federal statute addressing sex discrimination. In 1999, for example, she wrote the opinion for a 5-to-4 majority in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, holding public school districts accountable for one student's sexual harassment of another student. 
 And during the term that just ended, she wrote the majority opinion in another 5-to-4 decision, Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, that expanded the scope of the sex discrimination law known as Title IX to provide protection against retaliation for whistle-blowers who complain about discriminatory practices in schools and colleges.
 One exception came in 2000, when she joined Chief Justice Rehnquist's 5-to-4 majority opinion in United States v. Morrison, invalidating a provision of the Violence Against Women Act on the ground that Congress had lacked the constitutional authority to enact the law.
 The most famous, or notorious, 5-to-4 opinion in 2000 was, of course, Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount and effectively called the presidential election for George W. Bush. Justice O'Connor joined the unsigned opinion that declared the conditions of the recount to violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.
 While Mr. Bush was undoubtedly pleased by that decision, he was just as undoubtedly displeased last year when the court refused to accept his administration's position that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the open-ended detention of those being held both at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in military custody in the United States.
 ''A state of war is not a blank check for the president,'' Justice O'Connor wrote for the court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. She said ''history and common sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression and abuse of others.'' In a second case decided at the same day last June, Rasul v. Bush, she joined the majority opinion extending federal jurisdiction to the Guantanamo detainees.
 During the term that ended on Monday, Justice O'Connor was on the losing side in two major cases: Kelo v. City of New London, which upheld governmental power to use eminent domain for economic development, and Gonzales v. Raich, upholding the federal government's power to enforce federal drug laws in states that permit marijuana to be used for medical purposes.
 Justice O'Connor learned she had breast cancer early in the court's 1988 term and underwent a mastectomy and follow-up treatment. She never missed a day that the court was on the bench, and only years later did she reveal publicly, in a talk to other cancer survivors, how stressful the period had been. She also bounced back quickly from an emergency appendectomy. 
 In recent years, she has maintained an active schedule of public speaking and foreign travel, in addition to writing two books. It was her husband's deteriorating health, not her own brushes with illness, that finally wore down a woman who still proudly refers to herself as a cowgirl.
 ''She has taught us all,'' her friend and colleague Stephen G. Breyer said Friday in a statement released by the court.

HEADLINE: Cutting the Losses From Outsourcing

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
OUTSOURCING will inevitably eliminate many more American jobs, says Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
It's time for the federal government to take action to limit the damage, says Professor Hira, co-author with Anil Hira of ''Outsourcing America: What's Behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs'' (American Management Association, $22). Here are excerpts from a conversation.

Q. Will more jobs be lost offshore?

A. We're just at the beginning of this trend, particularly in the services area. The manufacturing sector is much more mature, but in the services area we're just scratching the surface.

Q. What jobs are likely to move next?

A. Information technology jobs and call-centers jobs were the first movers. Now it's snowballing in industries that are information intensive. Companies in insurance and financial services, in particular, have seen that I.T. operations can be successfully offshored. Because of that, they're beginning to think about types of other jobs like claims processing or financial analysis. We're also seeing it in engineering and design.

Q. How can this trend be stopped?

A. There's nothing that can be done to stop it. The question is, how do we adapt to it and deal with the negative effects? Nobody has done anything on the policy front. We've more or less ignored it. We need to take some steps to deal with this new reality.
 Some steps are pretty much no-brainers, like extending trade-adjustment assistance to service workers. If you lose your job in manufacturing because of trade, you get extended unemployment insurance. You get training and health benefits so that you can ''adjust,'' as economists put it -- so that you can find a new job in a different occupation. We do that for manufacturing workers, although the plan is underfunded, but we don't do it for service workers. Congress decided to kill that bill last year, and the reason was that we couldn't afford it, which is surprising. 

Q. How well do retraining efforts work?

A. Most people think retraining doesn't work very well. We need to start experimenting with free training programs right away because there is a new class of workers who are being displaced. They are no longer blue-collar workers. These workers have degrees, sometimes advanced degrees, in computer science or engineering.
 Over the longer term, we need basic things like gathering some data. The Department of Commerce spent $335,000 to do one outsourcing study, and that hasn't been released yet. When the government spends almost $1 trillion a year, it's pretty surprising they can't come up with more money to study this problem.

Q. Should companies face penalties for eliminating jobs?

A. There's a reasonable case to be made to extend the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to these situations. The idea is to give some advance notification to workers that they're going to be laid off. That gives those workers enough time to begin the adjustment process. Companies don't like this. It's in their self-interest to keep it secret until the end. Companies would look at extending the WARN Act as a penalty. I would look at that as smart economics.

Q. You suggest that in some ways the government actually encourages the outsourcing of jobs. How?

A. One policy that was part of the presidential campaign last year was about tax deferrals that companies got for expanding offshore operations. Companies are able to defer their taxes on profits that are earned offshore as long as they don't repatriate those profits. What Senator John Kerry was proposing, and companies have been lobbying for, was to get a moratorium, or a holiday, for one year to bring those profits back in. Kerry wanted that as a quid pro quo for eliminating the policy. There was $600 billion involved, according to J.P. Morgan. Companies not only got the moratorium but they also got the deferral back in. So the perverse incentive is already back in place. In a few years, they'll say: ''We have another $500 billion overseas. Why don't you give us a tax break for a year?'' This game will go on.

Q. How else does the government encourage outsourcing?

A. You've got programs like the H-1B visa. The intent of the program is, when you can't find American workers, you bring in highly skilled foreign workers who work on temporary visas. They can stay up to six years. The way it's been used traditionally is as a bridge to immigration. You capture the best and the brightest, and they become permanent residents.
 Unfortunately, some businesses have started using this in a different way. They're using it as a purely temporary means to bring in rank-and-file employees who will work for less money. They're not even bothering looking for American workers. This is pretty rampant in the I.T. sector in particular. Those workers then gain experience in the U.S. on the latest technologies, interfacing with customers, and then they are able to take that back to their home country.

Q. How can this situation be corrected?

A. The main thing is to ensure that American companies are looking for American workers first. That's the way Congress believes the program works, but more and more it doesn't.

HEADLINE: Albania Prepares to Vote Amid Accusations of Fraud and Intimidation

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, June 30 

 BODY:
Albanians are to vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday in a closely fought race that has been marred by accusations of fraud and voter intimidation. 
 Fourteen years after the collapse of the Communist government that isolated Albania from the rest of the world, American and European officials say the fairness of the election will determine Albania's chance of closer ties with the European Union and possible membership in NATO. 
 An estimated 500 international and 4,000 local observers will monitor the balloting on Sunday, in which voters will select 140 members of Parliament. Yet despite the scrutiny, the last days of the campaign have been fraught with difficulties. Among the problems cited by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the international body monitoring the polls and the campaign, are accusations of vote buying, the misuse of state resources and of voters being pressured to support particular candidates. 
 The main rivals in the race -- Prime Minister Fatos Nano's Socialist Party and the Democratic Party, led by Sali Berisha -- were running neck and neck, according to an opinion survey taken June 26. The poll, which was carried out by Gallup International on behalf of Mjaft, an Albanian nongovernmental group that is campaigning to get people to vote, gave the Socialists 34 percent and the Democratic Party 35 percent; 1,400 potential voters were questioned and the margin of error was plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. 
 Mr. Nano's government has presided over a sustained period of economic growth -- about 5 percent annually for three years -- and standards of living have risen. But his critics say that development has been uneven, favoring the rich and certain parts of the country like the capital, Tirana. The opposition, news media and nongovernmental organizations have also accused his administration of widespread corruption.
 For Dr. Berisha, the election is seen as his last chance to return to power. Albania was plunged into chaos in 1997 under his government in the wake of a pyramid banking scandal that cost Albanians more than $1 billion in lost savings. Hundreds lost their lives as soldiers deserted their posts and people looted armories. An Italian-led force was sent to restore order. 
 While the rival parties have waged the slickest election race in Albania's history -- the Democrats hired American advisers -- the campaign deteriorated in the last four weeks, election observers said.
 ''The tone of the campaign has become noticeably more rancorous,'' said an interim report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Election monitors said they were most concerned about the confused state of electoral rolls, and a ploy by each of the two major parties to exploit a loophole in the system that enables them to encourage votes for minority parties to lift their overall alliances in Parliament. 
 Large numbers of birth certificates, which can been used as proof of voter identification, have been issued before the election. Shkoder, a city in northern Albania, has issued 90,000 since last October. 
 Whatever the outcome on Sunday, many politicians and analysts agreed that Mr. Nano's and Dr. Berisha's domination of Albanian politics was not likely to survive past the elections. 
 With results expected to be close, both sides will need coalition partners. 
 ''Berisha will not be able to rule alone, even if he wanted to,'' said Neritan Sejamini, the Democratic Party candidate for the Tirana region. A third party, the Socialist Integration Movement, which was formed by a breakaway group of Socialists in Parliament, is expected to hold the balance of power. 
 Its leader, former Prime Minister Ilir Meta, contends that the end of the Socialist and Democrats duopoly of power would improve the chance of political and economic change.
 ''It will break this two-party system,'' Mr. Meta said.
 Most voters, meanwhile, have their minds focused on more basic needs, like water, electricity and paved roads. ''Nothing we have is secure,'' said Mereme Lila, 50, a homemaker in Sauk, one of dozens of new suburbs to have sprung up on the edge of Tirana. 
 Constant power failures and the lack of local government permits to plan new housing is a major concern in this and similar neighborhoods. Power supplies have been restored to the district in the week before the election. 
 ''When the voting is over they will cut it off again, you'll see,'' said Mrs. Lila's neighbor who declined to give her name. Official results are not expected before Tuesday.

HEADLINE: The Car Is for Kids, But Gramps Is Driving

BYLINE: By GEORGE P. BLUMBERG

 BODY:
THE next time traffic snaps to a halt in a spectacle of brake lights, glance around. There's a good chance you'll see one of those cool hipster-mobiles -- the coupes with erector-set spoilers, the hatchbacks in emphatic colors, the boxy wagons that seem more square than a 1950's sitcom. 
 These sorts of trendy cars, like the Toyota Matrix, the Honda Element and three varieties of Toyota's Scions, were designed and marketed expressly for 20-somethings. But the people at the wheel often look more like Ozzie and Harriet than like the serially pierced offspring of Ozzy Osbourne.
 For a variety of reasons, manufacturers of youth-oriented cars are missing their targets. ''The original anticipated median age of the Matrix driver was 28.8, but it's actually 42.7,'' said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, a consulting firm in Bandon, Ore., that tracks auto industry trends. ''And Element drivers are at 44.7 instead of the anticipated 28.6.'' 
 Graying baby boomers have co-opted many of the vehicles intended for buff young people. The median age of those driving the Pontiac Vibe, a small wagon similar to the Matrix, is 48.2; CNW says the anticipated age had been 30.2. The actual median of Dodge Neon drivers is 39.2, compared with the expected 22.7.
 CNW calculates the anticipated age of drivers based on manufacturers' demographic projections, analysis of prices and market segments and other information. Data on drivers is considered more relevant than that on purchasers, because parents often buy children the cars they demand, skewing the demographic profiles.
 Automakers would love to get the business of Generation Y, but this tribe -- loosely defined as the 70 million Americans born from 1977 to 1995 -- has proved elusive. While companies exhaustively research Gen Y's tastes and desires, they have run up against an obstacle: relatively few can yet afford new cars.
 ''The boomers have the money,'' Mr. Spinella said. ''The 50-plus group is responsible for 50 percent of sales, and that grows to 54 percent in 2010.'' In that same period, he said, the 15-29 age group will never account for more than 9 percent of sales. 
 After that, the aging Generation Y will make its presence felt. By 2020, these Americans are expected to buy more than six million new vehicles a year. As they grow older and richer they are likely to mirror, to some extent, the boomers who came before.
 Therefore, carmakers are concerned with more than selling cheap econoboxes to Gen Y today. The companies hope to draw in young customers gradually, cultivate their loyalty and sell them fancier cars later.
 But even the best-researched plans can have unintended consequences, as Honda discovered. ''We pitched the Element to 18-to-25-year-old males as a big box which could be like a rolling dorm room, and hold their stuff,'' said Andy Boyd, a company spokesman. But the Element's quirkiness -- with its wide-open interior space and rubber floor -- appeals just as much to older hobbyists, families and businesses, who like the vehicle's utility and the fact that it can be hosed out.
 Bob Van Almkerk, a sales manager at Brandfon Honda in Branford, Conn., says he sells Elements to boomers and empty nesters. ''I'm thinking our customer base is age 35 to 70,'' he said. ''The Element's versatile, easy to maintain and handy for young families and businesses. A fully optioned model runs about $22,000. How can an unemployed college kid afford that?'' 
 After Toyota tried and largely failed to sell Echos and Matrixes to young people, the company set up Scion as a separate brand with unconventional marketing methods. (For instance, custom versions of the cars are parked near hip night spots, so young people ''discover'' them on their own.) Toyota also wants to lower the median age of its buyers, which a spokeswoman, Ming-Jou Chen, said was close to 50. 
 The Matrix wagon and Echo subcompact were influenced by a Toyota program called Genesis, a corporate attempt to research the desires of young people. Yet young people began calling the Echo the ''Yucko,'' because of its frumpy styling and bare interior, while older people liked the frugal, upright car for another reason: it was easy to get in and out. 
 ''We learned a lot'' from Genesis, said Brian Bolain, national sales promotion manager for Scion. He said the Echo was seen as ''too mainstream'' because it wore a Toyota badge, and ''we still got older Toyota buyers'' for it.
 Andy Turton of TNS, a market research firm that studies the buying patterns of teenagers, said 16- to-19-year-olds did not aspire to Toyotas the way they dreamed of getting a Honda or a Volkswagen. ''It's not about practicality,'' he said, referring to why young people like particular brands. ''Teens see the car as an extension of themselves.'' 
 Each year, Mr. Spinella at CNW compiles the Stodgy Index, based on surveys in which young people rate the appeal of car and truck brands. Toyota comes off as one brand with a lackluster image, but Scion scored at the top.
 Mr. Turton said his annual study indicated that more than 30 percent of teenagers were aware of the Scion, ''pretty good for this short time and with such narrow marketing.''
 More than 160,000 Scions found buyers between June 2003, when the division started selling cars, and the end of May. Jim Farley, the Toyota vice president for Scion, said buyers of the xA hatchback and xB wagon had a median age in the mid- to- high-30's, while the median for the newer tC coupe was in the mid to late 20's. He said 85 percent of Scion customers were new to Toyota, 52 percent were men (versus 60 percent women for the segment), 25 percent had co-signers, and 66 percent configured their cars on the Internet. 
 Still, Brian Weinberg, general manager of Grossinger City Toyota in Chicago, said his average Scion buyer was 37 years old. 
 And 160,000 customers do not a self-sufficient brand make. ''Right now, there aren't enough Gen Yers in the market for Scion to have an average age in the 20's,'' Mr. Farley of Scion said. He said the age of the average owner could creep up as more older buyers discovered the cars. 
 ''Looking back, I'd say we should have said we're targeting trend-setters over all, not just youth,'' he said. ''It's a lifelong mind-set.'' 
 Mr. Farley agreed that getting new buyers into Scions was only half the job: ''We need exciting product for them to move to,'' once they are ready for a more expensive car. ''And,'' he added, ''it won't happen with today's Camrys or Avalons.''
 Will carmakers continue to be surprised that the youngsters they seek are not buying their cars? ''Half my friends are into cars and the other half just cares if a car runs,'' said P.J. McCombs, a 22-year-old musician who has gained a measure of fame for the car reviews he posts at epinions.com. ''But being into cars can mean a 20-year-old Camaro.'' 
 Mr. McCombs, who recently graduated from the University of California, Davis, said in an interview that he had noticed a growing number of Scions on campus, though used cars from the 1990's remained most popular. ''Ten-year-old Eclipses and Civics are all over,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Tax on Net Worth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Maybe Saving Money Is Just for Chumps'' (On the Contrary, June 26) which proposed the idea of a progressive consumption tax:
 Such a tax, however, would be an enforcement nightmare. A more practical alternative may be a progressive tax on personal net worth above a rather high threshold. To command enough public support, the threshold may need to be as high as $10 million.
There is a strong fairness argument for attaching the progressive feature to a personal net worth tax rather than to a personal income tax. The income tax makes it harder for the not-yet-rich to become rich, while the net-worth tax makes it harder for the already very rich to remain so, without continuing to be, or becoming, exceptionally productive. 
 Additional taxation should not have a significantly depressing effect on spending by the most wealthy, or on new, productive investment. In the 1960's the top tax rates on dividends and capital gains were very high, yet gross domestic product growth was strong.

THREE BILLION NEW CAPITALISTS
The Great Shift of Wealth
and Power to the East.
By Clyde Prestowitz.
321 pp. Basic Books. $26.95.
 IF you've managed to ignore the alarm bells on the outlook for American economic leadership -- and you enjoy dreaming -- don't read Clyde Prestowitz's ''Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East.'' It argues that the United States faces such serious fiscal and competitive challenges that we may be headed not only for a declining standard of living but for a 1930's-style depression with a capital D.
 Here's the story. In the golden age, 1950-73, we had it all -- low-cost manufacturing, rising wages, technological dominance, a highly educated and motivated work force, a trade surplus. Until 1971, our reserve currency was backed by gold, forcing us to be responsible. We had control over our economic destiny. Since then, bit by bit, we've lost much of our strength and are in danger of losing the rest. 
 Our first problem is the surge in competitiveness on the part of the rest of the world, especially China and India, a trend Thomas L. Friedman analyzes in detail in ''The World Is Flat.'' Even if the playing field were level -- which it isn't -- we would not be able to compete with the combination of low-cost labor, talent and fire in the belly of these two behemoths. Our second problem is that we still think we're living in the golden age. In fact, we suffer from a misguided sense of superiority, profligate spending habits, a weak education system, mammoth debts, a ballooning trade deficit and a religious devotion to free-trade theories developed before the Industrial Revolution.
 Each of these issues could consume a book, but Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a trade negotiator in the Reagan administration, packs them into one. The heart of the question, as he sees it, is that we are not defending the jewel in our economic crown -- our technology and manufacturing capabilities -- but are instead waxing poetic about the virtues of free trade while more practical countries walk off with our loot. This, he contends, will lead to the gutting of our economy, with well-paid skilled jobs replaced by low-paid menial ones, and an America in hock to the world's next economic leaders. 
 Globalization, of course, is nothing new. The ''hollowing out'' debate hinges on whether the United States can replace the jobs it loses with equal or better ones. Capitalism is fueled by Schumpeter's creative destruction -- new forever displacing old -- and this country has thrived through transitions from agriculture to manufacturing to automation to outsourcing to services. Free-trade advocates argue that globalization is just the latest phase of a continuing evolution. Trade hawks like Prestowitz argue that now is different because of the sheer size of India and China and our inadequate response to the new situation.
 Globalization has always been a touchy subject (after all, Americans lose jobs when companies move production and services overseas) -- so touchy that most popular discussion of it is inflammatory or inane or both. Last year, John Kerry branded corporations and executives who send jobs offshore ''Benedict Arnold companies and C.E.O.'s,'' and a White House adviser, N. Gregory Mankiw, provoked many a storm by suggesting that offshoring was actually beneficial because, among other things, it lowers prices and makes labor available for new opportunities. Mankiw may have been impolitic, but Kerry was just pandering. If the choice is go offshore or go out of business, a chief executive doesn't have a choice.
 Prestowitz acknowledges that many companies can't survive today without offshoring, but argues that we often abandon industries we could continue to dominate and so lose the ability to lead the next wave of innovation. He lays the blame on government, not the private sector. ''Whether it recognizes the fact or not,'' he declares, ''the United States has a de facto economic strategy, and right now it is to send the country's most important industries overseas.'' He observes, moreover, that the benefits of offshoring go beyond cost: 
 ''You do save money,'' a senior manager at the semiconductor equipment maker KLA-Tencor says about sending work to India. ''But pretty soon, you realize the work is getting done faster and better, and you start sending more and more of it. You also start sending more advanced work and then have to figure out what, if anything, you really don't want to send.''
 The work is getting done faster and better, Prestowitz argues, because Indians are not only hungrier than we are, but better educated. China, India, Japan and Europe all churn out more science and engineering degrees than we do. Worse -- and downright embarrassing -- is the state of American education. Globally, our 12th-graders rank only in the 10th percentile in math (that's 10th percentile, not 10th). Our students also rank first in their assessment of their own performance: we're not only poorly prepared, we have delusions of grandeur.
 One common argument against the hollowing-out theory is that we can afford to lose jobs in low-tech manufacturing because we retain our high-tech design and manufacturing capabilities. Prestowitz counters that China's and India's incentives and resources are so compelling that the high-tech work is leaving, too. 
 Another argument is that a revaluation of the yuan will curb imports and stimulate exports, thus repairing the trade deficit. In fact, Prestowitz asserts, our manufacturing capacity has been so gutted that we can't export our way out, even if the dollar's value drops to zero. The only path is to cut spending. 
 But Prestowitz risks sounding like Chicken Little when he pronounces the globalization of today more than just another ''gale of creative destruction'' to which our economy will eventually adapt. Manufacturing has long been declining as a percentage of the United States economy, but the jobs lost have been more than offset by growth in services (in health care, financial services, law, retailing, and so on). Prestowitz points out that services are now being offshored, too, but not (yet) at a rate threatening our main growth industries. The McKinsey Global Institute, for example, reports that while 24 million Americans switch jobs each year, only 3 million jobs are estimated to go offshore by 2015. 
 The critical question, still to be satisfactorily answered, is whether offshoring produces net economic gain or loss. Prestowitz deconstructs an oft-cited McKinsey study concluding that each $1 of spending sent offshore results in an overall gain in the gross domestic product of $1.12 to $1.14. He points out the study relies on data suggesting that 69 percent of displaced workers found jobs at an average of 97 percent of their former pay. This leaves 31 percent who didn't find new jobs. Not only that, ''if employers took McKinsey's advice to increase their offshoring,'' he says, the gain would quickly become a loss. 
 In America's boom time, government-business cooperation was considered anathema to free-market principles -- ''Politicians shouldn't pick winners and losers!'' In Prestowitz's view, the laissez-faire trade theories of the 19th century have no place in 2005; since he holds that many of our successes have resulted from public-private collaboration, most of his proposals for maintaining American competitiveness boil down to government taking a more active role. Pay teachers more. Help workers move between jobs by offering wage insurance and portable health coverage. Reduce oil consumption by providing incentives for efficient cars (and include S.U.V.'s in mileage regulations). Tax spending, not saving. Help strategic industries with federal loan guarantees and grants. Call ''a new Bretton Woods Conference'' to set steps for reducing the role of the dollar in the world economy and so defuse the trade-deficit bomb. Whatever you think about offshoring, most of these ideas are no-brainers.

THE GRAIL BIRD
Hot on the Trail
of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker.
By Tim Gallagher.
Illustrated. 272 pp.
Houghton Mifflin Company. $25.
 THE ivory-billed woodpecker, if you haven't heard, is no longer extinct. In late spring, a group of 17 researchers announced in the online version of Science that they had spotted at least one member of this majestic species living in the cypress and tupelo swamps of eastern Arkansas. Once found everywhere in Southern hardwood forests, the ivory-billed woodpecker tumbled in population after the turn of the century, the victim of avid collectors and logging. It had last been seen in 1944, reduced to what Tim Gallagher, author of ''The Grail Bird: Hot on the Trail of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker,'' calls ''a symbol of everything that has gone wrong with our relationship to the environment.'' 
 ''The Grail Bird'' is the story of this remarkable rediscovery, told by one of the chief rediscoverers. The editor of Living Bird magazine, Gallagher began the book several years ago with milder ambitions. The plan was to interview anyone who had seen the bird -- or thought he or she had. Soon, though, he was swept into a web of tantalizing rumors and half-clues, propelled by the possibility that a living ivory-bill might yet be found. ''If someone . . . could prove that this remarkable species still exists, it would be the most hopeful event imaginable: we would have one final chance to get it right, to save this bird and the bottomland swamp forests it needs to survive.'' Hope was a thing with a three-foot wingspan. 
 ''The Grail Bird'' is less an ecological study than a portrait of human obsession; if not for the outcome, it could as easily be a book about the hunt for Bigfoot. Gallagher stakes out swamps teeming with alligators and cottonmouths. He sifts through shady evidence, from fuzzy Instamatic photographs to bags of bark shavings -- peeled, possibly, by the ivory-billed woodpecker in its search for beetle grubs. He suffers bloodied feet and an infected knee. His closest companion, Bobby Ray Harrison, a wildlife photographer and an arts professor at Oakwood College, dresses in full camouflage gear and canoes with a camcorder attached to his helmet. ''Sasquatch chasers,'' Gallagher's wife calls them. Yet for all the shenanigans, his book is an insightful look at what most biological fieldwork involves: a lot of sweating, sitting and waiting for ghosts to -- maybe -- make themselves real. 
 As tales go, ''The Grail Bird'' isn't the most stylishly told. Gallagher lets his characters talk at too-great length, and the incidental details are sometimes overly incidental. (''After pigging out on bad burgers, we got a room at a cheap motel and quickly fell into a deep, exhausted sleep with lots of snoring.'') But most readers probably won't mind. As some rivers are to be enjoyed not for the quality of the water but for the quality of the stones to be found therein, so it is with some books. Gallagher presents a series of lively characters: Fielding Lewis, a former Louisiana state boxing commissioner who in 1971 took two fuzzy photographs of the woodpecker that were subsequently -- and perhaps mistakenly -- discredited; an anonymous ''woodpecker-whisperer'' who claims to have a telepathic connection to the birds, even a thousand miles away. (One group of searchers failed, they were told, because they were noisily scaring off the bird.)
 Oddly missing from this recounting is any extended focus on the ivory-billed woodpecker itself. Granted, the bird has been invisible for decades, a presence notable largely for its absence. Still, the book might have given us the animal's history in more detail -- something to convey the visceral appeal of this ''grail.'' Without that, the quest -- though triumphant -- at times feels hollow, and the fulfillment of the author's obsession veers perilously close to sounding like an end in itself. 
 When George Lowery, director of the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, came forth with the fuzzy photographs of what looked like, maybe, an ivory-billed woodpecker, the reaction from the birding community was disbelief and everlasting scorn; the photos sullied Lowery's reputation for the remainder of his career. Nonetheless, he refused to divulge who had taken the photographs or where. ''You know what would happen,'' he told a colleague. ''There would be 200 amateur bird watchers on planes from all corners of the United States descending on the area tomorrow. And I think that would be the worst possible development so far as the birds themselves are concerned.'' 
 Nature does best, it seems, when it is either so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable (like deer or squirrels), or so inaccessible as to be invisible; the ivory-billed woodpecker owes its survival to the fact that it could hide out in a vast, impenetrable swamp. One wonders what the future holds for the newly rediscovered Grail Bird. Shortly after the news of the sighting broke, Gale A. Norton, the secretary of the Interior, committed $10 million to preserving the bird and its habitat -- even as the Bush administration was busily opening federal forests to new road construction. Some days later I read a news article about an Arkansas town that hopes to see an economic revival from an influx of bird tourists and woodpecker seekers. The main photograph showed several boatloads of birders drifting down an Arkansas river, their binoculars out, peering, probing. Extinct, at least, a bird could get some peace.

HEADLINE: Cisco's Balance Of Automation And Workers

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., July 1 

 BODY:
The technology created by Silicon Valley workers may itself be partly responsible for slowing the rate of employment growth here. More and more, companies are automating functions once performed by people.
 Cisco Systems, for instance, uses Internet-based programs to automate certain pieces of its human resources, finance, customer service and support operations. Among other things, this means that when a new employee is hired, the employee enrolls online for benefits rather than meeting with a human resources manager. 
 In addition, salespeople can get legal documents and contracts online, with no need to mail, fax or even store information. And an increasing amount of the sales and marketing process is handled electronically, said Susan L. Bostrom, senior vice president for worldwide government affairs at Cisco.
 The company has set a long-term goal of raising productivity to $1 million in sales per employee. That translates to needing fewer workers, as Cisco's hiring pattern has borne out.
 In the first quarter of 2001, it had 44,000 employees, 28 percent of whom were in the Bay Area. At the time, its sales were $5.9 billion and its profit $1.3 billion.
 Today, Cisco has 37,500, with 22 percent in the region. Its sales during the fiscal quarter ended April 30 were $6.2 billion and its profit was $1.4 billion (after plummeting in the comparable quarter of 2001 to sales of $4 billion and profits of $230 million).
 As it has returned to steady growth, Cisco has begun to hire again. In the last four quarters, it added 2,755 workers -- mostly engineers and sales representatives -- with about 36 percent of them in the region.
 This more modest hiring is something that technology should continue to allow, said AnnaLee Saxenian, dean of the School of Information Management and Systems and a professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley.
 ''Productivity went up through the recession, and it continues to rise,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Room With No View

BYLINE: By ANNA BAHNEY

 BODY:
FOR many apartment dwellers, a home office is an indeterminate breed, a cross between a region of the house and a piece of furniture. Perhaps it begins as a docile desk with computer but grows into an unruly beast, covered in bills and power cords, spreading out from a corner of a room used primarily for something else, like cooking or sleeping.
 A real office would be nice, but what sense does that make, really, in a city where an extra bedroom can double the price of an apartment and push it beyond $1 million? Increasingly, there is a way to get that extra room, something more than a closet but less than a second bedroom -- and much more affordable than paying for a true second bedroom. Call it an office or den, library or study, media room, combo room or guest room. Just don't call it a bedroom. And don't expect a view.
Apartments with windowless rooms are becoming more common as office buildings are converted to condos. Because each floor of an office building is typically quite large and not designed to have all of its space windowed, there are rooms that simply cannot command a view, no matter how creative the floor plan. The appearance of this new kind of room has also created a new size of apartment, a half-size between one- and two-bedroom apartments. 
 With some priced nearly $500,000 less than similarly sized two-bedrooms in the same building, they come at a half-size price, too.
 But searching for such a place is difficult, as it doesn't yet have its own name on even the most evolved real estate search engines. 
 ''I was looking for a two-bedroom, two-bath,'' said Monica Mitro, executive vice president for public relations at Victoria's Secret. She was looking for a modicum of the space lost after moving out of a large house in Ohio, and because she had gone through renovations on that house, she wanted new construction in New York. Her friend Donald Mikula, a celebrity hair and makeup artist, told her about apartments available at the Lion's Head Condominium, a former office building at 121 West 19th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea, where he was buying. When she arrived on the third day of sales, which began in April, only eight of the 66 apartments were left.
 ''It reminded me of a Barneys shoe sale,'' Ms. Mitro said of the atmosphere, ''although I've spent more time picking out shoes than this apartment.''
 She signed a contract for a 1,600-square-foot one-bedroom with two baths and a home office. It was not worth it to her to buy the extra window for the few nights a year she has overnight guests or for the little job-related work she would do in the room. She plans to keep it from being too ''officey'' by creating a music room for playing her cello. ''This, to me, is the ultimate one-bedroom,'' she said.
 Mr. Mikula and his wife, Mary Catherine, are trading in their two-bedroom, two-bath in Chelsea for a one-bedroom with a den at Lion's Head. It is about 100 square feet smaller but more affordable and, he said, more flexible.
 ''Our whole feeling is about making it seamless,'' Mr. Mikula said of the den, where he plans to put a pullout sofa, a computer with wireless Internet connection and a flat-screen television with mini surround sound. His 11-year-old daughter, Sofia, will stay there when she visits several times a year from Europe. ''It's a treat for her,'' he said. ''She's in the media room, and she gets the best TV.''
 The list of backup buyers for the 20 apartments at Lion's Head with extra rooms like Ms. Mitro's and Mr. Mikula's stretched 100 deep with people attracted to the chance to get a full room at a reduced price. Indeed, a 1,553-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath went for $1.525 million and a one-bedroom with home office and two baths (one has a shower but no tub) went for $1.17 million. That's $355,000 for a window and the legal right to call it a bedroom.
 At the Grand Madison, a 192-unit condominium at 225 Fifth Avenue in the former Gift Building, at the northwest corner of Madison Square Park, the gap can be even greater. There is a $485,000 difference between a 1,280-square-foot two-bedroom unit available for $1.81 million on a high floor and a slightly larger 1,320-square-foot one-bedroom with a den on a middle floor. Both have two baths and neither has a park view. The difference in price on those same two apartments on a middle floor would be $285,000. Of course, from a developer's perspective -- in this case Elad Properties -- a one-bedroom with an office garners $385,000 more than a similarly sized straight one-bedroom.
 It is a rare meeting of the minds between developers and buyers, with home offices solving the odd problem of a surfeit of space: developers are able to create apartments out of buildings designed for commercial use and buyers have a space for the entertainment system or computer that have virtually become members of the family.
 Kenneth S. Horn, president of Alchemy Properties and developer of Lion's Head, said that the home office presented itself as an option because the floor plates of the building were so deep -- 100 feet front to back.
 ''Twenty-five by 25 feet, that is a huge living room; there was no reason to make it 35 by 35,'' Mr. Horn said. ''I know it sounds crazy. It is loft-type housing, but it gives people a lot more flexibility to have a separate room.''
 Mr. Horn sees such a demand for these multipurpose rooms that 13 of the 45 apartments in a new construction condo he's building at 199 State Street in Brooklyn will have windowless dens. When sales start in the late fall, every apartment, including the two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath with a den, will be priced under $1 million.
 Still, most home offices are found not in new construction but in conversions of buildings from the turn of the 20th century. Steven Kratchman, an architect working on a condo conversion called the Morgan Lofts, at 11 East 36th Street, said that the solution usually presents itself when a building is more than 65 feet deep, the length of a typical apartment. But it isn't easy, because dens are discretionary and require approval from the Department of Buildings. 
 ''Everything that is discretionary raises a question,'' Mr. Kratchman said. ''Everything that is as of right is straightforward and approvable.''
 According to the New York City building code, he explained, the windowless rooms are classified as occupiable rooms, like bathrooms and kitchens with their own set of rules for ventilation and light, rather than habitable rooms, like living rooms and bedrooms.
 (Mr. Kratchman, by the way, knows firsthand about windowless rooms. He uses the one in his Hoboken, N.J., apartment for desk space, a library and a guest room. ''I have my closet in there, because my wife uses the one in our bedroom,'' he said.)
 ''It can be seen as an exaggerated one-bedroom or an ersatz two-bedroom, but we can't sell it as a bedroom,'' said Richard Cantor, a principal at the residential sales firm Cantor & Pecorella, which handles sales in several buildings that offer home offices.
 His current properties include the O'Neill Building, a 49-unit condo in the cast-iron O'Neill department store built in 1887 at 655 Avenue of the Americas between 20th and 21st Streets; the Downtown Club, a 288-unit condo in the 45-story former Downtown Athletic Club, built in 1930 at 20 West Street in Lower Manhattan; and the Grand Madison.
 ''It is a neglected category,'' Mr. Cantor said of the space he calls a jack-of-all-trades room. ''A large number of people are not looking for a second bedroom, but they want a place where they can get away and do whatever they do in an office, whether it's clutter it or just have a computer and a clear space to think about things.''
 Elena Compton, a 21-year-old investment banker who is finishing her final year at Duke University, bought one of the one-bedrooms with a home office at the O'Neill Building last month. While she doesn't plan to work much at home, she said, ''it will be nice to have a space for the computer and not be staring at it from bed.''
 The developer of the Downtown Club, the Moinian Group, has designed that tower for people like Ms. Compton -- young professionals climbing up the financial industry ladder. The building will have only one-bedrooms and studios, but more than a quarter of them will have one home office, some will have two and many will be loftlike. They will be priced at $400,000 to $1.5 million when sales begin this fall. The building will also have a 12,000-square-foot fitness center and a social club atmosphere with a lounge and pool tables.
 Joseph Moinian, the president of the development group, said that the extra room is naturally appealing to people with hobbies. Or, he said, ''maybe I like a lot of Italian suits; I could make it a closet, or books -- I've seen the most magnificent libraries.'' But there is a fiscal bonus for people who use it for business, Mr. Moinian said. The zoning for some loft conversions, particularly in the lower reaches of Manhattan, allows for up to 49 percent of the residence to be used for a home occupation. ''Zoning in Midtown only allows you to use 25 percent,'' he said.
 The economic benefits of home offices in the resale market are only beginning to become apparent, but if Jeff McLaren's experience is any indication, appraisers may have to start a separate statistic for apartments with windowless rooms.
 In 2000, Mr. McLaren, a partner at a health care management consulting firm, bought a one-bedroom with a den in the Chelsea Mercantile building, at 252 Seventh Avenue, at 25th Street, an early conversion in that area that turned a 1906 building into 354 condos.
 Now, only five years later, his apartment recently went into contract at $1,270 a square foot, more than double the $460 a square foot he paid. What's more, his sale is higher than similarly sized one-bedrooms in the building without home offices.
 ''The building's belief at the time it was converted was that the more open units would be worth more,'' he said, describing other apartments with fewer but larger rooms. ''I disagreed with them. I bought the cheapest one in the building -- the one with a home office. So far I appear to be right.''

HEADLINE: Homeowners Shown The Door

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
SUSETTE KELO'S pink 19th-century Victorian cottage stands like a lighthouse against the oncoming storm. Ms. Kelo, 47, was on the losing end of the Supreme Court case last month that allows the city to buy her home for private redevelopment. On the day the court ruled, she sat in her favorite chair on her wraparound porch under a green umbrella and waved at neighbors passing by.
 Ms. Kelo is a deeply sympathetic character, a victim of a city that says it can make better use of her property. But she isn't asking people to feel sorry for her. It's their own backs they should be watching, she says. 
 ''This has nothing to do with me,'' she said. ''I'm nothing. I'm a nobody. This is every U.S. citizen, every American. No homes, no properties, no farms. Nothing is safe anymore.'' 
 The Supreme Court's decision has indeed cleared the way for more condemnations in states such as Connecticut that allow the government to take homes and businesses and replace them with more profitable private developments.
 In Connecticut, the law gives cities a broad array of reasons to condemn property, said Jeremy Paul, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. Dana Berliner, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, which represented the plaintiffs in the New London case, wrote in one report that the state seems eager to use these kinds of condemnations.
 At the same time, for a Connecticut city to take someone's land it must go through a complicated process designed to guard against corruption and unnecessary displacement. That, some say, keeps cities from using their powers to take property too loosely.
 ''One of the things to understand is that the process is very extensive,'' Mr. Paul said.
 The Supreme Court ruling, Mr. Paul added, does not open any new avenues to condemn a house; it simply upholds the way the state has already used eminent domain.
 The way courts have interpreted eminent domain laws has evolved over the last two centuries. Cities and states have taken private property through eminent domain laws since early in the nation's history, often to build roads or other pieces of public infrastructure. That right is enshrined in the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, which says that states must give private property owners just compensation when they take their property for ''public use.''
 Many courts followed that language narrowly -- that land taken from a private owner had to be used for the general public -- up through the middle of the 19th century, according to the Supreme Court opinion on the New London case written by Justice John Paul Stevens. Toward the end of the 19th century, however, the courts began reading the Fifth Amendment more broadly, allowing public bodies to take land for private mines and mills. More recently, cities have used eminent domain laws to clear out slums. While some states have placed tight restrictions on taking private property for private redevelopment, Connecticut has not.
 The New London case raised questions about just how far the law could go.
 The city may have fallen on hard times in recent years, with a declining population and tax base, but none of that was Ms. Kelo's fault. ''Blighted'' is not a word anyone would use for her house, with its happy family photographs hung on the walls, its stained-glass chandelier in the dining room and cozy moccasins in a basket at the foot of the staircase. Ms. Kelo is a nurse, the kind of professional that many cities hope to attract. Why take her house, and the 14 other properties that were at issue in the case?
 The court gave a handful of answers. And its answers, lawyers said, help to clarify the boundaries of eminent domain laws. Those clarifications may make the process of condemning homes for private development easier in the future, because they show cities how to use their eminent domain powers, said Wesley Horton, the lawyer who argued New London's case before the Supreme Court.
 ''Obviously, New London provides a road plan for other municipalities,'' he said.
 For one thing, the city is poor. The city was declared a ''distressed municipality'' in 1990 and has had unemployment rates in recent years that were higher than the state average.
 ''This taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious citywide depression,'' wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in a concurring opinion.
 Cities in better economic shape would be hard-pressed to prove the need for condemnations, Mr. Horton said.
 It would raise eyebrows if Greenwich claimed it needed to condemn property for economic redevelopment, he said. 
 It also helped that the city had undertaken a lengthy public process of hearings to present plans and gauge community support, the court noted.
 ''The City has carefully formulated an economic development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community,'' Justice Stevens wrote.
 The court also addressed the idea that the ruling would open the door to cities that want to transfer property to a favored developer, perhaps someone with political connections. That, the concurring justices said, would be an improper use of the law. Justice Kennedy noted that ''the identity of most of the private beneficiaries were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans.''
 The justices who voted in favor of the city made it clear that courts should handle such condemnations on a case-by-case basis.
 But many are concerned that the court opened the door too wide to cities and land-hungry developers. 
 ''The specter of condemnation hangs over all property,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in a dissenting opinion. ''Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.''
 Ms. Berliner said the court's decision paves the way for future condemnations benefiting private parties. Going through newspaper articles from 1998 to 2002, she found 31 cases in Connecticut of private homes' being condemned by governments for redevelopment by private parties. The practice is on the rise, she said. 
 ''I think it's increasing because courts aren't putting a stop to it,'' she said.
 In Connecticut, statistics from the Judicial Branch indicate that the number of contested redevelopment condemnations has increased over the past decade. In the fiscal year from 1989 to 1990, the court system logged 11 new redevelopment condemnation cases. Ten years later, 146 were filed. In the most recent fiscal year, from 2003 to 2004, 84 cases were filed.
 The majority of so-called ''redevelopment condemnations'' consist of cities condemning property to give to another private owner, as in the New London case, Ms. Berliner said.
 Mr. Paul cautioned that that doesn't necessarily mean that cities are becoming more zealous in their attempts to get land. It could simply mean that property owners thought the law was vulnerable and decided to take more cases to court, he said.
 ''It's very misleading to attempt to assess the number of condemnations by looking at the number of contested cases,'' he said. ''As legal issues develop and as homeowners believe they have a better chance of winning a suit, they're more likely to fight about it.''
 Some argue that Connecticut cities can be trusted with this power; they use condemnation sparingly, and when they do it generally benefits the city's residents.
 The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which represents 143 towns and cities, submitted a brief to the Supreme Court supporting New London's case and pointing to the state's past success at using condemnation to improve the economy. 
 Connecticut's laws allowing eminent domain for economic development had given rise to 62 projects, with 667 businesses employing 32,000 people through 1991, the association wrote in its brief. The brief also highlighted success stories, including projects in Bridgeport and Meriden that had produced hundreds of new jobs.
 ''The rumors that now everyone's home is at risk is really a great exaggeration,'' said Kevin Maloney, an association spokesman.
 But for some people who have been directly affected by condemnations, the process can seem arbitrary and deeply unfair.
 Frank Bugryn Jr.'s family, for instance, owned about 30 acres in Bristol when the city told him in the mid-1990's that it wanted an industrial park on his property. Ms. Bugryn's parents had bought the property in 1939 and left it to him and his three siblings in 1970, he said. Mr. Bugryn, 83, a retired brass-mill foreman, planted about 500 Christmas trees on the property about 10 years ago and watched them grow 20 to 30 feet high. When the government officials came knocking, they told him they wanted to put a distribution center on his property. He was totally unprepared.
 ''I never though that this would happen,'' he said.
 Mr. Bugryn fought the condemnation in court. When he lost, the United States Supreme Court would hear the case. The city paid $1.8 million for the property, and about $100,000 for the five-bedroom house Mr. Bugryn built, and then bulldozed it, he said. He now lives with his wife, Mary, in a one-story ranch house in Bristol.
 ''My sisters and I were hoping to live there until we passed away,'' he said. ''I wanted to die there and give it to the kids.''
 Nothing has yet been built on the property. Jonathan Rosenthal, executive director of the Bristol Redevelopment Authority, said the legal battle with the Bugryns delayed the project. The anchor tenant, which had agreed to allow the Bugryns to live on the property for the rest of their lives as the industrial park was built, dropped out of the project while the fight dragged on, Mr. Rosenthal said. The authority received a $1.2 million federal grant to prepare the property for development and has been showing it to potential tenants, he said.
 Mr. Rosenthal said Bristol needed the property to give the city an economic boost.
 ''We are a distressed city,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''Like a lot of places, we need jobs and we need the tax base.''
 Other eminent domain cases designed to spur redevelopment are pending in Connecticut's courts. In Norwalk, Peter Morley, the president of Maritime Motors on West Avenue, is fighting a city plan to redevelop the site of his business. The city decided it wanted an office park in the neighborhood and needed Mr. Morley's property to build a railroad underpass. Mr. Morley, who said he has fought the condemnation for more than four years, lost the case in Superior Court and state Appellate Court, but has since appealed to the state Supreme Court.
 His lawyer is Wesley Horton, who represented the city in the New London case. Mr. Horton said the New London case will not likely affect the Norwalk case because he has charged that the city's plan is improper, not that the law is unconstitutional. Both Mr. Horton and Mr. Morley said the city changed its plans for the site in the late 1990's after Mr. Morley had acquired the property. In the old plan, they contend, the city had included space for a car dealership.
 Norwalk Mayor Alex Knopp said the city had planned to redevelop that property since 1983 and Mr. Morley should have known about the plans when he bought the property.
 ''This was a terribly run-down and blighted area, and the city has focused on redevelopment for 25 years,'' he said. ''Unlike New London, there's no innocent owner surprised by the city's plans.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the United States Supreme Court decision on eminent domain omitted a word, reversing the meaning, in describing the court's role in the fight by Frank Bugryn Jr. against condemnation of his property in Bristol. The sentence should have read: ''When he lost, the United States Supreme Court would NOT hear the case.''

HEADLINE: A Little Spark for Stocks Ahead of the Holiday

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market eked out small gains last week, despite a decline on Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the ninth consecutive time.
 The Fed move -- which lifted the overnight lending rate between banks to 3.25 percent -- was expected, but it had a negative effect on the market anyway. 
This may be because Fed policy makers gave no hint of when their rate increases would end. Instead, they simply indicated that short-term rates might continue to rise at a ''measured'' pace in the months ahead.
 But the stock market bounced back on Friday. Trading volumes were light, as Wall Street began to empty early for the three-day Fourth of July weekend. Markets will be closed for the holiday on Monday.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 10,303.44. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,194.44. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 4.10 percent, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,057.37. 
 Crude oil for August delivery closed in New York at $58.75 a barrel, down from $59.84 the previous week.
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped to 4.05 percent from 3.92 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: As the City Shrugs, It's Burgers, Steaks and Ribs

BYLINE: By BETHANY LYE

 BODY:
On nice Saturday mornings, they start arriving as early as 6, lugging coolers, collapsible furniture and of course their beloved grills. 
 The competition for space to barbecue in Morningside Park has become so fierce, the only way to make sure of having a prime patch of turf is by showing up at dawn and marking off an area with lawn chairs and coolers. Especially eager cooks sleep on the picnic tables overnight to claim the next day's territory as early as possible. 
''Sometimes if you don't stay the night, it'll be too crowded,'' said Ivan Hodge, an admitted 10-year veteran of grill-outs and stakeouts. Mr. Hodge, 48 and unemployed, drove down from the Bronx last weekend to grill an impressive array of shrimp, ribs and steak for more than 20 friends and relatives. 
 While Morningside Park has been transformed in recent years, with dog walkers replacing drug dealers, flowers rivaling those found in botanical gardens, and, on some summer days, a small farmers' market, it has also become one of the city's major outposts for summer barbecuing, much to the dismay of local residents and in violation of city regulations, which forbid grilling in most city parks.
 For years, residents have tolerated the grilling and its accompanying smoke, burnt grass, dumped coals and excessive trash.
 ''Every time the summer rolls around, everybody starts sighing and says, 'Oh, no, here we go again,''' said Carol Fox, a Reuters executive who lives near the park and has watched hundreds of people congregate there on holiday weekends like July Fourth.
 The grillers, it seems, are winning the battle; the city even provides trash bags for them, along with a ''charcoal only'' bin to encourage cleanup.
 ''We know there's grilling in the park,'' said Carli Smith, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Parks and Recreation, ''and if we can't stop it, we at least want to encourage people to dispose of their charcoal properly.'' 
 Paradoxically, the increase in grilling is a byproduct of recent improvements in the park. ''Now that the park's getting that somewhat safe feel to it again, more and more people are using it,'' said Terry Lyon, a former Merrill Lynch trader who lives in the neighborhood. ''But people shouldn't take it and use it as their own personal backyard, and we shouldn't be smoked out of our own house because the Parks Department won't enforce their own rules.'' 
 On the opposite side of the issue is Gina Suarez, a Harlem resident for whom grilling in Morningside is a precious rite, despite the threat of a $250 fine. Every month in good weather, Ms. Suarez and 20 friends and relatives gather in the park for a cookout. ''We don't have transportation to go somewhere far,'' she explained, ''and we'd rather be in the neighborhood.'' BETHANY LYE

HEADLINE: Television That Leaps Off the Screen

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KRANTZ

 BODY:
IN a nondescript optics lab in tucked into an anonymous office park in the San Fernando Valley, the photon hackers of Deep Light are showing me the future of media. The object of their affection is a small screen on which an animated gladiator is clashing scimitars with a horned monster in a Coliseum-like setting. But this isn't a flat cartoon image: it's full 3-D space, the combatants circling each other inches from my eyes so convincingly that my hand twinges to grab them -- and I'm not wearing those clunky red-and-blue cardboard glasses, either. I'm seeing a 3-D image with the naked eye. My host, Deep Light's co-founder Dan Mapes, bounces on his heels, giggling with delight. ''It's cool, isn't it?'' 
 Yeah, it's cool.
Ordinary TV sets deliver 500 lines of resolution. Most high-definition screens reach 1,050. The HD3D hits 1,280 lines and counting -- which means better picture quality than that of any TV available today, all in a convincing impression of the third dimension. And here's the seriously trippy part about the new screen, which Deep Light plans to introduce at next winter's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: multiple ''blades'' of video enable one screen to show different programs to different viewers, at the same time. 
 Imagine what that could do to your living room. Your kid sprawls on the floor, happily splattering the virtual walls of Quake 3-D, while you sit on the couch watching the news and your spouse beside you talks with friends in a virtual chat room -- all on the same TV, all at the same time, and all in 3-D. Lean a few feet to the right and the latest report from the floor of the stock exchange becomes a live 3-D chat with the couple who came over to dinner the other night; lean the other way and Junior is blasting a zombie. And something similar is going on over at the neighbor's. And halfway around the world. 
 To be sure, plenty of technical and financial hurdles stand between today's 3-D pioneers and the future of their fervid imaginations. But Mr. Mapes thinks Deep Light has a pretty big trend on its side: humanity's evolution toward ever-more sophisticated representations of reality. ''The brain is a media junkie,'' he says. ''And it wants the good stuff.'' 
 We see the world in three dimensions, but throughout most of history, we've only been able to depict it in two. Until recently no one had come up with a better solution to this problem than goofy eyewear. When Rover sent back images from Mars, NASA scientists studied them wearing much the same glasses that audiences in 50's movie palaces donned to watch ''It Came From Outer Space.'' 
 Within the realms of industry, that's been changing, as what's known as stereoscopic imaging has become a big business involving everyone from drug researchers doing molecular mapping to car designers building next year's SUV. Culturally, however, it remains a novelty, consigned to the occasional theme park ride or Imax film. Recent commercial film releases, like ''The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3-D,'' have raised its profile a bit, but they still rely on the dinky glasses.
 But the ever-evolving high-tech revolution is finally moving 3-D entertainment to the next stage. Sharp has sold three million 3-D cell phones in Japan since 2003 and has just released a laptop that toggles between 2-D and 3-D views. The South Korean government, meanwhile, recently announced an ambitious ''3-D Vision 2010'' project to make stereoscopic TV the worldwide standard within five years, and a number of companies are racing Deep Light to build the pieces of that puzzle; just in April, Toshiba announced new display technology for 3-D television screens. ''The whole realm of TV,'' says Chris Chinnock, the president of the market research firm Insight Media, ''is the Holy Grail of 3-D.'' 
 In which case 3-D's Lancelot may turn out to be a Cambridge University professor named Adrian Travis. Back in autumn 1986, while he was an optics-obsessed grad student, Mr. Travis had an idea that he called time multiplexing. Suppose you were to pass an image through a lens and open a shutter when it emerged to guide the image out at a precise angle. And suppose you could do that for 30 images a second through each of 10 angles. Like fanning out a deck of cards, you'd beam out 10 angles of your image so quickly that, no matter where the viewer was in relation to the screen, each of his eyes would see its own angle of live video. Voila: natural 3-D. 
 The problem was speed. Movies need 24 frames per second to fool our brain into seeing motion. Video needs 30. Time multiplexing needed 300, and no device existed to deliver it, so Mr. Travis decided he'd just build one himself. ''I thought it was a get-rich-quick scheme,'' he says with a chuckle. ''I'd make my fortune and then decide what I really wanted to do in life.'' Instead, it followed the course of so many other high-tech eurekas: a long, painful succession of investors nibbling away at it, until the trail of licenses and sub-licenses reached from Europe to Asia to Los Angeles and Dan Mapes. 
 Mr. Mapes is a New Age-bedazzled baby boomer and high-tech savant who's been preaching the gospel of virtual worlds ever since the 1960's. His eclectic resume ranges from designing light shows for Peter Gabriel to running online video-conferences for the United Nations. He was in his lab in Santa Monica, Calif., three years ago when a former employee then working in Korea called him to rave about time multiplexing. So Mr. Mapes went to a Northrop Grumman military laboratory in the San Fernando Valley, where Mr. Travis's latest demo box, a 50-inch giant, had been gathering dust. 
 And what he saw, he says, changed his career plans on the spot. He and two partners, Paul Yoon and Robert Kory, spent $2 million in investment capital and three years gathering all the relevant patents and licenses under one corporate umbrella to build their first HD3D. 
 The small company, which has yet to book its first actual sale to a manufacturer, is hardly guaranteed to win the 3-D race, but time multiplexing, the only rear-projection no-glasses 3-D system to date, may give it an edge over larger players. Toshiba's flat-panel screen, for instance, alternates rows of pixels to deliver different angles to each eye in order to produce a 3-D effect, but at the cost of the screen's resolution: 480 lines to Deep Light's 1,280. Deep Light says that the first PC monitors with natural 3-D could be out as soon as this winter for around $5,000 and the HD3D television sets could be available by next year for $10,000 -- a number that might not be out of the question for slavering home-theater freaks. These prices could drop when the technology is mass-produced. All this, of course, depends to a large degree on Deep Light's finding manufacturers willing to license its technology (though they are putting 3-D PC monitors into production themselves). 
 HD3D isn't the first, or even the biggest, high-tech attempt to change the way people watch television. Yet aside from the advent of cable, the viewing experience remains largely the same. (Even TiVO is still a minority taste, to say nothing of interactive TV.) 
 If 3-D is to have a big impact on American living rooms, the first indication, paradoxically, may come at the multiplex. The film industry has lately been conducting its own experiments: last winter, for example, 2 percent of the screens that played the animated Tom Hanks film ''Polar Express'' did so in Imax 3-D. Those few screens were responsible for 22 percent of the movie's domestic ticket sales. 
 ''Everyone in town sees 3-D as the killer app for digital cinema,'' says Joshua Greer, chief executive of Real D, whose hardware and software for 3-D delivery lets theaters exhibit digital films economically in both 2-D and 3-D. In March, the company announced its first deal, with the Mann Theaters chain, and will also provide the equipment for Disney's plans, revealed last week, to release ''Chicken Little'' in 3-D on 100 screens this fall. Mr. Greer says he hopes to be on 1,000 screens by next summer. 
 ''We're on the cusp of a stereo renaissance,'' says the director James Cameron (''Titanic'''), a hardcore technophile. ''I'm doing all my films in stereo from now on, and just waiting for the display technology to catch up, both at the theater and the consumer level.'' 
 Meanwhile, the games industry has been eager to adapt to the evolving technology: hit titles like Halo 2 and Spiderman are already programmed in 3-D, ready for the day when TV screens are ready to show them in all their glory. And both the new Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 use platform standards that support 3-D. 
 It will almost certainly be years, however, before anyone starts making ordinary television shows in 3-D, a situation that suggests a typical chicken-and-egg problem -- why would the hardware giants build 3-D sets if there's nothing playing to seduce consumers into buying them? Because, Deep Light and its competitors hope, the old 2-D programming can be retrofitted to new sets. ''We can synthetically create the 3-D data that's lost when you film with a 2-D camera,'' says Chris Yewdall, chief executive of Dynamic Digital Depth, a 3-D technology company in San Monica. The company's software in Sharp's 3-D laptop lets you watch ordinary DVD's in 3-D; in theory, a similar box, plugged into your HD3D system, would render every movie on Netflix fit for 3-D conversion. ''As the 3-D display market reaches a certain size,'' Mr. Yewdall says, ''we think Hollywood will be quite interested in exploiting those screens for their libraries.'' Ready for ''The Honeymooners'' in 3-D? ''Desperate 3-D Housewives?'' Might your children enjoy, say, rampaging 3-D dinosaurs? 
 ''Jurassic Park in 3D?'' Mr. Mapes yells. ''It's mind-blowing! Martial arts in 3-D are so good! Porn in 3-D? Oh my God '' 
 Do we really need porn in 3-D? Will ''Casablanca'' be a better film when we can reach out and touch Ingrid Bergman? Will sitcoms be funnier and dramas more engrossing when writers create stories that move not only up/down and right/left but also in/out? 
 We're no more likely today to make an accurate prediction of the future of 3-D entertainment than the average talkie-era moviegoer would have been to anticipate ''The Matrix.'' But when our ancestors painted bison on the walls at Lascaux, they were using the most advanced tools they had to depict their world as richly as possible, and we've been upgrading as fast as technology permits ever since. The transition to 3-D might someday look like just the next stop on a path we've been traveling all along, from sound to color to interactive -- and beyond.
 ''These 3-D screens are going to be the head ends into the high-speed Internet,'' Mr. Mapes says. ''Their ultimate application is networked virtual environments.'' 
 ''Imagine 3-D TV hooked up to the Net,'' Mr. Mapes says. ''I'm in California having shared experiences with friends in Indonesia. Forging deeper connections with people anywhere in the world will be one of the key factors in creating a true global village.'' And so, perhaps, will a cool new way to watch ''Malcolm in the Middle.''

HEADLINE: Beset by Opposition, Broadwater Bets On Washington and Time

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
TEST the political winds swirling around the huge floating natural-gas terminal that Broadwater Energy wants to build in the Long Island Sound, and it is easy to conclude that the project is doomed. 
 Many environmental and civic groups hate the idea. Questions have been raised about the terminal's safety, its security from attack and environmental hazards, and even whether it will be needed by the time it can be built. 
 Senators, members of Congress, the Suffolk County Legislature, the Town of Riverhead and other towns in Suffolk have all lined up against it.
 Even the location of the office that Broadwater opened in Riverhead to promote the project seems ill starred: just a few doors from where the old Long Island Lighting Company rented space 30 years ago to talk up a Jamesport nuclear power plant that never came to be. 
 But Broadwater executives express confidence that they can make the platform a reality, despite all the omens and objections. 
 The company appears to be counting on two trump cards: Washington and wait-and-see. The energy bill now before Congress promises to give a federal agency the power to override state and local objections to the siting of gas terminals.
 And while few influential voices have come out squarely for the plan, many are declining to take a position until more specifics are known about the proposal and its impact, frustrating opponents' efforts to kill it quickly before it can gather momentum. 
 For a century, America got all its natural gas from domestic sources or by pipeline from Canada and Mexico. But with those supplies no longer growing fast enough to keep up with booming demand, the energy industry, with the strong backing of the Bush administration, is trying to build new facilities to import gas from Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East by tanker, transported in a supercold liquefied form known as L.N.G. 
 Energy analysts and others who are watching the progress of more than 30 proposals for L.N.G. terminals around the United States say that Broadwater Energy, a partnership of Shell and the TransCanada Corporation, is clearly operating in an unfriendly climate. 
 For one thing, of the 30 proposed terminals around the country, no more than 10 are expected to be built, experts say. 
 Giant energy companies like Exxon Mobil are competing fiercely to build rival projects and are making rapid progress along the Gulf of Mexico, where there is much less local opposition and where one analyst says all the L.N.G. terminals that are needed will be built. 
 New terminals are also proposed in eastern Canada that could supply the northeastern United States.
 But Broadwater's senior vice president, John Hritcko Jr., a Cornell graduate with more than 26 years of experience in the natural gas industry, seemed far from conceding in a recent interview that the project was in any trouble.
 ''It's early in the process, and there is still a lot of time for people to change their minds,'' he said. ''Both Shell and TransCanada are firmly behind this project.'' 
 Broadwater has no intention of forcing a gigantic hazard down local throats, he said. ''If we can't build this thing and operate it safely, if it can't be done in an environmentally sound fashion, and if can't be consistent with the uses of the Sound, we won't build it,'' Mr. Hritcko said.
 Facts have been in somewhat short supply so far. When Broadwater announced its proposal last November, it released little more than an artist's rendering, a location and a few overall dimensions -- the shiplike terminal is expected to be 1,200 feet long and 180 feet wide.
 More will become known when the company files its formal application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in November; it originally planned to file no later than September. Mr. Hritcko said the information the company is gathering for that application will convince the undecided that the terminal will be a boon to Long Island energy consumers.
 For their part, Broadwater's opponents -- including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Congressmen Timothy Bishop of Southampton and Steve Israel of Huntington, Suffolk County, the Town of Riverhead and several other municipalities, state legislators from eastern Long Island and an array of environmental and civic groups -- say the pertinent facts about the project are already on the table. 
 Having two or three giant L.N.G. tankers a week delivering gas to the terminal, nine miles north of the Riverhead shore but still in New York State waters, would harmfully industrialize the eastern Sound, they say. The terminal, close to both a busy shipping lane and heavily used fishing and recreational waters, would be vulnerable to catastrophic accidents and present an all too tempting target for terrorists. It would spoil the view and require a security zone. And it would undermine efforts to develop renewable energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
 The economic benefits of greatly expanding the region's gas supply are central to Broadwater's case. It would supply about one billion cubic feet of gas a day, enough to satisfy one-quarter to one-third of total gas demand in downstate New York and southern Connecticut, depending on the season. 
 About half the gas would go to New York City and almost one-third to its northern suburbs and Connecticut; only about 200 million cubic feet a day, or one-fifth of the total, would be for Long Island. Still, that is enough to supply all the gas used by customers of KeySpan, the Island's gas distribution utility, in the summer -- about 190 million cubic feet a day -- and about one-third of the 650 million cubic feet a day they now consume in winter. (Gas used by electric power plants is not counted in those figures.) 
 The terminal will also be able to stockpile eight billion cubic feet of gas, the company said, helping stabilize supplies and prices in a region that is hungry for more gas than existing pipelines can deliver and helping encourage more users to switch from oil to gas, which burns much more cleanly. 
 Tom Woods, a senior consultant and natural gas analyst for Platts Analytics and Forecasting, said that Broadwater's chosen location made the economics more attractive, because of proximity both to users and to sources of supply across the Atlantic. 
 ''Shipping distance will be shorter, and when gas is delivered, it's right there by the customers,'' Mr. Woods said. ''If you send it all the way down to the Gulf, that's a lot more miles, and then you have to send it up again through pipelines.'' Cutting out all that distance would reduce prices, he said. 
 Over all, Broadwater says that consumers would save $6 billion in energy costs from 2010 to 2020; it has not said how it calculated that figure. 
 Opponents say there are better options for supplying more gas to Long Island that will soon make the Broadwater terminal unnecessary, including the Iroquois pipeline from Milford, Conn., to Northport, which is already operating, and several more in development. 
 David J. Manning, executive vice president for corporate affairs of KeySpan, which has remained neutral on the Broadwater proposal, said new pipelines are central to the company's planning. ''We have continued to address the need for additional gas for Long Island,'' he said, ''and our focus specifically has been on the Islander East pipeline project and the Millennium project.'' 
 Islander East, a 50-mile pipeline meant to transport 260 million cubic feet a day through Connecticut to Yaphank, is a partnership of KeySpan and Duke Energy; it was supposed to be completed by 2003 but has been tied up by litigation in Hartford, where state agencies have refused to issue necessary permits. 
 Millennium, inwhich KeySpan acquired a 21 percent stake last September, is a larger pipeline being built to supply the New York metropolitan area from west of the Hudson, starting in the winter of 2006-7. Millennium has so far not been able to win approval for a branch to cross the river and supply Long Island. 
 KeySpan, which also operates gas- and oil-fired power plants, including four on Long Island, is applying for permission to expand its L.N.G. terminal on Narragansett Bay in Providence, R.I.; that project, too, faces intense political and public resistance on environmental and safety grounds. 
 On Long Island, Broadwater has called for everyone to withhold judgment of its project until more information is available. Opponents say that is a strategy meant to delay intervention by crucial decision makers until it is too late.
 ''Broadwater is asking elected officials to take a wait-and-see attitude, and they are waiting and seeing, and Broadwater is charging ahead full speed,'' said Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society and a leader of an anti-Broadwater coalition. 
 Mr. Amper said the federal energy bill, which among other things would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the power to override state and local objections to the siting of L.N.G. terminals, would be crippling. The bill has passed in the House and Senate in different versions to be reconciled in a conference committee; both versions include the gas-terminal siting provision.
 ''If Long Islanders don't have anything to say about it, a powerful multinational company has a chance to get its approvals from the Fed whether we like it or not,'' Mr. Amper said. 
 Others said there was still time to scrutinize the proposal and environmental studies that Broadwater must prepare for the commission. The board of the Long Island Association, a business group, approved a resolution in mid-June announcing its readiness to listen. 
 ''The region is going to need more energy, including natural gas, and these people should have the opportunity to make their case fully,'' said Matthew T. Crosson, the association's president. ''And everybody in the community, including public officials, should be heard by FERC prior to a decision being made.''
 Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board and Long Island's senior planner, was also withholding judgment. ''Some of the opposition is somewhat premature,'' he said.
 Almost alone among environmentalists, Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Manhattan said the Broadwater project deserved consideration. ''Let's try to look at it in a rational way,'' he said. Mr. Gupta said a small task force with New York and Connecticut members should be created to look into whether the gas was needed. 
 Senator Schumer opposes the project and has called it a contentious waste of time for the region.
 ''We do need a smart and comprehensive strategy to meet energy needs here on Long Island, but this L.N.G. terminal will take so long and be so controversial that it's going to take our attention away from the real issue at hand,'' he said in a statement in May. He voted against the Senate energy bill. 
 But Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who voted in support of the bill, has stopped short of taking an unequivocal stand. She raised environmental, economic and safety questions in a May 25 letter to the commission chairman, Pat Wood III, and seemed skeptical of the project in an interview last month on News 12 Long Island, but her office has not issued a statement confirming her views. Mr. Wood said in early June that Senator Clinton's concerns would be addressed when the commission considers Broadwater's permit application.
 Broadwater says that people concerned with safety should applaud the fact that its proposed terminal would be far offshore. ''We are talking nine miles away,'' Mr. Hritcko said. ''Its location is the biggest safety factor going for it.'' A 2004 report for the Energy Department by the Sandia Corporation said the effects of a fire at an L.N.G. terminal would probably be contained within one and a half miles.
 The Coast Guard is in the process of assessing the safety and security risks of the terminal and will also look at whether the proposed site and its surrounding security zone would obstruct commercial shipping. Mr. Hritcko said the proposed site would pose no problems for shipping and should not be changed. But Broadwater also disclosed that it had already shifted the location 1.3 miles west to accommodate fishermen. 
 While Broadwater and its two energy-giant parent companies say they are listening to local opinion, in the end a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could outweigh all but the most vigorous political opposition. Asked if Broadwater would go ahead even if the public overwhelmingly opposed the project, Mr. Hritcko declined to answer directly. ''We would have to look at it at that point in time,'' he said. 
 Opponents say popular opinion will prevail. ''Never doubt the strength of the public,'' said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale. ''If we get big enough opposition, we can stop this monstrosity.'' 
 Much may depend on where the Long Island Power Authority comes down on the issue. The authority, whose fuel costs and electric rates are among the highest in the country, is studying the possible economic effects of the terminal, with a report due in late summer or early fall. 
 ''We have a significant financial interest in the project because of its impact on rates, one way or the other,'' said Richard Kessel, the chairman of the authority. 
 In the past, Mr. Kessel has had Gov. George E. Pataki's ear on Long Island energy issues, so results of the power authority's study may influence the state's stance on the project. Under current law, the terminal would need permits from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and from the New York Department of State, which would rule on whether it is consistent with the state's coastal zone management plan.
 Governor Pataki has not taken a position. Jennifer Meicht, a spokeswoman for the governor, said that the need for new sources of energy for Long Island had to be balanced by the need for environmental protection, but that further comment was premature because the state had yet to receive a project proposal. 
 For all that, at least one analyst believes time is not really on Broadwater's side at all. Philip Dodge, an energy analyst for the Stanford Group in Houston, said that the United States needs only about eight new L.N.G. terminals, and he predicted that Texas and Louisiana would build that many before proposals like Broadwater's in the Northeast or on the West Coast could get through the approval process.
 ''A lot of these other projects are going to be left behind, because there will be so much capacity in four or five years'' that they won't be needed, Mr. Dodge said. ''What happens is that these things get delayed. They have to have all kinds of local permits, and that's when the delays start cutting in.''

HEADLINE: Farmingville's Rock and Hard Place

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
IF there were a public-policy superhero on the landscape -- one who could stem illegal immigration, create affordable housing in the suburbs, raise the minimum wage, end global economic displacements, guarantee liberty and justice for all and assure that lawns were mowed and beans were picked at reasonable rates -- there would be no trouble in Farmingville today.
 But Farmingville exists in the real world, where problems of all kinds tend to collide, overlap and linger unaddressed, until someone comes along and attacks one of them, forgetting it is connected to the others -- often thereby creating a whole new problem.
 By some accounts, that is what happened a week ago when the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, ordered his police department to join forces with the Town of Brookhaven building inspectors in shutting down an illegal rooming house. The raid resulted in the arrest of a landlord and the displacement of about 60 men, all or most of them illegal immigrants who work as day laborers. 
 Advocates for the workers assailed Mr. Levy for what they called an unnecessarily harsh assault that pushed 60 people in precarious circumstances into homelessness. 
 But neighbors applauded Mr. Levy's boldness in attacking a problem that they had been asking public officials to do something -- anything -- about for a long time: migrants from Mexico and Central America who mass at street corners each morning seeking a day's work, living in overcrowded and unsightly homes next door to them.
 ''They bought a house with a white picket fence, so their kids could have good schools and enjoy the American dream,'' Mr. Levy said of those neighbors, many of whom he first met when he served as the state assemblyman from the Farmingville area. ''Having 30 people in a flophouse next door was not part of the arrangement. They didn't sign up for this.''
 According to this view, the problem in such cases is not one of migrants per se, but of property rights and building codes. ''If the flophouse was inhabited by 60 Caucasians, or college kids, we would have done the same thing,'' Mr. Levy said, referring to the raid on June 20. 
 But as other officials from New York to California know well, a decades-long influx of Latino immigrants, many of them in the country illegally, and a national immigration policy that varies between neglectful accommodation and harsh enforcement have left local officials like Mr. Levy holding a Rubik's cube of public policy problems.
 At every turn, these officials find themselves out of alignment with one or another mission of government. For example, police officers who try to forge relationships with people in immigrant communities find that those sources dry up when there is any whiff of federal immigration surveillance. Building and health inspectors face similar suspicions when they try to gain access to rooming houses. 
 Shutting down a rooming house may put a large number of people on the street, as happened in Farmingville. But federal laws forbid the use of social-services money to aid illegal immigrants, so local officials who want to help relocate the displaced must do so at arm's length, usually by enlisting charities and nonprofit groups.
 Citizens tend to see what results as stasis. ''People stand up at meetings and say, 'The town is not doing anything!''' said Jon Kaiman, the North Hempstead supervisor, who frequently receives complaints about overcrowded rooming houses in New Cassel or Port Washington or Carle Place. ''The truth is, we are doing a lot, but it's a slow process.''
 Pressure from homeowners' groups may be speeding it up. Town and county officials said the Farmingville raid was the first of as many as 117 planned closures in Suffolk. North Hempstead is seeking injunctions against several operators of flophouses, too. 
 ''People are angrier and angrier,'' Mr. Kaiman said. ''We have to show that we are doing something.''
 That something may prove to be a bit gentler, at least initially, than it was in Farmingville. Mr. Kaiman says he has already lined up charitable groups to help in the event of any future raids and closures in North Hempstead. And after taking a public drubbing over his county's tactics, Mr. Levy said Tuesday that future raids in Suffolk would probably also be accompanied by similar social-service efforts.
 But these are matters of style rather than substance. The options are pretty much the same for officials here and across the country, and those options are few.
 ''We have many of the same problems that you see on Long Island, and New Jersey and Atlanta and Kansas City,'' said Maria Giuriato, a city councilwoman in Salinas, Calif., where farms attract large numbers of migrant workers. 
 ''Mexicans are fleeing by the thousands and thousands -- in Oaxaca, for instance, the coffee growers are suffering from competition from Nafta,'' Ms. Giuriato said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. ''There are whole towns without men in them. They all come here, and there is not enough affordable housing. Wages are too low. Workers are forced to live in very bad conditions.'' 
 Besides sitting on the Salinas city council, Ms. Giuriato also serves as the community relations director for the Department of Social and Employment Services in Monterey County. 
 When flophouses are closed in Salinas, inspectors and police officers hand out calling cards for agencies like the Monterey County Housing Advocacy Council, a private group that helps relocate anyone, no questions asked. 
 ''They recently shut down a storefront where 30 men were stacked like cordwood,'' said Marilyn Dorman, the council's executive director. ''Some of them trickled in here looking for help. Most of them didn't. There is a wariness of anything that looks official.''
 Advocates on Long Island were incensed when even such token aid was not forthcoming in Farmingville. ''So now where do these people go? That is the question,'' said the Rev. Allan Ramirez, pastor of the Brookville Reformed Church and an advocate for Latino workers on Long Island. ''What is the benefit to the community of putting people out on the street? There is none.''
 Advocates like Mr. Ramirez and Xochitl Castaneda, the coordinator of the Institute of Mexicans Abroad at the University of California, in Berkeley, argue that immigrants, legal or illegal, contribute in a major way to the local and national economy and do not deserve to be treated as quasi-criminals. 
 ''Undocumented workers add $120 billion a year to the national economy and pay between $25 billion and $30 billion in taxes,'' said Ms. Castaneda. ''They receive no benefit from those taxes. They are denied access to health care, government assistance or the civil protections of the law.''
 The anonymity of the immigrants' lives, in most cases a purposeful blending-in, makes their occasional surfacing on the front pages all the more startling -- whether as victims of a 2000 attack in Farmingville by white supremacists, or under the glare of television cameras trained on the dilapidated house where 64 men are said to have lived in 900 square feet of space.
 But beneath the surface of that virtual invisibility -- an invisibility that enshrouds them even as they cut grass and blow leaves, bus tables, paint houses, lay bricks, dig ditches, haul asbestos, strip roofs, pour blacktop -- the emotions evoked by the day laborers are strong. 
 One neighborhood advocate in Farmingville calls them terrorists. Murky ''patriot'' groups from the Far West have organized marches to denounce them.
 Mr. Ramirez, the advocate, said that Mr. Levy's raid amounted to ''ethnic cleansing,'' a remark that prompted Mr. Levy to fire the phrase ''lunatic fringe'' at Mr. Ramirez, who responded in an interview by calling Mr. Levy evil.
 ''We have helped to close down a place where men were living in concentration-camp-like conditions,'' Mr. Levy said Tuesday. ''If there were a fire in that house, and people died, the same people who attack me for closing it would be attacking me'' for not having closed it, he said.
 As for the emotions of the immigrants themselves, leery as they are of newspaper reporters as well as building inspectors, the record is incomplete but emerging piecemeal. The Bi-National Health Task Force, a joint group of researchers from Mexico and the United States, found in one recent study that after diabetes and hypertension, the most common health problem among Latino immigrant workers was depression.
 ''They are away from their families for long periods, and they are living in crowded conditions with no access to health care,'' said Ms. Giuriato of Salinas, a member of the 30-member task force. ''After 10 years of this, the predominant experience is depression.''

HEADLINE: 21 School Districts Adopt Austerity Budgets 

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
AT the end of the school year, administrators and school boards typically wind down and welcome the relief of summer vacation. But this year, there was neither a wind-down nor relief for many Long Island school districts. 
 After the defeat of 45 of the Island's 125 school budgets on May 17, 42 districts recalculated their expenses for a second vote, knowing that if their budgets were voted down again, they would have no choice but to adopt state-mandated austerity budgets for the next year.
After the second round of votes had concluded on June 23, 21 districts -- a record number on the Island -- were forced to adopt austerity budgets and must figure out how to make the cuts necessary to comply with state law.
 The law restricts austerity budgets to spending caps based on inflation, which this year means a 3.24 percent increase over the districts' previous budgets. In most cases that will mean cuts in staff, programs, transportation, capital projects, sports teams and clubs. 
 ''For the districts forced to go on austerity, this is devastating,'' said Kathy Dowling, the director of the Nassau Region P.T.A. ''There will be no choice but to cut educational programs and extracurricular activities that will impact on the children. My fear is that this will pit parent groups against one another as they fight for programs that involve their own kids, and we won't feel the full negative impact until well into the next school year.''
 George Duffy, the superintendent of the Seaford school district, which had to cut $900,000 for an austerity budget of $44.2 million, agreed. ''One of the programs we eliminated was middle-school sports,'' he said. ''We had 400 kids who were going to play on seventh- and eighth-grade teams, and now they'll be going home after school.''
 That was just one of many cuts that the Seaford district made after its voters rejected a budget with an increase of 6.8 percent -- lower than the previous year's budget, which passed despite its 7.7 percent increase. Also being cut are a guidance program, building repairs, new equipment and textbooks, and five elementary teachers, which will result in some larger classes. 
 Seaford was one of nine districts on the Island that presented the same budget to voters a second time; four passed and five were defeated again.
 Among the 34 districts that pared their budgets for the second vote, 20 were successful and 14 were not. 
 So what went wrong?
 Lorraine Deller, the executive director of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association, said that while the reasons varied from district to district, there were several common factors.
 ''People are angry and frustrated by their high taxes,'' she said. ''But if they have to pay such high taxes, they want to make sure that the money is being spent wisely by their districts. The Roslyn scandal generated new concerns.''
 Ms. Deller said that because of some costs over which there was little or no control -- like teacher retirement-fund payments, health insurance, and fuel and energy costs -- ''school districts had no place to go other than to their taxpayers.'' 
 Yet ''taxpayers felt that they could no longer be expected to assume an unfair burden for funding their schools,'' she said.
 Three districts that failed on the first round -- Glen Cove, Mineola and Connetquot -- bypassed a second vote and went right to austerity budgets.
 Jerry Cicchelli, the superintendent in Glen Cove, said that because of the district's voting history -- Glen Cove adopted an austerity budget last year -- it decided to forgo a second vote. 
 ''So we bit the bullet and cut our spending by $558,000 to meet the requirements of a contingency budget,'' he said. ''We'll have to make some modifications in class size but will be able to maintain our educational programs. People in the community are pleased that we didn't have to make any draconian cuts, and there is guarded optimism that next year will be better.''
 The mood is more somber in Harborfields, which was forced to adopt an austerity budget after two failures at the polls. 
 ''I have heard many concerns over the future of our school district,'' said Joseph Dragone, its deputy superintendent. He said the budget was resubmitted because district officials thought it ''was as low as we could possibly go without dismantling our educational program, and on the first vote it lost by only 94 votes.'' 
 ''But now that the community has voted down the budget twice,'' he said, ''we had to cut $1.4 million and have begun the process of dismantling our educational programs -- including the elimination of several elementary positions and librarians, our high school science-research program, our award-winning school-to-career program, half of our middle-school sports teams and clubs.''
 Mr. Dragone said that before the revote the district tried to make the public aware of what was in jeopardy, ''but some people didn't believe us and thought we'd find a way to preserve all of our programs.'' 
 ''Without money, you just can't do it,'' he said.
 For some districts, the defeat of a revised budget came as a surprise.
 In Port Washington, for example, a narrowly defeated budget seemed a contradiction to the election of the three pro-budget candidates to the school board. Superintendent Geoffrey Gordon said, ''This philosophical dichotomy gave us the message that while our community appreciates our efforts, at the same time they are having a hard time with such high taxes.''
 A reduction of an additional $2.6 million required for its austerity budget will mean staff reductions, as well as other cuts still to be decided, he said.
 ''We may have to cut sports teams and club activities,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''In the district we have 83 sports teams and 130 students in advanced placement art. We are a district that emphasizes athletics and the arts and are now trying to figure out what we can do to preserve as much as we can.''
 In Sachem, the second budget, which was scaled down by $9 million, was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Sachem, the Island's second-largest district (after Brentwood), will now have to make additional cuts of $3 million, which will translate into teacher cuts, bigger classes, a reduction in the special-education program, the elimination of the remedial summer-school program and the reduction or elimination of many sports teams and clubs. 
 ''There was a lot of anger in the community,'' said the district's superintendent, James Ruck. ''People thought that we should be able to do the same thing with less money.''
 Even for districts whose budgets passed, there was less a sense of exhilaration than of relief.
 Kathy Weiss, the superintendent of the Baldwin school district and the outgoing president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents, said: ''This has been a scary year for Long Island school districts. In Baldwin, we were relieved that our budget passed, but it was a very conservative budget that added nothing new, aside from three sports teams in the middle school for a cost of $10,000. If our budget had failed, we would have had to eliminate our all-day kindergarten. 
 ''There's no way to go on a contingency budget without having to make drastic cuts in a district's instructional program. If we value education -- which we do -- we have to pay for it.''

HEADLINE: The Long Way Home

BYLINE: By Marsha Mehran. 
Marsha Mehran is the author of a novel, ''Pomegranate Soup,'' which will be published by Random House next month.

 BODY:
Growing up, I thought that destiny had marked me for a life of impermanence. I wasn't even 2 years old on Nov. 4, 1979, the day my father hoped to get his visa from the American Embassy in Tehran. Having long harbored academic ambitions, my parents had finally decided to emigrate. They were luckier than many Iranians; they had modest savings and letters of acceptance from the University of New Mexico. A U.S. visa was the only thing standing in their way. 
 Good timing has never been a talent in the Mehran family. That very day, a band of revolutionary students stormed the embassy's front door and took its employees hostage. With the embassy under siege, visas were no longer issued to Iranians, and my parents were forced to abandon their dreams of American academia. Following a friend's advice, they moved to Buenos Aires and opened a Middle Eastern cafe, El Pollo Loco (the Crazy Chicken), where the heady smells of dolmas and spicy beef kebabs were an instant hit with Argentine locals. 
 In Buenos Aires, I attended St. Andrew's, a Scottish private academy where students spoke English exclusively and where we pledged loyalty to the British monarchy every morning. I loved the bagpipe ceremonies and kilted school uniforms. Meanwhile, I was learning three languages simultaneously (Farsi at home, English at school and Spanish in the streets). Every night before going to bed, I was required to say good night in all three languages: ''Shab bekheir, buenas noches and good night.'' 
 With threats of military coups and a collapsing Argentine economy, my parents were forced to sell their beloved cafe. In the spring of 1984, we left again, for Miami. My father found work as a sous chef in a health-food restaurant, and my mother dressed in powder pink and sold Mary Kay cosmetics door to door. Adjusting to the rhythms of American life, I immersed myself in dodgeball and Saturday-morning cartoons. At home, the sofreh, an embroidered picnic cloth, was still covered with platters of buttery lima-bean rice, delicate herb stews and pistachio cake, but in the shopping mall across from our tenement apartment, I indulged in corn dogs, cherry Slurpees and peanut M&M's. 
 Revolutions come in all varieties. For me, the biggest one came at 14, when my parents announced they were divorcing. Somewhere along the line, somewhere between chopping root vegetables and learning to say, ''Let Mary Kay make your day,'' their marriage had lost ground. My mother and I went to live in Australia, where my grandparents migrated after the revolution in Iran. Although the quirky vocabulary of the Australians and the warmth of my new schoolmates helped ease the pain of my parents' separation, Australia struck me as barren.
 I don't think I was fully aware of what was wrong, why I felt so unmoored in Australia. All I knew was that I did not belong in that pale, homogenized culture with its sausage sizzles and flat beer. So in 1997, at 19, I left for New York with about $200 in my pocket. I told myself that I was seeking new adventures, but I think I was looking for a place to call home.
 I took on a variety of bizarre jobs in Manhattan -- a Broadway poster hanger, personal assistant on film sets, hostess in a restaurant owned by Russian mobsters and the odd, humiliating waitressing gig. I also met my husband, an Irishman who worked as a bartender at Ryan's Irish Pub on Second Avenue. 
 According to my father, an Irishman was an Iranian once removed. ''Ireland,'' my father said when I notified him of my impending nuptials, ''Ireland is really Iran-Land.'' Crazy, perhaps, but there was something appropriate about marrying an Irishman, as if my Celtic schooling had somehow predestined such a meeting. My husband's name is Christopher, same as the patron saint of travelers.
 Christopher and I lived for two years in a cottage in the west of Ireland. But now our days abroad are over, and we're back in the United States. We have settled in Brooklyn, where, of all the places I've been, I feel most myself. I understand Brooklyn in my bones: the juxtaposition of so many voices, so many souls, so many foods, so many cultures. It is in this most American of cities that I have chosen to set down roots -- because it seems to me no other place better embodies the world. 
 I know that identity is a major concern for many first-generation immigrants in America, but I find that I'm not preoccupied with hyphenated labels. When people ask me where I am from, I say I am Persian, born in Iran. I write and dream in English, I curse in Spanish and, after a few pints of Guinness, I dance a mighty Irish jig. And when people ask me where I live, I tell them Brooklyn is my home.

HEADLINE: A Beach Community in an Awkward Transition

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
THE transformation of Fairfield's central beach neighborhood is understandably disconcerting to residents who find themselves craning their necks to glimpse the tops of the three-story turreted houses rising around them. Yet at the same time, they can't help but marvel at their good fortune. Encroaching wealth has driven up land values such that the aging six-room Capes that once made the beach one of Fairfield's more affordable areas now get $700,000 or more as teardowns. 
 Trish and Tom Sullivan moved into one of those Capes in 1997, when beach prices were still in the $200,000 to $300,000 range. By 2001, their family of four had outgrown the space, so the Sullivans expanded upward, essentially converting their house into a colonial. ''We were one of the first on our street to do that, and people were walking by gawking at it,'' said Mrs. Sullivan, a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. ''Now, the joke around here is: 'Ha! Remember when we thought your house was big?''' 
Over the last three years, the Sullivans' house has shrunk relative to the 4,000- to 6,000-square-foot shingled colonials that have come to represent the new beach style. While Mrs. Sullivan, who grew up in Fairfield, said she worries that these huge multimillion-dollar houses will eventually outnumber the modest homes that give the neighborhood a casual family-friendly feel, she can't help but be pleased by the corresponding rise in her own property value. 
 ''We're fortunate we got in when we did,'' she said. ''I just never would have thought this could happen.'' 
 Buyers priced out of waterfront communities farther south along the Fairfield County commuter line have touched off an extended building boom in the neighborhoods around Fairfield's beaches. The makeover is particularly pronounced along the shady, suburban streetscapes between downtown's historic Old Post Road and the mile-plus stretch of uninterrupted beach along Long Island Sound. Though much of the beachfront is privately owned, the beauty and accessibility of the town's two largest public beaches -- Jennings and Penfield -- enhance the value of properties throughout the 1.6-square-mile area. Even after several years of explosive growth in beach-area home prices, property values continue to climb. 
 Capes, ranches and bungalows are coming down so quickly that the town planner's office has lost count, said Joseph E. Bienkowski, the planner specializing in coastal development. He offers a ''conservative estimate'' of 20 beach teardowns and 10 substantial renovations in just the last year. Because most beach lots are little more than a quarter of an acre, yards are disappearing beneath houses designed to wring every dollar of value out of the land. 
 ''What we're seeing more of now, which we didn't see even 10 years ago, is builders taking advantage of the third-story allowance in these zones,'' Mr. Bienkowski said. ''Also, they'd never bumped up against the lot coverage allowance before. These old Capes typically cover 8 to 14 percent of the lot, but the new houses are right up against the 20-percent limit.'' 

What You'll Find
 The resulting hodgepodge of cottages, Capes, newer colonials and contemporaries and palatial Nantucket-style houses exemplifies a community in the midst of an awkward transition. The shift is most prominently symbolized by the $2.249 million stone-and-shingle home towering above a row of humble bungalows on Fairfield Beach Road, the well-traveled avenue following the shoreline. 
 Across the street from the beach, the house is loaded with luxuries, including a master suite with a fireplace, whirlpool tub and heated bathroom floors; a third-floor media room with a wet bar; and balcony views of the Long Island Sound. At 5,500 square feet, the house was able to accommodate some 175 people at a party given there recently by the builder, Bob Sabre of Beachside Estates. 
 ''I'd love to make a house a little smaller,'' said Mr. Sabre, who, with his partner Tom Kane has built and sold about a dozen houses at the beach and has eight more in various stages of development. ''But you know what? People want big. They want all the rooms, and all the space.'' 
 The destruction of older homes is encouraged, some residents complain, by regulations that make it prohibitively expensive for homeowners to renovate. 
 Because the beach neighborhoods are in a flood zone, under federal regulations any homeowner making an improvement that costs more than 50 percent of the structure's value must fully comply with Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations for building in areas prone to flooding. In most cases, that means elevating the house and filling in the basement. 
 The town's strict enforcement of the flood code is in homeowners' best interests, particularly in light of rising sea levels, said Mr. Bienkowski, the planner. According to a Connecticut College study, the water level of Long Island Sound rose three inches from 1979 to 1989 and another five inches from 1989 to 1999. As it is, Mr. Bienkowski noted, severe storms have been known to flood the parking lot of Town Hall three-fifths of a mile from the Sound. 

What They're Asking
 Prices in the beach area range from about $450,000 to more than $3 million, with an average list price of $1.1 million. Lower-priced properties are found along busy Reef Road, where the notorious rowdiness of Fairfield University students sharing rentals has resulted in frequent clashes with year-round residents. Elsewhere in the area, buyers in search of properties under $800,000 must be quick to act, according to Julie Vanderblue, president of the Higgins Group real estate agency. 
 ''If it's priced well, it's going to go overnight,'' Ms. Vanderblue said. ''You're not going to get 3,000 square feet for under $1 million, but if you can compromise on space or wait on a new kitchen, it's worth it because the property will definitely hold its value.'' 
 The median sale price of a single-family home in the beach area has more than doubled in the last five years, she said, to $745,000 from $340,000 in 2000. The highest sale to date, $2.287 million, occurred last year, but three higher-priced properties, including one listed at $5.25 million, recently went under contract. 
 ''Two years ago, we thought prices were going to level,'' said Mr. Sabre, the builder. ''They kept going up. Then a year ago, we thought it was going to happen. It didn't. Now, it seems like it's peaking, but I really don't know.'' 

What to Do
 During warm months, Penfield and Jennings Beaches are hubs of activity from dawn to dusk. Throughout the summer, the Parks and Recreation Department adds sailing and swimming lessons, outdoor movie nights and a spectacular Fourth of July fireworks display. Parking restrictions on residential streets limit traffic spillover from the beach. 
 Boaters have a full-service facility in the town-operated South Benson Marina, but nearly 1,300 residents are on the waiting list for the 600 boat slips, according to Robin Bimmel, the marina manager. The wait for a small slip is about four years, and twice that for large slips. Fees, at $320 to $800 for the season (April through November), are about one-third the cost of private marinas. 

The Schools
 The Roger Sherman Elementary School is a focal point for the beach neighborhoods -- the annual family cookouts and ice cream socials are community events. ''Everyone here seems to have either been through the school, will go through it or is currently at the school,'' said Michael Giarratano, who just completed his ninth and final year as principal. 
 Enrollment at the school, which has kindergarten to Grade 5, hovers around 430; five classrooms are outside the school in separate portable structures. The school's academic performance on the 2003 Connecticut Mastery Test mirrored the district averages: 93 percent of Sherman students scored at the proficient level in math, and 90 percent showed proficiency in reading. 
 Sherman students go on to Tomlinson Middle School for Grades 6 to 8, and then to the new Ludlowe High School. Both schools are downtown. SAT scores for the class of 2004 averaged 550 in verbal and 557 in math; state averages were 508 and 518, respectively.

The Commute
 A crew of commuters can be seen making their daily morning trek from the beach area to the downtown train station. Walking is often preferable to trying to find a parking space, especially for residents whose names haven't yet risen to the top of the town's lengthy waiting list for station parking permits. The trip to Grand Central Terminal on Metro-North Railroad's New Haven line during peak commuting hours is 70 to 80 minutes. 

The History
 Living at the Fairfield beaches wasn't fashionable until midway into the 20th century. During the late 1800's, trains arrived daily bringing wealthy vacationers from New York, but the visitors stayed well back from the beach in a fancy resort called Fairfield House. According to a town history written by Thomas J. Farnham, the first people to live at the beach were average folks who traveled down from Danbury in the 1890's, and their cluster of rustic summer cottages was dubbed Little Danbury. 
 Shorefront living could be hard, as flooding was a recurring problem. After the hurricane of 1938 destroyed dozens of cottages along the shore, flood protections were put in place that enabled more permanent development. Development pressures increased in the 1970's, and the town bought 1.8 acres of land with 280 feet of shorefront along Fairfield Beach Road to preserve for public use. 
 The town had earlier acquired 16 acres of beach property presented as a gift from Annie B. Jennings, the wealthy owner of a sprawling estate called Sunnie-holme that once stretched from Old Post Road to the shoreline. 

What We Like
 Refreshing in its economic diversity, Fairfield's beach area lacks the exclusivity of many shore communities to the south. Whether you live in a cottage or a castle, you enjoy the same access to the beaches and other amenities. 

What We'd Change
 In response to residents' complaints, the town made a meager attempt to rein in house sizes by lowering the maximum height from 40 feet to 32 feet. The effect is negligible, as much of the new construction continues to look grossly out of proportion to the rest of the neighborhood.

HEADLINE: A Leap of Faith

BYLINE: By RENEE WATABE. 
Renee Watabe, who lives in Verona, N.J., is a patient advocate in a hospital emergency department. She is completing a book of personal essays about life-altering experiences.

 BODY:
A LOT of people think I was brainwashed. How else to explain why I would allow the Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church to choose my spouse?
 Most people regard the choice of a life partner as a deeply personal decision, perhaps the most important decision anyone has the opportunity to make; and if you give up that choice, you must be out of your mind. From the outside looking in, this evaluation makes perfect sense. 
 Me, I like to look at things once, twice, again and again. When I was a little girl, my father, a chemical engineer, told me that if you chew a piece of bland bread over and over, holding it in your mouth, it eventually becomes sweet. He was trying to explain to me about the breakdown of the molecules into glucose and such. 
 But what sticks in my mind is the deeper meaning I saw in what he'd said: how anything, any experience, conversation, scene observed or moment reflected upon, is like that bland piece of bread. Look at it a while, chew it, hold it, and it becomes sweet and satisfying. There are hidden surprises and hidden flavors residing in everything and everybody. 
 So how did I find myself on a spring day in 1987, sitting on a bench by a pond in Central Park with a complete stranger, licking vanilla ice cream cones, watching the toy sailboats racing by and discussing our future together as husband and wife? 
 I'd met him only an hour or two earlier. He, like me, was a member of the Unification Church and had been invited to the grand ballroom of the New Yorker Hotel where Reverend Moon was to perform a matchmaking ceremony, pairing a thousand brides with a thousand bridegrooms.
 ''Love your enemy,'' he preached, in echo of Jesus. 
 As we saw it, the path to world peace was through a coupling of the historically polarized: black and white, East and West, Jewish and Muslim. So many nations and religions are historical enemies. We ''Moonies'' were willing to sacrifice personal choice to spin gold out of the raw silk of ourselves, to help create world harmony through family harmony.
 ''I put you together not for your own happiness,'' our spiritual leader said, ''but for the beautiful children your marriages will produce.'' Children whose very existence would challenge established notions of racism. 
 With me, Reverend Moon was preaching to the choir: I was the product of an intercultural marriage myself. Back in the 1950's my white Kansas-born mother had married my Chinese father, who hailed from Shanghai. When they were wed, their marriage was illegal in most of the Southern states. But my mother and father loved each other, and their racially blended relationship was a model for me. 
 So when Reverend Moon asked for those of us who wanted an international marriage to stand, I stepped forward. It wasn't long before he approached me, grasped the sleeve of my dress and tugged me to the middle of the room. I glanced up at the serious face of a handsome young man whom I later learned was born in Japan. We bowed briefly in silence and went off to get acquainted.
 IN a room just off of the grand ballroom, I looked at the young man next to me, born halfway around the world from my American hometown. In a sense I didn't care who he was or what he looked like, only that he was willing, with me, to enter into this commitment to an ideal. 
 The first words he spoke to me were, ''I never want to break this.''
 ''Neither do I,'' I answered. 
 He liked to draw. So did I. 
 He liked to read good books. So did I. 
 He was a man. I was a woman. 
 So far, so good. 
 I had the feeling God was living in this space between us, and that God, like a baby or a tender plant, needed our care and attendance in order to thrive. There was an undeniable sense of holiness about the whole endeavor.
 As is customary, following our engagement and marriage ceremonies several years passed before we consummated our marriage. We were sent on separate church missions: I to South Korea, he to the American Midwest. We understood that a union built upon a foundation of celibacy would purify us for married life and allow us to dedicate our hearts to God and mankind first, spouse and family second. 
 Was I brainwashed? I sit here writing this, 18 years and three children later, on the verge of divorce. Did he and I finally fail after all we've been through? We certainly haven't turned out to be the ideal picture-perfect family we set out to be. Even so, I still find Reverend Moon's vision a beautiful one, this path remarkable, this project admirable. It's just that my husband and I didn't know how hard and gritty the path would be.
 Yet I honestly don't think I was more brainwashed than any young bride, who, starry eyed, says yes to the man of her choosing: the one she met at work, or in a coffee shop, or on a blind date, or in art class. Marriage under any circumstances requires a leap of faith no matter who you are or how your paths may have crossed. My husband and I ate our ice cream, took a chance and leapt.
 It was difficult from the start of course. But we soldiered on. After all, why should achieving a peaceful marriage be any easier than creating a peaceful world? 
 So years passed, our children were born. One had cancer diagnosed when he was 1, and for two straight years he fought for his life. We fought with him -- a hardship, I'm told, that either binds a husband and wife closer together or tears them apart. With us it did neither. 
 Initially I attributed our relationship's ongoing strife and my husband's overall remoteness and anger to ''cultural misunderstandings.'' Then I shifted into the mode of telling myself, ''If only I were a better wife.''
 Whatever the case, I didn't allow myself to consider breaking my wedding vows. My tradition-laden double whammy of being both Asian and religious made the idea of divorce extremely distasteful. Add to that the motto of our movement -- ''Live for the sake of others'' -- and any suffering I might incur from the agreement was rendered inconsequential.
 I prayed. I read ''Fascinating Womanhood,'' which my Christian friends guaranteed would yield the desired result: a happy hubby. In my attempts to be a ''domestic goddess,'' I got my hair done, bought pretty lingerie, read the Bible and prayed harder. After consulting a spiritualist, I prepared a meal and offered it to the presumably angry ancestors of my even angrier husband by throwing it into the Hudson River. None of it worked.
 Finally I came to understand what was missing. The religious call to love your enemy included loving that enemy as you would love yourself, and I didn't love myself. In all the sacrificing I'd done for marriage, children and world peace, I'd lost a sense of who I was and what I wanted. 
 And so I deliberately set out to recapture that sense: I began to draw, to paint and to write. I started having conversations with people from decades past, significant friends from the days before my celibacy and arranged marriage.
 I got in touch with a dear old friend who was gay. He was successful, doing work he loved and, most important, he was in love.
 ''He fills a need in me that is so deep,'' he said of his lover. ''If he didn't exist, I'd have had to dream him up just to go on.'' 
 These words intoxicated me. I wanted that for myself. 
 One evening I removed my wedding rings in front of my husband, held them up and made my declaration. ''We need to do something, '' I said. ''We should try counseling. Something, please.'' I placed the rings on top of our bedroom dresser.
 ''When this marriage is a genuine marriage of heart,'' I continued, ''I will put them back on.''
 But he wouldn't discuss the unhappiness of our marriage, and we never made it to counseling. The rings never made it back to my finger.
 Eventually I fell in love with someone else whose heart miraculously chose me in return. And this experience felt more scriptural, holy and biblical than all the dogma I had tried to live up to for so many years. It was a revelation and it made me wonder, ''How could I simply have given all this power away?''
 PEOPLE marry for all kinds of reasons other than love: to please their families, to satisfy economic demands, to submit to the guidelines of their faith. Cults do indeed come in all shapes and sizes. You don't need to become a Moonie to lose yourself; nearly any club, political party or organized religion has the necessary ingredients. 
 And of course marriages dissolve for all kinds of reasons, too, even those that begin with love. But in one measure my marriage was an undeniable success: my husband and I were blessed with three loving children who are happy, healthy and wise beyond their years. 
 Concerned about how our children were handling the separation and impending divorce, I sat down the other day with my 12-year-old daughter. I meant to reassure her, but it was she who reassured me.
 ''Maybe God put you and Daddy together to have the three of us,'' she said. ''And maybe now it's O.K. for you not to be married. Just look at how happy you are these days.'' 
 A marriage can end; perhaps it even can be doomed from the start. But it's impossible for me to look at my children and regret the chance my husband and I took, that jump into the unknown we made on that beautiful spring day, sitting by the pond in Central Park.

 SEARCHING FOR THE SOUND: My Life With the Grateful Dead. By Phil Lesh. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) It's hard to say which of these miracles is more profound: the fact that after three decades with the Grateful Dead, Lesh has any memories of the experience whatsoever, or that he's been able to consolidate them into a single volume of less than 20,000 pages. In his marvelously economical and engrossing memoir, Lesh, the band's bassist, recounts the Dead's creation against the backdrop of the Bay Area's beatnik culture and its historic performance at Woodstock (and nonperformance at Altamont), but he also takes a frank look at the drug abuse that marred the group's later years, as well as his own struggles with alcohol and with liver disease. Through it all, Lesh proves to be as capable and enthusiastic a writer as he is a musician; whether he's describing the ''immense, turbulent, Druidic'' snoring of Jerry Garcia, the ''saber-toothed crotch cricket'' hum of the Woodstock sound system or a road-trip travel game called ''Radio I-Ching,'' he consistently exhibits a peculiar and poetic fondness for language, transforming what could have been a routine exercise in nostalgia into a work as graceful and sublime as a box of rain. Dave Itzkoff 
 LIKE A ROLLING STONE: Bob Dylan at the Crossroads. By Greil Marcus. (Public-Affairs, $25.) The books written about Bob Dylan could fill up a bookcase -- and any suspicions that the publication of Dylan's extraordinary memoir, ''Chronicles,'' would slow the tide seem premature. ''I've written a lot of books and after reading Dylan's book, I realized I would never write a book that good,'' Marcus said recently. Yet that hasn't stopped him from trying. Marcus's latest -- published eight years after ''Invisible Republic,'' his exploration of Dylan's ''Basement Tapes'' album with the Band -- is a ''biography'' of the singer's signature hit, a single that Rolling Stone magazine recently selected as the greatest song of all time. (Some readers might begin to wonder if Marcus's next book will be an exegesis of the chorus to ''Jokerman.'') Marcus, the author of such landmarks as ''Mystery Train,'' perhaps the finest book ever written about pop music, can still deliver blazing insight. His description of the pure sonics of ''Like a Rolling Stone'' -- a sound so complete and perfectly realized that it ''never plays the same way twice'' -- forces you to approach a 40-year-old song with new ears. The song ''promises a new country,'' Marcus writes; ''now all you have to do is find it.'' But too many tropes in Marcus's cultural criticism are starting to feel overfamiliar, and too much of his own Dylanology is starting to fold in on itself. This book's subtitle is ''Bob Dylan at the Crossroads''; the opening line of ''Invisible Republic'' was ''Once a singer stood at a world crossroads.'' Alan Light
 THE MAYOR OF MacDOUGAL STREET: A Memoir. By Dave Van Ronk with Elijah Wald. (Da Capo, $26.) Wald, a music journalist, pulled together this autobiography of Dave Van Ronk, a folk music pioneer in the 1950's and 60's, from interviews and from a manuscript the singer left behind after his death from cancer in 2002. Van Ronk makes no secret of his curmudgeonly tendencies, and as a narrator he proves to be a mostly endearing and gregarious grouch. In between reminiscences of Dexedrine-fueled road trips and attempts to unload bootleg bottles of absinthe, Van Ronk recounts how he and his youthful contemporaries would toss barbs at old-guard folkies and record labels with the reckless zeal of modern-day bloggers. Sure, he says, ''we threw some babies out with the bath water, but bath water -- comfortably warm and bubbly -- was exactly what a lot of our targets were purveying.'' But his tone shifts noticeably when Bob Dylan arrives on the Greenwich Village scene, and as the student gradually outpaces the master, Van Ronk's resentment is palpable; he even dredges up the old story that Dylan stole his arrangement of ''House of the Rising Sun.'' It's the only unwelcome detour in an otherwise genial and picaresque ramble. D.I.
 THE ROCK SNOB'S DICTIONARY: An Essential Lexicon of Rockological Knowledge. By David Kamp and Steven Daly. (Broadway, paper, $12.95.) Developed from a recurring column in Vanity Fair, this slim book is a note-perfect lexicon of the names, recordings, places and ephemera treasured by those who lord ''their encyclopedic musical knowledge over others.'' (Think John Cusack in ''High Fidelity.'') From provocateur producer Steve Albini to Nudie's Rodeo Tailors (whose bespoke Western wear outfitted Hank Williams, Gram Parsons and Beck), with stops at such unavoidable terminology as ''post-rock'' and ''seminal'' and mandatory references to Brian Wilson every few pages, Kamp and Daly's book equips readers with a sufficient arsenal to make it through the latest issue of Mojo magazine or a thick set of liner notes on a Rhino Records reissue. Of course, try as they might to present their book as a way to ''bridge cultural gaps between snobs and nonsnobs,'' the obvious danger here is that this dictionary is really a way for self-satisfied music geeks to feel even more smug by demonstrating that they -- O.K., we -- can laugh at ourselves. To complain about the occasional odd choice (Kurtis Blow and Whodini, but no DJ Premier?) would be to out myself as a snob among snobs, so . . . never mind. A.L.
 ALL YESTERDAYS' PARTIES. The Velvet Underground in Print: 1966-1971. Edited by Clinton Heylin. (Da Capo, $26.) At bare minimum, this book should finally dispel the adage that whoever saw the Velvet Underground perform live went on to start a band of his own. (Unless Bosley Crowther, the former Times film critic, founded an avant-garde rock combo I'm not familiar with.) To the extent that Heylin's meticulously curated collection of on-the-scene Velvets reportage and reviews forms a narrative, the tale it tells is of how a critical consensus formed -- and then re-formed -- around Lou Reed's group, and it's a story that contains a few surprises, though its ending is never in doubt. In their Warhol-associated days, the Velvets' music managed to alienate the mainstream and alternative presses alike (''What can you say?'' wondered one exasperated writer from Boston Broadside), but in rapid succession, John Cale left, Reed masterminded the albums ''The Velvet Underground'' and ''Loaded,'' and eventually everyone -- even The New York Times -- was compelled to acknowledge their latent greatness. Following a lucid and scholarly introduction, Heylin wisely lets these primary texts speak for themselves, and after Lester Bangs's bittersweet 1971 post-mortem on the recently broken-up band, it's arguable that another word never need be written about them. D.I.
 THE WU-TANG MANUAL. By the RZA with Chris Norris. (Riverhead Freestyle, paper, $16.) This busy handbook is a glimpse inside the brain of the RZA, the producer/spiritual leader of Staten Island's revolutionary hip-hop collective, the Wu-Tang Clan. A glance at the chapter titles -- ''Martial Arts,'' ''Capitalism,'' ''Chess,'' ''Organized Crime,'' ''Technology'' -- presents the recipe for a worldview that made this nine-member group the most distinctive force in urban music of the 1990's. Fifty pages of annotated Wu-Tang lyrics is probably too much, but it's worth trawling through the explications and translations for such gems as the footnote for the line ''Flowin' like Christ'' from the classic single ''Protect Ya Neck'' -- ''We can assume Jesus had mad flow because he could rock any crowd.'' There's something touching about the RZA's account of how kids from the projects learned life strategies and ethics from kung fu movies, and something weirdly inspirational about their ability to take those lessons and expand into brand extensions like a Wu-Tang comic book and a nail salon. A.L.
 THE THRILL OF IT ALL: The Story of Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music. By David Buckley. (Chicago Review, paper, $17.95.) Drawing upon what seems like every previously published word on the subject of Bryan Ferry, the melancholy magnate of glam rock, Buckley has written a classic piece of obsessive British trainspotting. If you've ever wanted to know how the bass line for ''Love Is the Drug'' was recorded or which role Ferry played in his grammar school production of ''Twelfth Night,'' this is the Roxy Music biography for you! Even so, Buckley succeeds in painting a remarkably sympathetic portrait of a decadent musician with an eight-figure net worth. By 1977, Ferry finds himself a poseur in an era of punks, dumped by Jerry Hall for Mick Jagger, creatively outpaced by his former Roxy bandmate Brian Eno and filed under the ''Hates'' column of a famous Malcolm McLaren T-shirt design. After this, though, it's not clear why the book needs to continue for another 100 pages, particularly when Ferry's subsequent recorded output has been so spotty and the details of his life aren't exactly a mystery. It's not as if he's Morrissey, after all. D.I.
 A HOUSE ON FIRE: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul. By John A. Jackson. (Oxford University, $35.) Jackson's book tells the story of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International Records, the last of the great soul empires. In the late 1960's and early 70's Gamble and Huff, along with the producer/arranger Thom Bell, racked up a series of hits that elevated them to the ranks of the better-documented Motown and Stax labels. With the O'Jays (''Back Stabbers''), Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes (''If You Don't Know Me by Now''), Billy Paul (''Me and Mrs. Jones'') and others, the three created a sophisticated, dramatic new interpretation of rhythm and blues, heavy on luxurious strings and propulsive beats, that dominated the charts only to help set in motion the disco movement that ultimately sank them. Jackson, the author of fine histories of Alan Freed and ''American Bandstand,'' isn't the most elegant writer; phrases, even entire anecdotes are repeated, and his attempts to merge the story of Philadelphia soul with that of the era's social and political changes, though entirely valid, are sometimes awkward. The reclusive Gamble and Huff both refused to participate in the book, which makes it even more difficult for Jackson to decipher Gamble, who was driven at times by a volatile mixture of capitalism and black pride. But ''A House on Fire'' is a meticulously researched and engaging story, and there are lessons to be learned from the often forgotten Philadelphia International; before the triumph of the more mechanized sounds of disco and then hip-hop, it was a place where the human dynamics of musicians, songwriters and producers, all collaborating under one roof, were essential to success. A.L.
 BILLY JOEL: The Life and Times of an Angry Young Man. By Hank Bordowitz. (Billboard, $24.95.) Say what you will about his body of work, after nine multiplatinum albums, three marriages, three suspicious car crashes in two years, one Broadway musical and one trip to a substance abuse treatment program, Billy Joel surely deserves a biography of his own, whether he chooses to participate in it or not. Alas, in the case of Bordowitz's book, the people's Piano Man has opted out, leaving the author to rely upon recycled material and interviews with various former Joel confidants and aides-de-camp in order to construct his story. While it dutifully describes Joel's upbringing in Hicksville, N.Y., such early career miscues as his heavy metal band Attila and his eventual success with albums like ''The Stranger'' and ''An Innocent Man,'' the book is undermined not by the absence of its subject but by its author's workmanlike approach, which reduces Joel's journey to one long trade publication article. When a biography devotes two pages to the 1981 renegotiation of Joel's recording contract with Columbia, but just one paragraph to his discovery that he has an Austrian half brother, well, what can you say? D.I.
 METALLICA. This Monster Lives: The Inside Story of ''Some Kind of Monster.'' By Joe Berlinger with Greg Milner. (St. Martin's, $24.95.) Berlinger was one of the directors of the acclaimed documentary ''Some Kind of Monster,'' which chronicled two and a half years in the life of the biggest hard rock band in the world, during which its bass player quit, its lead singer disappeared for months, its members underwent seemingly perpetual group therapy and, finally, it recorded an album. Like the film itself, ''Metallica: This Monster Lives'' continually flirts with self-parody, dancing right on the edge between ''Spinal Tap'' cluelessness, ''Behind the Music'' cliche and genuine emotional revelation. A book about the making of a movie about the making of an album obviously risks irrelevance, and Berlinger is hardly shy about his own opinion of his work with his directing partner, Bruce Sinofsky. But the book gradually takes on the momentum of a suspense novel, and triumphs because of the commitment and fearlessness of Metallica. More a book about filmmaking than about music, ''This Monster Lives'' shows that tenacious reporting can still produce great narratives, even about the most mega of megaplatinum rock stars. A.L.
 TURN THE BEAT AROUND: The Secret History of Disco. By Peter Shapiro. (Faber & Faber, $26.) It's more than just the much-maligned genre that gave us ''Funkytown,'' the Village People and a movie in which Gene Kelly roller-skated with Olivia Newton-John: in Shapiro's effusive and engaging musical history, disco is the Fiorucci-clad bastard child of any number of 20th-century cultural movements, from Nazi Germany's Swing Jugend to Britain's Northern Soul scene to the post-Stonewall gay movement of downtown Manhattan. Disco also proves to be a laboratory of innovation second only to the American space program, yielding early antecedents of such present-day musical devices as the mash-up and the 18-minute-long dance remix. Though the thematically organized chapter structure can sometimes result in confusing chronology, Shapiro's no-rhinestone-unturned approach makes for highly entertaining reading, including short profiles of such dance floor icons as Chic and Giorgio Moroder and an exploration into the origins of disco's ubiquitous ''whoop! whoop!'' sound effect, all before the music meets its fate at a ''Disco Demolition Derby'' night at Chicago's Comiskey Park in 1979. Try to resist the temptation to turn directly to the book's discography to see how many of the albums it cites are in your own collection. D.I.

Manischewitz Company -- an industrial icon that has maintained its plant in this city since 1932, when dozens of factories dotted the Hudson River waterfront and sent billows of smoke, along with a distinctive aroma, into the North Jersey sky.
 But in recent years, this city has transformed itself from a hard-edged and fading industrial port to a haven for Wall Street finance and young professionals, and the isolated food manufacturer may be preparing its last baked brick-oven matzo by the waterfront.
The signs on the door are ominous. In December, the company quietly moved its corporate offices to Secaucus. A year ago, the company sold a vacant parcel of land next to its factory to a Hoboken-based developer, and it is now considering selling a parking lot. Recently, the company retained the services of a former city official to help scout new locations, according to company officials. 
 And in an interview last week, Richard A. Bernstein, president and chief executive of the group that owns Manischewitz, indicated that the company was exploring a move -- to where, exactly, he was not sure. 
 ''We're now talking,'' Mr. Bernstein said, ''and just going through the preliminary stages of what a new plant would look like.''
 To help in its search, the company has enlisted the services of Mark Munley, a former director of the Department of Housing and Economic Development here. 
 ''Mark has been helpful in recognizing what we have, and with any new plans,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''Mark has been giving us guidance, and he knows his way around, so he keeps his eye open to know what's up.''
 Yet when asked about his involvement with Manischewitz, Mr. Munley denied any relationship. 
 ''That's untrue,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernstein said that if he could, he would remain in Jersey City. Indeed, he said that he was looking for a new plant in ''the general Newark-Jersey City area.'' 
 But he said that he had seen the transformation around the plant, and taken notice.
 ''The area has changed rather dramatically in the past 24 months,'' he said. ''We'd be foolish to ignore it.''
 Suitors have certainly not been ignoring Manischewitz, Mr. Bernstein said, though for now the company is telling developers that they are not yet prepared to deal.
 ''They're not accepting offers,'' said Vincent Wilt, the Hoboken developer who last year bought a triangle-shaped property adjacent to the plant for $1.5 million and considers himself one of the top contenders once the factory goes on the market.
 Six months ago, Mr. Wilt said, he bought another property next to the plant. 
 To Mr. Wilt, who owns a loft building around the corner that he is converting into luxury housing at a cost of $22 million, the actions seem to indicate that the company is preparing for a sale. He said he hoped to redevelop the plant as a 10-story luxury residence with about 300 apartments.
 In December 2004, Bruce Glickstein, the president and chief executive of Manischewitz at the time, indicated that he was listening to offers on his property. 
 ''We're always looking for expansion of our product capability,'' Mr. Glickstein said in an interview. ''We're always considering options,'' like, for instance, ''does it make sense to move somewhere else?''
 In fact, when asked whether the entire plant would be shut down and moved, he responded: ''It could be. We know the land's worth money. We're listening to anyone coming to talk to us.'' And, he added, ''A lot of people are interested in my land because it sits in a very good location.''
 It was not always considered such a good location. The 139,000-square-foot plant stands just blocks from the waterfront in a 12-block warehouse district that had declined into a tumbledown no-go zone after manufacturers abandoned the city. It has only recently seen signs of resurgence. 
 Indeed, about a half-dozen properties here are being developed into luxury housing, and other plans are on the table. A former artists' enclave at 111 First Street was emptied in March, and the owners are seeking to demolish the old tobacco warehouse and build apartments there. 
 The loss of Manischewitz and its 20 million pounds of matzos a year would effectively mark the end of manufacturing in the district. At its height, this place was teeming with industry, and companies like the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and P. Lorillard Tobacco shipped out their products along the freight lines that terminated nearby.
 The kosher food maker was, in fact, something of a latecomer here. 
 The history of Manischewitz stretches back 117 years, to Cincinnati, where a rabbi named Dov Behr Manischewitz started baking in a modest shop and later expanded his operation to create the standardized production of matzos with a gas-fired oven. When the Jersey City plant opened in 1932, the Ohio facility was closed.
 In 1954, the company opened a plant in Vineland, in South Jersey, where it continues to make gefilte fish and borscht. Its wine is produced in Naples, N.Y.
 This would not be the first time Manischewitz had considered leaving Jersey City. In 1976, the company seriously contemplated a move to Newark, where its corporate offices were at the time, but a state loan of $2.4 million helped upgrade offices and warehouses and kept them put. 
 In 1989, the company was sold for $40 million to a California investment group. In 1991, the company had a brush with scandal when executives admitted to fixing the price of Passover matzos. The company was forced to pay $1 million in fines.
 Since 1998, the company has been a subsidiary of R.A.B. Holdings, a New York-based firm. In fact, the company last year quietly retired the Manischewitz name -- it is merely known inside the company as the R.A.B. Food Group -- although the food products still say Manischewitz.
 Whatever the name, business has been good. From 2001 to 2003, revenue rose to $62.1 million from $57.7 million, though in 2004 that figure declined to $59.4 million. Company officials blamed a variety of factors for the loss, including decreased sales of non-Passover products. In addition, R.A.B. Holdings has suffered losses within the last few years, with revenue down $148 million since 2001.
 Despite the fact that only 50 employees now work at the Jersey City plant, the loss of those manufacturing jobs could be a sensitive political issue here, and Mr. Bernstein has spoken about it with Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy.
 As he explained: ''The mayor has been very vocal to me that he'd like to keep manufacturing industrial jobs in the city.''

HEADLINE: O.K., Japan Isn't Taking Over the World. But China . . .

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
NOT even 20 years have passed since the apparently unstoppable Japanese economic juggernaut struck fear in the hearts of Americans, and now China has emerged to be seen as the new economic menace threatening the nation's vital strategic interests.
 America's boom in the 1990's, coupled with Japan's decline into an economic quagmire through much of the decade, quelled most fears that the Japanese were going to eat our economic lunch.
But now China has set out to snap up everything from Unocal to Maytag, not to mention a steady diet of United States Treasury bonds. And many of the leading voices who worried about Japan in the 1980's are warning that China presents a much bigger and more complex conundrum. 
 ''In retrospect I probably did overstate the nature of the Japanese challenge,'' said Chalmers Johnson, a prominent expert on Asia who in the early 1990's argued that Japan was ''the only nation with real leverage over the United States.'' But, he added, ''China is several orders of magnitude different from Japan.''
 China is not only much bigger and more populous. Its economy is likely to become the largest in the world at some point in the next 50 years. As China keeps growing at a rubber-burning pace, competition with the United States over energy resources alone could cause substantial tension. 
 Americans' fear of Japan's ascendancy in the 1980's was inspired by economics and pride. The growing bilateral trade deficit, as Japanese companies acquired leadership in industries that were once dominated by American businesses, cast a pall on America's self-confidence. The Japanese purchase of high-profile American assets, whether Columbia Pictures or the Pebble Beach golf course, just rubbed it in. 
 Relations with China have a more complex geopolitical dimension. Unlike Japan, China is likely to become a military power. And it is not an unconditional ally. From Taiwan to the Middle East, the strategic interests of China diverge from America's. As it throws its weight around, to secure supplies of energy, say, or to avail itself of strategic technology, China can cause American policy makers no end of discomfort.
 For instance, if the United States government were to block the China National Offshore Oil Corporation from acquiring Unocal, it might just push China into cutting energy deals that the United States government would rather it did not make with countries like Russia or Iran.
 ''Clearly the relationship between the United States and China is much more ambivalent than that between the United States and Japan,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz, a trade negotiator during the Reagan administration who in the 1980's warned that Japan's ascent could eclipse the United States' power and compromise its prosperity.
 Those differences might warrant a more careful review of deals like the attempted purchase of Unocal by China's state run oil company. 
 Robert B. Reich, the former secretary of labor in the Clinton administration who as a Harvard professor in the early 1990's argued that big Japanese investments in the United States were not threatening, says today that a Chinese acquisition of a potentially strategic asset like Unocal could be problematic.
 ''In economic terms there is no reason to block Chinese ownership of U.S. assets just as there was no reason to block Japan from buying U.S. assets in the 1980's,'' Mr. Reich said. ''But in political terms in 2005 there may be a reason to take seriously the downside of China owning Unocal.''
 But even those most concerned about China's rise up the economic, political and military ladder recognize another, perhaps more important difference between China and 1980's Japan. The United States has a vested interest in China's success. 
 For starters, whereas Japan's success at the time was inevitably seen as America's failure, today American businesses are all rooting for China to succeed. Because they own a lot of it. 
 ''It was virtually impossible for a foreigner to make an acquisition in Japan,'' Mr. Prestowitz said. ''In China its 'y'all come.' American business is part of the China lobby, not the anti-China lobby.''
 Some of Japan's old foes view America's growing interdependence with China with suspicion. ''Interdependence means dependence,'' said Susan J. Tolchin, a professor of public policy at George Mason University who in 1993 was the co-author of ''Selling Our Security,'' which argued against allowing foreign investment in American technology companies. ''If we lose our economic independence we are going to lose our independence of movement on foreign policy.''
 Yet most acknowledge that China's transformation from a struggling Communist state to a prosperous nation with a growing stake in the global system of market economies is in America's best interest. For example, if the Chinese central bank owns oodles of United States Treasury bonds, it has a reason not to want to destabilize the bond market. 
 ''I cannot see how a rich bourgeois China could be not in our interest,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''If we're interested in our security we should establish collaborative ties with China right now.''
 The difference in emphasis appears in a shift in Mr. Prestowitz's writing about Asia. In 1988, he published ''Trading Places: How We Are Giving Our Future to Japan and How to Reclaim It.'' This year, he published ''Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East.''
 Today, Mr. Prestowitz said, the biggest risk is not that China will succeed in rising to become an economic superpower. The biggest risk is that it will fail.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Apartment Prices Reach New High

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
A rush of market reports using different numbers and methodologies all concluded last week that prices in the Manhattan real estate market hit a new high during a frothy spring selling season. Average prices rose for everything from cramped studios to four-bedroom apartments, lofts and town houses. 
 The reports confirm that despite worries about a bubble in real estate prices here and around the country, buyer interest remained strong, with frequent bidding wars, both in older apartment buildings and new condominiums just coming to market. 
It was only a year or so ago that average cooperative and condominium prices reached the $1 million mark in Manhattan. Yesterday, the very day the quarter ended, major Manhattan brokers sent out competing claims for new highs in average sales. 
 Prudential Douglas Elliman put the average sale price at $1.32 million, 8.5 percent above the last quarter, and 30 percent above a year earlier, when they reached $1,009,998.
 Brown Harris Stevens calculated it at $1.28 million, 9 percent above the figures it reported the previous quarter and 21 percent more than a year ago. A third firm, Corcoran Group, reported that the average price for a co-op reached $1.08 million, while an average condominium fetched $1.54 million.
 Brokers and analysts attributed the surge to continuing low interest rates, which dipped even lower during the quarter, a tight supply of apartments on the market, rising incomes and confidence in the economy. 
 There were also the lingering effects of year-end bonuses for Wall Street executives -- some of whom signed contracts in the winter, but closed on sales in the spring.
 ''If you've been waiting for prices to come down, you have been waiting a long time,'' said Gregory J. Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens. ''The fundamentals have only gotten better and they were strong to begin with.''
 Price increases were particularly strong downtown, where new buildings were coming on the market and the average price of a three-bedroom apartment increased 46 percent to $2.4 million in the last year, according to Brown Harris Stevens. 
 But there were also strong price increases in smaller apartments. The Prudential Douglas Elliman report found that average prices on studios increased by 12 percent in the last quarter, to $380,000 from $337,000, more than any other size apartment. 
 And while the average price is affected by multimillion-dollar sales, another measure, the median price, also rose to record levels, showing the breadth of the increases. Half of the apartments sold for less than the median price, and half sold for more. 
 Median prices reported by Douglas Elliman increased to $775,000, or by 9.9 percent from the price recorded three months earlier, and a 24 percent increase from the previous year.
 Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, said that 800 Manhattan cooperative and condominium sales this quarter, or 37 percent of the sales he tallied, were for more than $1 million. In the last quarter of 2001, after the World Trade Center attack, only 13 percent of sales were above $1 million. 
 There were many reports of sellers with multiple offers during the peak of the spring season, with sellers walking away with multiple backup offers and brokers talking about ''frenzy'', but that cooled somewhat in the last few weeks among more expensive apartments, as more apartments, including newly completed units, came on the market.
 ''We had overpricing by sellers and that dampened enthusiasm by buyers,'' said Pamela Liebman, president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group.

HEADLINE: Gabriela Quiros, Andrew Gilbert

 BODY:
Gabriela Victoria Quiros, a documentary filmmaker, and Andrew Brian Gilbert, a music journalist, are to be married today at the Brazilian Room in Tilden Regional Park in Berkeley, Calif. The ceremony is to be led by Alexander T. Grishaver, a friend of the couple, who was appointed by Alameda County as a deputy marriage commissioner for the event.
 Ms. Quiros, 33, is keeping her name. She was an associate producer on ''Bloodlines: Technology Hits Home,'' a documentary about genetic and reproductive technologies, which was broadcast on PBS in 2003. She was also an associate producer on ''Secrets of the SAT,'' shown in the ''Frontline'' series on PBS in 1999. She graduated with honors from the University of Costa Rica and received both a master's degree in journalism and a master's degree in Latin American studies from the University of California, Berkeley. 
 She is a daughter of Carol Robinson Quiros and Jose Maria Quiros -Salazar of Tres Rios, Costa Rica. The bride's father is an economist at the United States Embassy in San Jose, Costa Rica. Her mother retired as a preschool teacher at Country Day School in San Jose.
 Mr. Gilbert, 38, writes about jazz and Brazilian and Afro-Caribbean music for newspapers. He graduated with highest honors from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and received a master's degree in journalism from Berkeley. He is a son of Marlene and Larry Gilbert of Los Angeles. His mother, who is retired, worked in Costa Mesa, Calif., as the assistant general counsel of the Automobile Club of Southern California. His father is a construction contractor in Los Angeles.
 The bride and bridegroom met in journalism school in 1996. Mr. Gilbert gave Ms. Quiros rides home regularly. He eventually agreed to help her learn to drive. ''Teaching someone to drive is very stressful,'' he noted. 
 Ms. Quiros was directing a documentary at the time, ''Tango 73: A Bus Rider's Diary,'' and filmed Mr. Gilbert's teaching efforts as part of the story. Right up to the point -- captured on film -- when he said she thought like a passenger, not a driver. That was when they realized she should find instruction elsewhere.
 Ms. Quiros took away a simple lesson: ''You should never learn to drive from someone you love,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Mystery Of the Tunnels

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
Lewis Greenstein, a retired city worker, first heard about the Underground Railroad on Duffield Street in Downtown Brooklyn in 1992, when his mother died and he inherited a building there. At the time, he said, its existence was treated as common knowledge -- old people told stories about being scolded as children for playing in hidden tunnels in front of their houses.
 In time, Mr. Greenstein noticed some strange things about the basement of his own building, at 233 Duffield, where his parents had had a business since 1953. On the lowest level were two alcoves that seemed to be fireplaces, two shafts leading to street level, and a circular spot on the floor, three feet in diameter, that seemed to have been filled in with stones and cemented over. 
These clues, plus months of research into property records, convinced Mr. Greenstein that his house and several others on the block warranted further study as possible historic sites along the Underground Railroad, a route used by escaped slaves. The city, however, has other ideas for the block: It falls within the boundaries of the Downtown Brooklyn redevelopment plan, which shows a new street running through the block, flanked by a park and a new building. 
 ''Given enough time, we'll prove everything,'' Mr. Greenstein said. ''But if we don't have enough time, we can't prove it, and what's happening is, we have found that the city is in a rush to build that road.''
 The city's Economic Development Corporation has spent more than a year studying the property's history, according to Janel Patterson, an agency spokeswoman. As reported in The Brooklyn Eagle and The Brooklyn Paper, an official of the agency said last June that studies had shown the site has no connection to the Underground Railroad. Another study has since been conducted, and its results, which Ms. Patterson would not reveal, are being reviewed by a panel of historians and academics.
 Mr. Greenstein, who runs the Duffield Street Block Association along with Joy Chatel, who has a hair salon at 227 Duffield, concedes that no single piece of indisputable evidence identifies the block as an Underground Railroad site. But he notes that the organization operated in secret, and says the clues in the neighborhood are tantalizing: The former home of the Bridge Street African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church, an acknowledged Underground Railroad site, is just a block and a half away, and nearby is Plymouth Church, the famed abolition center. 
 Right now, he said, he just hopes for a thorough hearing. ''What we've asked them to do is open the tunnels, take a look inside, go in the tunnels, take a look around,'' Mr. Greenstein said. ''Evidence can be found if they search for it.'' JAKE MOONEY

HEADLINE: A Small Enclave Survives in the Big City

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE tiny Queen Anne-style red-brick enclave of Henderson Place, at the eastern end of 86th Street, has long seemed out of place in a high-rise city -- its dollhouse architecture is dwarfed by its surroundings. But now a new sense of light floods the little 19th-century buildings, which were designed as low-cost housing -- the entire blockfront to the north is being cleared in preparation for a new ultraluxury apartment tower.
 The enclave's developer, John C. Henderson, was born in 1809 in Ohio; his father had been a civil engineer and city planner in Cincinnati. The son developed businesses in the dry-goods, rubber, artificial-flower and wool trades and did well. The 1860 census lists him as living in Castleton, on Staten Island, with his wife, Jane, 10 children and 10 servants, including two gardeners. The census indicated he owned $500,000 in real estate. 
Between 1880 and 1883, Henderson took what appears to have been an entirely new tack and built a cluster of 32 modest row houses at 86th Street and what is now East End Avenue (it was then simply called Avenue B). 
 The old summer houses for the wealthy along the East River shore had long before given way to factories and tenements, and Henderson's obituary in 1884 in The New York Times noted that he intended these houses to be ''for persons of moderate means.''
 The Times advertised one of the houses at a rent of $650 a year, at a time when traditional row houses rented for $700 to $1,500 a year. Those traditional houses, however, were usually four or five floors high, on plots 100 feet deep; Henderson's were typically only three stories high, on 18-foot-wide by 46-foot-deep lots. 
 The complex faces four streets: East End Avenue, 86th and 87th Streets, and a small alley running north off 86th Street called Henderson Place. Early directories give a flavor of the initial tenancy, showing occupations like electrician, and work involving coal, hats and collars.
 The architects Lamb & Rich were becoming well known for especially picturesque small buildings, and the Henderson Place complex is one of their signature works, on which they called on all the charming details in their portfolio and lavished them on the complex. (Perhaps their best-known building is Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's Long Island country house.) 
 But an anonymous critic in The Real Estate Record & Guide in 1883 was not so impressed, not even with the little dead-end alley, which the writer felt would leave the residents with ''the disagreeable feeling of living in what the French call a bag's end.'' 
 The critic acknowledged the ''bright, varied and animated'' character of the design but said it seemed too strained and thought that the tiny plots, 900 square feet, left the houses extremely cramped on the inside and with terrible air circulation. If this was the best a civic-minded developer could do, the article concluded, polite families of modest means had no alternative but to move to the suburbs. John Henderson died the next year in his house on Staten Island.
 The 1905 census gives a fuller picture of the complex's economic makeup. Neils Olsen, secretary of the New York Yacht Club, lived at 553 East 86th Street with his stepson, Donald Campbell, who was a clerk at another men's club, the Knickerbocker, and a lodger, Daniel Dowling, who was a boatman for the yacht club. Some of the houses were stuffed full, like 11 Henderson Place, where a florist, Louis Rossow, was the head of an eight-person household. Most houses had five or six residents. 
 In the 1920's, East River districts like Beekman Place and Sutton Place attracted New York society, and Henderson Place was no exception. The Duke and Duchess of Richelieu lived at 140 East End Avenue; 549 East 86th Street was occupied by the editor and war correspondent Horace Green -- educated at Groton and Harvard -- with his wife, Eleanor, three children and a governess. 
 In 1933, the family of Walter R. Herrick discovered that their cat, Tiddles the Tiger, had disappeared after being put out at night from their house at 148 East End. They learned that others in the row had also lost cats, and a few nights later they found another cat, Timothy, caught in a commercial trap set in back of 150 East End Avenue. 
 The owner of No. 150, Elizabeth Parkinson, said that she felt that cats should be licensed and kept inside and that she had trapped the cats and released them in a vacant lot at 58th Street. Although Timothy returned home, a long search for Tiddles was fruitless. 
 Vincent Astor and others built a series of unusually refined apartment buildings in the East End area, and a group of physicians built the full-blockfront Doctors Hospital to the north, between 87th and 88th Streets, which was for a long time favored by the elite. The west side of the Henderson Place alley was demolished after 1940, but the 24 houses left are startlingly little changed; they were designated landmarks in 1969. 
 The hospital building was torn down earlier this year, and now its lot is cleared for a new 19-story residential tower designed by the architect Peter Marino. The U-shaped structure will be severe and chaste, all limestone and glass, with apartments of up to five bedrooms, most with distant views across the constant, hypnotizing eddy of Hell Gate. 
 The new residents will be able to gaze down on the neighboring Lilliput and contemplate their astonishing good fortune in having one flank even lower than the trees in the nearby Carl Schurz Park. 
 But at the moment the empty hospital site lets the Henderson Place survivors exhale in a way they could not when hemmed in by taller buildings. Indeed at the moment the buildings look respectably sized, or at least no longer miniature.
 Miner Warner, an international financial adviser, has owned one of the houses in the complex since the 1970's. To step inside is to cross the Atlantic, to venture into a compact London town house, with the smallish windows insulating the house from the outside world. 
 Mr. Warner and his wife, Ellen, a photojournalist, have meticulously painted and decorated, reproducing lost Queen Anne-style windows -- where there are often many panes in the upper sash but only a few in the lower -- and salvaging original slate fireplaces discarded from neighboring houses. The fireplaces are utterly simple, with thin, wirelike incised detailing. 
 Mr. Warner says he and his wife have never noticed anything diminutive about their house, although their main hallway is smaller than some Park Avenue walk-in closets. 
 ''It's a lot of small spaces, but it's not at all cramped,'' he says. ''It doesn't feel small to me.''

HEADLINE: When the Everyday Was Revolutionary

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
HE finally stopped taking his Game Boy to work at Goldman Sachs to keep from playing Mario Brothers games during finance meetings.
 He had trouble forming lasting relationships, yet this physics and math whiz with the unfashionable glasses was definitely a ladies' man.
His work won a Nobel in economic science -- a subject he had never studied. 
 He is Fischer Black, who is best known, if he is known at all, for his work on the Black-Scholes pricing model, which determines how much a stock option is worth. (In 1997, the Nobel was awarded to Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, two of his collaborators. Mr. Black had died two years earlier.) 
 His life is captured in ''Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance'' (Wiley, $29.95), by Perry Mehrling. 
 But while this biography by Mr. Mehrling, an economics professor at Barnard College, is worth your attention for cataloging the life of one of the first Wall Street ''quants'' -- people who apply arcane pricing models to create new financial instruments like derivatives -- there is a greater appeal here. Mr. Mehrling hints at it in the ''revolutionary'' in the book's title. 
 Mr. Black, who divided his working life between academia (the University of Chicago) and the private sector (consulting firms and Goldman Sachs), turned out to be in some ways a real-life Zelig when it came to the way investing and finance developed from the 1960's to the 90's. 
 Here's an example: Although we now take index funds for granted, they were an unknown when Mr. Black entered the finance field. There was an implicit assumption that money managers, including those who ran mutual funds, could consistently outperform the market, although no reliable data made the case.
 In fact, in one of Mr. Black's first jobs -- as a consultant for Arthur D. Little -- he was hired by the mutual fund industry to prove that its managers outperformed the market. The industry was hoping that such proof could keep the Securities and Exchange Commission from regulating mutual fund sales charges and management fees. 
 Mr. Black and his colleagues studied the performance of 115 fund managers over 10 years and found that not one would have outperformed a mythical ''passive'' investor who had simply bought the entire stock market and held on.
 Those findings, and later work that Mr. Black and colleagues did for Wells Fargo, led to the creation of index funds. 
 Although this is all interesting reading, there is a fundamental flaw: the book periodically veers into discussions best left to graduate seminars or department mixers. 
 Formulas for things like mapping ''variance and covariance'' in determining risk in stock prices often clutter the page, and the hieroglyphics are not always explained completely. Even those who are intrigued by the subject can be left baffled.
 The prose is mostly straightforward, but sentences like this occasionally pop up: ''However, Tobin did not take the crucial step of associating the portfolio proportions in the dominant portfolio with the available supply of assets, and so did not derive market-clearing risk premiums.''
 For all those who went out of their way to avoid math and economics courses in school, this may prove overwhelming.
 But for everyone else, the book is a fascinating history of things we take for granted in our everyday financial lives: the decision to choose stocks for the long term, for example, or why index funds should be the vehicle of choice for almost all investors.
 Consider this summer reading for nerds. 
 A WAY to put Mr. Black's theories into effect is found in ''Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Personal Investment'' (Free Press, $27.50), by David F. Swensen, the chief investment officer at Yale and author of ''Pioneering Portfolio Management.''
 This is a solid book aimed at those who already have a reasonable understanding of investing, but the title may be confusing. Mr. Swensen's premise is that ''conventional wisdom'' says actively managed mutual funds can consistently outperform the market, so that is the way most people invest.
 Therefore, anyone who invests ''passively'' through index funds is, by his definition, unconventional. But as the work by Mr. Black and others showed decades ago, and the popularity of the index funds championed by Vanguard confirms today, most people are at least aware of the alternative to actively managed funds.
 Indeed, many people have heard of the countless studies -- some cited by Mr. Swensen -- showing that returns of a majority of actively managed funds fail even to equal the performance of an index fund made up of the same types of stocks. Funds that outperform their appropriate benchmarks are the exception. 
 But even if you were unaware of all that, you won't be by the time you finish this book, which is a relentless, well-constructed attack on active investing in general, and on actively managed mutual funds in particular.
 Mr. Swensen argues that the fees charged by actively managed funds are too high, that the funds trade too often -- increasing transaction costs, which are borne by shareholders -- and that the funds have their interests, and not those of their investors, at heart. 
 ''Individuals fare best by constructing equity-oriented, broadly diversified portfolios without the active management component,'' Mr. Swensen writes. ''Instead of pursuing ephemeral promises of market-beating strategies, individuals benefit from adopting the ironclad reality of market-mimicking portfolios.''
 Or, as he puts it more simply later: 
 ''Well-informed tax-deferred investors reach an obvious conclusion: look no further than low-cost, passively managed index funds.''
 It is interesting to note that Mr. Black, whose initial work on options pricing led to the offering of a host of derivative products, was extremely conservative in his personal investments.

HEADLINE: Were the Good Old Days That Good?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
TOM RATH, the protagonist in Sloan Wilson's 1955 novel, ''The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,'' certainly had his share of troubles: the stressful conformity, the constant striving for success, the superficial suburban friendships, the war experiences he kept hidden from his wife. It all ate away at him. 
 But Tom, like most Americans in the first three decades after World War II, took a rising standard of living for granted. When he needed more income to make ends meet, he simply landed a better-paying job. Indeed, at parties throughout suburbia, Mr. Wilson wrote, ''the public celebration of increases in salary was common.'' And Tom didn't fret about medical bills, job security or the quality of public schools for his three children.
Fast forward to Tom and Marie DeSisto in 2005. They are real people in their early 50's, living in a three-bedroom condominium in Newton, Mass. Ask them if their standard of living is rising and they say yes, indeed, it is -- but not in the Rath family's sense of the word. The DeSistos' income made a U-turn last year, but they manage to live within its limits, even eking out money for extras. And that success lifts their spirits. ''We are not really into boats and cars,'' Mrs. DeSisto said, ''but we are traveling more.'' 
 Pushed into early retirement last year by his employer, Verizon, Mr. DeSisto's salary plummeted from more than $100,000 as a manager to $36,000 as a first-year math teacher at Newton High School. His wife, on the other hand, has just been promoted to director of nursing in the Framingham public schools. Her salary rose by nearly $4,000, to $67,000 a year, but she is also adding eight working days a year to handle the additional responsibilities. 
 While the Raths moved up in income, home size and leisure time, the DeSistos sold their four-bedroom colonial home in Newton, pocketing a profit while cutting their property taxes and maintenance costs. ''We planned carefully,'' Mrs. DeSisto said, ''and we downsized successfully.''
 So, did the Raths, that quintessential 1950's family, enjoy a higher standard of living than middle-class families like the DeSistos do today? In other words, can it be that living standards are actually slipping in America? 
 No economist, demographer or historian would make that case. Living standards, after all, almost never go backward, at least not in a material sense. Indeed, the economy today is growing, consumer spending is plentiful and new technologies -- from the Internet to laparoscopic surgery -- make life better than ever, as they do in every generation. 
 BUT for the DeSistos and their contemporaries, the trajectory is no longer the steadily upward line that the Rath family enjoyed. Instead, the line appears to be climbing erratically. That is certainly true of the traditional measures of standard of living. After 20 years of very small gains, the rate of improvement surged from 1995 to 2000 -- only to fall back toward zero over the last four years, a reversal that puzzles analysts. 
 ''When you talk about living standards, you have to focus on people in the middle,'' said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. ''A lot of the goodies that we think of as raising living standards have gone to the people at the top at the expense of the broad mass of Americans in the middle.''
 Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, argues that federal subsidies in the form of tax credits, mainly the earned income tax credit, are raising living standards for low-income families by more than many people realize. Those subsidies have risen by about $2,000 since President Bush took office in 2001, to just over $3,000 a year for a married couple with two children and a family income of $27,300, Mr. Hassett estimates. 
 ''The standard income numbers don't capture what is happening to people at the bottom,'' he said. ''So you have to look at their consumption, not their income, to gauge standard of living. And consumption has significantly outperformed income.''
 While income and consumption are the chief measures of a nation's standard of living, other, more subtle indicators also play an important role -- and several of them are not doing so well. Life expectancy in the United States, while still rising, has fallen behind that in France, Germany and Japan. Home ownership is at a record high for the population as a whole, but it has dropped since the 1970's for some groups -- working families with children, for example, according to the Center for Housing Policy. In overwhelming numbers, Americans say they are satisfied with their standard of living, a Gallup poll reports. But 25 percent of the nation's families also worry all or most of time that they won't be able to pay their bills. That is up from 21 percent in the late 1990's. 
 And in many cases, public services are not holding their own. ''Thirty years ago a lot of public goods were free, and now they are fee-based,'' said Michael Hout, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Even the Grand Canyon charges, and many public schools are engaged in fund-raising. So public goods that contribute to living standards are more dependent today on family income.'' 
 The good news for the nation is that productivity -- a measure of output per worker that is the bedrock on which income and living standards are built -- is rising. When it goes up, so does the revenue from the sale of the additional goods and services that each worker produces. In theory, some of that revenue feeds back into the income of the workers, financing improvements in their standard of living. 
 That symbiotic relationship worked very well for Tom Rath. From the late 1940's through 1973, productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent, and incomes rose almost as briskly. Then came a horrific slowdown: productivity fell back to an annual growth rate of less than 1.5 percent from the mid-1970's to the mid-90's, and median income hardly rose at all. 
 The revival that started in 1995 brought productivity growth back to its old rate of increase, and for five years incomes also rose smartly. What happened next is tough for economists to explain. The productivity growth rate has stayed strong -- rising at an average annual rate of just under 3 percent since 1995, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But starting in 2000, median income, adjusted for inflation, has grown more slowly every year -- and this year the increase is almost imperceptible.
 ''There is no question that a huge gap has opened up between productivity and living standards,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. 
 Not since World War II have productivity and income diverged so sharply, yet that phenomenon barely registers in public opinion surveys. Nearly 9 in 10 people surveyed by Gallup say they are satisfied with their standard of living, a higher proportion than in the 1960's. In answering that question, however, those surveyed make no comparisons with the past, said Lydia Saad, a senior editor at Gallup, ''so they don't know whether they are falling behind on some treadmill of life.''
 Richard A. Easterlin, an economic historian at the University of Southern California, has a different take. Satisfaction is always relative, he says. If a family's debt rises, that is not a negative as long as other people's debt is increasing at roughly the same pace. 
 The parity helps to explain why consumption has risen 40 percent faster than income since 2001, and why people are able to focus on the amenities they acquire -- the cellphones, the bigger homes, the cars and the digital cameras-- without feeling weighed down by rising debt or by income that is rising more slowly. 
 TOM RATH'S generation, having experienced the Depression, expected more hard times after World War II. When the economy boomed instead, the aspirations of his generation rose and so, eventually, did their sense of well-being. All of that changed in the 1980's, when globalization infected public attitudes and people told pollsters that they expected their children's living standards to decline.
 That shift in expectations soon gave way to a new norm. In the age of layoffs, tens of thousands of families have done what the DeSistos have done: adjusted to a decline in income after a job loss. The DeSisto family's income is still more than twice the national median of nearly $53,000, and Mrs. DeSisto's eight additional days of work are not really eight additional days, as she sees it. 
 ''I always worked those extra days,'' she said. ''I just didn't get paid for them in my old job as supervisor of nurses.'' 
 While the glass may be half full in the eyes of many beholders, living standards certainly are not improving for everyone. Productivity, as it rises, throws off more and more income, which is then distributed to capital in the form of profits, and to labor in higher wages, more paid hours and benefits.
 Labor's share, which has historically represented 60 to 65 percent of the total, has fallen in the last five years to the low end of that range. But for Mr. Gordon at Northwestern, that is only part of the story. Capital's share, he says, has increasingly found its way to upper-income families as stock options, dividends, special bonuses and the like. 
 ''We had much less income inequality in the first couple of decades after World War II because of strong unions, restricted trade and a decline in immigration,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Then all three reversed, which means that the income from productivity falls to the bottom line and for the time being stays there.''
 To him and others, living standards cannot be truly rising if the improvement is so unevenly distributed; in addition, they say, earning a living has become increasingly stressful. 
 Job security, which Tom Rath took for granted, has deteriorated. ''People talk of the new economy and of reinventing themselves in the workplace, and in that sense most of us are less secure,'' said Daniel Kahneman, a Princeton University economist who shared a Nobel in economics for his contributions to behavioral economics.
 People approaching the age of 65 face a different uncertainty: smaller retirement incomes than their parents enjoyed. That is happening as the nation shifts from a system of fixed monthly pensions to 401(k)-type accounts, in which people save what they can for their own retirement. In the process, retirement income is falling from 93 percent of preretirement pay for today's retirees to 80 percent, on average, for the next generation, according to an Urban Institute projection. 
 Some retirees cannot afford the pension hit, and they continue to work. The portion of the 65-and-over population that is employed has risen to 14 percent from less than 12 percent in 1995, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. The option to retire is slipping away, and that damages living standards.
 ''People who have a choice experience a greater standard of living,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. ''They are not constrained from choosing what they prefer.'' 
 Choosing not to work is no longer an option for many families who need two incomes to pay what they consider basic expenses. Two of those expenses -- health care and education -- have risen faster than incomes, says Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy specialist at Harvard Law School and co-author of ''The Two-Income Trap.''
 ''Half of all people who file for personal bankruptcy do so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem,'' she said, noting that the number of Americans without health insurance has increased in recent years. As for education, the rising cost is mostly in the purchase of expensive homes in upscale areas known to have good public schools. ''A generation ago,'' Ms. Warren said, ''the majority of American parents believed they could buy whatever home they could afford and send their kids to a good school down the street.''
 There is a problem with this argument. The quality of public school education, measured by test scores, is in fact holding up quite well, on average. The National Assessment of Education Progress, a federally sponsored testing program that started in the 1960's, periodically measures the skills and achievements of students at the ages of 9, 13 and 17. Scores have risen slightly since the early 1980's, on average, but so, too, has the disparity in school performance. 
 ''The variation is extraordinary across school districts and even across schools in the same district,'' said Richard Murnane, an economist at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, ''so when you ask about how good the schools are, the measure of central tendency is less interesting than the variation around the average.''
 HEALTH problems also undermine living standards. Life expectancy at birth is one symptom. At 69.7 years in the late 1950's, life expectancy in the United States was slightly ahead of that of Germany and France, and well ahead of Japan's. Now Japan is far ahead at 80.5 years, compared with 78.5 in France, 77.5 in Germany and 76.5 in the United States.
 Infant mortality, at more than six deaths per thousand live births, similarly trails the rates in France, Germany and Japan, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Height, too, is no longer an American hallmark. Average height has been stuck at less than 6 feet for a decade or more while Europeans have grown passed that mark, suggesting that they are somehow healthier. 
 Obesity is now a distinguishing feature. The percentage of obese American adults has doubled in the last 15 years, to 30 percent, said Kenneth E. Thorpe, chairman of the department of health policy management at Emory University's School of Public Health. 
 The way we live makes that happen, he argues: the lack of exercise, the marketing of foods high in sugar and fat, the over-large portions. As a result, weight-related illnesses -- diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, asthma -- have risen sharply.
 ''Once you are sick, we are doing a better job in treatment,'' Dr. Thorpe said. ''The pace of technological development has probably accelerated since 1980 more than in previous generations. That's the good news. The bad news is that we have larger shares of the population who are sick.''
 For Dr. Thorpe, the much better treatment is clearly a big improvement in standard of living -- offset, however, by the big increase in the incidence of illness. He estimated that the additional health care cost resulting from the decline in healthiness would total $70 billion this year. 
 ''You can't have a rising standard of living,'' he said, ''if you have people getting less healthy.''
 The Rath family had no such misfortune. In Sloan Wilson's hands, the man in the gray flannel suit enjoyed an ever more prosperous life -- a happy ending that many middle-class families can't seem to match today.

HEADLINE: Profits, Not Jobs, On the Rebound In Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., July 1 

 BODY:
Things are looking up at Wyse Technology, a venerable maker of computer terminals. Unless, that is, you happen to want to work for the company here in Silicon Valley.
 Responding to booming demand in Asia and in Europe, Wyse is adding new development teams in India and China and expanding its worldwide work force to about 380, from 260. Its profits are recorded here -- but almost none of its new jobs. 
 Amid widespread signs of economic recovery in the region, Wyse is emblematic of its economy, in which demand, sales and profits are rising quickly while job growth continues to stagnate. 
 In the last three years, profits at the seven largest companies in Silicon Valley by market value have increased by an average of more than 500 percent while Santa Clara County employment has declined to 767,600, from 787,200. During the previous economic recovery, between 1995 and 1997, the county, which is the heart of Silicon Valley, added more than 82,800 jobs.
 Changes in technology and business strategy are raising fundamental questions about the future of the valley, the nation's high technology heartland. In part, the change is driven by the very automation that Silicon Valley has largely made possible, allowing companies to create more value with fewer workers. 
 Some economists are wondering if a larger transformation is at work -- accelerating a trend in which the region's big employers keep a brain trust of creative people and engineers here but hire workers for lower-level tasks elsewhere. 
 ''What has changed is that Silicon Valley has continued to move up the value chain,'' said AnnaLee Saxenian, dean of the School of Information Management and Systems and professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley. That has meant that just as low-skilled manufacturing jobs fled the region starting in the 1970's, now software jobs are also leaving.
 The phenomenon is only the latest twist in the region's boom-and-bust history, marked by repeated cycles of innovation and renewal over the last five decades.
 Industries based on personal computing, hand-held devices and electronic commerce have emerged and thrived here, and each brought waves of new jobs. Now, almost everyone agrees that Silicon Valley is coming back, and employment there grew from March to May, but the area still has about 10,000 fewer jobs than there were a year ago. 
 The increase in profits ''has been very dramatic, but there's no job growth,'' said Doug Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a regional consulting company. 
 Some former technology workers have given up on the sector -- or moved out of the Bay Area altogether. 
 Catherine Haley, 32, went to work in 1997 as a project manager and a Web designer for technology companies in the area, but after quitting the consulting firm KPMG in 2002, she found it extremely difficult to find a full-time job.
 In 2004, after working in piecemeal assignments for two years, she gave up on the job market and nearly moved back to Boston. Instead, she decided to pursue her passion -- art -- and is now majority owner of a gallery in San Francisco. 
 She does not miss fighting for work, she said, partly because the high-tech economy has lost its charm. ''Unfortunately, the number of interesting projects and companies out there has really come down,'' she said.
 In some cases, as at Wyse, the job growth in the sector is taking place elsewhere -- in lower-cost, higher-growth markets. 
 A new management team, installed as part of a buyout of the company that was completed in April, is leading a restructuring that includes adding 100 workers in India and 35 in Beijing so far this year. At the start of the year the company had 90 percent of its work force in Silicon Valley; now the figure is 48 percent, and only 15 percent of its engineering talent remains here, largely because of the technology development teams it is building in India and China. 
 ''It was pretty clear that growth was going to come first in Asia,'' said John Kish, Wyse's chief executive. ''We had the desire to get engineering teams to those markets as quickly as we could.''
 Stephen Levy, director for the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, said the growth of employment outside Silicon Valley was ''not a nefarious plot,'' but a logical development. ''Companies are going where there are customers and, in some cases, where it's cheaper to produce,'' he said.
 Hoping to keep costs low, Electronic Arts, the video game maker based just north of here in Redwood City, already has development studios in Vancouver, Montreal, London, Chicago and Orlando, Fla. It is debating how much of its work in the future it can move to lower-cost regions, said Jeff Brown, a company spokesman.
 ''We will always have a presence here because there is a core of talent,'' he said. ''But there is strong pressure to figure out exactly which jobs it is essential to keep in California.''
 The issue is not just outsourcing, though, but also big leaps in productivity. Cisco, the behemoth maker of Internet equipment, now has annual sales of $680,000 per employee, compared to $480,000 in 2001.
 One key measure, known as value added per employee, rose 3.7 percent in 2004, to $222,000 in economic value per worker. That compares with $85,000 per worker in the rest of the country, according to data reported by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a regional economic research group. 
 By a number of other measures, companies are watching profits and sales rise. An analysis published in April by The San Jose Mercury News found that the top 100 public companies in the region had revenues of $336 billion in 2004, an increase of 14 percent from the previous year. 
 Mr. Henton said that measure, while not entirely indicative of what is going on because it includes worldwide sales, gives a good sense of the growth here. 
 ''It's a clear recovery,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It's a high-productivity jobless recovery.''
 In the past, much of the job growth has come from investment by venture capitalists in start-up companies. That engine is starting to rev up again, with venture capitalists putting $7.4 billion into 724 Silicon Valley companies in 2004, according to the National Venture Capital Association.
 That is up 17 percent from 2003, but still far below the $34 billion invested in 2000, at the peak of the phenomenon.
 Also, newer start-ups are under pressure from their venture-capital investors to outsource work to lower-cost regions, said Cynthia Kroll, a senior regional economist at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. She added that the venture capitalists, burned as the last cycle turned downward, are much more closely watching how start-ups spend money, including how they hire.
 ''That would be slowing growth of employment,'' Ms. Kroll said.
 The venture capitalists are being highly selective, said Margot Heiligman, 39, who is doing consulting work for technology companies but is in the market for a full-time job. Ms. Heiligman moved to San Francisco last November when her husband took a trumpeter position with the city's symphony orchestra.
 Ms. Heiligman previously oversaw the internal technology department for the New York law firm of Proskauer Rose and spent six years as director of business development for Swisscom, a telecommunications company in Bern, Switzerland. She is eager to find work at a start-up company, but has found that the venture backers of such companies are very selective, hiring acquaintances or people who have worked at companies they know well.
 ''I'm finding it pretty closed,'' she said of the job market. ''It's making New York look like an easy place'' to find a job.

HEADLINE: How Closing a Sub Base Could Affect Housing 

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: Groton 

 BODY:
AS has been widely publicized, the New London area will face grave economic consequences if the historic Naval Submarine Base on the Thames River in Groton is closed down. It is one of 33 large military installations across the country designated by the Pentagon to be closed, although it is possible the list may be changed in coming months. 
 ''Anyone who has a business serving the military is saying their prayers every night,'' said George K. Boyer, president of Boyer Realty Management L.L.C. in New London, a commercial and residential development and management firm. In the greater New London economy, ''we rely 60 percent on the base for stability,'' he said. ''When it goes empty, there are businesses that live off the base personnel that will suffer or go out of business.'' 
Commercial real estate like restaurants, bars, clothing and furniture stores, hotels, car dealerships, dry cleaners, supermarkets, liquor stores and scores of other businesses may wither from the loss of customers among the 7,800 military personnel and about 12,000 family members, 1,400 civilian employees, 650 reservists and more than 1,000 contractors that serve the base.
 How drastic the effect will be on residential real estate is less clear. The housing sector has been solid, with retirees moving in along the coastline and a stream of workers at Foxwoods and the Mohegan Sun casinos, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Mystic Seaport, Mystic Marinelife Aquarium and the Sonalyst and Utopia film studios.
 The median single-family-home sale price for the first quarter of 2005 in New London County was $244,500, up from $230,000 a year earlier and $200,000 in 2003, according to the Eastern Connecticut Realtors Multiple Listing Service. 
 Ten years ago, the median ranged from the low $80,000's to around $115,000, depending on the town, as listed in a market report by Prudential Connecticut Realty. 
 In New London, sales numbered 336 in 2003 and 434 last year but are projected to be 385 this year. Many realtors believe price rises this year will be about 5 or 6 percent. 
 While prices in this part of the state are far below those on the western edge of Connecticut, a shortage of housing at the low end of the price spectrum is a problem. 
 Multifamily rentals are excluded by zoning in several communities and extremely scarce in others. To meet existing demand, such developments should make up 30 percent of housing, according to a recent study. In fact, however, such rentals constitute barely 14 percent of the housing stock. The units rent for around $600 to $2,400 a month.
 The problem is being addressed by a coalition of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, the Southeastern Workforce Investment Board and the United Way of Southeastern Connecticut.
 They set up a Blue Ribbon Commission on Housing in 2000 and sponsored a study called ''Housing a Region in Transition: An Analysis of Housing Needs in Southeastern Connecticut, 2000-2005.'' It concluded that by 2010 the county needs 8,000 additional housing units that are affordable for those with relatively low incomes, said James Cronin, president of the Dime Savings Bank in Norwich and chairman of the commission.
 To that end, he said, ''the coalition is putting together a pool of $4 million from the state and local banks in order to purchase and rehabilitate existing properties for mixed housing and retail use.''
 He added, ''So far we have commitments totaling $1.5 million'' from several banks; ''we hope to get the rest by fall.'' 
 A measure of relief is built into a new Navy housing program that would be greatly expanded if the base is closed. There are more than 2,000 rental homes built for the military on 530 acres behind the base, and those that are not required for Navy personnel are being offered to the public.
 The area is a beehive of activity as older ranch houses are being renovated and 995 stylish new colonials are being built. ''People are moving in and out of there all the time,'' said John M. Vincent Jr., the broker associate in corporate and military relocation services at Prudential-Pequot Properties. ''Moving vans are all over the place.''
 The program was initiated by the Department of Defense, said Chief Petty Officer Jack O'Neill, the public affairs spokesman for the base. 
 ''All the services are getting out of the housing business as a cost-effective measure,'' he said. ''Limited liability corporations are purchasing 50-year leases on the homes. The Defense Department will still own the property, and the military has priority in renting. But once that is met, if units are still available, they can be rented to anybody.'' During the one to six years required to close a base, the tenants gradually shift from military to civilian.
 The lease on the housing near the Groton base is held by GMH Military Housing L.L.C., selected by the Department of the Navy as its partner to privatize the housing. GMH declined to comment on any aspect of the project, pending a decision on the base's future, which is to be made by November. 
 Tenants in the two- to five-bedroom homes have 24-hour on-call maintenance; heat and hot water included in the rent; and an appliance package of refrigerator, garbage disposal, dishwasher, washer-dryer hookup, cable and Internet access.
 Many homes have fenced-in yards and all have access to the base community center, pool, movie theater, commissary, medical facility, fire service, youth center, and busing to children's activities and to two public elementary schools populated overwhelmingly by Navy children. Appointments to see the model house are made at the GMH management office in Groton.
 Meanwhile, private development continues. The Konover Properties Corporation, a major Hartford developer, is one of several companies coming into the area, building homes and condos. Konover has two projects in the works: a 202-unit apartment complex in New London, with units renting from $625 to $1,000 a month; and Haley Brook, under construction in Mystic, where 28 out of 62 condo units have been presold to adults over age 50. Prices range from $198,000 to $299,000. Both projects offer one-, two- and three-bedroom units. 
 ''Over the last 10 years, Pfizer, the casinos and the sub base have brought tremendous growth to this region, and developers like ourselves are trying to fill the need for new housing,'' said Newton Brainard, Konover's vice president for development. 
 ''Consumers are increasingly wealthy, especially those from the metropolitan New York area who are coming out here increasingly, buying vacation homes and permanent homes.'' 
 ''Southeastern Connecticut,'' he said, ''is going to continue to grow, with or without the sub base.''

HEADLINE: Alternative Tax Starts to Cause Consistent Woe

BYLINE: By JESSICA KOVLER

 BODY:
FOR Joel Forbes, a banking manager, this year's tax season was unlike any other. A Yorktown resident for seven years, Mr. Forbes, 44, was used to paying his share of property, state, sales and local tax. But this year, he said, he was stunned to hear that he would have to pay nearly $8,000 in additional federal taxes because of the alternative minimum tax, a provision in the tax code that hit millions this year, including many in Westchester. 
 Nick Kounios, a tax preparer from Mount Kisco, had to break the news. ''I told him it was coming, but it's still a shock to many residents,'' he said. ''Each year, the numbers of people affected are increasing, and people don't know why they're hit with this.'' 
Mr. Forbes, like many Westchester residents, was unaware of the alternative minimum tax. The tax affected nearly four million taxpayers in 2004, but is expected to hit 20 million in 2006. 
 The tax was created in 1969 as a parallel tax to prevent some of the nation's wealthiest families from evading taxes through various loopholes. Taxes are computed through a separate calculation, and, in many cases, the calculation does not allow for deductions like local and state taxes. 
 A married couple with a gross income of $100,000, for example, must first calculate their tax bill the traditional way, then again under the alternative minimum tax. The couple must pay whichever is higher. Virtually all New York State families making at least $75,000 with two or more children will be subject to the alternative minimum tax within the next three years.
 Westchester residents, however, are not alone in their tangle with the alternative tax. County Executive Andrew J. Spano was unaware of the implications of the tax until he met with his accountant. ''It was an extra $3,000 I had to pay.'' he said. ''I was a bit surprised. It crept up on me. I wasn't aware of it. It's a big problem affecting all of us in Westchester.'' ''We have schoolteachers, policemen, every kind of working professional affected by this,'' Mr. Spano said. ''This is a middle- to upper-middle-class dilemma.''
 Now he hopes to educate the public on what he sees as the ''perils of the A.M.T.,'' and has begun a grass-roots effort to drum up support to repeal or amend the tax.
 Mr. Spano recently began a virtual-postcard campaign to local representatives in Congress and senators in hopes they will fight for the tax's repeal or reform in September, when President Bush is scheduled to hear recommendations from an advisory panel on possible changes in the tax code. Since the start of the campaign in May, there have been some 400 responses, Mr. Spano's office said. 
 One response came from a teacher in Westchester, who sent this e-mail message to Mr. Spano: 
 ''I am a single mother of three sons, two of whom are in college. I don't make enough money to pay my bills.'' She added, ''I am just another member of America's middle class getting squeezed.'' 
 Mr. Spano also plans to hold rallies around the county, and is looking for support from around the state.
 The problem with the tax, critics say, is that it has not been indexed for inflation in the way other taxes have. Congress enacted the tax in 1969 after learning that 155 families with income of more than $200,000, or more than about $1 million in today's dollars, paid no income taxes. 
 By 2010, it is estimated that at least 35 million taxpayers will be affected by the alternative minimum tax.
 Many are unaware that they will be included in the alternative minimum tax until tax time, as there are no set rules, just a set calculation. Mr. Forbes became subject to the tax as a result of property taxes on a newly built home, a salary increase and a combination of other deductions, including state and local income taxes.
 Those deductions were disallowed under the alternative-tax calculation, adding up to a higher tax debt. He had to pay the higher amount, $8,000 more than he had expected to pay. ''This is the $100,000 Westchester Poor,'' said Donald Newsholme, a certified public accountant who lives in Yorktown Heights. ''For the typical Westchester family -- two working parents, two kids about to go off to college, homeowners -- this A.M.T. is a financial burden.''
 Representative Nita Lowey, a recipient of Mr. Spano's postcards and an author of a bill to reform the tax, agreed: ''This is not the A.M.T. It's more like the M.C.T. -- Middle Class Tax.''
 As part of his campaign, Mr. Spano has asked local towns and villages and other municipalities in the state to adopt resolutions against the alternative minimum tax; so far, Ardsley, Mount Kisco, Somers, Briarcliff Manor and Rochester have announced support of alternative-minimum-tax reform.
 Knowledge, however, is still an issue, he said. Mr. Spano shared his campaign with other county executives at a national meeting last week. ''At first people thought I was referring to the cash machine. I said: 'That's an A.T.M. This is the A.M.T.''' 
 But not everyone believes repeal is a possibility, or a prudent decision. The tax, which brings in an additional $95 billion a year, can significantly reduce the national deficit, some experts say, and they disagree with politicians seeking a repeal.
 ''This has to be done responsibly, and straight repeal is irresponsible,'' said Adam Hughes, budget policy analyst at OMB Watch, a government watchdog group in Washington. He added that the country would lose some $600 billion over the next 10 years if the tax were repealed.
 Mr. Forbes summed up the alternative tax as another cost of living in Westchester. ''It's just less money in my pocket to do as I choose,'' he said. ''Vacations, doing something for the house, saving money -- it's just less discretionary income.''

HEADLINE: Garbage Plan And Asphalt Green 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Give Us Your Garbage,'' by Ramon Cruz and Michael Singer (Op-Ed, June 26), and ''Don't Trash a Good Plan'' (editorial, June 12):
As a pediatrician and pediatric oncologist, I say yes to a garbage plan that decreases pollution and lowers carcinogen exposure for our children. But I say no -- strongly -- to the proposed solid waste management plan for the city. 
 The current plan includes the East 91st Street marine transfer station. This site abuts Asphalt Green, a park and community center where hundreds of children play every week. The plan actually proposes to run an average of 130 garbage trucks five days a week (as well as 99 trucks per day on Saturdays) along a ramp that bisects the Asphalt Green complex.
 Furthermore, the proposed site lies smack in the middle of one of Manhattan's most densely populated residential neighborhoods.
 The proposed East 91st Street marine transfer station must be taken out of the solid waste management plan.

HEADLINE: How Much Is That Teacher Worth?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 One thing that often goes unacknowledged about teacher salaries is how much teachers spend out of their own pockets. My salary as a teacher in North Texas is above average, but I am given little or no money for necessary items like art supplies, paperback books or bulletin board materials.
 My school serves mostly underprivileged students, many of whom come to school with no supplies. I typically provide up to 30 of them with basics like pencils and paper.
 Teachers are expected to create a warm, inviting learning environment out of small, dismal classrooms. They are also encouraged to move away from worksheets and textbooks to projects and hands-on learning. In economically disadvantaged schools, this means that they will foot the bill for any extra supplies. 
 I love my job and will continue to make sacrifices to provide the best for my students, but it would be nice to be reimbursed.

HEADLINE: P.C. Tea

BYLINE: By Rob Walker. 
E-mail: consumed@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Honest Tea
The obvious question raised by a product called Honest Tea is: What, exactly, is dishonest tea? This sounds smart-alecky, but the name of the bottled tea does imply something more serious than mere thirst-quenching, so it's legitimate to wonder what it is trying to communicate. Is it healthfulness, or a tie-in to a cause, or a solution to an ethical quandary (in the way that Fair-Trade-certified coffee lets you wake up without feeling as if you're exploiting third-world farmers)?
 It's also worth asking because a significant group of consumers seems to be responding. Launched in 1998, Honest Tea now sells more than a dozen varieties of bottled tea (and some bag teas as well), had revenues of nearly $6 million last year and expects to hit $9 million this year, according to the company. 
 The easiest answer is that Honest Tea is part of the ''organics'' category, which has lately been quite popular with consumers. (The United States Department of Agriculture defines organic as food produced without most pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, among other things. To carry a U.S.D.A. Organic label, an item must be ''at least 95 percent organic.'' This is distinct from foods marketed as ''natural,'' which is an unregulated claim.) Seth Goldman, a founder of Honest Tea, says that he wanted to make a tea that wasn't cloyingly sweet; soon, he hit on the attraction of also making it organic, which helped the brand get distribution in places like Whole Foods. 
 But the idea of Honest Tea expanded as the company became more established. Goldman had previously worked for the Calvert Group, a mutual-fund firm that specializes in socially responsible investing, and he pushed the company to be more ambitious about selling values. It began by linking some of its varieties to specific causes or nonprofit organizations. One example, from 2002, was called Haarlem Honeybush: a bottled, unsweetened, no-caffeine variety of tea, made with ingredients from a South African farm that had backing from the United States Agency for International Development. This was a fairly ambitious agenda for a drink -- and it didn't catch on. Consumers didn't know what honeybush was (it's an African shrub), and the social impact alone wasn't enough to overcome the unusual taste. ''That's something that the company and I have probably gone through an evolution on,'' Goldman says. ''We've probably had periods where we kind of overemphasized the mission.''
 And so in 2003 Honest Tea tried a different tack with Peach Oo-la-Long. This was a bit sweeter than some of its existing teas (60 calories per 15.5-ounce bottle instead of 34), contained some caffeine and had a label that featured not just a clear flavor promise (peach) but also Opus, from the comic strip ''Bloom County.'' Goldman sums it up this way: ''We made it a much more accessible tea.'' It took off, becoming what he says was a first step toward a new goal -- to cross over into the mainstream. He adds that it is still organic and that the calorie count remains lower than that of a typical Snapple, let alone a Coke or a Pepsi. Also, Peach Oo-la-Long is made with leaves from the first tea plantation in the Darjeeling region of India to be Fair-Trade-certified, so there's still plenty to appeal to the ethical tea drinker.
 But the real point is that it also appeals to a broader group: those who are attracted to a general promise of benefits but who maybe don't want to do a lot of homework to figure out the specifics (or give up all sugar). After all, even the concept of organics is confusing to many; according to a recent Natural Marketing Institute study, many consumers said they preferred ''pesticide free'' foods, but they didn't seem to realize that this is basically what ''organic'' signifies. And while most U.S. consumers have heard of organics, N.M.I.'s study found that sales growth has lately come not from bandwagon jumpers but from a far smaller group that is growing more organic-centric. 
 Lately Honest Tea has sought to reach different kinds of consumers through outlets like Target and even, in one current test program, some 7-Eleven locations. At worst, Goldman figures, he'll reach his usual customers in new places; but ideally, he'll attract new ones who are looking for something different, maybe a bit better for them. And if they don't know what, exactly, his tea is being honest about, maybe that doesn't really matter.

 BODY:
The citizens of France are once again taking a pasting on the op-ed pages. Their failing this time is not that they are cheese-eating surrender monkeys, as they were thought to be during the invasion of Iraq, but rather that they voted to reject the new European Union constitution. According to the pundits, this was the timid, shortsighted choice of a backward-looking people afraid to face the globalized future. But another way of looking at it is that the French were simply trying to hold on to their perks -- their cradle-to-grave welfare state and, above all, their cherished 35-hour workweek.
 What's so bad about that? There was a time when the 35-hour workweek was the envy of the world, and especially of Americans, who used to travel to France just so they could watch the French relax. Some people even moved to France, bought farmhouses, adjusted their own internal clocks and wrote admiring, best-selling books about the leisurely and sensual French lifestyle. 
 But no more. The future, we are told, belongs to the modern-day Stakhanovites, who, like the famous Stalinist-era coal miner, are eager to exceed their quotas: to the people in India, say, who according to Thomas L. Friedman are eager to work a 35-hour day, not a 35-hour week. Even the Japanese, once thought to be workaholics, are mere sluggards compared with people in Hong Kong, where 70 percent of the work force now puts in more than 50 hours a week. In Japan the percentage is just 63 percent, though the Japanese have started what may become the next big global trend by putting the elderly to work. According to figures recently published in The Wall Street Journal, 71 percent of Japanese men between the ages of 60 and 64 still work, compared with 57 percent of American men the same age. In France, needless to say, the number is much lower. By the time they reach 60, only 17 percent of Frenchmen, fewer than one in five, are still punching the clock. The rest are presumably sitting in the cafe, fretting over the Turks, Bulgarians and Romanians, who, if they were admitted to the European Union, would come flooding over the French border and work day and night for next to nothing.
 How could the futurologists be so wrong? George Jetson, we should recall -- the person many of us cartoon-watchers assumed we would someday become -- worked a three-hour day, standard in the interplanetary era. Back in 1970, Alvin Toffler predicted that by 2000 we would have so much free time that we wouldn't know how to spend it.
 Economic globalization obviously has a great deal to do with the change. It has leveled the playing field all over the world, so that the have-nots can now compete more equally with the haves, especially if they are willing to work harder, longer and for lower wages, which so many of them are. And the haves, in turn, find that they have to pick up the pace just to stay even.
 But there may be a more insidious force manifesting itself -- something along the lines of an evolutionary law that says, paradoxically, the more you try to simplify or eliminate work, the more of it there is to do. Scholars estimate that medieval peasants, for example, worked between 120 and 150 days a year. They didn't have holidays as we understand them, but they had about eight weeks' worth of holy days, which amounted to the same thing. The notion of a regular workweek was a late-18th-century invention, a product of the vastly speeded-up pace of the Industrial Revolution, which instead of liberating workers, virtually enslaved them, dooming entire families to numbing stretches in what Blake called the ''dark, Satanic mills.'' The Mills and Factories Act, passed in England in 1833 to curb the worst labor abuses of the time, limited children 9 and older to 48 hours of work a week and teenagers to 69 hours. Adults worked even longer, and they did so in part simply because they could.
 The Nobel Prize-winning economic historian Robert William Fogel has studied what he calls the ''efficiency of the human engine'' and found that the mechanical advances of the Industrial Revolution were paralleled by an equal increase in the human body's size, strength and endurance. In his view the great growth industry of the 19th and 20th centuries was the capacity for work itself. 
 The more work we do, apparently, the more we're able to do, and though Fogel himself takes a sort of Toffler-like view of the 21st century, predicting that leisure will become the next great growth industry, there's little evidence of that right now. Working hours in America -- the nation in the world with by far the most efficient human engines -- have risen steadily over the last three decades. And far from complaining, we have adopted a superior, moralizing attitude that sees work not as a necessary evil, a means to an end, but as an end in itself. It is now obligatory to boast -- to lie, if necessary -- about how much you work and how little you sleep. The Stakhanov for our time is that lawyer who a few years ago billed 62 hours over a 24-hour period. 
 Most everyone now faces the dismaying prospect of falling by the evolutionary wayside, a casualty in the global rat race. Unless we can be chemically or behaviorally enhanced, that is, and for those whose work ethic is faltering, there is some encouraging news. Provigil, a drug for narcoleptics, has been tested on Army helicopter pilots, who found that it enabled them to stay awake and alert for two days straight. And the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is working on programs to modify the metabolism of soldiers so that they can will themselves not to bleed and can function efficiently without food or sleep for up to a week. They might even be able to survive without oxygen for a brief while. This is something the French would never think of.

HEADLINE: Diner's Owner Frets About Ruling

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM

 BODY:
MARIA APOSPOROS wept when she heard the news about the Kelo v. New London decision, so much so that customers at the downtown Stamford diner she operates and co-owns, Curley's on West Park Place, came over to comfort her.
 Mrs. Aposporos feared the decision would give the city and its Urban Redevelopment Commission a green light to restart efforts to condemn the diner and fold her land into a large-scale plan, already under way, to build offices and apartments on property the city took over that surrounds the diner. 
''I'm not giving up hope,'' she said, her voice breaking. ''I'm going to call Oprah. I'm going to start a revolution. Millionaires can't just take over what they want in this country.''
 Her fears of losing Curley's turned out to be premature. Both Mayor Dannel Malloy and Mrs. Aposporos's lawyer, John Wayne Fox, agreed that the New London ruling does not affect Curley's because the 2002 decision by the state Supreme Court that went against the city turned on the question of whether the 54-year-old diner was a form of community ''blight,'' and not on the city's right to seek eminent domain.
 ''Either we go back and do all this over again, or we let them keep the property,'' said Mayor Malloy, a supporter of the redevelopment plan. ''So we let them keep the property. The project has been redesigned and the city has moved on.''
 A siege mentality persists at Curley's. Last fall, the city put up a chain-link fence around property it owns abutting the diner; Curley's lost the property in a 1982 eminent domain case. The fence blocks access to the diner's 18-space rear parking lot. Mrs. Aposporos said the city was trying to induce her to sell out.
 While the diner is suing to remove the fence, Mr. Malloy defended the fence's presence as necessary because of construction of a garage about 60 yards behind Curley's rear lot. It is the first phase of a redevelopment plan that will surround Curley's with new commercial and residential construction over the next few years. A court date has been set for July 26.
 ''They kill my business,'' Mrs. Aposporos said. ''They smother me. I am not sleeping. I broke my teeth from grinding them so.''
 While dingy enamel-and-metal exterior and faded linoleum countertops render Curley's conspicuously out-of-place amid the new high-end bistros and commercial high rises around it, Marion Hjorth, a patron, said Curley's serves a need.
 ''This is like tradition, the warm and fuzzy place you can always go to, like family,'' she said.
 The fence has had an especially negative impact on Curley's lunchtime trade because there is no place for patrons to park. On one of the diner's front windows is a placard with a hand-scrawled message: ''Mr. Malloy Tear Down This Wall.''
 Meanwhile, the Health Department has filed numerous health-code violations against the diner, because of problems Mrs. Aposporos said are caused by blocked access to the diner's rear.
 Mr. Fox was more guarded than his client in describing the situation.
 ''I am not qualifying it as harassment, I leave that to others,'' he said, ''but they are making life difficult for her and making it clear it would be better if she left.''

HEADLINE: Musical Cry to Help Africa's Poor Is Heard at Concerts Around Globe

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL; Reporting for this article was contributed by Chieko Tsuneoka from Chiba, Japan; Yasuko Kamiizumi from Tokyo; Ariane Bernard from Versailles, France; Victor Homola from Berlin; Elisabetta Povoledo of The International Herald Tribune from Rome; Colin Campbell from Toronto; Nomazenda Mathiane from Johannesburg; Angela Macropoulis from Philadelphia; and Marc Lacey from Nairobi.

DATELINE: LONDON, July 2 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered here and in nine other spots around the world on Saturday for a series of free concerts meant to persuade world leaders to give more money to fight poverty in Africa.
 The concerts, held in South Africa as well as in each of the eight countries whose leaders will gather at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland starting on Wednesday, were a triumph of logistical flexibility, extravagant idealism and strange juxtapositions.
 In London, the preternaturally scruffy Sir Bob Geldof, the former Boomtown Rat and the events organizer, performed an old favorite, ''I Don't Like Mondays,'' while the clean-cut billionaire Bill Gates told the cheering crowd that ''some day in the future, all the people in the world will be able to lead a healthy life.''
 Conceived only in May and organized in haste, with additions popping up at the last minute -- concerts in Moscow and Japan were announced just a few days ago -- the Live 8 shows were intended to send a loud message to the leaders of the eight countries before their meeting. 
 In Philadelphia, an estimated 1.5 million people heard the rapper and actor Will Smith relay the sobering statistic that in Africa, one child dies every three seconds. In Johannesburg some 40,000 people gathered to listen to the music and to denounce the selfishness of the world's richest countries. 
 ''They owe us,'' said the South African pop star Zola, speaking of Europe. ''They are the ones who brought slavery, killed our ancestors. If anybody must pay, they must pay us back so that we can have jobs and education.''
 Elsewhere, some of the stars seemed unsure of the statistics they were citing -- in London, performers could not agree whether 50,000 Africans die of poverty every day, or just 20,000 -- but the sentiment was there. ''This is our moment; this is our time; this is our chance to stand up for what's right,'' Bono of U2 told the crowd in Hyde Park, saying 3,000 Africans die every day of bites from disease-carrying mosquitoes.
 U2 led off the concert here, playing ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' along with one of its composers, Sir Paul McCartney. The familiar opening line -- ''It was 20 years ago today'' -- was an affectionate reference to Live Aid, the multiact extravaganza staged in 1985, also by Sir Bob, to raise money directly for African famine relief.
 Expectations for Live 8 were high, as was on-the-scene euphoria. Chris Martin, the charismatic frontman of Coldplay, which performed in London, called the concerts ''the greatest thing that's ever been organized, probably, in the history of the world.''
 According to Sir Bob, who sweet-talked, strong-armed and shamed politicians and musicians into endorsing and taking part in the 10 concerts, the collective gatherings constituted ''the largest mandate for action in history.''
 Among his ''demands'' were that the Group of 8 leaders increase aid to Africa by $25 billion, as well as send an additional $25 billion to impoverished non-African countries. 
 The concerts included more than 200 musical acts scheduled to play more than 69 hours of music. Organizers said 5.5 billion people would be able to watch or listen on the Internet and over 182 television stations and 2,000 radio networks and stations.
 Enormous crowds turned out for the concerts in London and in Philadelphia, where a diverse and mellow crowd withstood 85-degree heat to listen to bands including Destiny's Child and the Black-Eyed Peas. But some of the other concerts -- held in Barrie, Canada; Berlin; Johannesburg; the Eden Project, an ecological theme park in Cornwall, southwestern England; Moscow; Versailles, France; Philadelphia; Rome; and Chiba, Japan -- proved not as well-attended as expected.
 The concert in Japan drew just 10,000 spectators, in a stadium that holds twice that many. At the Circus Maximus in Rome, the crowd was estimated at about 200,000, and enthusiasm was high. ''I wanted to raise their awareness about issues like canceling the debt,'' Isabella Dandina, a 40-year-old housewife, said of her three teenage children. She said she thought the initiative would jolt the Group of 8 leaders into action. ''We're all voters, if you want to put it in blackmail terms,'' she said.
 The mood was festive at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, too. ''I can feel a sense of community among all the people,'' said 31-year-old Peter Gabriel, a computer engineer, ''and many of the band leaders actually seem very convincing in what they say.''
 Many Africans were not aware that concerts were being held on their behalf. ''I hope it's going to help us Africans,'' said Jane Waisaka, a hairdresser in Nairobi, ''but I really don't know how.''
 Sir Bob has certainly been doing his best to prod politicians into paying attention, publicly berating Italy and Canada, saying they do not spend enough money on foreign aid. 
 The call was taken up at the concert in Barrie, a town about an hour north of Toronto, where the Canadian musician Tom Cochrane said onstage that foreign aid should represent 0.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
 But a poll published Saturday said most Canadians agreed with their prime minister, Paul Martin, that spending should be kept in check so as to preserve the country's budget surplus.
 ''I'm sure Bob Geldof means well,'' the commentator Connie Woodcock wrote recently in the Toronto Sun, ''but where does this second-string musician get off telling Paul Martin he doesn't like our foreign aid spending?''

HEADLINE: A Mall in Decline Eyes Fish-Market Space

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
THE South Street Seaport has long been perceived as a mall in decline -- but fortunes there could begin to change this summer when the neighboring Fulton Fish Market is expected to move to the Bronx, creating an opportunity for the shopping center's owner to expand and revive the Seaport. 
 The mall's owner, General Growth Properties, a large real estate investment trust, has told the city that it plans to exercise an option in its lease to take over portions of the fish market, including the Tin Building on Pier 17, which has landmark status, and several brick fish market stalls on South Street, city officials and a mall executive say.
In preparation, the company has hired the architecture firm of Beyer Blinder Belle to come up with a plan for an expanded and possibly reconfigured Seaport, according to Michael Piazzola, vice president and general manager of Seaport Marketplace, the company that operates the mall for General Growth. Beyer Blinder Belle has been asked to find ways that the new properties can be incorporated into the current complex, which includes a series of shops and restaurants along Fulton and Front Streets and a three-tier mall on Pier 17, in the East River. 
 ''They're basically on a fact-finding mission to understand what the development potential of the site is, what the as-of-right looks like and what the potential is over and above what the zoning allows today,'' Mr. Piazzola said.
 General Growth has also met with members of Community Board 1, which covers Lower Manhattan, and the city's Economic Development Corporation, to discuss possible Seaport changes. ''There's this desire for more than just retail,'' Mr. Piazzola said. Possible uses include restaurants, cultural venues and housing, he said. 
 The company has six months after the fish market departs to exercise its lease option. The market, which has been on South Street for more than 180 years, is scheduled to move to a new facility in Hunts Point in the Bronx this summer, although the move has already been postponed several times.
 The Chicago-based General Growth took over the Seaport last November, when it acquired the Rouse Company, which created the mall. The Seaport was developed in 1983 on property leased from the city. 
 Some ideas for an expanded Seaport had already been explored by Rouse, which last year was on the verge of a deal with the Related Companies and the city to knock down the Pier 17 mall and replace it with a theater for Cirque du Soleil, the Montreal-based avant-garde circus. General Growth opted not to follow through with that deal when it bought Rouse.
 The Rouse plan, however, is a focus of a lawsuit filed against the mall operator by a group of Pier 17 merchants last fall in state Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking $80 million in damages. General Growth has inherited the lawsuit, in which the tenants charge that Rouse overbilled them for a variety of charges, misappropriated funds meant to promote the Seaport and sought to drive away tenants to clear the way for its planned redevelopment.
 The tenants who filed the suit say they were never informed of the talks between Rouse, Related and the city, which included provisions to buy them out or have the state condemn their leases. General Growth has pursued eviction proceedings against several merchants involved in the lawsuit, claiming that they have fallen behind on payments or that their leases had expired. 
 David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, refused to discuss the suit or the company's redevelopment plans. Lawyers for the company have asked a judge to dismiss portions of the lawsuit and say the charges are unfounded.
 Gerry Nally, who owns the Seaport Watch Company in the Pier 17 mall, is a prime mover behind the lawsuit. He says that his sales dropped 37 percent from 2000 through 2004. In that period, he says, promotional events at the mall became less frequent or declined in quality and stores offering less-upscale products were added at the mall. 
 The Seaport, covering 260,000 square feet, is really two malls in one. Merchants on the terra firma portion of the mall, on and around Fulton Street, have not joined the lawsuit and apparently have not had the same problems. Complaints are concentrated on Pier 17, which has always had a greater challenge attracting customers because it is more out of the way. 
 Merchants on the pier also say escalators installed in 2000 routinely break down. And they complain that General Growth has continued a pattern, first established by Rouse, of renting out many stores on short-term leases for far below what the more established merchants are paying. Mr. Nally estimated that about half of the pier's tenants are on short-term leases. These short-term tenants include T-shirt shops, a bonsai shop and a poster gallery.
 Mr. Piazzola said General Growth ''has a very aggressive specialty leasing division'' that has a standing relationship with small retailers that may take temporary space in several malls at one time, or move from mall to mall as space becomes available. ''That drives a lot of revenue for the company, and by its very nature specialty leasing deals are short term,'' he said.
 Asked if maintaining short-term leaseholders at Pier 17 was part of a larger strategy, he said, ''At the end of the day we've hired an architect, we're planning on repositioning the project in the marketplace and the landlord has every right to maintain its flexibility with regard to its occupancy.'' 
 Meanwhile, retail brokers said the Seaport is off the radar screen of high-end retailers seeking space in Manhattan. ''Brokers go to other areas where the retailers want to go,'' said Benjamin Fox, executive vice president of Newmark Retail. He pointed to heavy competition for shoppers from areas like Times Square and said the Seaport must find a way to distinguish itself. 
 Matthew Ostrower, an analyst with Morgan Stanley who specializes in the retail sector, said General Growth is the second largest retail REIT in the country. ''Redeveloping mall assets is their bread and butter: buying a 'B' mall and trying to turn it into an 'A' mall, buying a 'C' mall and trying to turn it in to a 'B' mall,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Town That Bled Under Hussein Hails His Trial

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS; Razzaq al-Saiedi and Khalid al-Ansary contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DUJAIL, Iraq 

 BODY:
The scars of what happened after an assassination attempt on Saddam Hussein, on July 8, 1982, are painfully evident in this mainly Shiite town 35 miles north of Baghdad.
 People lower their voices when they speak of fathers, brothers and sons who went to the gallows, their fates unknown until Mr. Hussein's overthrow 21 years later set off the ransacking of a secret police headquarters in Baghdad that uncovered records of the executions. The landscape around Dujail is mostly barren scrubland, stark testament to the bulldozing of thousands of acres of date palms and fruit orchards after plotters fired on Mr. Hussein's convoy from thickets on the edge of town.
 Now, the events at Dujail have come full cycle for Mr. Hussein. 
 Officials at the Iraqi Special Tribunal set up to try the former dictator and his top aides have said they expect to put him on trial by the end of the year in the deaths of nearly 160 men and boys from Dujail, all Shiites, some in their early teens. Some were shot dead in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt, but 143 -- 9 of them ages 13 through 15 -- were executed three years later by Mr. Hussein's revolutionary court. Townspeople say that many others remain missing -- at least 200, by some counts -- and that they hope the trial will reveal at least something of their fate.
 For now, their families have only fading photographs of their lost menfolk at weddings, school graduations and summer outings, and tales of the moments they disappeared, seized on the streets or pulled from their homes by secret police squads that descended on Dujail in the days that followed the attack on Mr. Hussein.
 Along the sun-blasted streets and alleyways of the town, a nondescript, impoverished sprawl of single- and double-storied concrete structures and makeshift, domeless mosques beside the main highway to Iraq's oil-rich north, the prospect of seeing Mr. Hussein, 68, facing a possible death sentence has brought relief -- at least to the three-quarters of the population who are Shiites, though not to many in the Sunni Arab minority in the town, where there are still fierce loyalties to Mr. Hussein.
 ''Having Saddam on trial for what he did here will be good for Dujail, and for all of Iraq, because many people in this country, and in Dujail, still think of him as some kind of a god,'' said Ali Haj Hussein, a 37-year-old Shiite who lost seven brothers in the executions that followed the assassination attempt, including one, Hussein, 19, who confessed to his father before he died that he was one of those who had shot at the Iraqi ruler. 
 The visit to Dujail amounted to a venture into enemy territory for Saddam Hussein. In 1982, he was in his third year as president, still consolidating his power, and many in this town, with a population of about 75,000, despised him for starting a war with Iran, Iraq's Shiite neighbor, two years earlier. Shiites here say that Mr. Hussein had long distrusted the presence of a large Shiite enclave, including Dujail and the nearby town of Balad, deep inside Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland -- and beside the main highway from Baghdad to Tikrit, Mr. Hussein's hometown.
 A conservative Shiite religious party, Dawa, with an armed wing that had mounted terrorist attacks against Mr. Hussein's government, had strong support in Dujail, and saw in his visit a chance to avenge the government's killings of hundreds of Dawa leaders and sympathizers. The plotters named the mission Operation Bint Huda, after the sister of Dawa's founder, Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr, a prominent Shiite cleric. The two were executed in 1980.
 Other crimes for which Mr. Hussein is likely to face eventual prosecution, in separate trials, include the Anfal campaign -- the Arabic word means spoils -- of the late 1980's, in which as many as 150,000 Kurds were killed, many shot and dumped into mass graves, others killed in poison-gas attacks; the chemical weapons attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in March 1988 that killed about 5,000, which is likely to be treated as a separate case, like Dujail; and the repression of a Shiite rebellion in southern Iraq in 1991, in which 150,000 people are believed to have been killed. Also under investigation by the tribunal are the executions of more than 200 Baath Party leaders after Mr. Hussein seized power in 1979.
 But the Dujail trial will set the pattern for the others, and lawyers for Mr. Hussein have made it clear they plan to use every legal recourse to expose the proceedings as a show trial, manipulated by the American lawyers who run the Regime Crimes Liaison Office, an American Embassy agency that has been the legal and financial mainstay of the tribunal.
 ''All over the world, people know Saddam Hussein as the man who said 'No!' to America, and it will be so in court,'' said Ziad Najdawi, a Jordanian who is part of an international team of defense lawyers.
 ''They can talk as they want, about executions and chemical weapons and mass graves, but we will say, 'It is all lies, nothing but lies. Everything here is tainted by America.''' 
 On the summer afternoon 23 years ago when Mr. Hussein came to Dujail, he was greeted with gunfire from the palm groves on the north side of town, survivors say. The first to rush to the streets were the youths; they had heard rumors for days that something important was about to happen. Army helicopters had been circling near the town, and official vehicles from Baghdad had been coming and going from the Baath Party headquarters in a grim, guarded compound along the road leading into Dujail from the main north-south highway. 
 ''It was about 2:30 p.m. when we heard people saying that Saddam had arrived, so we ran into the streets to see him, and right away his bodyguards started shooting at us, and they killed three of my friends,'' said Ghalib Hussein Abbas, a 42-year-old tractor driver now, then an unemployed youth of 19.
 Fleeing to their homes, the townspeople saw the helicopters return, firing at villages amid the palm groves from which the plotters had attacked. 
 Two days later, survivors said, a 24-hour curfew was eased when loudspeakers announced that those missing relatives should go to the Baath headquarters and search among rows of bodies laid out in the building's forecourt. For some, it was a trap. According to witnesses' statements to the tribunal, four of the men set to go on trial with Mr. Hussein had gathered at the building to direct vengeance on the town: his half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, deputy head of the Mukhabarat secret police in 1982; Taha Yasin Ramadan, a deputy prime minister and later Baath Party vice chairman; and the two local Baathist officials, Abdullah al-Musheikhi and his son, Mizher al-Musheikhi. Another defendant will be Awad Hamad al-Bandr al-Sadoon, former chief judge of the revolutionary court. 
 In small groups at first, then in larger roundups, about 1,500 townspeople were arrested, as many as 30 from single families, and started on a journey into Mr. Hussein's gulags -- first at a detention center in Tikrit, later at a secret police detention center in Baghdad, and finally, to the Nugra as-Salman prison, an old British-built fort in the desert along the Saudi Arabian border. Some survivors, who were released in 1986, say that the appalling conditions at the prison caused several dozen deaths, including women, children and nursing infants. The 143 who were hanged never got beyond detention in Baghdad, where Mr. Sadoon, the chief of the revolutionary court, sent them to the execution chambers at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad.
 Accounts from local Shiites say Mr. Hussein outwitted the Dujail plotters from the start. On his entry to the town, those accounts say, tribal leaders made him a gift of a car, and marked it, in tribal tradition, with hands dipped in the blood of slaughtered sheep. Mr. Hussein, though, Shiites in Dujail say, saw the gift as a possible harbinger of assassination and returned the car, insisting that the tribal leaders and some of his aides travel in it -- to their deaths, as the accounts have it, when the plotters fired on the car.
 A few hours after the shooting, Mr. Hussein took to the flat roof of the town's main clinic and told a crowd that he was ''not a coward who can be chased from your town,'' but assured his listeners there would be no reprisals. ''He told us that the people who had attempted to kill him were a small band of traitors, and that we don't want to confuse them with the good people of Dujail,'' said Kassem Aalbuhaider, a shopkeeper now, then only 12.
 But even as Mr. Hussein spoke, Mr. Aalbuhaider said, the secret police were at work. ''They took whole families, even old people, women and small children,'' he said.
 Within weeks, the razing of the palm groves and the orchards began, continuing until more than 250,000 acres had been bulldozed. In 1992, after the first Persian Gulf war, Mr. Hussein returned to Dujail for the first time, and told tribal leaders that the wastelands could be replanted, with grain crops, but not with palms and orchards. But it took 12 more years, and the overthrow of Mr. Hussein, before the town could begin in other ways to recover from what townspeople now refer to simply as ''al karitha,'' the disaster.
 Now, the plinths where Mr. Hussein's statues and portraits once stood at the town's major intersections are bare, and the streets are hung with portraits of the white-bearded clerics who are the icons of religious Shiites. The Baath Party headquarters serves now as a Shiite mosque. But the totems that seem to matter most are the date palms that some townspeople began planting discreetly in the mid-1990's as memorials to those who died.
 On a recent evening, Mr. Hussein, the townsman who lost seven brothers to the gallows, led a visitor to the family's fields outside the town and through a grove of half-grown palms dedicated to them: Faleh, Hussein, Mahmud, Mohsen, Muhammad, Saad and Salim. ''Here, I feel like a king,'' he said, smiling broadly as he reached out to touch the palm trees' drooping fronds. ''Like these trees, Iraq is reborn. We are just at the beginning, but once Saddam has been tried and executed, we believe Dujail will begin to rise again.''

The Iraqi Special Tribunal plans 12 to 15 trials, each focusing on an atrocity or sequence of atrocities committed during Mr. Hussein's rule. Dujail has the legal merit, prosecutors say, of involving a ''discrete event,'' detailed in official records and in witness statements. This makes the case easier to try than other mass killings where the spread of events was greater, the documents and witnesses harder to find and the ''command responsibility'' of Mr. Hussein more difficult to pin down.

HEADLINE: A Livable Shade Of Green

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
When President Bush travels to the Group of 8 summit meeting this week, he'll stiff Tony Blair and other leaders who are appealing for firm action on global warming.
 ''Kyoto would have wrecked our economy,'' Mr. Bush told a Danish interviewer recently, referring to the accord to curb carbon emissions. Maybe that was a plausible argument a few years ago, but now the city of Portland is proving it flat wrong. 
Newly released data show that Portland, America's environmental laboratory, has achieved stunning reductions in carbon emissions. It has reduced emissions below the levels of 1990, the benchmark for the Kyoto accord, while booming economically.
 What's more, officials in Portland insist that the campaign to cut carbon emissions has entailed no significant economic price, and on the contrary has brought the city huge benefits: less tax money spent on energy, more convenient transportation, a greener city, and expertise in energy efficiency that is helping local businesses win contracts worldwide.
 ''People have looked at it the wrong way, as a drain,'' said Mayor Tom Potter, who himself drives a Prius hybrid. ''Actually it's something that attracts people. It's economical; it makes sense in dollars.''
 I've been torn about what to do about global warming. But the evidence is growing that climate change is a real threat: I was bowled over when I visited the Arctic and talked to Eskimos who described sea ice disappearing, permafrost melting and visits by robins, for which they have no word in the local language.
 In the past, economic models tended to discourage aggressive action on greenhouse gases, because they indicated that the cost of curbing carbon emissions could be extraordinarily high, amounting to perhaps 3 percent of G.N.P. 
 That's where Portland's experience is so crucial. It confirms the suggestions of some economists that we can take initial steps against global warming without economic disruptions. Then in a decade or two, we can decide whether to proceed with other, costlier steps.
 In 1993, Portland became the first local government in the United States to adopt a strategy to deal with climate change. The latest data, released a few weeks ago, show the results: Greenhouse gas emissions last year in Multnomah County, which includes Portland, dropped below the level of 1990, and per capita emissions were down 13 percent.
 This was achieved partly by a major increase in public transit, including two light rail lines and a streetcar system. The city has also built 750 miles of bicycle paths, and the number of people commuting by foot or on bicycle has increased 10 percent.
 Portland offers all city employees either a $25-per-month bus pass or car pool parking. Private businesses are told that if they provide employees with subsidized parking, they should also subsidize bus commutes.
 The city has also offered financial incentives and technical assistance to anyone constructing a ''green building'' with built-in energy efficiency.
 Then there are innumerable little steps, such as encouraging people to weatherize their homes. Portland also replaced the bulbs in the city's traffic lights with light-emitting diodes, which reduce electricity use by 80 percent and save the city almost $500,000 a year.
 ''Portland's efforts refute the thesis that you can't make progress without huge economic harm,'' says Erik Sten, a city commissioner. ''It actually goes all the other way -- to the extent Portland has been successful, the things that we were doing that happened to reduce emissions were the things that made our city livable and hence desirable.''
 Mr. Sten added that Portland's officials were able to curb carbon emissions only because the steps they took were intrinsically popular and cheap, serving other purposes like reducing traffic congestion or saving on electrical costs. ''I haven't seen that much willingness even among our environmentalists,'' he said, ''to do huge masochistic things to save the planet.''
 So as he heads to the summit meeting, Mr. Bush should get a briefing on Portland's experience (a full report is at www.sustainableportland.org) and accept that we don't need to surrender to global warming.
 Perhaps eventually we will face hard trade-offs. But for now Portland shows that we can help our planet without ''wrecking'' our economy -- indeed, at no significant cost at all. At the Group of 8, that should be a no-brainer.

LENGTH: 584 words

HEADLINE: An Afternoon Like America, Cognitive Dissonance and All

BYLINE: By KELEFA SANNEH

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 2 

 BODY:
Just after noon on Saturday, the actor and rapper Will Smith took the stage in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, flanked by a copy of the Declaration of Independence and ready to make his own ''declaration of interdependence.''
 This was the American installment of the Live 8 concerts, organized to draw attention to African poverty. It seems likely, though, that some (O.K., nearly all) concertgoers were a bit fuzzy on the details and, as the warm but breezy afternoon dragged on, a bit fuzzy on everything else, too. 
 The concert was broadcast by MTV and VH1 and was available online at aol.com. So the fans on Benjamin Franklin Parkway might have had a better view (but a worse tan) at home. The concertgoers were hundreds of feet from performers who couldn't really see them, separated by the enormous statue of George Washington, who didn't seem impressed: his horse was showing the stage its less photogenic side.
 These concerts certainly helped focus attention on Africa, but they also helped focus attention on a group of people who need it much less and want it much more: the performers themselves. On a stage this big, everyone gets bigger.
 And, in a sense, smaller. In the global context of Live 8, the American idols seemed like mere local favorites. This was an afternoon that sounded like America: an entertaining mishmash of hip-hop, R&B and country music, with rock 'n' roll bringing up the rear. The schedule ranged from Jay-Z to Toby Keith to the Dave Matthews Band. Clearly, Americans love dissonance, especially the cognitive sort. 
 Many performers made brief speeches, but they didn't worry too much about matching the music to the message. The members of Destiny's Child sang their fierce, unsentimental R&B. Linkin Park and Jay-Z played an effective, mashed-up set of plaintive hard rock and swaggering hip-hop. And in a singularly strange moment, Mr. Smith arrived for his set on a sedan, borne aloft by six porters. (Maybe that's what he meant by interdependence.)
 Stevie Wonder played a crowd-pleasing, show-closing set; someone like him doesn't have to strain to seem monumental. The funk-rock band Maroon 5 did strain, though, and it showed in their dull trudge through Neil Young's ''Rockin' in the Free World.''
 The great rapper-producer Kanye West began his charged-up set with ''Diamonds From Sierra Leone'': the title promises high-mindedness, but the lyrics deliver only shameless (and witty) jokes, including one about a stripper named Porsche. And the Australian country-rock star Keith Urban might have earned some new fans with his excellent set, full of big, breezy hits.
 It was Rob Thomas (of Matchbox Twenty) who delivered the day's best segue. He announced, eloquently, that AIDS kills ''two 9/11's a day'' in Africa. Then came a confession: ''This next song has nothing to do with that.'' 
 This is how Live 8 works: it's a bait and switch. The big names draw big crowds looking to hear big songs and the organizer, Sir Bob Geldof, finds a way to redirect some of that enthusiasm.
 But it's often easier to attract attention than to redirect it, as some of the performers might have noticed. Music fans -- and, for that matter, music critics -- can be infuriatingly blinkered. Trying to get to keep us focused is a bit like trying to teach a dog the meaning of pointing. Sometimes you succeed. And sometimes you gesture wildly while the poor creature just sits there, mesmerized by the movement of your hand.

HEADLINE: Africa at the Summit

 BODY:
''There can be no excuse, no defense, no justification for the plight of millions of our fellow human beings in Africa today. And there should be nothing that stands in our way in changing it.'' That ringing summons was issued by Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, earlier this year, when he presented the compelling findings and lucid recommendations of his Commission for Africa. Later this week, we will see whether President Bush has the vision and compassion to meet those challenges, and grasp a historic opportunity to radically improve the life prospects of millions of those fellow human beings. 
 An unusual and mutually reinforcing set of possibilities is converging around this week's summit meeting of the world's richest countries in Scotland. If Mr. Bush is truly the compassionate conservative he says he is, he will not let the moment pass with the United States continuing to contribute far less than its share to the international effort to include Africa in the prosperity of the 21st century. 
Africa is not looking for handouts. It is looking for help in nurturing the human capital, physical infrastructure and governmental capacities that are indispensable to modern development. Africa's poor are asking the world's rich countries for an admission ticket to the modern world. America, the world's richest country, would betray its values and its humanity by holding back. 
 To his great credit, Mr. Bush has been more attentive to the problems of Africa than his recent predecessors. He has increased overall assistance, stepped up spending on H.I.V./AIDS programs and created the Millennium Challenge Account to reward Africa's best-governed countries. Last week he promised further increases, including a program to fight malaria, and new teacher training and scholarship money to help girls attend school. 
 But so far there has been a discouraging gap between Mr. Bush's generous declarations and the money Washington has actually made available to Africa. The White House has failed to push the Republican-controlled Congress to fully finance Mr. Bush's aid programs and failed to spur its own aid appointees to get the money flowing to where it is most urgently needed.
 At this point, America's total worldwide spending on all forms of foreign aid still amounts to only a relatively stingy 0.16 percent of this country's gross national income, one of the lowest proportions in the developed world. Most European countries represented at this week's summit meeting are already giving substantially higher percentages of their smaller national incomes. Many have promised to double those percentages between now and 2010. Mr. Bush needs to commit Washington to a substantially faster rate of increase to make America once again a leader in global development.
 A brighter future for Africa will require more than just increased aid. The other recommendations made by Mr. Blair's commission are just as important. Rich-world agricultural subsidies make it possible for high-cost American, European and Japanese farmers to undersell efficient African producers even in their home markets; they must be phased out. Attention and money must be devoted to strengthening peace agreements and preventing conflicts before they erupt -- a far cheaper and more humane approach than waiting to send help only after genocide and other atrocities start appearing on international television screens.
 Donors must also make certain that African governments are held accountable for how the money is spent. Western countries can fight corruption by urging their own companies to be more transparent about the money they pay to African governments for oil, diamonds and other valuable commodities and by pressing Western banks to better monitor and police suspicious deposits and fund transfers.
 There is a desperate need for greater policy coherence in a period when many national governments, including Washington, are sensibly exhorting African governments to spend more on primary health care and education while international financial institutions largely controlled by those same Western governments have been pressing African countries to shrink their government payrolls, including teachers and health care workers. 
 Africa comes to this week's summit meeting proclaiming its commitment to be a responsible and constructive partner in its own development. It has made significant accomplishments over the past decade or so. These include a rising trend of multiparty elections across the continent (tyrannies like Zimbabwe's are now the exception, not the rule), an important reduction in the number and scope of destructive civil wars (Darfur being a tragic counterexample), the spread of enlightened economic management (notably in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana) and brave governmental forays against corruption in places like Nigeria.
 Nurturing these positive trends and providing hope for Africa's millions, is, as Mr. Blair unflinchingly put it, ''the fundamental moral challenge of our generation.'' We beseech Mr. Bush to embrace that challenge on behalf of the American people.

HEADLINE: The Mall That Would Save America 

BYLINE: By Amanda Griscom Little. 
Amanda Griscom Little writes a syndicated column about the environment that appears on Grist.org and Salon.com.

 BODY:
Robert Congel, a commercial real-estate developer who lives in upstate New York, has a plan to ''change the world.'' Convinced that it will ''produce more benefit for humanity than any one thing that private enterprise has ever done,'' he is raising $20 billion to make it happen. That's 12 times the yearly budget of the United Nations and more than 25 times Congel's own net worth.
 What Congel has in mind is an outsize and extremely unusual mega-mall. Destiny U.S.A., the retail-and-entertainment complex he is building in upstate New York, aspires to be not only the biggest man-made structure on the planet but also the most environmentally friendly. Equal parts Disney World, Las Vegas, Bell Laboratories and Mall of America -- with a splash of Walden Pond -- the ''retail city'' will include the usual shops and restaurants as well as an extensive research facility for testing advanced technologies and a 200-acre recreational biosphere complete with springlike temperatures and an artificial river for kayaking. 
 After a false start in 2002, countless changes of plan and a storm of local opposition, Congel is finally breaking ground again, with a projected completion date of 2009. Later this month, bulldozers powered by biodiesel are scheduled to begin leveling the site, a rehabilitated brownfield in Syracuse, Congel's hometown. Whether Congel's firm, the Pyramid Companies, can maintain the cash flow and political support needed to complete the project is a subject of much local debate. Also disputed are Congel's goals of creating 200,000 jobs regionally and making Destiny nothing less than ''the No. 1 tourist destination in America.'' 
 More mind-boggling than the sheer scope of Destiny is its agenda. Congel emphasizes that renewable energy alone will power the mall, with its 1,000 shops and restaurants, 80,000 hotel rooms, 40,000-seat arena and Broadway-style theaters. As a result, Congel says, Destiny will jump-start renewable-energy markets nationwide with its investments in solar, wind, fuel cells and other alternative-energy sources. But if Congel does manage to erect his El Dorado, will it really help cure our country's addiction to scarce and highly polluting fossil fuel? Or will it just be a cleverly marketed boondoggle that may create more environmental problems than it solves? 
 All by itself, the mall would boost America's solar-electric power capacity by nearly 10 percent. ''On every level, this project astounds,'' Senator Hillary Clinton said in April, claiming that the mall could make the area a hub for clean technologies and deliver a shot of adrenaline to upstate New York's ailing economy. To help foot the bill for Congel's project, Clinton and other politicians successfully persuaded Congress to provide financial incentives for mega-scale green development projects. (Destiny, of course, will face little competition to reap those benefits.) 
 An avid Bush supporter who already has 25 shopping malls to his name, Congel himself is not a man you would expect to entertain an eccentric clean-energy vision. It first seized him in 2001, soon after 9/11 -- and after the project was under way -- during a visit to the D-Day beaches in Normandy. ''There I was looking at those pure white graves of tens of thousands of kids that died for freedom,'' Congel reflects, sitting on the veranda of his 6,000-acre farm just outside Syracuse, where he has imported Russian wild boar and other exotic game for hunting. ''Today our kids are dying in a war for oil. Petroleum addiction is destroying our country, our economy, our environment.'' 
 Several months after returning from Normandy, Congel announced that not a drop of fossil fuel would be used in the making of Destiny. Almost overnight the mission of the project changed. It went from the mall that could save the depressed economy of Syracuse to the mall that could save America by establishing a new model for green commercial development. But will shoppers actually want to travel from far and wide to a little-known city's eco-friendly mall? And even with the green tax benefits, it is vastly more expensive to power Destiny with renewable sources than with conventional grid energy -- so where's the financial logic? 
 Here's where Congel's schemes to create ''monster profits'' come in. Intel, Clear Channel, Cisco, Sony and Microsoft are among the brands that Destiny has recruited to supply its retail, entertainment, security and energy technologies. Many suppliers are planning to build local offices that will aid the Syracuse economy, and all have agreed to participate in the on-site development of new technologies that could be tested on the captive audience of mall-goers. (Congel will be a co-owner of the patents on all inventions.) A group of companies hopes to perfect a new wireless radio frequency identification technology to enable customers to purchase items instantly without waiting in line. The Department of Homeland Security and A.D.T., a home-security company, have discussed testing new devices that will track all visitors entering and leaving the mall.
 Some locals, however, question Congel's promises of economic benefits to the region, arguing that Destiny may be an elaborate charade. ''He is legally bound to build only a fraction of the square footage of his plan,'' says John DeFrancisco, a state senator and a leading critic of the mall. ''Congel could reap extraordinary tax benefits without actually meeting his goals. There is no guarantee that won't happen.'' And while many environmentalists embrace Congel's grand ideas, others are skeptical. ''How do you reconcile the glaring paradox of an ostensibly fossil-fuel-free development that requires tremendous amounts of fossil fuels to transport visitors to the site?'' asks Ashok Gupta, an energy economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Moreover, there is something eerily postmodern, even postenvironmental, about the whole of Congel's project: the mega-mall is located on the fringes of the Adirondacks, but visitors will experience only virtual meadows, faux ponds, a river replica and a five-story imitation of a mountain peak.
 While environmentalists are often regarded as doomsayers, Congel is without question an optimist: he is certain that America and its great commercial endeavors can thrive in a post-fossil-fuel era. A similar conviction is represented in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign to put solar installations on a million California rooftops and in the agreement by the mayors of more than 165 American cities to honor the Kyoto Protocol and help develop renewable energy. Although Destiny is still years away from opening, Congel's executives have already held talks with Schwarzenegger about exporting the franchise and have excited interest from developers in England and China. Of course, Destiny's success could be bittersweet to some: if Congel has his way, the road to eco-paradise will not only be paved; it will be glassed-in, climate-controlled and lined with shops.

HEADLINE: Tone Deaf on Africa

BYLINE: By William Easterly. 
William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University, is the author of ''The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics.''

 BODY:
BONO, Jeffrey Sachs, Tony Blair, rock bands, finance ministers and aid agencies have been vowing to ''make poverty history'' in Africa as the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland begins this week. The proponents of a comprehensive plan to end Africa's poverty say the solutions are easy. For example, Gordon Brown, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, says preventing the deaths of five million children over the next 10 years would cost just $3 more for each new mother in the world's poorest countries. All told, Tony Blair's Commission for Africa calls for $25 billion more in aid to Africa per year. 
 It's great that so many are finally noticing the tragedy of Africa. But sadly, historical evidence says that the solutions offered by big plans are not so easy. From 1960 to 2003, we spent $568 billion (in today's dollars) to end poverty in Africa. Yet these efforts still did not lift Africa from misery and stagnation. 
 Why don't big plans work? Because they miss the critical elements of feedback and accountability. If consumers like a product, its maker prospers; if they don't, the company goes out of business. If voters complain about public services to their local politician, the politician either fixes the problem or gets voted out of office. It doesn't always work, but it works well enough for rich people to get potato chips and paved roads. 
 For the poor, Professor Sachs and the United Nations Millennium Project propose everything from nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees to replenish the soil, to rainwater harvesting, to battery-charging stations, for, by my count, 449 interventions. Poor Africans have no market or democratic mechanisms to let planners in New York know which of the 449 interventions they need, whether they are satisfied with the results, or whether the goods ever arrived at all. 
 Take the nitrogen-fixing leguminous trees that cure exhausted soils. As one study pointed out, the trees don't grow well in shade, they can proliferate as weeds and they can wind up competing for soil nutrients, especially in arid areas. It's easy to decree a solution at the top, but it will never work without the detailed local knowledge at the bottom -- which planners in New York cannot possibly process.
 To make it worse, the United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and national aid agencies like the United States Agency for International Development are jointly responsible for these interventions to reach the Millennium Development Goals (which are various indicators of reduced poverty). Collective responsibility for big goals doesn't hold any one agency accountable if the effort fails; they can always point to others as the ones who are to blame. 
 Who took responsibility, for example, for missing the goal of universal primary school enrollment by 2000 set by a 1990 United Nations conference? Instead, it is now one of the Millennium Development Goals for 2015. 
 The sensible alternative is to concentrate on piecemeal solutions to poor people's problems. You can evaluate the results of a specific intervention by comparing them with conditions in another group without the intervention, and you can get feedback from those affected and hold an individual aid agency accountable. 
 The Dutch aid organization I.C.S. Africa distributed deworming drugs to schoolchildren in the Busia district of Kenya. Ninety-two percent of the children had intestinal worms that cause listlessness, malnutrition and pain. I.C.S. invited economists to evaluate its program, comparing those children who got the drugs with those who did not. The deworming drugs decreased school absenteeism by a quarter. ''Pupils who had been miserable now became active and lifeful,'' said a schoolteacher. 
 Piecemeal projects have led to progress in other areas as well. Twenty-five percent of the population in African countries had access to clean water in 1970; 60 percent do so today. The enrollment rate in secondary school has gone from less than 5 percent to more than 30 percent over the last 40 years; over the same period, increased vaccination helped infant mortality fall by more than a third. Aid agencies are more accountable on visible piecemeal steps like water pipes and wells, school buildings and vaccinations -- where individual contributions can be measured -- than they are on nebulous goals like African poverty reduction, which depends on many players and many factors. 
 Piecemeal fixers do not promise the miracles that planners do; they just quietly deliver results. Accountability for aid would transfer power from planners to fixers, both African and foreign. Maybe then we can hold some aid agency accountable to get the full value of those three additional dollars to each new mother.

HEADLINE: In Fight to Confirm New Justice, Two Field Generals Rally Their Troops Again

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and LYNETTE CLEMETSON; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
The last time Ralph G. Neas and C. Boyden Gray went head to head as commanding generals in a war over a Supreme Court confirmation was in 1991, when Clarence Thomas was the nominee. Now, with the resignation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, they are adversaries again.
 Mr. Gray, who was White House counsel for President George Bush, won the Thomas battle. 
 But by all accounts, Mr. Neas had the superior operation: a unified battalion of labor unions, civil rights groups, women's organizations, civil libertarians and environmentalists that had more money, more energy and more firepower than had ever been used in a Supreme Court fight. It was an expansion of the same force Mr. Neas mobilized successfully in 1987 to defeat the nomination of Robert H. Bork. 
 After the bruising Thomas conflict, Mr. Gray, surprised by the fervor of the opposition, vowed he would never be outgunned again.
 ''When I was counsel, there was nothing out there,'' he said in a recent interview at his law office. ''We didn't have the infrastructure with Bork or Thomas. The other side existed, but this side did not.''
 This year, said Mr. Gray, chairman of the Committee for Justice, an organization he formed three years ago to work for the president's judicial nominees, he was mustering outside forces that would be up to the fight.
 ''We haven't leveled the playing field,'' Mr. Gray said. ''But at least we're on the field and we're able to engage.'' There is no doubt that his side has been much fortified. Progress for America, a group with close ties to the Bush administration, has begun to spend a pledged $18 million on advertising and organizing for the confirmation battle. Christian conservatives, who are far better organized and sophisticated than they were when the first President Bush named Justice Thomas to the court, are springing into action. And Mr. Gray, like his opponent, expects to have far greater reserves of cash and armies of activists this time around.
 Some familiar faces are assisting Mr. Gray, who talks regularly with the White House about judicial nominees, in the confirmation campaign. The growing clout of Christian conservatives has given him new allies. He works closely with Jay Sekulow, general counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, a Christian conservative legal group founded by the televangelist Pat Robertson, and Leonard Leo, a top official of the conservative Federalist Society who doubles as director of Republican outreach to Catholics. 
 By contrast, Mr. Neas, now president of People for the American Way, is presiding over a liberal coalition that has stayed largely intact over the last 10 years, still led by the same handful of veterans. 
 After learning of the O'Connor resignation Friday, Mr. Neas joined Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, and representatives from three dozen groups -- including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the American Association of University Women and the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights -- at a Capitol news conference to call for a ''consensus nominee.'' 
 Of the two generals, he is less likely to face dissension in his ranks. His coalition has worked with the Democratic leadership in the Senate all year on appellate court nominees, and Mr. Neas himself is so closely tied to the Democrats in Congress that Senator Edward M. Kennedy once called him ''the 101st senator.''
 The conservatives, by contrast, are looser-knit and have a more contentious relationship with Republicans in the Senate. Mr. Gray's task is to hold them together despite their divergent interests. 
 Progress for America, for instance, can be counted on to support President Bush's choice. ''Our focus as an organization all along has been to defend the president's nominee, no matter who that person is, from attacks from liberal interest groups,'' said Jessica Boulanger, a spokeswoman for the organization.
 But the Christian conservatives say they will back only a nominee with a clear record of subscribing to their views on abortion, gay marriage and the role of religion in public life. 
 Meanwhile, business groups, which have largely sat out the fights over the president's appeals court nominees, have pledged support for Mr. Gray but will make no commitment until Mr. Bush's choice for the Supreme Court is known. 
 As in their previous confirmation battles, both sides will rely on advertising blitzes, barrages of mail and phone calls and media campaigns to deliver their messages. But this time they will have to compete to shape public opinion in the faster, more intense world of gossipy Web sites, political blogs and 24-hour news shows. Mr. Gray will be a regular television presence, agreeing to appear exclusively on the Fox network during the confirmation process.
 He founded the Committee for Justice in 2002 at the request of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, then the Senate Republican leader, to work for the president's judicial nominees -- and to expressly counter the voice and influence of Mr. Neas.
 By Friday morning, Mr. Gray had convinced himself that any resignation would hold for the holiday weekend. When he got word of Justice O'Connor's plans, he left home in a flash and headed to his downtown office. Within minutes he was on the phone with allies -- among them Edwin Meese III, former White House counsel and attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and now at the Heritage Foundation; former Gov. John Engler of Michigan, now president of the National Association of Manufacturers; and Mr. Sekulow.
 He issued a statement imploring the left ''to take a breath and resist their natural impulse toward exaggeration.''
 A few blocks away on M Street downtown, Mr. Neas had been in his office since 6 a.m. He had joined People for the American Way, a group founded by the Hollywood producer Norman Lear as a political antidote to the conservative Christian movement, in 2000. During the Bork and Thomas battles, he headed the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. At 8:30 a.m., Mr. Neas called his wife, Katy, and promised that this weekend, unlike the past several when he had spent all day devising strategies to respond to various potential court nominations, they would take their 5-year-old daughter, Maria, to the zoo and to see the animated movie ''Madagascar.'' 
 Then the news broke. By 10 a.m., Mr. Neas had his armies in motion. E-mail messages were sent to the bulk of the group's 750,000 members and supporters, as well as 10,000 reporters. Volunteers streamed into what the organization calls its war room, a 2,500-square-foot space in downtown Washington with 40 computers and 75 phone lines .
 At seven regional offices across the country -- in California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas -- staff members were rounding up supporters to bombard the Senate and White House with e-mail messages and petitions once a nominee is announced.
 For Mr. Neas, the Supreme Court is the ultimate guardian of fundamental rights, from civil rights to reproductive rights. For Mr. Gray, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the Constitution's enduring meaning, with no business usurping decisions better left to voters. Beyond their judicial philosophies, the leaders of the two campaigns could hardly be more different in appearance, background and temperament. 
 Mr. Gray, 62, is 6-foot-6 and lanky with an angular face. An heir to the Reynolds tobacco fortune, he went to Harvard, clerked for Chief Justice Earl Warren and has more than a trace of his native North Carolina in his voice. 
 Divorced, he has a daughter, Eliza, who is now at Harvard, and he lives most of the year alone in his elegant, orchid-filled Georgetown house, a hub of the Washington social circuit, where he is host to near-weekly fund-raisers for everything from his judicial interests to a Washington voucher program. He has faced ethics queries in the past for skirting campaign finance laws in the 1990's by using his secretary to make campaign donations to Mr. Lott and, during the first Bush administration, for meeting with oil company representatives while serving on a regulatory task force.
 A partner at the traditionally Democratic law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr, Mr. Gray is said to be Mr. Bush's top pick for ambassador to the European Union. Business associates say he has been scaling back work with clients in his law practice, easing himself off the many boards on which he sits and making frequent trips to the State Department.
 Mr. Neas, 59, is 5-foot-9 and compact, constantly in motion. He grew up outside Boston, graduated from Notre Dame and the University of Chicago Law School and cut his political teeth in the civil rights movement. 
 He was 42 when he married and did not become a father until he was 54. His family now lives in a three-bedroom home in Bethesda, Md., that he says is ''almost large enough to take care of the three of us with room for a grandparent or two.''
 Paradoxically, both men switched parties well into adulthood. 
 Mr. Gray was a Democrat until 1978, when he became a Republican because, he says, he opposed the Carter administration's economic policies. Mr. Neas was a Republican and worked for Republican senators throughout the 1970's. He switched parties and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in 1998.
 The two have not always been antagonists. In 1989, when Mr. Gray was White House counsel, they worked together on the Americans With Disabilities Act. But on the heels of that, they squared off as rivals once more on civil rights legislation.
 ''He's a very astute politician,'' Mr. Gray said of Mr. Neas. ''He knows where all the pressure points are and he's a very serious adversary -- or ally if you're on his side, which I have been.''
 Mr. Neas was more critical of his longtime opponent.
 ''President Bush and Trent Lott chose Boyden Gray to be the quarterback of the radical right,'' he said. ''Boyden Gray has always been the consigliere for the Bush family and has always represented well corporate special interests, often at the expense of ordinary citizens across the country.''

HEADLINE: Views of Mayor Have Changed For the Better

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Fred Backus and Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's rising approval ratings reflect a significant political milestone: half of those New York City voters who now say they like him also say they disliked him for one reason or another after he was elected in 2001 but have changed their minds. 
 Although not all of them say they are certain to vote for Mr. Bloomberg in November for a second term, their shift helps explain how he was able to reach an important political threshold in the latest New York Times poll. Not only has the proportion of voters who say they have a favorable opinion of him doubled since 2001, but also, for the first time, more than 50 percent say they approve of how he handles his job as mayor. Nearly one in three say his performance as mayor was better than they expected.
Nilda Rivera, a 57-year-old Democrat and public housing manager from Staten Island, said she voted for Mr. Bloomberg in 2001 only because she disliked his Democratic opponent, Mark Green. ''When I voted for him the first time I said, who is this jerk?'' she recalled in an interview conducted after the poll was completed. ''But he seems to be straightforward -- not talking in riddles like other politicians. 
 ''Just the fact that he's a self-made man tells me that he knows what he's talking about when it comes to business. When he speaks, whether I agree with him or not, I understand what he's saying. He gives me a feeling of trust.''
 Charmaine Grant, 29, a Jamaican-born Democrat who lives in the Bronx and works for the State Education Department, said of Mr. Bloomberg: ''He doesn't owe anybody anything and he's really moved the city forward when it seemed hopeless. He's been able to do what he set out to do and when he failed at something, like the West Side stadium, he looked for the next alternative.'' 
 Last week's poll results and follow-up interviews with New Yorkers suggest that while many started with low expectations of Mr. Bloomberg, or voted for him but then had reservations, they have been won over by both his style and his record. 
 For the first time in his mayoralty, in response to a benchmark poll question, a majority of those surveyed said Mr. Bloomberg cared about the needs and problems of people like them. 
 That New Yorkers credit the mayor with improving the schools may bode well for his re-election, since more New Yorkers want the next mayor to concentrate on education than any other issue. While fewer than one in four say they are satisfied with the quality of the city's public schools, nearly 40 percent say they are satisfied with the schools in their neighborhoods. New Yorkers also seem to accept the mayor's argument that a vast bureaucracy cannot be fixed overnight. 
 ''He's trying to do things for the children in this city as far as education is concerned,'' said Theresa Perkins, 48, a special education teacher from the Bronx who is not affiliated with either major party. ''Over all, I feel he's done the best he can, and he can do more, but that takes time.''
 But four months is a lifetime in politics, and voters could change their minds again by November in response to events, expected or not. Moreover, their favorable opinions might not necessarily translate into votes once the Democrats present a more visible alternative in the September primary and begin focusing more aggressively on Mr. Bloomberg. So far, by spending heavily on television advertising, Mr. Bloomberg has largely defined himself. 
 Among voters who say they view him favorably now, nearly one in four said the mayor's campaign commercials made them think better of him.
 Why are more voters gravitating to Mr. Bloomberg? 
 Compared with all voters, the flippers tended to give the mayor more credit for improving test scores in the public schools, for overall quality of life and for visiting their neighborhood. They seem more optimistic about the city's future and especially pleased with the city's economy and quality of life. They are less concerned than other voters about the availability of affordable housing, higher taxes and whether the mayor has devoted too much time and attention to Manhattan in general and the proposed West Side stadium for the Jets in particular. 
 The poll revealed a wide gender gap in Mr. Bloomberg's support. He was viewed favorably by 54 percent of men but only 44 percent of women, although women were just as likely as men to change their minds and say they now like him. 
 More than half of the flippers were Democrats; more than one-fourth said they were independents. They were disproportionately liberal (over all, more liberals view the mayor favorably than conservatives do), better educated, in their 30's to mid-40's or older than 64, earning under $15,000 or over $75,000 and living in Manhattan (where, with all the controversy over the Jets stadium, over all the mayor enjoyed the highest favorable and lowest unfavorable ratings of any borough). 
 About one in four whites, nearly as many blacks and one in five Hispanics said they had reversed themselves and now viewed the mayor favorably. 
 The Times's telephone survey of 665 registered voters citywide was conducted from June 21 through 26. It found that over all, 48 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the mayor, 33 percent unfavorable and 17 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
 Among those who say they changed their minds about Mr. Bloomberg and now view him favorably, the reasons they cite most often for their shift are his record on education, his position on the stadiums, and the general goodwill he attracts.
 About 28 percent of those who said they had an unfavorable opinion of the mayor said they once viewed him favorably. Their change of heart was most likely to be motivated by apparent dissatisfaction with the schools, unemployment, taxes and the stadium controversy. 
 So far, the poll found, criticism by Democrats that Mr. Bloomberg has failed to wring more from fellow Republicans in Washington and Albany has not stuck. More than half of all voters said he had done a good job in getting help from the federal government, and more than 4 in 10 said the same about his record in Albany. 
 In interviews, a number of New Yorkers said that at the start of Mr. Bloomberg's term they were uncertain whether he could be as tough as his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, but that they were pleased because, they said, he proved to be as resolute, though not as shrill.
 ''The changing of the guard -- that's the thing that worried me,'' said Rosemarie Martini, 62, a nurse and Democrat from Borough Park, Brooklyn. ''Would Mike be able to run things as well? Would he be able to take command? Would he be able to be a good leader? But he proved that he could.'' 
 Some New Yorkers said they had reservations that a billionaire businessman might run roughshod over his constituents, but that generally -- with the exception of the Jets stadium -- their fears had been assuaged.
 ''Sometimes you take the path that's less popular, but if you find that you've made the wrong decision and if you have a surplus in the end it's better than acting in a careless way and ending up short,'' said Jessica Kesselman, a 35-year-old former schoolteacher and a Democrat who lives in Morningside Heights. ''It's that kind of business philosophy and business mind-set that I think has been helpful to New York.'' On his support of the West Side stadium, though, she said: ''What I saw was more of the corporate business leader who wasn't getting his way. But as of now there's no West Side stadium, so I'm O.K.'' 
 Other Democrats expressed reservations about voting for a Republican, but said no Democrat had emerged so far whom they favor. 
 ''There really isn't a strong candidate running against him,'' said Eddie Rios, a 38-year-old Republican from Staten Island who works for a bank. ''There are certain things that I wish he had a different opinion on, but I see myself voting for him; I don't foresee Fernando Ferrer being any better.'' 
 Responding to several questions about city services, even as more New Yorkers said services had improved, they were outnumbered by those who said things stayed about the same. 
 ''The city didn't get any worse,'' said James Upton, 65, a retired security officer who is a Democrat and lives in the East 20's. ''Things in my neighborhood have gotten better.'' 
 Lisa Ellis, 39, a City University librarian from Sunnyside, Queens, and a Democrat, said she voted for Mr. Green, the Democrat, in 2001. ''I didn't know much about Bloomberg and I was going with the guy with the public record,'' she said. ''This time I'm thinking of voting for Bloomberg more and more. I don't see a reason to change course.''

HEADLINE: LOOKING AHEAD

 BODY:

OLYMPIC HOPEFULS -- In Singapore, the International Olympic Committee is schedule to announce the host city for the 2012 Summer Games. New York City still holds out hope for being selected and for receiving all the economic benefits that would accrue. But handicappers are saying that Paris and London may have better odds of winning the competition for the games. (Wednesday)

FLYING TOGETHER? -- The United States Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., will examine the proposed merger between US Airways and America West that would create the nation's fifth-largest airline. The deal has already been cleared by the Justice Department. (Thursday)

U.S. v. SCRUSHY 2 -- A hearing may determine whether Richard M. Scrushy, the former HealthSouth chief executive who is fresh off his acquittal last week by a federal jury in Birmingham, Ala., must still face charges in that city by the Securities and Exchange Commission. District Judge Inge P. Johnson has scheduled a hearing in which, he wrote last week, the parties must show ''why this case should not be dismissed.'' (Thursday)

SWEAT SELLS -- When the June sales figures for retail chains are announced, analysts expect to see some good numbers -- mainly because the weather finally turned hot. After an unseasonably cool spring and an earlier-than-normal Easter holiday, ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it's suddenly easier to sell tank tops, swimsuits and air-conditioners,'' said Adrianne Shapira, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs. (Thursday)

ON THE JOB -- After a series of zigzags in the first five months of the year, most economic forecasters are confidently predicting the labor market will record an upward zag for June, adding around 180,000 jobs -- more than twice the number gained in May. It seems an easy call, in view of other economic gauges signaling vigorous economic growth. But the monthly employment report has consistently tripped up the experts. A safe bet is that the forecasters will be wrong. (Friday)

ECONOMIC INDICATORS -- Factory orders for May (Tuesday); June sales of leading retailers and weekly jobless claims (Thursday); wholesale inventories and consumer credit for May (Friday).

HEADLINE: Use This Phone to Find a Date. Or See Videos. Or Even Talk.

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
Amp'd Mobile is a new kind of cellular service, but the company's founder scarcely thinks of himself as being in the phone business. What he's out to sell is wireless entertainment.
 When Amp'd begins service, its handsets will practically overflow with content and features more commonly associated with television and the Internet, said Peter Adderton, the 38-year-old founder and chief executive of the company. 
 The offerings planned at the outset late this year include full-motion video of news, sports, concerts and other live events, as well as movie and television clips and music videos. Added to the mix will be high-speed music downloads, 3-D games, video blogs, a dating service, text messaging and an assortment of ring tones and wallpaper. 
 And, of course, Amp'd phones will handle conventional calls, Mr. Adderton said.
 ''I think our launch is going to fuel the mobile media community in the United States,'' he said in an interview. ''We are thinking of it from a media perspective and an entertainment perspective rather than from a wireless perspective.''
 Early glimpses of the service's offerings and the phones' strikingly visual menu system suggest the sort of multimedia experience found on personal computers. Mr. Adderton said multimedia content from Amp'd will play on its phones -- which will be made by Kyocera and Motorola, and customized by Amp'd -- as well as on the PC's of subscribers.
 Mr. Adderton's move comes as cellphone use and design is being redefined. Thanks to advances and new economies in processor and memory chips, mobile phones increasingly serve as still and video cameras, personal organizers and Web browsers, not to mention video game devices and global positioning system navigation units.
 New high-speed wireless networks in many American markets -- often referred to as third generation, or 3G -- are also delivering programs and services that are increasingly making cellphones as compelling to watch as they have been for talking. 
 But how does a small company like Amp'd make such an offering against competition with major wireless carriers? For starters, by cooperating with one. 
 Amp'd refers to itself as an M.V.N.O., or mobile virtual network operator, meaning that it will use another company's network to operate. In this case, that network will be the Verizon Wireless EV-DO (Evolution-Data Optimized) service.
 Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless, confirmed that Amp'd was expected to become an M.V.N.O. ''running on our service.'' He declined to comment further on the relationship, but did say that Verizon has had its own high-speed multimedia service, VCast, since February, offering video, games and limited music on specially equipped phones for $15 a month.
 Amp'd executives paint their company's offerings in more ambitious brush strokes. Mr. Adderton said plans for his service included mobile broadcasting units that would upload video clips, some of them in real time, for subscribers to receive. There will be live text chats with athletes it sponsors in extreme sports like motocross.
 Amp'd has yet to announce subscription rates, but said its phones are expected to have an initial price of around $100, considerably less than typical 3G handsets. The phones will be sold through the company's Web site (www.ampdmobile.com) with customizable features that will be downloaded when the handset is turned on.
 Scott Anderson, a senior vice president at Amp'd, said much of the service's design and style was meant to appeal to teenagers and young adults. 
 The approach taken by Amp'd is not surprising, said Linda Barrabee, a senior wireless analyst for the Yankee Group, a technology research firm.
 ''It's clear why we are even seeing this kind of offering come to the market,'' she said. ''The market is fairly saturated and fairly mature.''
 Ms. Barrabee said that well over 80 percent of those aged 19 to 65 in the United States have a cellphone, and practically all of wireless revenues are earned from voice communications. ''There isn't a lot more the market can do to bring new customers to get a cellphone,'' she said.
 There are, however, opportunities for carriers to generate greater profits by offering more nonvoice services to drive up average daily data rates, such as video and music streaming and downloading, Ms. Barrabee said. 
 And for traditional carriers, Ms. Barrabee said, another source of revenue is to turn to outside companies to reach new customers without incurring any costs themselves. 
 Mr. Adderton, who started a prepaid, youth-oriented wireless service called Boost Mobile system in his native Australia, said Amp'd would offer its services in prepaid and standard billing versions.
 Mr. Adderton, who sold Boost Mobile to Nextel two years ago, is now lining up partners to provide content for the Amp'd service. 
 This week, THQ, a video game publisher, is expected to announce that it will provide 3-D games. And HurryDate, a popular online dating service, is creating a special cellphone component using Amp'd Mobile.
 HurryDate arranges events in which single men and women can have up to 20 four-minute encounters with people they know only by first name and an ID number. The ID number can then be entered on the service's Web site to see a fuller profile and follow up.
 Ken Deckinger, the chief executive of HurryDate, which is based in New York, said that with Amp'd, people would be able to check profiles over their cellphones as well as communicate by text messaging with prospective dates over a secure system. 
 ''I think it's going to create a new level of ease,'' he said. 
 Amp'd also plans to create a circle of cellphone-based video bloggers by encouraging subscribers to post short videos and text made with their phones or computers.
 The service is expected to appeal to users who have brief video clips that they want to share with others, said David Sypniewski, senior director for media development. ''It's taking the freedom of the Web world to the handset,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bedrock of Law On Workplace Should Remain As Justice Exits

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Few people would dispute the impact that Sandra Day O'Connor, in her 24 years on the Supreme Court, has had on advancing the rights of women and minorities to equal hiring and education opportunities and to a bias-free workplace.
 But now that Justice O'Connor is leaving the court, will the pendulum swing back to give employers the right to hire and fire as they please, or even encourage them to dismantle voluntary affirmative action programs? 
 Neither business leaders nor minority advocates expect that to happen. Minorities and women, they note, make up an increasingly large part of the potential work force -- and of the consumer base. 
 ''Sure, we worry that the balance will be tipped when it comes to court rulings affecting people of color, but we don't worry that industry will backtrack,'' said Harriet R. Michel, president of the Minority Supplier Development Council, which matches minority businesses with corporate customers. ''The realities of the American marketplace are such that, if companies don't embrace supplier diversity, they are acting to the detriment of their bottom line.'' 
 The same holds true for hiring policies, said Theodore M. Shaw, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. ''From a dollars-and-cents standpoint,'' he said, ''it is no longer economically realistic for companies to be lily-white and male.'' 
 In fact, many business leaders feel they have lost a friend in Justice O'Connor. 
 ''I'd love for her to be replaced with a clone,'' said Roderick M. Hills, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a co-chair of the judicial selection committee of the Committee for Economic Development, a nonpartisan group of business and academic leaders based in Washington. ''She had an understanding of acceptable business conduct that was tempered by a real respect for the law.''
 Justice O'Connor was the swing vote in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, a 1999 case that made a school responsible for preventing harassment of students by other students, a ruling with implications for workplace harassment. 
 She sided with the majority in 1983 when the court ruled that employers must give men and women equal retirement benefits, in a case called Norris v. Arizona Governing Committee. She again sided with the majority in 1986, on Meritor Bank v. Vinson, a case that made it illegal for companies to countenance sexual harassment in their workplaces. 
 After the announcement of Justice O'Connor's resignation on Friday, civil rights advocacy groups rushed to issue statements of concern and vowed to fight for a replacement equally friendly to their cause. 
 ''She's been the key vote in race cases for more than 20 years,'' said Mr. Shaw of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Jocelyn C. Frye, director of legal and public policy at the National Partnership for Women and Families, also feels the loss. ''She made it clear, in all her votes, that affirmative action is an appropriate and lawful remedy if it is done right, and that sexual harassment must be remedied in any context,'' she said. 
 Some legal experts say her track record was less clear. ''On civil rights issues, sometimes she got it really right, but sometimes she got it really wrong,'' said Abigail Thernstrom, vice chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, an independent federal agency, as well as a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a New York-based research group. 
 Ms. Thernstrom applauded Justice O'Connor's stance in Shaw vs. Reno, a 1993 decision that prohibited North Carolina from implementing a redistricting plan that would effectively have created two districts populated primarily by blacks. But she insists that Justice O'Connor was wrong in Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 case that affirmed the University of Michigan Law School's right to take race into consideration in accepting applicants. ''She neglected all of the opinions she had enunciated in cases like Shaw,'' Ms. Thernstrom said. 
 Justice O'Connor showed sensitivity to affirmative action in certain areas of employment and education, but she also balanced that with her suspicions about the use of race as a criteria for hiring and government contracting. In 1989, she authored a 5-4 opinion that struck down a program, used by Richmond, Va., to set aside a percentage of municipal contracts along racial lines. In the decision, she wrote that the government may use racial preferences in hiring or awarding contracts only if it is rectifying cases of proven past discrimination.
 She rarely showed an antipathy to business. Indeed, her majority decision in Grutter v. Bollinger was hailed by minority rights and business groups alike. 
 The minority groups saw it as guaranteeing better access to higher education; corporations, many of which registered as friends of the court, said it both assured a pipeline of qualified talent and safeguarded the legality of their own internal diversity programs. 
 Justice O'Connor's impact on the business world was by no means confined to areas of racial and gender equality. Nor were her opinions consistently pro- or anti-business. She was in the majority in 2003 when the court upheld the law restricting the flow of corporate ''soft money,'' or unregulated contributions, to political parties. Many executives at the time said they welcomed the decision because it relieved them of feeling obliged to make large contributions when asked to do so by candidates and party officials. 
 She won kudos from business groups when she wrote the majority opinion in Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association, a 1992 ruling which forbids states from enforcing stricter worker-safety standards than called for by the government, and in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Company, a 1991 ruling that said consumer addresses and phone numbers in telephone directories are not protected by copyright law, and thus can be used by direct marketers. 
 Some of her decisions pleased some business groups while alienating others. For example, 1997, in State Oil v. Kahn, Justice O'Connor wrote that there were circumstances under which price caps on products are not anticompetitive; it was a victory for manufacturers, but a defeat for retailers and wholesalers. She was, at times, a vocal dissenter when the court ruled against business interests. The court placed an upward limit on punitive damage awards only in 2003, in State Farm v. Campbell. Justice O'Connor had fought for such a limit for years. 
 ''Business has lost its absolute best friend and most passionate advocate on the issue of limiting punitive damages,'' said Carter G. Phillips, a managing partner of the law firm Sidley Austin Brown & Wood.
 Nor did Justice O'Connor march in lock step with civil rights advocates in areas of race and gender bias. In 1986, in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, she wrote the opinion that a school district must lay off teachers in order of seniority, even if that meant a disproportionate number of black teachers would lose their jobs. 
 ''Hers was often a difficult vote to get, and she wrote many anti-affirmative action opinions,'' Mr. Shaw said, citing the Richmond, Va., case as a particular irritant. ''But, in an increasingly conservative court, at least her vote was in play.''

HEADLINE: Melding Gravity And Guilt At Live 8

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: LONDON, July 3 

 BODY:
The symmetry was clear between the Group of 8 summit meeting, which begins in Scotland on Wednesday, and Saturday's Live 8 concerts, which were staged to pressure the G-8 leaders on policies affecting Africa. The concerts took place in the eight major industrial countries represented by the group (along with a concert belatedly added in South Africa). And like the G-8 meeting, they hinged on the privileged addressing the problems of the impoverished. 
 How immediately effective Live 8 was will be gauged after the summit. Skeptics could discount the concerts' gigantic audience, estimated to be in the billions live and electronically, as merely a reflection of the music's popularity. But viewers absorbed some persuasive messages, balancing grim statistics with promises of solutions. Those spots, as slickly produced as any political advertising, probably reached people who hadn't thought much about Africa since the Live Aid concert raised money for famine relief in 1985. 
''By the time this concert ends this evening, 30,000 Africans will have died,'' Brad Pitt announced here in London, then urged that ''we the fortunate'' stand for change. 
 Endorsing the program of the organization Make Poverty History, Sir Bob Geldof -- who organized Live Aid and the larger, technologically upgraded Live 8 -- and many of the performers called for canceling third-world debt, doubling aid and changing trade regulations to open markets for African goods. At the Philadelphia concerts, performers invoked a ''declaration of interdependence.''
 Live 8 was not about opening ears to African culture but about maximizing the audience. It's a shame that Africa's remarkable music was barely noticed during the Live 8 marathon. The Johannesburg concert -- with musicians from South Africa, Senegal and Mali -- was not cybercast by AOL; neither was a hastily organized concert of African music in Cornwall, far from London, although Angelina Jolie dropped by. Youssou N'Dour, the great Senegalese singer, sang with Dido in London and Cornwall, and led his own set at the concert at Versailles, near Paris. Yet even the background music in the video clips about Africa was largely Western. More Africans should have been heard, as well as pitied, during Live 8. 
 But in the global pop market, the biggest names are English-speaking pop stars whose privilege transcends language barriers. The Philadelphia concert had a strong American contingent, and a vital presence for the African-American rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop that is now fueling pop innovation; and the Canadian concert ended with Neil Young. But the others leaned toward musicians who live or record in Britain.
 The Cure headlined in Versailles, the Pet Shop Boys in Moscow, Bjork (who is Icelandic) in Tokyo, Roxy Music in Berlin. Flashy production, on nearly identical stage sets, sought to hold viewers long enough so they would watch video spots about Africa between songs. One spot showed emaciated Africans holding Western consumer goods as it compared the amount of proposed aid with the billions spent on cosmetics, fashion accessories, weapons and discarded computers and cellphones. Meanwhile, Live 8's corporate sponsors included Nokia and AOL (which has reruns of some concerts at www.aolmusic.com).
 Visions of the 1960's, and rock songs full of peace and love -- along with Bob Marley's 1970's reggae songs -- are always associated with pop benefits. Sir Paul McCartney started and ended the flagship London concert with Beatles songs: not ''All You Need Is Love,'' however, but ''Helter-Skelter.'' Yet there was little 60's-style protest beyond an occasional stretch of a rap: ''Greed is a weapon of mass destruction,'' Faithless rapped in Berlin. While the G-8's decisions are ultimately political, the Live 8 concerts strove to appear more technocratic than ideological. Sir Bob brought Bill Gates of Microsoft on stage in London, where Mr. Gates gave a C.E.O.-style pep talk: ''Success depends on knowing what works and bringing resources to the problem. We know what to do.''
 The 1960's didn't have the 21st-century gadgets that dominated Live 8. (Neither, for that matter, do the many Africans who live on less than $2 a day.) ''Text us, call us,'' Bono said to a worldwide audience from Hyde Park on Saturday afternoon as U2 opened the Live 8 concert here. ''These phones, they're dangerous little devices.'' 
 He was asking viewers to send their names -- a painless contribution -- for a list that grew past 25 million as the group of concerts was shown on television and the Internet. Of course, petition drives don't usually come with satellite-linked serenades from million-selling rockers.
 It was high-tech coalition building. At one point the rapper and actor Will Smith in Philadelphia played host as audience members at simultaneous concerts roared video-screen greetings to one another. Then he had the viewers snap their fingers at three-second intervals; in Africa, he said, an impoverished child dies every three seconds. 
 Against statistics like that, rock hits can sound lightweight and narcissistic -- overly concerned with the preening or the romantic mishaps of people making considerably more than $2 a day. It's a rare band -- U2, to be precise -- that can make big booming songs sound humble as well as rousing. A few performers, like Sting, also rewrote lines of familiar songs to address the G-8: ''We'll be watching you,'' he sang in ''Every Breath You Take.'' 
 Others hoped that their love songs would double as songs of empathy. And the rest kept it to themselves if they were worried about the context. Rappers boasted, rockers flailed at their guitars, country singers honky-tonked. Parochial, frivolous, raucous and more, the songs were hits nonetheless, and performing them drew attention. That is what stars are supposed to do, as well as providing fantasies of pleasure, success, rebellion or shared trauma. Whether it was Beyonce of Destiny's Child boasting ''I'm a survivor'' because an album sold millions of copies, or the Cure's Robert Smith moaning about angst, the stars provided enough media leverage to put Live 8 on all those television and computer screens. 
 There was narcissism, too, in those 25 million names. When transmitted online or by cellphone text, there was a chance that a sender's name would be projected on the video screens behind the stars during the Live 8 broadcast, where the names became one more graphic element. It was not only an endorsement of Make Poverty History, but a chance at 15 milliseconds of fame, one more privilege of the connected. 
 Perhaps narcissism is underrated. It can be a great motivator. It may have added some percentage of names to that online petition for African relief; it definitely helped put stars onstage for Live 8. And as the Live 8 concerts sought to instruct the G-8, those who have economic privilege should use it well.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Puts Bronx Senator in an Unfamiliar Place: Under a Spotlight

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 2 

 BODY:
Though he is the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the State Senate, it was not unusual that Senator Efrain Gonzalez Jr. of the Bronx missed the leadership's final news conferences of the legislative session last month. 
 In the 16 years that Mr. Gonzalez, a former city bus driver, has been walking the marble hallways of the Capitol, he has never been one to seek the spotlight. His Senate Web site lists no news releases. His aides say he is more comfortable flying below the radar, working person-to-person in informal settings. 
 Even the neighborhood organization he has long served as a benefactor and mentor is a decidedly low-key affair. Seldom has the organization, the West Bronx Neighborhood Association, been mentioned in news articles. Few in the borough know much about its work.
 For months, though, Senator Gonzalez and the organization have been the recipients of unwanted notoriety, as subjects of a joint city and federal investigation whose premise and possible consequences remain unclear.
 Last August, investigators from the United States attorney's office in Manhattan arrived with subpoenas for the neighborhood organization, which occupies an office next to the senator's on the first floor of a commercial building on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. 
 Since then the senator, who has shared staff members and $32,000 of his campaign money with the organization over the years, has also turned over records, according to his lawyer, Murray Richman.
 Over the past few months, city and federal investigators have questioned several people associated with the neighborhood association or the senator, but they will not disclose what has piqued their interest. Emily Gest, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Investigation, which is involved in the inquiry, said, ''We decline comment due to the ongoing investigation.'' 
 But Mr. Gonzalez's lawyer said the finances of the neighborhood organization appeared to be a focal point. ''They are just looking at the allocation of moneys,'' Mr. Richman said.
 Last month, as the senator went home for the summer to prepare for surgery to remove a tumor from his right kidney, allies and friends said the specter of the investigation still hung in the air.
 ''There are all these accusations flying around,'' said Michael Jones-Bey, an aide to Senator David A. Paterson, the Democratic minority leader. Mr. Jones-Bey said of Mr. Gonzalez, ''He said there is nothing there.'' 
 Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer skipped a fund-raiser for Mr. Gonzalez for which he had been listed as a host. An aide to Mr. Spitzer, Paul Larrabee, said that the attorney general had never agreed to serve in such a capacity. Mr. Larrabee attributed the mix-up to confusion that occurred in the planning of the event. 
 Allies and friends of Mr. Gonzalez, who describe the investigation as unfair, say the senator is bearing up well under the scrutiny. They describe him as a tough and savvy man, a former union official who has survived adversity in the past and is facing the investigation, like his illness, with perseverance.
 ''That cloud has been there,'' said Lynette Perez-Gonzalez, the senator's daughter. ''But he just goes about his business, his daily life, doing what he's always done.''
 Mr. Gonzalez, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is one of the city's longest-serving state legislators, having been first elected to the Senate in 1989. Though he is chairman of the Senate's Democratic conference, he has also exhibited a distinct tendency to reach out across the aisle. In the past, his diplomacy has extended beyond bipartisan detente and he is known for having endorsed Republicans like Alfonse M. D'Amato and Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 A native of Puerto Rico, Mr. Gonzalez entered politics after serving as a union representative for the Transport Workers Union and the Teamsters. Friends describe him as a jovial man with the core skills of a natural politician, a good memory, a way with people and a generous sense of humor. 
 At times, the senator will hand out cigars as he works a room. He has his own cigar company in the Dominican Republic, where his wife lives and where he is a housing adviser to the government.
 It is in the Bronx, though, that the senator has fashioned himself into a powerful presence through his close ties to the borough's Democratic leaders and through his efforts to lure corporate support for economic development and increased opportunities for Hispanics. He is the president of the National Hispanic Policy Institute, which he has described as an organization to advance the interests of Hispanic-Americans. It is located, like the West Bronx Neighborhood Association, just down the hall from the senator's office at 1780 Grand Concourse.
 The West Bronx organization, a nonprofit group founded in 1993, has been run for several years by people associated with the senator. The vice president of its board, Jose M. Nicot, is Mr. Gonzalez's former chief of staff. Lucia Sanchez, who was listed as its secretary in 2003, is a close friend of the senator's. She now works in his office as a legislative aide, and her salary is paid through the Senate leadership. 
 The West Bronx organization's small office is identified by two sheets of white paper with its name that have been taped to the front door. No one answered a knock last week, but Mr. Nicot later answered questions by phone and described Senator Gonzalez as the organization's ''rainmaker.'' 
 ''Efrain is the guy who has all of the relationships that make it rain,'' he said. ''He's the guy that brings the money in.'' 
 Mr. Nicot said that, structurally, the West Bronx group was set up like a trade association or a political action committee, not a charity. It does not receive public money, he said, but relies on corporate contributions.
 ''When business has called and said, 'We have issues,' he has been there and he has solved those problems,'' said Mr. Nicot. 
 In recent years, the West Bronx group has raised about $200,000 annually, according to its tax returns on file at the attorney general's office. Of the $222,336 it raised in 2002, the last year for which it had filed the forms, costs included: $23,593 for telephone; $20,544 for travel; $92,796 for conferences, conventions and meetings; and $20,500 for ''annual gala expenses.''
 Several people who said they knew Mr. Gonzalez well, however, said they were not familiar with the organization.
 ''It doesn't ring a bell,'' said Gwynn Smalls, the interim executive director of the Bronx Heights Neighborhood Community Corporation, a housing management and tenant advocacy group, who has known the senator for many years. 
 Mr. Nicot said publicity was not a measure of effectiveness, and he ticked off a list of efforts in which the association has been involved, including helping young women compete in beauty pageants, paying tuition for students at parochial schools and underwriting summer trips for neighborhood children.
 He said money had also gone to support Ramitas de Borinquen, whose members twirl batons in the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade, and to help ship donated city fire trucks, ambulances and buses to the Dominican Republic after Hurricane Georges in 1998.

HEADLINE: Clinging to Their Dream on Fields Near and Far

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: WILLISTON, N.D. 

 BODY:
Phil Sorenson didn't hear a knock at the door, but he knew his best friend had let himself in again because there was a commotion in the kitchen.
 Cody Wentz was standing at the refrigerator, chugging milk from a half-gallon carton. He wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and Sorenson could guess what would come next.
 ''You want to play some football?'' Sorenson said Wentz would always ask.
 Sorenson knew Wentz's dream was to leave Williston, a prairie town of 12,512 so isolated that it shares a telephone book with a city two hours away. Everyone around knew Wentz wanted to play professional football. Ever since they met on the high school freshman team, Sorenson had helped Wentz chase that goal. 
 So without hesitation, he trailed Wentz to a field where they played catch, a ritual they followed even in winter, when the temperatures could dip to 50 below. 
 Football was there for Sorenson and Wentz at 17, when they joined the National Guard to pay for college, and united them at 21, when they were shipped to Iraq, where the sport provided a connection to less complicated lives back home. 
 But halfway around the world, it was the war that would separate them.
 To sign up for the North Dakota National Guard, Phil Sorenson drove seven hours to the Military Entrance Processing Station in Fargo. He remembered thinking, ''Woo-hoo! College money!'' as he took the physical, signed the papers and repeated the oath. 
 His brother Jeff had enlisted after disappointing jobs at Wal-Mart and Subway, and Sorenson was drawn by the $5,000 enlistment bonus, the $150 monthly training pay and the tuition assistance. 
 In Williston, where the median household income is less than $30,000, the money mattered. 
 As soon as Wentz heard from Sorenson what the Guard paid, he signed up, too. With a commitment of one weekend a month and two weeks a year for six years, they were confident their lives would stay pretty much the same.
 Both high school juniors then, they still drove to the Dairy Queen parking lot at night and sat atop Sorenson's mother's 1985 Econoline van to holler at passers-by. Days revolved around football.
 Their senior year, in 2000, they started on the Williston High School football team, which went 2-7. Sorenson, at 6 feet and 160 pounds, was the quarterback and the all-conference safety. Wentz, a bear of a guy at 5-11 and 215, played defensive tackle. 
 ''They were always together,'' Fred Douglas, their former coach, said. ''No one could outwork Cody. Phil wasn't as hard-core, but he always got the job done.''
 They could not have been more different, said Jake Schmitz, a tight end who was a close friend. He said Wentz was opinionated, driven and uncomplicated. 
 ''But Phil was different,'' he said. ''He was more of a mystery.''
 To relax, Sorenson went on long runs, drove to an empty field to listen to the wind or cross-stitched football logos. Wentz was forever restless; he worked long shifts as a waiter and a cook to save money for football training and cars. 
 After high school, Wentz won a partial athletic scholarship to the University of Mary in Bismarck. As a freshman, he played linebacker in practice but never dressed for games. The next semester, he left because he did not want to pay for tuition if he was not going to play.
 Wentz developed an alternate plan, however far-fetched: train on his own and improve so that an N.C.A.A. Division I team would recruit him. Then, maybe, some pro football team would notice him.
 Wentz bulked up to 275 pounds. Leo Warmsbecker, his training partner, said Wentz could bench-press 375 pounds and squat 550.
 Meanwhile, Wentz studied nursing at Williston State, a two-year college. Sorenson took classes there, too, while working in the grain fields, still undecided about a career. 
 Once a month, they did their routine duty with the Guard.

Off to War
 When Phil Sorenson and Cody Wentz enlisted in 2000, the recruiter told them not to worry, Sorenson recalled, because the last time the Williston unit had been activated for federal duty was in 1961 for the Berlin crisis, and it did not leave the country. 
 But in December 2003, their unit, trained to build bridges and roads and to demolish structures, was mobilized to go to Iraq. 
 Sorenson thought it was his duty to serve. Wentz thought fighting a foreign war was not a guardsman's job. 
 Two nights after Christmas, as a frigid 30 mile-an-hour wind swept the falling snow sideways, 105 soldiers boarded buses headed to Fort Carson, Colo., to train with the 141st Engineer Combat Battalion. Fifty-five of them were from Williston's unit, the rest from a unit in Dickinson, three hours south. 
 Police officers and firefighters marched ahead of the buses as they drove out of Williston. People lined the street, honking car horns and cheering. Sorenson said Wentz, usually boisterous, was silent as they waved goodbye through the bus windows. 
 Sorenson remembered that he and Wentz tried not to cry. They climbed onto a pile of duffel bags and lay side by side for a trip that took nearly 25 hours on icy roads. The hum of the motor lulled them to sleep.
 After two months at Fort Carson, Phil Sorenson and Cody Wentz were driving in an unarmored five-ton gravel truck near Balad, 50 miles north of Baghdad, inside the unstable Sunni Triangle, 6,500 miles from home. 
 ''We better pray to God that we don't get hit in this thing because we'll all be dead,'' Sorenson recalled saying to Wentz, M-16 rifle in hand, as they stood surrounded by plywood boxes filled with sandbags in the back of the truck. Fully armored vehicles did not arrive for six months, Sorenson remembered.
 Sorenson said his unit was initially told it would conduct searches for insurgents. But for the next year, the 141st's mission was to travel 15 to 20 miles an hour in search of roadside bombs, a task for which Sorenson said they had trained for about one day.
 Infuriated by poor equipment and the lack of preparation, Wentz wrote a four-page letter to Lloyd Omdahl, a former lieutenant governor of North Dakota who writes a newspaper column. In crisp, neat handwriting, Wentz explained that he had been duped into believing his unit would not face overseas combat.
 ''We are doing a good job, but one of these times, 'good' will not be enough,'' he wrote.
 To allay their fears, he and Sorenson talked about Williston. Wentz said he wanted to buy his parents a new house so they could move out of their trailer. Sorenson missed the Chicken Supreme from the truck-stop restaurant Kalley's Kitchen. They promised each other that if neither married, they would buy a house together, sit on the lawn in undershirts and whistle at women.
 They talked about dying or, worse, being wounded.
 ''We always said, 'If I lose any one of my limbs, make sure you're behind me to shoot me in the head,''' Sorenson said. 
 He and Wentz turned to sports to feel tied to home, tossing a football in 130-degree heat and playing basketball on a makeshift court with some fellow soldiers from North Dakota and a National Guard unit from New York, the Second Battalion, 108th Infantry.
 Meanwhile, Wentz wrote to his parents, ''I don't want to look back on life and say I never did everything I could to make football become a dream come true.''
 He lifted weights, often past midnight when it was cooler, using wheels and parts from a Bradley fighting vehicle because there were no barbells.
 Sorenson's hobby was taking digital photographs and making videos, which he would send to friends and family. In one video that became a hit back home, he filmed Wentz eating a four-pound can of tuna sent by Sorenson's father because it had 300 grams of protein. 
 Sorenson had his camera along on an evening patrol last Nov. 4 as his armored Humvee inched its way down a paved four-lane highway between Balad and Ad Dujayl.
 Early in the mission, a roadside bomb exploded between vehicles in their convoy, putting Sorenson, the driver, and Wentz, his gunner, on edge. To take their minds off the danger, they debated the virtues of their favorite N.F.L. teams, the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions.
 Suddenly, another bomb exploded, sending shrapnel into their Humvee. It jumped the curb, hit a tree and caught fire. Wentz was thrown to the floor, unconscious. Sorenson leaped out and collapsed. His left foot and ankle were gone. He saw a hole in his left hand.
 As a medic placed a tourniquet on his leg and gave him morphine, Sorenson cursed, screamed and asked, ''Where's Cody at?''
 Wentz, who wasn't breathing but had a faint pulse, had been pulled out of the Humvee and was lying on the ground. Soon they were loaded onto a Black Hawk helicopter headed for a hospital. Wentz died onboard. 
 Back in Williston, his father, Kenny, was mowing the lawn around a sign that said, ''Cody 141st: Waiting for Your Safe Return.'' His mother, Joyce, was out playing bingo.
 A Black Hawk appeared in the sky, a signal that officers were arriving to notify a soldier's family of his death. 
 Joyce Wentz returned home and found them standing in her kitchen. 
 No one had the heart to tell Sorenson that Wentz had died until late the next day.

Survival and Guilt
 Half a year later, in May, Phil Sorenson pulled up to the Wentzes' new house in Williston and tried to stay composed as he took it all in.
 Parked in the driveway was Cody Wentz's souped-up purple 1973 Plymouth Duster. Hanging in one closet were his extra-large fatigues. Scattered in a bedroom were his Detroit Lions memorabilia, from banners to Beanie Babies.
 Inside a wooden box with an Army silver seal were Wentz's ashes. Sorenson looked away.
 Wentz's parents purchased the home in April with part of their son's $250,000 life insurance, which he had bought at the last minute. They received the standard death benefit, $12,000, from the government.
 As Sorenson toured the house, limping on his prosthetic leg, he clutched his wooden cane with his left hand, now held together by six metal rods.
 Joyce Wentz led him to a room in the finished basement.
 ''This bedroom is yours,'' she said. 
 On the way out, she whispered to visitors: ''We don't have Cody, so we have Phil. He's all we have left of our son.''
 Though the Wentzes say their pain has been unbearable, they insist that Sorenson feels worse because he was there when Cody died. They know he feels guilt about surviving, and they have gone out of their way to help him deal with that emotion.
 ''If you and Cody had switched places, Cody wouldn't have been able to handle it, so please don't feel bad,'' Kenny Wentz told him.
 The 141st sent 475 soldiers to Iraq. Twenty-six of them, including Sorenson, received Purple Hearts. Four died; Wentz was the only one from Williston. 
 The unit returned on Feb. 16, which would have been Wentz's 22nd birthday. Sorenson was promoted to sergeant that day. 
 The next time he saw his unit was in May for a parade in Williston to welcome the returning Guard soldiers. At a party later that day at the community center, those soldiers were introduced. Sorenson, wearing a T-shirt with Wentz's picture on it, rose slowly when his name was called. He turned toward the gathering of about 1,800, who cheered loudest for him.
 Flanking him, Kenny and Joyce Wentz sat frozen and stared at the floor. 
 ''How do you think I felt standing there in between my best friend's parents?'' Sorenson said later. ''I'm here and Cody is not, and there are his parents crying, and there is the whole crowd looking at me wondering why I'm still here.
 ''To tell you the truth, I think that is how I'm going to feel my whole life.'' 
 He dropped his forehead onto his cane and began to sob as the master of ceremonies said, ''Soldiers, make sure to wear your name tags, so all of these burka-free girls know who to kiss.''

Ground Zero
 Phil Sorenson said if he had not been injured, he would probably have gone back to school or applied for a full-time job with the Guard. He might have become a recruiter. 
 Although North Dakota's National Guard and Reserves have the country's second-highest number of deaths in Iraq per million population, enlistments are strong. In April, recruiters enlisted 52 soldiers, the highest monthly total in three years, according to the state's National Guard Bureau. 
 While Sorenson was in Iraq, his brother Jeff, 28, re-enlisted for six years to get the tax-free $15,000 bonus. His brothers Adam, 19, and Brent, 26, are also in the Guard. 
 But now Sorenson cannot imagine a military career.
 He has fallen in love. Seven months ago, he met Alaina Sacramo, a volunteer with an organization called Operation Second Chance. He was recuperating at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and she was visiting wounded soldiers as part of the group's mission to assist returning soldiers with their return to duty or with their transition home.
 They clicked when she told him that her best friend had been killed in a car accident. He is convinced that Wentz sent her from heaven.
 Sorenson said he was angry because he thought his friend had died for nothing. But Sacramo and others have helped him change his view.
 Parents and spouses of some of those who died in the World Trade Center attack thanked Sorenson when they visited Washington. And in mid-June, he and Sacramo visited ground zero, and Engine Company 9 and Ladder Company 6 in Chinatown. He said he wanted to talk to firefighters because he felt it would help him understand why he and Wentz had gone to Iraq. 
 ''Lots of us think you're real heroes, especially after what happened here in New York,'' the firefighter Nick Lucenti told him. ''Your sacrifices were not in vain.''
 Sorenson will leave the military at the end of July. Even though Sacramo lives near Washington, Sorenson said he would return to Williston for at least a year, to be with his parents but also to spend time with the Wentzes. He wants to take Kenny and Joyce Wentz hunting with the rifle some townspeople recently gave him as a welcome-home present.
 Or, he said, he may simply hang out at their house. He imagines drinking a few beers, playing pinochle and reminiscing about Cody before descending the stairs to his new room.

About The Series
 This article is one in an occasional series on the Iraq war's effect on athletes. A previous article focused on two women who had shared a dream of playing pro basketball and who sustained serious injuries in the war.

HEADLINE: Old Pledge by Rowland To Raze Mall Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: BRISTOL, Conn. 

 BODY:
Just how much is the handshake of a jailed former governor worth? And how binding is it on the lieutenant governor who took over for him last July, as she mulls running for a four-year term of her own?
 City officials here argue that the undoing of former Gov. John G. Rowland should have no bearing on the pledge he made last year to help improve downtown Bristol. They have big plans to raze a shabby old mall in the heart of downtown to make way for a new recreational complex, theater and shops. And they need the state's financial backing to help shoulder the estimated $61 million cost. 
 City leaders say that more than a year ago, Governor Rowland agreed to pour $45 million of state money into the deal, $9 million more than they had requested. Springing into action, the city hired consultants to draw plans, spent $5.3 million of city money to buy the 17-acre property and cinched local approvals.
 It also began evicting the mall's tenants, prompting a battle with holdouts like Ocean State Job Lot. The chance that its last-chance offerings -- ranging from $24.99 London Fog suitcases to $9.99 towel sets by Martha Stewart -- may no longer be available has its cult following up in arms.
 But Mr. Rowland's resignation last summer amid a corruption scandal that eventually landed him in federal prison has added uncertainty to a project that already had its critics. And it raises the specter of yet another city brushing aside the old in preparation for a future that may, or may not, arrive.
 ''It's not a done deal anymore,'' said Wallace Barnes, a prominent local businessman who supports revitalizing the heart of the city his family helped settle nearly 300 years ago. He said he had agreed to help raise private contributions to defray some costs but was holding off until the plan received a green light from Hartford.
 The biggest unknown is what it will take for Connecticut's new governor, M. Jodi Rell, to release the money. Mrs. Rell, Republican of Brookfield, was Mr. Rowland's three-time running mate. But as governor and head of the state's Bond Commission, she has proved more cautious than he was about using state bonds to stoke economic development projects that are speculative.
 The plan's supporters acknowledged that the project's first phase -- a multiuse field house, a 1,250-seat theater, a new home for the Boys and Girls Club and a parking garage -- would be lucky to break even. But they argue that the payoff would come later once private developers were persuaded to build adjoining shops, restaurants, offices and other additions to the city's tax base.
 The state, however, is now asking for more economic forecasts and impact studies. That go-slow approach may make it harder for Bristol, about 20 miles west of Hartford, to protect its promised financing when a half-dozen other cities, including Norwalk and Naugatuck, also want the state to freshen their downtowns. 
 Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the governor, said that once a ''detailed analysis is complete and is subjected to careful review, decisions can be made about how best to proceed.''
 Gerard J. Couture, mayor of Bristol, the state's ninth largest city with a population of 61,000, said tearing down the mall outside his office should remain a priority. ''It's not what I want my downtown to look like,'' said Mr. Couture, a 64-year-old Democrat, who on Monday sported a shirt that had ESPN, the city's largest taxpayer, stitched on the pocket.
 A former luncheonette owner and a former police officer, Mayor Couture said that Connecticut's biggest cities have received help and that now it was midsize cities' turn. ''New Haven, Hartford, Danbury, Bridgeport and Waterbury,'' he said. ''They all received their funding. But Bristol hasn't.''
 He said that whatever else Mr. Rowland had done that resulted in his pleading guilty to conspiracy last December, the three-time governor saw wisdom in revitalizing the state's cities, many of them traditional Democratic strongholds. ''Our request was for $12 million over three years, and he said $15 million, $15 million, $15 million were the numbers we should be looking at,'' Mayor Couture recalled.
 Just after Mr. Rowland announced his resignation last June, the mayor said Mrs. Rell had visited Bristol and had reassured local officials that ''if your plan is good, we'll be there.'' Her only caveat, he said, was that the plan had to be agreeable to the state's economic development team.
 David Raccio, a spokesman for the Economic Development Department, makes no apologies for the state's pace since then. ''I understand Bristol's perspective,'' he said. ''But at the agency here, we have a new commander in chief, if you will, and we have to do everything by the book.''
 Much of Bristol does not want to hear that. The mall's future is emerging as an issue in this year's mayoral race and there is talk of taking the matter to voters in a referendum. Local officials are under fire to explain why the project has stalled and why they spent $800,000 more of state money on consultants and architects to draft and revise the plan floated by Mr. Rowland so that it passes muster with the Rell administration.
 Two leading critics have been past mayors, one Democrat and one Republican. Both have questioned the city's decision to buy the mall for $5.3 million -- more than twice what the owner paid in 1998 -- without a full assessment of potential environmental problems. Mayor Couture said that appraisals had confirmed that the price was fair.
 Adding to the din has been Ocean State's determination to fight the city to save a store that attracts 500,000 visitors a year and grosses more than $4 million a year, company officials say. ''In 28 years of being in business, we have never been treated with such contempt and disrespect by a landlord,'' said an owner of Ocean State's parent company in Rhode Island, Marc Perlman.
 The one point of consensus around town is that the project's best asset is the support of Representative William A. Hamzy, the lone Republican in Hartford representing any part of Bristol. He was on the impeachment panel that held Governor Rowland's feet to the fire a year ago. More recently, Governor Rell asked him to head the state's Republican Party.
 Mayor Couture and Mr. Barnes, a Republican candidate for governor in 1970, said the assignment made Representative Hamzy a crucial person if Governor Rell ran for a four-year term in 2006, as many expect.
 Apprised of that, Mr. Hamzy said: ''I can talk till I'm blue in the face. But if the project isn't feasible, I'm just wasting my breath.''

HEADLINE: A Frantic Finale For Cities Vying For '12 Games

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Monday, July 4 

 BODY:
International Olympic Committee members warily stepped out of elevators, looking both ways for solicitous representatives from the cities bidding to be host for the 2012 Olympics who might be lurking in the lobby.
 Soldiers who look barely old enough to drive were pacing outside the doors, toting machine guns and appearing impervious to the sweltering heat. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, huddled with advisers in the lobby bar, chain smoking.
 The entire scene paused as a huge security detail ushered Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain through the doors and into the elevator, a burst of camera flashes lighting his way.
 The frantic world of Olympic bidding has descended on this city-state in Southeast Asia, and a vote by I.O.C. members Wednesday will decide what many consider the most hotly contested Olympics ever -- with New York, Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow vying to win the 2012 Games. 
 By all accounts, there are far more undecided I.O.C. members than usual this time around, making all the posturing and wooing necessary, and endlessly intriguing.
 As is their habit, I.O.C. members rarely tip their hands, addressing the race as evasively as possible. Most say the outcome will be extremely close, with voting going several rounds before a winner is determined. It has become an outsized civic beauty pageant.
 ''I've never seen a contest like it,'' said Kevan Gosper of Australia, an I.O.C. member since 1977. ''It has got to be the greatest peacetime competition between five of the greatest and most historic cities in history, not just in Olympic history.''
 The scene swirls around two adjacent hotel lobbies, at Raffles and Swissotel, with their various restaurants and bars, ringed by armed soldiers and metal detectors, and occasionally preoccupied with the arrival of a major dignitary. 
 Mr. Blair created the biggest stir Sunday, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York opting for an unpublicized arrival in his private jet. But by Wednesday, dignitaries like President Jacques Chirac of France, Queen Sofia of Spain, Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov of Russia and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, will have caused their own commotion, as will the sports superstars David Beckham and Muhammad Ali. The gathering has attracted about 1,500 members of the news media, outnumbering the 116 I.O.C. members by more than 10 to 1.
 Most of the work of courting votes, however, happens out of plain view, although I.O.C. members brave enough to venture through the lobby are met quickly by representatives from bid cities. In the evening, the mingling moves to the bars and restaurants nearby.
 But the task is more complicated than simply finding favor. The voting goes by rounds; if one city has not received a majority of votes after the first round, the city receiving the lowest number of votes is eliminated. The rounds continue until one city receives a majority. I.O.C. members from a country that has a city competing for the bid cannot vote until after their city is eliminated.
 ''I don't get lobbied much,'' said Craig Reedie, an I.O.C. member from Britain. ''It's my goal not to vote.''
 But voters have to think beyond their first choice, which may be knocked out quickly. NYC2012, New York's bid committee, has a delegation of more than 200 people here. The bid officials have worked to make New York the second choice of a lot of voters, even lobbying I.O.C. members they believed were favoring another city.
 Daniel L. Doctoroff, New York's bid founder and the deputy mayor for economic development, says New York can gain steam if it survives into the later rounds. Paris is expected to have the most first-round votes, but it may be less aggressive about picking up votes from members committed to another city.
 ''My gut view is that most people know what they're going to do in the first round,'' said Sebastian Coe, a two-time gold medalist in the 1,500 meters who is London's bid leader. ''But it's a bit like I knew how I was going to start most races for the first 30 or 40 yards, but then you weren't always able to factor everything in. Yes, I have a number of scenarios in my mind what could happen, but that will unravel anyway.''
 The run-up to this vote has helped shape its ambiguity. I.O.C. rules now forbid members to visit bid cities as a way to prevent the kind of vote-buying that resulted in the Salt Lake City scandal, in which some I.O.C. members received bribes and special favors for their votes on the 2002 Winter Games. Bid leaders are allowed to approach I.O.C. members only at I.O.C.-sanctioned events, so the lobbying has been contained to organized settings.
 ''I think that the rules have resulted in people being both more cautious and waiting until the latest moment,'' Mr. Gosper said.
 None of the cities' bid officials admit to taking anything for granted. Paris officials often say that they do not believe their city is the front-runner. Madrid's bid leader, Feliciano Mayoral, insists his city received the top marks from the evaluation commission, although most interpreted the review for Paris as the best. New York officials are still questioned about the possibility that New York's State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, would kill a second stadium plan, forcing them to rebut the idea that their Olympic stadium hangs in perpetual limbo.
 Mr. Coe trumpets London's momentum; that is not a hard claim to back up considering that the bid had little public support even within Britain until Mr. Coe took over a year ago and gave it an aggressive posture. The London bid will require a huge urban renewal project, even more ambitious than New York's now that the West Side makeover has been scrapped. They provide a stark contrast to Paris's modest building plans.
 Singapore has added its own particular flair to this process. On Saturday, with I.O.C. members beginning to arrive and bid cities jockeying for access, the country unfurled a fascinating distraction. What appeared to be a significant portion of the Singapore military paraded through the streets, with legions of soldiers, dozens of tanks driven by men in full camouflage, and trucks carrying missiles. The display ended with a flyover and a 21-gun salute.
 The event was one of seven practice sessions for a National Day parade in August. While the rehearsal was taking over Singapore's streets, New York's bid leaders were forced to walk through a maze of underground malls to reach their scheduled news conference. They emerged from the crowded string of stores joking about the prospect of Manhattan needing to stage seven practice runs for all of its parades. 
 NYC2012, however, has repeatedly rehearsed for its big moment Wednesday, when it makes a 45-minute presentation before the I.O.C. membership. The presentation is being choreographed down to the minute, although it is not being directed by the filmmaker Steven Spielberg, contrary to a rumor reported in a local newspaper. That rumor captivated even the French filmmaker Luc Besson, who is directing Paris's effort. Mr. Besson declared Spielberg his hero. ''To lose in front of him will be an honor,'' he said. ''To win in front of him will be a super honor.''
 There will be no Mr. Spielberg, but plenty of others will swoop through the hotels, where the entertainment on parade needs no Hollywood stagecraft.
 A prime minister's entrance here or there will do.

HEADLINE: Court's Term A Turn Back To the Center

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3 

 BODY:
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's unexpected retirement announcement last week shifted public attention toward her legacy and the Supreme Court's future and away from the term that just concluded. But the term -- apparently not the Rehnquist Court's last, after all -- contained its share of notable developments that, taken together, cast a shadow of ambiguity over Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's legacy. 
 The court's federalism revolution stalled, while the revival of property rights, which appeared to be taking off not long ago, crashed and burned on a riverbank in New London, Conn. 
 The court displayed a growing concern about the death penalty, with the majority suggesting that lower courts had taken the Supreme Court's impatience with prolonged appeals too far toward short-circuiting defendants' rights. The justices also gave broad interpretations to three federal antidiscrimination laws. 
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer displaced Justice O'Connor at the court's center of gravity, casting the fewest dissenting votes -- 10, to Justice O'Connor's 11 -- in the 74 cases that were decided with full opinions. 
 As the Rehnquist Court ended a 19th year and appeared poised, unexpectedly, to begin a 20th, it was almost as if a constitutional centripetal force had been at work in recent years, pulling the court back toward the middle in many areas of its docket, including federalism, affirmative action, religion and abortion. The result frustrated conservatives and raised the stakes for the appointment of Justice O'Connor's successor.
 The court's six discrimination cases from this past term provide an example. Three were brought under the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, and the others required an interpretation of three different federal statutes. 
 In all six cases, with Justice O'Connor in the majority in four, the court adopted a broader reading of the relevant provision, not necessarily handing victory to the particular individuals but keeping avenues of legal redress open for the future. 
 Beyond these case-specific trends, the voting patterns this term were unusual.
 In recent terms, the five most conservative members of the court, Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, displayed a striking degree of cohesion. They voted together, for example, in half of the 18 5-to-4 decisions in the 2003-2004 term. In the past five terms, their alliance in the most closely divided cases ranged from a low of just over one-third of the cases in one term to a high of 70 percent of them in another.
 But in the latest term, which began Oct. 4 and ended June 27, the five voted together in only 18 percent of the cases decided by five-member majorities, 4 out of 22. (Four of the 22 cases were decided by votes of 5 to 3, with the chief justice not participating.) 
 Although theories were available to explain votes that looked anomalous, some of the alignments turned heads. For example, Justices Scalia and Kennedy joined Justice Breyer and Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to reject the states' rights position in the California medical marijuana case. Justice Breyer provided the crucial fifth vote for Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion upholding the Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.
 In 48 split decisions this past term, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, President Bill Clinton's two Supreme Court appointments (and the only two current justices to have been appointed by a Democratic president), were on opposite sides in 11. Justices Scalia and Thomas, who are often mistakenly viewed as ideologically inseparable, were on opposite sides in 12.
 After their 11 years together, what has gotten into these nine justices?
 Nelson Lund of the George Mason University School of Law, who was a law clerk for Justice O'Connor during the court's 1987 term, said in an interview that there was a tendency to blame her for outcomes that have disappointed Professor Lund's fellow conservatives. ''But the easy explanations are not quite adequate,'' he said. 
 Pointing out that courts proceed incrementally, informed by precedent and by the facts of each case, Professor Lund continued: ''There is a deep current of common-law thinking that pervades our legal system. Our courts rarely make a lot of big lurches. Usually when they make a big step, it's because people didn't realize how big a step it was, and then they pull back.''
 Kathleen M. Sullivan, a liberal legal scholar and former dean of Stanford Law School, offered a similar observation. The court's recent behavior may be ''as much psychological as jurisprudential,'' she said in an interview. 
 Professor Sullivan said some of the term's more surprising outcomes may reflect the fact that the Supreme Court, its membership stable while the lower federal courts have had considerable turnover, is now by some measures to the left of some of the federal appeals courts. 
 She said some justices may have been alarmed to find that the appeals courts were carrying their opinions further than intended or were applying them in unanticipated ways. This, in turn, may explain why in several decisions this year, including rulings for defendants in death penalty cases, the Supreme Court did not articulate new legal principles so much as correct what it saw as erroneous lower court opinions, a role it usually avoids. ''The middle justices have seen themselves as guardians of the court's integrity even at the price of inconsistency,'' Professor Sullivan said.
 The term was something of a triumph for Justice Stevens, the longest-serving associate justice and a vigorous 85-year-old who has no plans to retire; in fact, this week he is interviewing applicants for clerkships for the court's term that begins in October 2006.
 Of his several major opinions, by far the sweetest for him must have been his majority opinion in Gonzales v. Raich, declaring that federal authority trumped California's medical marijuana initiative. Justice Stevens, a Republican named to the court by President Gerald Ford and now arguably the most liberal justice, has been adamant in resisting the states' rights tilt of the court in a series of federalism cases. He also wrote for the majority in the eminent domain case, Kelo v. City of New London, and in an important age discrimination case, Smith v. City of Jackson.
 Justice Stevens filed one particularly notable dissenting opinion during the term, in a case that prohibited states from discriminating against out-of-state wineries. In Justice Stevens' view, the intent of the 21st Amendment, adopted in 1933, was to give states free rein in regulating alcohol use and commerce within their borders. To support his argument, he drew on a resource no other justice had available: a memory of the repeal of Prohibition. ''My understanding (and recollection) of the historical context reinforces my conviction'' about the meaning of the amendment, he said.
 Course corrections were made by justices across the ideological spectrum, even in areas of the docket not usually seen as lightning rods. For example, the court upheld the federal beef marketing program that finances the ''Beef, it's what's for dinner'' advertising campaign through assessments on cattle producers, even on those who object to paying. 
 A Supreme Court decision fours years earlier had found that a similar program amounted to compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment. The decision used language that, if taken to a logical conclusion, suggested a new constitutional basis for attacking a range of government programs, even taxation. 
 So in an opinion by Justice Scalia, who had joined the earlier decision, the court tacked back, shutting the door on that First Amendment theory before it could gain momentum. Chief Justice Rehnquist also changed sides.
 In the constant dynamic of stability and change inside the court, justices find different comfort levels. With Justice O'Connor's departure, change will now come, for the first time in 11 years, from outside the court as well.

Criminal Law and Sentencing
 The court's continuing re-examination of the respective roles of judges and juries in criminal sentencing produced a transformation in federal guidelines. 
 The decision in United States v. Booker, No. 04-104, was really two separate 5-to-4 opinions supported by two different coalitions of justices. First, Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Ginsburg held that the federal sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional because they gave judges power that, under the Sixth Amendment's right to a trial by jury, belonged to the jurors -- namely, the power to make the factual findings that determine the sentence.
 A second coalition, composed of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Breyer, Kennedy, O'Connor and Ginsburg, then ruled that the problem could be fixed by making the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory, restoring to federal judges some of the discretion that Congress had taken away 21 years earlier.
 In another case, the court ruled 5 to 4 that the Constitution categorically bars capital punishment for crimes committed before the age of 18. Justice Kennedy's opinion in the case, Roper v. Simmons, No. 03-633, overturned a 1989 precedent that had set the age at 16. The Roper decision also concluded that the American public, as well as the world, had turned against the death penalty for juveniles. Justices Scalia, Thomas and O'Connor dissented, along with Chief Justice Rehnquist.
 For only the third time in 20 years, the court overturned a death sentence on the ground that the defendant had received a constitutionally inadequate defense. Justice Souter's 5-to-4 opinion in Rompilla v. Beard, No. 04-5462, was joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer and O'Connor.
 In Deck v. Missouri, No. 04-5293, the court ruled 7 to 2 that it is unconstitutional to use shackles to restrain a prisoner during a death penalty sentencing hearing unless there is a particular reason for doing so. Justice Breyer said for the majority that shackling was inherently prejudicial and required ''adequate justification.'' Justices Thomas and Scalia dissented.
 The court also ruled that in making a routine traffic stop, the police can allow a trained dog to sniff the car for drugs without the need for any particular suspicion of a narcotics violation. Justices Souter and Ginsburg dissented in the case, Illinois v. Caballes, No. 03-923, and the chief justice did not vote.
 In Castle Rock v. Gonzales, No. 04-278, the court held that the police do not have a constitutional duty to enforce a court-issued domestic order of protection. The 7-to-2 decision overturned an appeals court ruling that allowed a woman to sue a Colorado police department for failing to take action after her estranged husband violated a restraining order by kidnapping their three daughters, whom he then murdered. 
 The mandatory arrest language on the order could not displace the police department's ordinary exercise of discretion, the court held in an opinion by Justice Scalia, over the dissenting votes of Justices Stevens and Ginsburg.

Property Rights
 In what was perhaps the term's most disputed decision, the court ruled that fostering economic development is an appropriate use of the government's power of eminent domain. The 5-to-4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108, upheld a plan in the economically depressed Connecticut city to replace an old residential neighborhood with office space and a conference hotel. The majority opinion by Justice Stevens was joined by Justices Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
 The court also unanimously upheld Hawaii's rent-control law for gasoline stations, rejecting the oil companies' argument that limiting their rate of return amounted to an unconstitutional ''taking'' of private property. The case was Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., No. 04-163.

Religion
 Two decisions on government display of the Ten Commandments looked in opposite directions, with only Justice Breyer joining the majority in each of the 5-to-4 rulings.
 In Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03-1500, the court found that the display of a six-foot-high Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol did not amount to an unconstitutional ''establishment'' of religion. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion, joined by Justices Breyer, Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas.
 In McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 03-1693, the court held that the framed display of the Ten Commandments on the walls of two Kentucky county courthouses, although surrounded by other texts of historical interest and secular content, was unconstitutional. Justices Souter, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Stevens, along with Justice Breyer, voted in the majority. 
 Also, the court ruled unanimously that a new federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, does not violate the separation of church and state in requiring prison officials to meet inmates' religious needs. Justice Ginsburg's opinion in Cutter v. Wilkinson, No. 03-9877, warned, however, that prison security remained a ''compelling state interest'' and that demonstrated problems in accommodating inmates' requests would be resolved in favor of prison officials.

Discrimination
 The federal law that bars sex discrimination in schools and colleges also prohibits school officials from retaliating against those who bring complaints of such discrimination, the court ruled in Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, No. 02-1672. The 5-to-4 decision expanded the scope of the law known as Title IX to include protection for whistle-blowers. Justice O'Connor's majority opinion was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
 Also, employees who sue for age discrimination do not have to prove that the discrimination was intentional, the court ruled. The 5-to-3 decision in Smith v. City of Jackson, No. 03-1160, applied to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the ''disparate impact'' theory of liability long familiar under the laws against race and sex discrimination. Employees need not produce a smoking gun, but can win by showing that a policy has the effect of discriminating against older workers, regardless of an employer's motivation. The dissenters were Justices Thomas, Kennedy, and O'Connor. Chief Justice Rehnquist did not participate.
 In Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., No. 03-1388, the court ruled 6 to 3 that the Americans With Disabilities Act protects the rights of passengers who sail on cruise ships that call at American ports, even ships that fly under foreign flags, as most do. However, ships will not be required to make major structural alterations. The dissenters were Justices Scalia and O'Connor and Chief Justice Rehnquist.
 The court also overturned a 20-year-old murder conviction in Texas on the ground that the jury selection had been infected by racial discrimination. The 6-to-3 decision in Miller-El v. Dretke, No. 03-9659, was the court's second ruling on behalf of the death row inmate, Thomas Miller-El. The dissenters were Justices Thomas and Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist.
 In another case, the court ruled that a California prison policy that temporarily segregates new or newly transferred inmates by race, for the stated purpose of preventing gang violence, was constitutionally suspect and not entitled to the judicial deference that is usually accorded to prison administration policies. The vote in Johnson v. California, No. 03-636, was 5 to 3, with Chief Justice Rehnquist not participating. Justice Stevens said in his dissent that the policy was flatly unconstitutional. Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissenting on different grounds, said the court should have deferred to prison officials.

Federalism
 Reasserting federal authority, the court upheld the power of Congress to prohibit and prosecute the possession and use of marijuana, even in California and the 10 other states that allowed it for medical purposes. A federal appeals court had ruled that the noncommercial cultivation and use of marijuana that did not cross state lines fell outside Congress's constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. 
 The vote in Gonzales v. Raich, No. 03-1454, was 6 to 3. The surprise was not that Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Souter, and Breyer voted with the majority, but that Justices Kennedy and Scalia defected from their usual states' rights allies to vote to uphold federal power.
 Rejecting state protectionism in the national wine market, the court overturned liquor laws in New York and Michigan and ruled that states that allow in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers must give the same privilege to out-of-state wineries. The vote in Granholm v. Heald, No. 03-1116, was 5 to 4, with Justices Kennedy, Scalia, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer in the majority.
 The court rejected a claim of federal pre-emption and allowed suits to go forward in state court claiming negligence in the design and manufacture of pesticides and herbicides. These products are regulated under a federal law, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and the Bush administration had argued that this statute, which does not allow private lawsuits in federal court, also implicitly blocked the states from opening their courts to such suits. The vote in Bates v. Dow AgroSciences L.L.C., No. 03-388, was 7 to 2, with Justices Thomas and Scalia dissenting.

Immigration
 The court ruled unanimously that driving under the influence of alcohol, even when serious injury results, is not a ''crime of violence'' for which an immigrant should face automatic deportation. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion in Leocal v. Ashcroft, No. 03-583, which rejected the Bush administration's interpretation of federal immigration law.
 Meanwhile, Cubans who entered the United States during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and subsequently committed crimes cannot be subjected to open-ended detention, the court ruled in a 7-to-2 decision. Although these Cubans, as many as 1,000 of the 125,000 who arrived in the boatlift, are now deportable, Cuba will not take them back. They may not be held for more than six months without a special reason, Justice Scalia said for the court in Clark v. Martinez, No. 03-878. Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.
 Immigrants from Somalia may be deported despite the lack of a centrally functioning government in Somalia to receive them, the court ruled 5 to 4 in Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, No. 03-674. The dissenters were Justices Souter, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.

Business
 The court unanimously overturned the criminal conviction of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen for shredding documents related to its work for Enron as that company was collapsing in 2001. Chief Justice Rehnquist said for the majority in Arthur Andersen v. United States, No. 04-368, that the judge's instructions to the jury failed to require the necessary proof that the firm knew its actions were wrong. The victory came too late for Andersen, which lost its clients and its licenses and now has 200 employees, down from 28,000, wrapping up the firm's affairs.
 In another unanimous opinion, the court reinstated a copyright-infringement suit by Hollywood studios and the music industry against two file-sharing services whose software enables users to download copyrighted movies and songs.
 Overturning an appeals court ruling in favor of the services, Grokster and StreamCast Networks, the court held that a company shown to induce copyright infringement can be liable even if its products also have lawful uses. While sending the case, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios v. Grokster Ltd., No. 04-480, back to the lower courts, the justices made it clear that they believed the plaintiffs had presented ample evidence of inducement. 
 Upholding an interpretation by the Federal Communications Commission, the court ruled that cable companies do not have to allow rivals to offer high-speed Internet access over their systems. The 6-to-3 decision in National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services, No. 04-277, was a victory for cable in the competition to provide broadband service. Justices Scalia, Souter and Ginsburg dissented.
 In another case, the court ruled unanimously that federal bankruptcy law shields individual retirement accounts from creditors. The decision in Rousey v. Jacoway, No. 03-1407, extended the protection already provided to 401(k) accounts and company pension plans.
 The court also raised the bar for investors bringing securities fraud cases. The mere accusation that a company's misrepresentations inflated the stock price is an insufficient basis for a suit, the court ruled unanimously in Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Broudo, No. 03-932. Instead, investors must claim at the outset that it was the artificially high stock price that actually caused their losses.

HEADLINE: Seeking First to Reinvent the Sports Arena, and Then Brooklyn

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Frank Gehry's new design for a 21-acre corridor of high-rise towers anchored by the 19,000-seat Nets arena in Brooklyn may be the most important urban development plan proposed in New York City in decades. If it is approved, it will radically alter the Brooklyn skyline, reaffirming the borough's emergence as a legitimate cultural rival to Manhattan.
More significant, however, Mr. Gehry's towering composition of clashing, undulating forms is an intriguing attempt to overturn a half-century's worth of failed urban planning ideas. What is unfolding is an urban model of remarkable richness and texture, one that could begin to inject energy into the bloodless formulas that are slowly draining our cities of their vitality. It is a stark contrast to the proposed development of the West Side of Manhattan, where the abandoned Jets stadium was only the most visible aspect of what seemed doomed to become another urban wasteland.
 From the dehumanizing Modernist superblocks of the 1960's to the cloying artificiality of postmodern visions like Battery Park City, architects have labored to come up with a formula for large-scale housing development that is not cold, sterile and lifeless. Mostly, they have failed. 
 Mr. Gehry, for his part, has never worked on such a colossal scale. And the construction of an arena, in particular, is more apt to create a black hole in a city's fabric than to ignite a major urban revival.
 Mr. Gehry begins by reinventing the arena. To minimize the deadening effect of the obligatory rings of corporate seats, Mr. Gehry partly hides them under a cantilevered portion of the arena's upper tier. And a slight arch in the rows of seats on either side of the court adds to the impression that the entire room is being squeezed and is buckling under invisible pressure.
 Such touches reaffirm that Mr. Gehry, at 76, is an architect with a remarkably subtle hand. Yet what makes the design an original achievement is the cleverness with which he anchors the arena in the surrounding neighborhood. Located on a triangular lot at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, the arena's form is buried inside a cluster of soaring commercial and residential towers. At certain points the towers part to reveal the arena's bulging facade behind them. Pedestrians would be able to peer directly into the main concourse level, creating a surprising fishbowl effect.
 The tallest of the towers, roughly 60 stories, would echo the more somber Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, now the borough's highest building. A cascading glass roof would envelop a vast public room at the tower's base, so that as you arrived by car along Flatbush Avenue, your eye would travel up a delirious pileup of forms, which become a visual counterpoint to the horizontal thrust of the avenue.
 The striking collision of urban forms is a well-worn Gehry theme, and it ripples through the entire complex. Extending east from the arena, the bulk of the residential buildings are organized in two uneven rows that frame a long internal courtyard. The buildings are broken down into smaller components, like building blocks stacked on top of one another. The blocks are then carefully arranged in response to various site conditions, pulling apart in places to frame passageways through the site; elsewhere, they are used to frame a series of more private gardens.
 Mr. Gehry is still fiddling with these forms. His earliest sketches have a palpable tension, as if he were ripping open the city to release its hidden energy. The towers in a more recent model seem clunkier and more brooding. This past weekend, a group of three undulating glass towers suddenly appeared. Anchored by lower brick buildings on both sides, they resemble great big billowing clouds.
 Anyone who has followed Mr. Gehry's thought process understands this back-and-forth. It is his struggle to gain an intuitive feel for the site, to find the ideal compositional balance between the forms. The idea is to create a skyline that is fraught with visual tension, where the spaces between the towers are as charged as the forms themselves. That tension, Mr. Gehry hopes, will carry down to the ground, imbuing the gardens with a distinct urban character. In this way, he is also seeking to break down and reassemble conventional social orthodoxies.
 There are those -- especially acolytes of the urbanist Jane Jacobs -- who will complain about the development's humongous size. But cities attain their beauty from their mix of scales; one could see the development's thrusting forms as a representation of Brooklyn's cultural flowering.
 What is more, Mr. Gehry has gone to great lengths to fuse his design with its surroundings. The tallest of the towers, for example, are mostly set along Atlantic Avenue, where they face a mix of retail malls and low-income housing. Along Dean Street, the buildings' low, stocky forms are more in keeping with the rows of brownstones that extend south into Park Slope.
 A more important issue, by contrast, is the site's current lack of permeability. Because the development would be built on top of the Atlantic Avenue railyards, the gardens are several feet above ground level, an arrangement that threatens to isolate them from the street grid. In the current version of the plan, shallow steps would lead up to the gardens from the sidewalk. Olin Partnership, the landscape architect, has suggested that the same effect could be accomplished with a more gradual slope -- a significant improvement -- but the key will be to create a balance in which the gardens feel like a smooth extension of the public realm.
 Even so, Mr. Gehry's intuitive approach to planning -- his ability to pick up subtle cues from the existing context -- virtually guarantees that the development will be better than what New Yorkers are used to. The last project here that was touted as a breakthrough in urban planning was Battery Park City. As it turns out, it was as isolated from urban reality as its Modernist predecessors. Conceived by a cadre of government bureaucrats and planners, it produced a suburban vision of deadening uniformity.
 By comparison, Forest City Ratner Companies, a relatively conventional developer known for building Brooklyn's unremarkable MetroTech complex, has seemingly undergone an architectural conversion, entrusting a 7.8-million-square-foot project to a single architectural talent who is known for creating unorthodox designs. It seems like a gutsy decision. But Bruce C. Ratner, the company's chief executive and the development partner of The New York Times in building the newspaper's new headquarters in Manhattan, has apparently realized that the tired old models are no longer a guarantee of cultural or financial success. He seems willing, within limits, to allow Mr. Gehry the freedom to play with new ideas.
 This is no small miracle. Even in this early stage of development, the design proves that Mr. Gehry can handle the challenge better than most. His approach is a blow against the formulaic ways of thinking that are evidence of the city's sagging level of cultural ambition. It suggests another development model: locate real talent, encourage it to break the rules, get out of the way.

HEADLINE: After Several Years of Increases, Home Prices in Australia Level Off

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
For several years, dinner party chatter here did not linger on favorite Australian subjects like rugby, cricket, sailing and surfing or politics. No, all the talk was of real estate: how much a house was worth, how much more this year than last, and how much more valuable it would be next year.
 It was not just the rich who were getting super-rich, their multimillion-dollar homes with water views rising rapidly in value. Every homeowner was making money, at least on paper, and Australia is a country with one of the highest levels of home ownership in the world. A midlevel office worker, for example, who bought a house in a middle-class Sydney suburb for 188,000 Australian dollars in 1996 was offered 720,000 Australian dollars ($504,000) in 2003. Sound familiar? As in many regions of the United States these days, house prices here seemed to defy gravity. They just kept going up and up and up -- in Sydney, by 11 percent in 1997, according to the Real Estate Institute of Australia, followed by a leap of another 21 percent the next year. After more modest increases, prices rose by 16 percent in 2002, and another 23 percent in 2003. It was similar in other major cities.
''It overshot all models, all predictions,'' said Rod Cornish, head of property research at Macquaire Bank. 
 In the last two years, though, the Australian housing boom has come to a halt, in a move that many experts see as the first signs of the end to a housing bubble, not just in Australia, but also in the United States as well as several other rich countries around the world. 
 It is impossible to say for sure how the situation will work out here -- or in the United States, for that matter. But so far, despite predictions that housing prices in Australia would plummet by as much as 20 to 30 percent, there are no signs of a crash. Prices have leveled off noticeably or dropped slightly, at least in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. They continue to rise at a modest rate in Perth, Darwin and Brisbane, the major cities in resource-rich states, where the local economies are being buoyed by China's insatiable demands for raw materials.
 Nationwide, for the year ending March 31, the rise in house prices was 0.4 percent, the lowest since 1996, according to the Australia Bureau of Statistics.
 ''It's been an orderly correction,'' said Mark Steglick, managing director of Gowings Properties, a Sydney property development company, who said that there had been few foreclosures or forced sales since the boom ended. ''There's not blood on the streets.'' 
 Looking ahead, local housing experts expect prices to flatten out, perhaps remaining stagnant for a number of years to allow gradually rising incomes to catch up with the sharply higher level of home values. 
 But there are significant differences within the market that may provide some clues as to how housing booms elsewhere could run out of steam. 
 Prices for investor-owned apartments have fallen considerably more than for owner-occupied houses. Nationwide, prices are down about 10 percent from the peak.
 The most expensive homes, particularly those along the coast, have held up better than the rest of the market. ''My jaw drops at some sales,'' Mr. Steglick said, describing a house in Vaucluse, a posh Sydney suburb, that recently sold for $17 million Australian dollars ($12.7 million). The home does not even have direct access to the beach, though it does have spectacular views of the soaring Opera House and of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. It last sold in 2001 for 12.1 million Australian dollars.
 Australia is no stranger to booms and busts in housing prices. The latest boom began in the mid-1990's, following a bust brought about by the recession of 1990, one of the worst in Australia's history, and far more severe than the downturn in the United States at the time. Unemployment soared to more than 10 percent as interest rates reached as high as 17 percent.
 Those high rates knocked many potential buyers out of the market, but even more importantly they also saddled many existing homeowners with a greater debt than they had assumed when they took out their loan.
 House financing here differs significantly from the United States, where the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has been the norm and most adjustable rate mortgages delay rate increases for several years and then limit them to set annual amounts. In Australia, fixed rate mortgages are very rare. The standard mortgage is a variable, with the rate rising automatically whenever the central bank raises interest rates.
 So someone who borrowed at 12 percent in 1985 found that his monthly mortgage payments had gone up by nearly 50 percent five years later, when the rate was just over 17 percent.
 There was ''blood on the streets'' then, with thousands of foreclosures and forced sales.
 The market remained stagnant until around 1996 or 1997, when prices began to rise, first in Melbourne, then in Sydney. 
 As in the United States in the early 2000's, the primary driving force behind the housing boom in Australia was the decline in interest rates, which dropped to about 7 percent here by the end of 1997. Simultaneously, unemployment fell, continuing to shrink to as low as 5.5 percent today. 
 Another factor driving house prices, especially in Sydney, is the quality of life. In surveys of the most desirable cities in the world, Sydney is regularly in the top 10. Moreover, not many major cities offer such a wide variety of beachfront properties, many of them attracting wealthy people from around the world.
 The increase in home values, and the expanding economy, also sent Sidney residents in search of second homes. In the late 1990's, the housing boom hit Byron Bay, which juts into the ocean, about 500 miles north of Sydney.
 ''It just flew in here,'' Barbara Sexton, a real estate agent, said about the swift rise in interest in a beach community where the rich now mingle with writers, artists, backpackers and hippies, and dolphins frolic with surfers. ''I do believe this is the greatest boom we've had.'' 
 People would come to Byron Bay for two-week vacations, Ms. Sexton said, and spend the second week looking at property.
 The market has now softened, but limits on development in a town where the council is dominated by Greens, who are determined not to let the area go the way of the uncontrolled Gold Coast, an hour north, are likely to keep prices from falling significantly.
 A 700-square-meter piece of land on the beach recently sold for 1.8 million Australian dollars ($1.3 million), Ms. Sexton said. A modest three bedroom cottage on the water -- ''beach shack'' in the Australian vernacular -- recently sold for 4.1 million Australian dollars ($3 million), double what it sold for five years ago.
 With interest rates falling and as the value of homes soared, homeowners began borrowing against their equity, whether to renovate or buy the latest flat screen television. It was a lending practice introduced here by Citigroup, and now followed by nearly every bank. 
 The economy has continued to expand -- it is now in its 14th consecutive year of growth -- and with money and confidence, people not only bought their own homes, but properties for investment as well. In this, they have been actively encouraged by Australia's tax laws. 
 In contrast with the United States, interest payments on an Australian home mortgage are not tax deductible. But for those who invest in property and rent it out, the payment is deductible as an expense against rental income.
 If total expenses exceed income, the loss can be offset against ordinary income. In a country where the top marginal tax rate is 48.5 percent, that provides a strong incentive to search for ways to reduce taxable income.
 For example, an investor who has $30,000 a year in rental income, and $40,000 in expenses, including the mortgage, can take a deduction of $10,000. But when the property is sold, the gain, quite substantial in recent years, is taxed as a capital gain at a rate of no more than 24 percent.
 ''The market was awash with people turning over properties,'' said David Edwards, owner of the LJ Hooker real estate franchise in Palm Beach, an hour north of Sydney, where the rich and super-rich have holiday homes. A house, with a view over Whale Beach, sold for $1.7 million in March 2002, Mr. Edwards said. The owner put on a coat of paint, planted a few trees, and sold it four months later for $2.1 million. Nine months later, it sold for $2.5 million. 
 In 2003, the governors of the Reserve Bank of Australia began trying to talk the market down, with speeches about households having too much debt and about the housing bubble.
 The Reserve Bank, the equivalent of the Federal Reserve in the United States, also went to commercial banks to examine their loan portfolios, and did something called ''stress testing.'' Assume unemployment went to X percent, or the interest rates went to Y, regulators asked, could the bank handle it?
 The central bank found that banks were in pretty good shape, but the exercise made the banks more cautious about lending to property investors, said Mr. Cornish of Macquaire Bank.
 In late 2004, the central bank started raising interest rates, by a quarter point in November followed by another quarter point in December. There was another quarter point increase in March. 
 ''They hit the brakes, lightly,'' said Shane Oliver, head of investments strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors, who estimated that the value of his house on the water in Avalon, a small suburb north of Sydney, has gone to $3 million, from $700,000 in 1995. 
 But no one was sure of what was coming, and the fear was that rates would continue to go up. The psychological impact was just what the central bank wanted and was needed. 
 The median price for a three bedroom house in Sydney has gone up only 0.2 percent so far this year. It has dropped 5.2 percent in Melbourne, according to the Real Estate Institute. 
 The leveling out of housing prices is beginning to have a ripple effect on the rest of the economy. ''Housing equity withdrawal has now ceased,'' the governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, said in a speech in mid-June. That has contributed to a sharp slowdown in consumer spending. Some of the major retail stores, like David Jones and Coles Myer, seem to have been offering almost perpetual sales since November.
 Now the question on people's minds: is the decline over, or is the worst yet to come? 
 Mr. Oliver thinks Australian house prices are still at least 25 percent overvalued, as measured by their historical values, and as a ratio to wages. It now takes 500 weeks of average wages to buy the typical home in Australia, Mr. Oliver wrote recently in his newsletter, much more than the 350 weeks, on average, required in the United States.
 Still, he is not predicting a crash.
 ''It's easier to trigger a panic in the share market than in the housing market,'' Mr. Oliver said. ''People get attached to their homes.''
 While analysts express comfort with their predictions that the market will remain soft but not collapse, they are not cocky about it. A sharp increase in unemployment or interest rates could trigger an even sharper fall in real estate prices, they warn. 
 ''We're still vulnerable to shocks,'' Mr. Cornish said.

HEADLINE: Energy-Rich Nations Are Raising Price of Foreign Admittance

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia 

 BODY:
For centuries, this country made it easy for prospectors to mine -- from the Spaniards who plundered gold to the tin barons of the 19th century to the multinational energy companies that flocked here in the 1990's to develop Latin America's second-largest natural gas deposits.
 But like many energy-producing countries these days, Bolivia has pulled back the welcome mat. With an angry population demanding a larger share of the benefits, and some groups even calling for expropriation, the government recently raised royalties and taxes to among the highest levels in Latin America.
 It might appear to be an exceptional episode of revolutionary zeal translated into energy policy. But Bolivia is just the latest of several oil-and-gas-producing countries in Latin America and beyond that are squeezing energy companies as never before. 
 With prices of crude oil and natural gas at record highs, and ideology increasingly propelling government policy makers, producing nations are demanding a larger part of the mineral wealth. In some cases, they are canceling long-term contracts that gave energy companies highly favorable terms.
 ''They think that since there is more revenue coming in, they can take a much harder line in negotiations,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-financed analysis group in New York. ''In some cases, they don't even need to negotiate.''
 Many of the world's giant energy producers, among them Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran and Mexico, play no role in the trend because their state-owned companies either fully control or dominate production. But Russia, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Algeria, together accounting for 20 percent of the world's supply but dependent on foreign and private domestic companies, are another story.
 They are among the countries that are tightening the terms -- sending a message that has reverberated in the industry at a time when supplies are tight. Some industry representatives call the new terms a chokehold that will slow investments, just as consuming nations need more oil to reduce prices.
 ''Both the tighter terms and the fluidity of contract terms will cause companies to second-guess further investment,'' said Michelle Billig, director of political risk at the PIRA Energy Group, a New York consulting firm. ''The willingness of countries to change the terms halfway through the project complicates any type of investment decision because you don't know what terms you're going to have at the end of the project.''
 To governments, though, the squeeze is justified because of the huge amount of money that oil companies are generating. A barrel of oil traded above $60 last week, before settling Friday at $58.75. Natural gas, which has doubled in price in the United States in five years, is in high demand the world over.
 ''They've never had earnings of this order,'' said Victor Poleo, a left-leaning oil economist in Venezuela. ''So this awakens an insatiable appetite in governments for that income.''
 The increasing prices have been a windfall for oil companies, which are registering record profits. 
 The Exxon Mobil Corporation saw profit jump 44 percent to $7.86 billion in the first quarter this year, while Royal Dutch/Shell's profit climbed 28 percent. The combined net income of the four biggest oil companies -- Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips -- increased 39 percent from a year earlier, the companies reported in April.
 Measured another way, Exxon Mobil's revenue for the first quarter -- $82.05 billion -- is nearly as much as the $107 billion gross domestic product in Venezuela, which supplies much of its crude oil to the United States.
 The big profits are not lost on people like Abel Mamani, the leader of Fejuve, an influential antiglobalization group in Bolivia that has fought oil companies. Angry protests against the country's energy policies have already led two presidents to resign in 20 months. 
 The latest resignation came last month after the Bolivian Congress sharply raised taxes on foreign energy companies, but not enough to placate some groups -- the protests continued and talk of nationalization was in the air. 
 ''This is a necessity,'' Mr. Mamani said in an interview. ''We are tired of these companies taking advantage of our resources.''
 Energy analysts say such a hard line could backfire in struggling countries like Bolivia or Ecuador, where energy reserves are large, but the industry still needs to be developed. 
 Repsol YPF, a Spanish energy giant whose Bolivia holdings account for a small part of worldwide production, has publicly said that it is considering legal action against Bolivia for changing contracts.
 ''The problem in Bolivia is companies are just now making investment,'' said Ed Miller, the president of Gas TransBoliviano, a pipeline group owned in part by Shell, Petrobras and British Gas, adding, ''This is going to have disastrous effects in the long term.''
 That may not be the case in most countries that are tightening terms. ''Countries like Venezuela, which are in a class on their own, can be more demanding in pushing for a government take,'' said Roger Tissot, director of countries and markets at PFC Energy, a consultant group based in Washington.
 In a sense, companies are captives of their own success. Big oil may have invested billions in technologically challenging areas, like the Orinoco Belt of Venezuela or the Caspian Sea region, but now they are reaping the benefits, with oil flowing out and petro-dollars flowing in.
 They are not about to abandon those projects now. Nor do they have unlimited options for new investments, since many of the world's top energy-producing countries restrict foreign investment.
 ''There are very few countries with attractive reserves that are open to foreign investment,'' Ms. Billig of PIRA Energy said. ''Those which are open recognize their bargaining power.''
 PIRA, which has completed a report on the trend, says some of the toughest new policies are in Russia, by some accounts the world's second-largest oil exporter. In its drive to assert control over the industry, the Kremlin aggressively sought back taxes last year against Yukos, the country's largest private oil company, leading to its sale in a state auction.
 The move stifled the political ambitions of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the founder of Yukos, who was sentenced in May to nine years in prison.
 In 2004, Russia increased the production tax rate by 15 percentage points and raised the export tax for crude oil that sells for more than $25 a barrel, while maneuvering to give state-run Gazprom, already the world's largest producer of natural gas, greater reach over the country's energy resources.
 More ominously for oil companies, Russian legislators are discussing whether to limit foreign participation in certain large-scale projects. 
 Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic, is also toughening terms, with a new law calling for a 90 percent minimum government share of all profits when oil is selling above $27 a barrel and at least a 50 percent state participation in projects.
 In Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, the government is levying new royalties, and its new offshore contracts are expected to be far more restrictive than past agreements.
 No country's energy policies have attracted as much attention as those of Venezuela, whose government has turned the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, into an engine for social change, while increasing taxes and royalties and changing long-term contracts with foreign multinationals. 
 Venezuela's government, led by its leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is planning to spend up to $4 billion of the oil company's budget this year on a range of programs, from clinics to literacy programs to subsidized markets. Foreign companies, which produce 1.1 million barrels a day out of a total of 2.6 million barrels daily, are needed to help generate that revenue.
 The shift could not be in sharper contrast to the early 1990's, when the government opened the energy sector to foreign investment and offered sweet deals to companies like ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Total of France and Statoil of Norway. In the vast Orinoco Belt, companies paid only a 1 percent royalty, a level intended to overcome concerns about drilling for heavy, poor-quality oil.
 That all changed last October, when Mr. Chavez's government increased the royalties in the Orinoco region to 16.6 percent, ending a virtual tax holiday. Venezuela is now hoping to raise the income tax rate on the projects in the Orinoco to 50 percent from 34 percent, the country's energy minister, Rafael Ramirez, told reporters recently. 
 In other parts of the country, the government has also toughened terms, seeking as much as $3 billion in back taxes, raising taxes and requiring majority state ownership. Companies are still welcome, officials say, while making clear that the state is in charge.
 ''The higher prices permit countries to have the higher revenues for development,'' said Nicolas Maduro, president of the National Assembly in Venezuela. ''Even with the higher royalties and taxes, the oil company earnings are still enormous.''

HEADLINE: Healing the World by Curing the Poor

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Like the champion of jet lag he is known to be, Dr. Paul Farmer dashed into town recently to give a seminar at Harvard Medical School. He had arrived in Boston via Haiti and Rwanda, the central African nation where he has been organizing an campaign to fight AIDS with money from the William J. Clinton Foundation.
 Dr. Farmer, 45, is a founding director of Partners in Health, a nonprofit agency based at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The organization provides medical services to the poor of Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, Russia and, yes, even Boston.
In the 2003 best seller about Dr. Farmer's life, ''Mountains Beyond Mountains,'' the writer Tracy Kidder described him as ''a man who would cure the world.'' 
 But sitting with a reporter over a beer and a basket of French fries at a Tremont Street pub, Dr. Farmer, tall and gangly, seems a lot less grandiose than that. ''As I ricochet around the world, I see a lot of idealism,'' he said. ''I see it in American high school kids raising money for health care in Haiti. I see it in Haitian health workers willing to go to Rwanda to battle the AIDS epidemic in Africa. These things are motivating.''

Q. If the great humanitarian physician Dr. Albert Schweitzer were alive today, what would he think of your work?

A. If he walked into our hospital in Cange, in central Haiti, I think he'd be impressed. I mean, our patients are really poor, and this is a really decent medical center. There's no utility infrastructure in rural Haiti -- few land line phones, hardly any passable roads. But at Cange, we've got a blood bank, laboratories, a modern operating room.

Q. How can you offer modern health services in places so poor that there is no electricity to power equipment?

A. We buy our own generators. And that's another thing: I think Dr. Schweitzer would be fascinated by the ways we use technology. He'd probably say, ''E-mail, wow!'' But we also do things he'd probably be uncomfortable with. We try to address the deeper causes of the diseases we see in countries like Haiti and Rwanda.
 A while ago, an official from this giant development bank came to central Haiti. I took him to see kids with typhoid. At that time, there'd been embargo aid and development money for Haiti. So I took him to a kid who was not going to make it because of typhoid. ''I want to know why your institution is blocking clean water loans to Haiti,'' I asked. Somehow I have the feeling that Dr. Schweitzer would have thought this outside of the purview of a good ''humanitarian'' physician.

Q. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere. Do you ever feel overwhelmed by all the suffering you see?

A. Sure. But you can't allow yourself to be overwhelmed for long because that's going to leave you ineffective. Instead, you say, ''Gee, with the help of some talented doctors, nurses and engineers, we could do a lot here.''
 When I first went to Haiti in the 1980's, there was a moment that clarified this for me. With a young Haitian man who later became a health worker, we went to see a 7-year-old girl with malaria. The only doctor in the region didn't make house calls. She had 105 fever and was shaking like a leaf. Later, as we walked back many miles to the squatter settlement where we worked, I asked, ''What can we do?''
 ''About the little girl or the problem of malaria?'' he asked me.
 I said, ''Both.'' 
 That moment stays with me. Even in situations that seem overwhelming, you try to focus on the individual patient. At the same time, you develop strategies to change the larger picture. You get others involved, go to people with power and try to get their help. One mustn't assume that people with great power won't help. 

Q. How have technological advances of the last decade changed your ability to serve the poor?

A. Certainly the Internet has made all kinds of new things possible. Central Haiti, as I mentioned, is a place of poor communications. But hey, we've leapfrogged the lack of infrastructure with satellite dishes and laptops.
 So the other day, we heard about a woman in a remote area who was dying in childbirth; we sent e-mails out to try to get help to her. The Internet has been useful for consults, too. We can now get input from specialists from all around the world. 
 Just yesterday, I got an e-mail from Cange with a digital photograph of a lesion that the doctor there couldn't identify. Did I know what this was? 
 I recognized it immediately as a Kaposi's sarcoma, which we saw frequently at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. It's become so rare now that this young doctor had no experience with it. Well, thanks to e-mail, I was able to say, ''Start that patient right away on antiretroviral medications.'' Of course, this should be confirmed with a biopsy. We couldn't have done this 10 years ago.

Q. Antiretroviral medications are expensive. How can your patients afford them?

A. We buy Indian generics mostly, and we give them out. We don't sell them. If we're confident that the Indian knockoff is as good, and we can get it at a tenth of the price, why on earth wouldn't we use it?
 With these lifesaving medications, you start thinking there ought to be another way. AIDS drugs exist. But the people we serve are too poor to be consumers and thus patients. Trying to help them makes you think that health care ought to be thought of as a human right -- like the right to free speech or the right to vote.

Q. Genomics is transforming health care in much of the West. Will your patients be able to be helped by it?

A. Whenever there is some new scientific breakthrough, we start scheming right away about how to use it. Cervical cancer? It's a major killer of women in poor countries.
 It's routine to screen for cervical cancer with Pap smears. But, the test is problematic in an underdeveloped region because you have to collect specimens, get them to a pathologist, obtain the results and then find the patient again. Because of poor transportation and communications, that's hard.
 There's this new test out, a DNA serology that can identify the strains of HPV virus that cause the cancer. So now, thanks to technology, there's no need to rely only on Pap smears. 
 Right now, we don't have this test. But six months from now, I'd like to tell you we're screening Haitian women with the HPV/DNA test. We're going to call the company who makes the test and find out if they'll consider giving it to us. If that doesn't work, we'll try to get it at a reduced rate.

Q. Do you ever get tired or angry?

A. Not long ago, I was coming back to Haiti from Rwanda. I'd had a great time at the new project in Africa -- all these committed people, all this optimism. But in Haiti, the road to Cange had changed hands, and now there were all these guys with guns everywhere. I started thinking, We've been living with guns in Haiti for some 20-something years. When's it going to end? It got me down. Plus, when I arrived at the hospital, there was a gunshot wound to tend to.

Q. So how did you break your mood?

A. I read Adam Hochschild's new book about the abolition of the slave trade. The abolitionists, they were pretty effective. Learning that cheered me right up.

HEADLINE: The Heterosexual Revolution

BYLINE: By Stephanie Coontz. 
Stephanie Coontz, the director of public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, is the author of ''Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage.''

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash. 

 BODY:
THE last week has been tough for opponents of same-sex marriage. First Canadian and then Spanish legislators voted to legalize the practice, prompting American social conservatives to renew their call for a constitutional amendment banning such marriages here. James Dobson of the evangelical group Focus on the Family has warned that without that ban, marriage as we have known it for 5,000 years will be overturned.
 My research on marriage and family life seldom leads me to agree with Dr. Dobson, much less to accuse him of understatement. But in this case, Dr. Dobson's warnings come 30 years too late. Traditional marriage, with its 5,000-year history, has already been upended. Gays and lesbians, however, didn't spearhead that revolution: heterosexuals did. 
 Heterosexuals were the upstarts who turned marriage into a voluntary love relationship rather than a mandatory economic and political institution. Heterosexuals were the ones who made procreation voluntary, so that some couples could choose childlessness, and who adopted assisted reproduction so that even couples who could not conceive could become parents. And heterosexuals subverted the long-standing rule that every marriage had to have a husband who played one role in the family and a wife who played a completely different one. Gays and lesbians simply looked at the revolution heterosexuals had wrought and noticed that with its new norms, marriage could work for them, too.
 The first step down the road to gay and lesbian marriage took place 200 years ago, when Enlightenment thinkers raised the radical idea that parents and the state should not dictate who married whom, and when the American Revolution encouraged people to engage in ''the pursuit of happiness,'' including marrying for love. Almost immediately, some thinkers, including Jeremy Bentham and the Marquis de Condorcet, began to argue that same-sex love should not be a crime. 
 Same-sex marriage, however, remained unimaginable because marriage had two traditional functions that were inapplicable to gays and lesbians. First, marriage allowed families to increase their household labor force by having children. Throughout much of history, upper-class men divorced their wives if their marriage did not produce children, while peasants often wouldn't marry until a premarital pregnancy confirmed the woman's fertility. But the advent of birth control in the 19th century permitted married couples to decide not to have children, while assisted reproduction in the 20th century allowed infertile couples to have them. This eroded the traditional argument that marriage must be between a man and a woman who were able to procreate.
 In addition, traditional marriage imposed a strict division of labor by gender and mandated unequal power relations between men and women. ''Husband and wife are one,'' said the law in both England and America, from early medieval days until the late 19th century, ''and that one is the husband.'' 
 This law of ''coverture'' was supposed to reflect the command of God and the essential nature of humans. It stipulated that a wife could not enter into legal contracts or own property on her own. In 1863, a New York court warned that giving wives independent property rights would ''sow the seeds of perpetual discord,'' potentially dooming marriage.
 Even after coverture had lost its legal force, courts, legislators and the public still cleaved to the belief that marriage required husbands and wives to play totally different domestic roles. In 1958, the New York Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the traditional legal view that wives (unlike husbands) couldn't sue for loss of the personal services, including housekeeping and the sexual attentions, of their spouses. The judges reasoned that only wives were expected to provide such personal services anyway.
 As late as the 1970's, many American states retained ''head and master'' laws, giving the husband final say over where the family lived and other household decisions. According to the legal definition of marriage, the man was required to support the family, while the woman was obligated to keep house, nurture children, and provide sex. Not until the 1980's did most states criminalize marital rape. Prevailing opinion held that when a bride said, ''I do,'' she was legally committed to say, ''I will'' for the rest of her married life.
 I am old enough to remember the howls of protest with which some defenders of traditional marriage greeted the gradual dismantling of these traditions. At the time, I thought that the far-right opponents of marital equality were wrong to predict that this would lead to the unraveling of marriage. As it turned out, they had a point.
 Giving married women an independent legal existence did not destroy heterosexual marriage. And allowing husbands and wives to construct their marriages around reciprocal duties and negotiated roles -- where a wife can choose to be the main breadwinner and a husband can stay home with the children-- was an immense boon to many couples. But these changes in the definition and practice of marriage opened the door for gay and lesbian couples to argue that they were now equally qualified to participate in it.
 Marriage has been in a constant state of evolution since the dawn of the Stone Age. In the process it has become more flexible, but also more optional. Many people may not like the direction these changes have taken in recent years. But it is simply magical thinking to believe that by banning gay and lesbian marriage, we will turn back the clock.

HEADLINE: Red, White and Bamboo

BYLINE: By Alan Lightman. 
Alan Lightman, who teaches writing at M.I.T., is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Discoveries.''

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH 

 BODY:
THE chief of Tramung Chrum is a small, white-haired man of about 60 with a crinkled face and a quiet dignity. When my family and I arrived at his remote village last week for the inauguration of its first brick-and-mortar school, he broke out in a huge grin and said (in Khmer through an interpreter), ''I feel like a hunter who has just captured an elephant.'' 
 Tramung Chrum (pronounced Truh-mung Chah-rum) is a Cambodian village of about 500 people, 40 miles from Phnom Penh. Because the village is far from a good road and made up of Muslim Chams in a largely Buddhist country, the Cambodian government has never built a school there. Generations have passed without reading and writing. The history of the village extends back at least as far as the mid-19th century, during the beginnings of the French occupation. 
 Four years ago, a former resident of the village rode his moped to the United Nations office in Phnom Penh and announced that the villagers wanted a school. They had built a roof of palm leaves and were requesting a building to hold the roof up. A Cambodian United Nations worker named Veasna Chea eventually relayed the villager's plea to a visitor from Maine named Frederick Lipp. Mr. Lipp in turn financed the construction of a temporary school made of sticks and palm leaves. Teachers were trained and the first classes began. 
 But the school of sticks and leaves leaked during the monsoons and blew down entirely in heavy winds. Two years ago, Mr. Lipp told me of his work. I began making trips to the village. Then, with the contributions of other friends, we built the new school for Tramung Chrum. 
 Cambodia desperately depends on such help to survive. One of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with an average annual income of only $300 per person, Cambodia still has not recovered from the devastation of the 1970's. In the early part of that decade, the United States dropped 500,000 pounds of bombs on Cambodia, the finale of the Vietnam War, and propped up the corrupt dictatorship of Gen. Lon Nol. 
 Then came the Khmer Rouge regime, which sent two million people to their deaths. Among other brutalities, the Khmer Rouge annihilated Cambodia's educated class. Today, 30 percent of the country remains illiterate. 
 Tramung Chrum, like many villages in Cambodia, lives on subsistence farming and menial labor. There is no electricity or running water. The men, women and children live in huts made of palm leaves and sticks and own little more than the clothes on their backs. They live a stripped down existence. Yet they crave education. Education ranks alongside food and water as a necessity of life. 
 The school at Tramung Chrum, with its three classrooms and library, took four months to build with a 20-man crew from Phnom Penh. A camera recorded the excitement of the villagers as they watched this wonder of concrete and steel girders and tiles rising bit by bit from the dirt. 
 On inauguration day, I was greeted by a gathering of the entire village and a large assortment of officials, including the vice governor of the province, the district chief of police (with his uniformed entourage) and a representative from the national ministry of education. Colored pennants had been hung from tall sticks and a ceremonial platform built out of bamboo and twine. All of the children of the village, about 150 boys and girls, stood on both sides of the dusty path leading to the platform, waving American and Cambodian flags. In the distance gleamed the new school, its pale yellow walls and red roof shimmering in the fierce heat. 
 On the ceremonial platform, I found myself seated beside several Muslim Cham clerics, wearing their white robes, and several Buddhist monks in their saffron robes. The monks chanted and tossed a gentle rain of white flower petals onto the heads of the dignitaries. 
 Then, the speeches began. As I sweated heavily in my chair, I recalled that my nation's Independence Day was only a week away. I thought of all that has happened in recent years to tarnish the meaning and honor of that day around the world. 
 Then I looked out at the new school, 50 yards away. I looked at the new flagpole, made of bamboo. I looked at the meandering cows, the principal source of income for the village. I looked at the dirt road leading to Phnom Penh, the scattered groups of fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, the 150 children squatting in front of the platform, miraculously holding still in the heat, listening to the long speeches. And I looked again at the American and Cambodian flags. I felt proud to be an American.

HEADLINE: At N.A.A.C.P. Helm, an Economic Approach to Rights

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4 

 BODY:
When the N.A.A.C.P. recently announced plans to make Bruce S. Gordon, a retired Verizon executive, its new president, the reaction from some longtime civil rights activists was, ''Bruce who?''
 But black business leaders cheered, loudly.
 ''Like the excitement around the election of Barack Obama, Bruce Gordon will generate excitement in corporate America,'' said Earl G. Graves Sr., the founder and publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, referring to the black United States senator from Illinois.
 Those conflicting reactions say much about the divergent views many blacks and civil rights leaders have about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, which is struggling to redefine itself in an era of resurgent political conservatism.
 For more than a year, the organization has been beset by problems -- including a revenue shortfall, stagnant membership and ethical complaints about its last president -- that have raised concerns about its vitality and ability to recruit younger blacks. Republicans have also attacked it as biased in favor of Democrats, an assertion the N.A.A.C.P., a nonprofit group, strongly denies. 
 But to many civil rights advocates, the biggest challenge facing the group is clarifying its mission at a time when legal segregation has been largely vanquished, but economic, housing and educational disparities between blacks and whites remain large. Integration may have opened doors, but it has also splintered, or complicated, the civil rights movement, those advocates say.
 Mr. Gordon, 59, has said he will apply his 35 years experience in corporate marketing to push the N.A.A.C.P. toward a more economic-based approach to civil rights, including by prodding pension funds and corporations to hire more black managers. He has said he will also raise money for an endowment, setting a goal of $200 million.
 ''We've got to get the right emphasis placed on economic equality,'' Mr. Gordon said in an interview. ''I happen to think that when you have economic stability and equality that often becomes an enabler for social equality.''
 But whether Mr. Gordon is the right person for the job is the subject of debate. For decades, the organization, founded in 1909, has been led by lawyers, ministers and, most recently, a politician, all with resumes steeped in civil rights experience.
 In vision and background, Mr. Gordon is something of a departure, said John Brittain, chief counsel for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Some activists worry that a man more experienced with boardrooms than barricades will stray from the N.A.A.C.P.'s tradition of protest and political pressure, Mr. Brittain said.
 ''There is the concern that the N.A.A.C.P. will deviate from their historic struggle for racial justice, for voting rights, for fair housing, employment, criminal justice, all won through things like boycotts, marches, leafleting and picketing,'' he said. 
 But Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who was considered for the N.A.A.C.P. job, said Mr. Gordon would have access to corporate leaders who could help ''turn around our problems.''
 ''He can take the purchasing power of African-Americans and turn it into political power,'' he said. 
 In an interview at his spacious apartment in the Tribeca section of Manhattan, surrounded by paintings by African-American artists, Mr. Gordon said he had no plans to eschew protest, litigation or legislation in fighting for rights for blacks, Hispanics and other minorities.
 ''When it is time to go out on the front lines and protest and take issue in the more traditional ways, if that's what it takes, that's what it takes,'' he said. ''I want to employ whatever mechanisms are needed to bring about change. Sometimes it may involve protest, sometimes one-on-one dialogue.''
 Supporters of Mr. Gordon also assert that his lack of overt political activity and his strong corporate experience will make it easier for him to work with Republicans, particularly President Bush, who has had a tense relationship with the N.A.A.C.P. since he was governor of Texas. 
 ''Bruce Gordon is going to be a terrific bridge-builder,'' said Jack F. Kemp, the former Republican congressman and vice-presidential candidate who served on the panel that recommended Mr. Gordon's hiring. 
 It will not be an easy job. Last year, Mr. Bush declined to address the group's annual convention for the fourth consecutive year, becoming the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover not to appear before the group over a full term. Mr. Bush has declined to attend this year's convention as well, N.A.A.C.P. officials said.
 At last year's convention, Julian Bond, the group's chairman, delivered a blistering attack on the Bush administration, asserting it encouraged racial division. Within months, the Internal Revenue Service said it would audit the group. N.A.A.C.P. officials have called the inquiry politically motivated and have refused to turn over documents.
 In the interview, Mr. Gordon said a priority would be to improve relations with the White House. ''That is not because I think the organization needs to move to the right,'' he said. ''It's because I think there have to be issues that are of common interest between the N.A.A.C.P. and the current administration.''
 Mr. Gordon was raised in Camden, N.J., where his mother was a schoolteacher and his father was a school administrator who helped found the Camden chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Gordon attended chapter meetings when he was a boy, making him feel, he said, that ''the N.A.A.C.P. was in my DNA.''
 After earning a bachelor's degree from Gettysburg College and a master's from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Gordon went to work at Bell of Pennsylvania and spent the rest of his career in the telecommunications industry. 
 He is married to his second wife, Tawana, 49, a former Verizon manager, and has a 27-year-old son from his first marriage.
 Before retiring from Verizon in 2003, Mr. Gordon was president of the retail markets group, with more than 30,000 employees and annual revenues of $20 billion.
 ''Those kinds of jobs can't be run based on just having good business skills,'' said Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Verizon's president. ''If you can't motivate a large organization to follow your lead through difficult times, you would not have survived as long as Bruce Gordon did.''
 The N.A.A.C.P. is looking to Mr. Gordon's management skills to put its finances in order: last year, it had a $4.7 million shortfall and laid off several employees at its Baltimore headquarters. Mr. Gordon will also be expected to help overcome complaints that the organization's last president, Kweisi Mfume, gave promotions and raises to female employees with whom he had relationships. Mr. Mfume has denied playing favorites.
 But more important, the organization is hoping Mr. Gordon can use his marketing skills to expand its membership, which has been stagnant at about 500,000 for more than a decade, officials said. In particular, the organization has had trouble maintaining support among blacks between the ages of 30 and 45.
 Mr. Gordon, a mentor to many minority employees at Verizon, said he planned to conduct focus groups to hear the concerns of younger blacks. But he also called for more aggressive marketing, saying the N.A.A.C.P. ''has great brand recognition'' but is undervalued because its work has not been promoted.
 ''When you advertise, you communicate your company's products and services,'' he said. ''You don't advertise, people don't get the message. Do we need to promote the N.A.A.C.P., what it is, what it stands for? Absolutely.''
 Such talk from a man so comfortable with the jargon of corporate marketing causes some traditional civil rights activists to roll their eyes. But Mr. Bond said Mr. Gordon's life experience -- a child of civil rights activists who became a corporate leader -- made him ideally suited to help guide the evolving civil rights movement.
 ''As opportunity has increased, it has become possible for there to be a range of ways that you could have an impact on civil rights,'' Mr. Bond said. ''There could not have been a Bruce Gordon 50 years ago. There is a Bruce Gordon today.''

HEADLINE: Dollar Rises Against Euro, Lifted by Economic Data

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 4 

 BODY:
The dollar hit its highest level against the euro in more than 13 months Monday after economic data painted a rosy picture of the United States economy and traders waited to see if the European Central Bank would cut interest rates later this week.
 The euro fell as low as $1.1888 in Europe -- its lowest point since May 20, 2004, when it dropped to $1.1893 -- before recovering slightly in early evening trading. That compares with $1.1947 in New York late Friday. 
Carsten Fritsch, a currency strategist with Commerzbank, said the dollar had been buoyed by the interest rate increase last week by the Federal Reserve and increases in United States manufacturing and consumer sentiment indexes. ''The other currencies are under pressure from the dollar,'' he said.
 The euro surged to an all-time high of $1.3667 at the end of December on worries about the wide United States trade and budget deficits.
 Stock markets were up slightly on Monday across Europe and Asia. United States markets were closed because of the Independence Day holiday.
 In Frankfurt, the DAX Index rose 6.4 percent, or 0.1 percent, to 4,623.51, while London's FTSE 100 was up 23.30 points to close at 5,184.30 points. The CAC-40 in Paris ended the day largely flat at 4,264.40, and the Swedish bourse, OMX, closed up 0.3 percent at 832.34.
 Oil companies led the indexes higher, as Brent futures edged up 40 cents in quiet European trading to $57.94 on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
 BP rose 3.8 percent to close at 617 pence ($10.90) in London. The French oil company Total closed up 1.2 percent at 199.20 euros ($236.93).

HEADLINE: A Look Behind the Curtain in Classical Music Shows It Has Serious Flaws

BYLINE: By ANNE MIDGETTE

 BODY:
Blair Tindall and I have several things in common. We are both women and both freelance journalists who have contributed, more or less frequently, to The New York Times. And we have both written (or participated in writing) books that are widely viewed as, at best, risque; at worst, blots on the pristine temple of classical music. 
 Mine, ''The King and I,'' written with Luciano Pavarotti's former manager Herbert Breslin, was a behind-the-scenes look at Mr. Pavarotti's rise and fall, and if you believe some of the press, a smear campaign on Mr. Pavarotti's glorious career. Ms. Tindall's, ''Mozart in the Jungle,'' came out last month, and if you believe some of the press, it is all about how Ms. Tindall, a freelance oboist, slept her way to the top (or as some have it, to the bottom). 
Well, don't believe everything you read. Advance press and reviews, even at their best, give only part of the picture. (I speak as one who writes them.) And people seem ready to suspend their own judgment and be shocked if they are told something should be shocking. For better or worse, I saw ''The King and I'' as a candid portrait, alternately entertaining and sad, of a relationship between two idiosyncratic and difficult people that also revealed a corner of the opera business. 
 And Ms. Tindall's book, as I understand it, is an indictment of the classical music world, using her own life as illustration. But it's a lot easier to focus salaciously on Ms. Tindall's sex life than to deal with her allegations that there are serious flaws in the classical music business, which was built up artificially during periods of economic growth and is now trying to sustain itself at untenable levels. 
 Let's talk about sex for a minute. (Readers attuned to the proprieties of a family newspaper may want to avert their eyes for the next few paragraphs.) Here's a shocking fact: consenting adults have sex. Even outside the field of classical music. I have heard tales of office Christmas parties in the business world that sound a lot more titillating than Ms. Tindall's mentions of rehearsals degenerating into group sex sessions.
 Actually, neither Ms. Tindall's nor Mr. Pavarotti's sex life sounds all that appealing or excessive, but once you enter the sacred temple of classical music, any reference to sex seems to be taken as licentious. (Has everyone forgotten ''Amadeus'' already?)
 What gets me is that a culture that embraces ''Sex and the City'' and the columns of Amy Sohn (now in New York magazine) is shocked when a classical musician admits to having the same amount of sex as any other healthy, unmarried 40-something in any other field, simply because people are told they should think it's shocking. It makes me agree all the more with Ms. Tindall that the business is in desperate need of some shaking up. 
 So I think it's great if classical music fans get a candid and unstinting look at the vicissitudes of the life of a freelance musician in New York. Those in the field know what a hard life it is, highly competitive and a constant scramble with no job security or health insurance; now, thanks to Ms. Tindall's book, it's out there for everyone to see. 
 And Ms. Tindall argues that the system is effectively set up to create this situation. Conservatories produce large numbers of trained musicians, only a few of whom can hope to find regular employment, but who, given their lack of a well-rounded education, have few other professional options. So they're stuck freelancing, either in prestigious but irregular classical gigs or in the security of a long-running Broadway show.
 Determined to make her memoir the stuff of journalism, Ms. Tindall anchors every event in her life with large swatches of supporting facts and figures. She enters the North Carolina School of the Arts in 1975; here's a brief history of the school and the rise of arts conservatories in the United States in the 1960's and 70's. She registers with the musicians' union; here's a brief history of employment opportunities for musicians, particularly women. (Did you know that the notion of full-time employment in a symphony orchestra dates from as recently as the 1960's?) She commutes to freelance jobs out of town; here are all the musicians who died in car accidents on the way to freelance jobs. 
 In short, she has done a lot of homework. And in many ways I am sympathetic to her argument. But as I read, I began to wonder how well she is able to interpret all the data she throws around. Some of her facts are fuzzy or even inaccurate.
 To cite an obvious point of contact between our two books: she bases her argument that even top-selling classical music albums far underperform pop ones on the Three Tenors album from 1996. It sold three million copies, she says, only about 2,000 a week, ''when the Three Tenors were hottest.'' The Three Tenors were actually on the wane by 1996; and their original album, released in 1990, sold around 11 million copies.
 Her point is not inaccurate, but too much of the book is like this: somewhat conventional statements about the field backed up by a handful of facts not always substantiated. The book has no index, only a section of footnotes and a list of acknowledgments that includes -- full disclosure -- a nod to my husband, Greg Sandow, evidently based on a single lunch they had during which the book was only briefly discussed. (For the record, they did not have sex.)
 But the book's biggest weakness is that it smacks of sour grapes. By writing it as an autobiography, Ms. Tindall seems to be saying that everything that went wrong in her life is the fault of the classical music world. This leads to some inadvertently amusing moments, like implicitly blaming a man's failure to call her for a third date on the fact that she works as a musician. And one wonders, Had she gotten a job at the New York Philharmonic rather than gone into the journalism program at Stanford, would this book have been written? 
 There's a lot wrong with the classical music business. But there is a lot wrong in other fields, too. Plenty of people in this country are stuck in dead-end jobs even more repetitive and less interesting than Ms. Tindall's. Plenty of them can't afford health insurance. Plenty of industries need fixing. Plenty of people used a lot of drugs in the 1980's. Plenty of workers die in car accidents during their daily commutes. So these arguments alone are not a strong indictment of classical music per se.
 In fact, if you want to write about a field that's concerned about its future, where profits seem to be falling and where the top institutions pay their top executives huge salaries while sustaining themselves in part through the efforts of struggling semipermanent freelancers: Welcome, Ms. Tindall, to journalism.

HEADLINE: Bush, A Friend Of Africa

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Those who care about Africa tend to think that the appropriate attitude toward President Bush is a medley of fury and contempt.
 But the fact is that Mr. Bush has done much more for Africa than Bill Clinton ever did, increasing the money actually spent for aid there by two-thirds so far, and setting in motion an eventual tripling of aid for Africa. Mr. Bush's crowning achievement was ending one war in Sudan, between north and south. And while Mr. Bush has done shamefully little to stop Sudan's other conflict -- the genocide in Darfur -- that's more than Mr. Clinton's response to genocide in Rwanda (which was to issue a magnificent apology afterward). 
 So as the G-8 summit meeting convenes this week, focusing on Africa, it's worth acknowledging that Mr. Bush, and conservatives generally, have in many ways been great for the developing world. At their best, they bring a healthy dose of hands-on practicality to their efforts.
 The liberal approach to helping the poor is sometimes to sponsor a U.N. conference and give ringing speeches calling for changed laws and more international assistance. 
 In contrast, a standard conservative approach is to sponsor a missionary hospital or school. One magnificent example is the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, where missionary doctors repair obstetric injuries that have left Ethiopian women incontinent. 
 Liberals also often focus on changing laws, but in a poor country, the legal system is often irrelevant outside the capital. Sudan, for example, banned female genital mutilation back in 1957; since then, the practice has expanded steadily. Sure, lobbying for better laws is important, but it's usually much more cost-effective to vaccinate children or educate girls. Nobody gets more bang for the buck than missionary schools and clinics, and Christian aid groups like World Vision and Samaritan's Purse save lives at bargain-basement prices.
 Liberals may also put too much faith in aid itself. What Africa needs most desperately are things it can itself provide: good governance, a firmer neighborhood response to genocide in Sudan, and a collective nudging of Robert Mugabe into retirement. 
 Plenty of studies have shown that aid usually doesn't help people in insecure, corrupt or poorly governed nations. Indeed, aid can even do harm, by bidding up local exchange rates and hurting local manufacturers. 
 All that said, in the right circumstances aid can be tremendously effective, especially in well-governed countries -- Mozambique is an excellent example. And Mr. Bush's new push to help Africa is smartly designed, targeting problems like malaria and sex trafficking, where extra attention and resources will make a big difference on the ground.
 Mr. Bush's signature foreign aid program, the Millennium Challenge Account, is off to an agonizingly slow start, but is shrewdly focused on encouraging good governance and economic growth. The first grant went to Madagascar, a well-run country, to clarify property rights there. This isn't sexy, but nothing would help the poor in Africa more than giving them clear title to their land so they could secure loans and start businesses.
 The divide I portray between the left and right is, of course, a caricature. Some of the very best work to help the poor is done by liberal-leaning groups, like the Carter Center, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Doctors Without Borders. They all use their resources to make real changes on the ground.
 And while Mr. Bush has done much more for Africa than most people realize, there's one huge exception, because anything with a whiff of sex in it makes some conservatives go nuts. Mr. Bush's decision to cut off funds for the U.N. Population Fund means that more African girls will die in childbirth. Even more tragic is the administration's blind hostility to condoms to fight AIDS -- resulting in more dead Africans.
 Mr. Bush has another blind spot as well: while he is right that aid is not a cure-all, sometimes he seems to use legitimate concerns about aid as an excuse for stinginess. Aid has shortcomings, but Mr. Bush himself has shown that it can be used effectively to save lives by the millions. 
 Yet Mr. Bush is resisting the G-8's calls for further help for Africa; he thinks the sums are better spent on cutting the taxes of the richest people on earth than on saving the lives of the poorest. Come on, Republicans! You need to persuade Mr. Bush to be more generous this week, because his present refusal to help isn't conservative, but just plain selfish.

HEADLINE: Summit Leaders Still Differ And Protesters Still Protest

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, July 4 

 BODY:
With some signs of discord after a weekend of free rock concerts and celebrity urgings to end Africa's poverty, politicians and protesters prepared Monday for the Group of 8 summit meeting later in the week.
 The leaders of eight major industrial nations are to meet Wednesday through Friday at the luxurious Gleneagles golf estate north of Edinburgh, preoccupied by two main subjects -- climate change and relieving African poverty through changes in policies on trade, aid and debt.
 In Edinburgh on Monday police officers drawn from the estimated 10,000 on duty to guard the meeting fought running scuffles with several hundred antiglobalization protesters. No injuries were reported. 
 In an interview broadcast Monday on British television, President Bush seemed to damp any expectation that he might reward Prime Minister Tony Blair, the conference host, for his support in the American effort to prevent terrorism.
 ''I really don't view our relationship as one of quid pro quo,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Tony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for keeping the peace and winning the war on terror, as I did. So I go to the G-8 not really trying to make him look bad or good but with an agenda that I think is best for our country.''
 Mr. Bush is generally seen to be at odds with Britain and most other members of the group on accepting the scientific evidence relating to the causes of global warming, and thus on the need for immediate steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Indeed, the United States is held by other group members to be the world's biggest polluter.
 Mr. Bush's remarks seemed to conflict with a forecast on Sunday by President Jacques Chirac of France that the member countries -- the others are Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia -- were ''heading toward an agreement'' on global warming.
 At a news conference in London on Monday, Sir Michael Jay, Mr. Blair's representative at talks by senior officials in advance of the meeting, said climate change ''was never going to be an easy discussion,'' and added, ''There are differences of opinion, particularly about the science.''
 Asked about speculation that the meeting might split over climate change and produce two final statements -- one of them representing the United States' view and one agreed by the others -- he said, ''I'm not going to rule in or rule out anything.'' 
 Mr. Bush maintained his opposition to deals like the Kyoto Protocol, which set targets for lowering greenhouse gas emissions and which the United States has refused to accept.
 ''If this looks like Kyoto, the answer is no,'' he said. ''The Kyoto agreement would have wrecked our economy. I think you can grow your economy and at the same time do a better job of harnessing greenhouse gases. That's exactly what I want to talk to our partners about.'' 
 His only apparent softening lay in remarks during the interview that climate change represented a ''significant long-term issue that we've got to deal with'' and that the problem was ''to some extent'' a result of human actions. 
 At other talks in advance of the summit meeting, Group of 8 countries have apparently made some progress on increasing aid to Africa and canceling debt. But trade, said Sir Michael, the British representative, ''is going to be one of the most difficult issues.'' 
 In part, that is because a change in trade rules would affect huge farm subsidies in both the United States and the European Union -- an area in which Mr. Bush seemed to suggest the Europeans had more changes to make than the United States.
 ''We've got agricultural subsidies, not nearly to the extent that our friends in the E.U. have,'' he said.
 In support of more aid for Africa, campaigners like the former rock singer Bob Geldof urged the leaders to heed the voices of millions of people who flocked to rock concerts across the globe over the weekend or took to the streets. More than 200,000 people demonstrated on Saturday in Edinburgh to reinforce the slogan: Make Poverty History.
 ''We are asking them to be great,'' Sir Bob said on Monday, referring to the eight leaders. He said it would be a ''grotesque failure'' if the summit meeting failed to make a breakthrough.
 In Edinburgh, by Monday night, the police said, about 60 people had been arrested after skirmishes between protesters and officers wielding transparent riot-shields. The day of protests paralyzed Princes Street, a main thoroughfare near Edinburgh Castle. Witnesses said that the police, some on horseback, confronted protesters throwing paving stones and park benches. Television showed young children and shoppers caught up in the fray. 
 The fighting raised worries among officers about the next few days, when tens of thousands more protesters plan to arrive in Edinburgh and attend a rock concert as the summit meeting formally opens on Wednesday. The police said the violence had been set off by a number of protesters, including some from around Europe.
 Protesters had billed a march through the city as a carnival, but Tom Halpin, a senior Scottish police officer, said the event had not been authorized. ''Those involved were determined to cause as much disruption as possible,'' he told reporters. ''We are facing a hard core of determined activists, supported by hangers-on. 
 The leaders of several African countries, including South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal and Algeria, are to meet Friday with Group of 8 leaders. 
 African leaders gathered Monday in Libya for a summit meeting of the African Union, whose president, Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, said Africa would take part in this year's major development meetings ''proud, united and showing solidarity,'' Agence France-Presse reported.
 But he voiced some skepticism: ''Too many promises have been made to us in the course of too many meetings, but none has ever been honored.''

Mad Cows and Englishmen
 (By The New York Times) PARIS, July 4 -- President Chirac joked about mad cow diseases and bad English food during a conversation on Sunday in Kaliningrad with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, the French daily Liberation reported Monday.
 ''The only thing they [the British] have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow,'' Mr. Chirac joked, eliciting laughter from Mr. Schroder and Mr. Putin, the newspaper said. As for British food, Mr. Chirac apparently said, ''You can't trust people who cook as badly as that.''
 Asked to comment on the remarks, Mr. Chirac's chief spokesman, Jerome Bonnafont, said, ''No reaction whatsoever.''
 Relations between France and Britain have been even more strained than usual after the collapse of a European Union summit meeting last month in which Mr. Chirac and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain blamed each other for its failure. Mr. Blair is determined to cut European Union farm subsidies, which mainly benefit France, while Mr. Chirac and other leaders want Britain to give up a generous rebate it receives each year.

HEADLINE: Two Views of Baltimore Compete for Public Money

BYLINE: By GARY GATELY

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, July 5 

 BODY:
Hardly anybody lives on this blighted block in East Baltimore anymore. On a steamy Friday morning, a few people mill about outside the two row houses that still have life left in them. All the rest of the houses on this block of Bethel Street are boarded shells. 
 On the side of a vacant row house overlooking a playground, long since taken over by a drug gang, there is a spray-painted image of a bullet and the words ''Body-More Murdaland.'' 
 About two miles away, the city's Inner Harbor teems with life. Yachts and paddleboats crowd the water. Throngs stroll the brick promenades. Musicians and mimes perform, and the city celebrates the 25th birthday of the twin shopping and dining pavilions of Harborplace. City benches read ''Baltimore -- The Greatest City in America.'' 
 These sharply contrasting views of Baltimore underlie a sharp dispute between an influential advocacy group, led by clergy members, and a prominent local politician. Last week, angry ministers protested, accusing the City Council president, Sheila Dixon, of reneging on a promise to provide $50 million for the redevelopment of blighted neighborhoods as the council considers building a $305 million hotel just west of the harbor. It would be connected to the existing Baltimore Convention Center and owned by the city. 
 From City Hall to church pulpits to corners of the city tourists rarely see, many people have questioned the priorities of a city that would finance the convention center hotel with neighborhoods in dire need. 
 ''It's a tale of two cities and two visions -- one uptown, one downtown, one doing extremely well, one struggling to survive,'' said the Rev. Douglas Miles, a co-chairman of the advocacy group, Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development, known by its acronym, Build. The group claims thousands of members in churches and community organizations.
 Mr. Miles, the pastor of Koinonia Baptist Church in East Baltimore, said Build did not oppose a new hotel. But, he added, ''Redevelopment of blighted neighborhoods warrants the same sense of urgency as the hotel.''
 Build leaders said Ms. Dixon, a Democrat, had promised publicly at least three times that she would push for $50 million in bonds for the redevelopment of neighborhoods.
 But Ms. Dixon denied she broke a promise and said the city had pumped more than $100 million into neighborhoods in the past five years. She said Build had yet to provide a specific plan for redevelopment. ''We can't write a $50 million check when they don't have a plan, and they don't have a plan,'' she said.
 Build counters that Ms. Dixon knew the group was not planning to propose specific development plans, but was asking the city to commit the money to demolish, acquire and rebuild blighted and vacant properties.
 The council president said that she had been working with Build and that the city was making progress to wipe out blight, stimulate the economy and improve housing.
 The hotel proposal has been supported by Mayor Martin O'Malley and the city's tourism and economic development agencies as a way to stem the loss of convention business to competing cities. Clarence Bishop, the mayor's chief of staff, said that because Baltimore lacked such a hotel it had lost conventions that would have generated $81 million in direct spending over the past three years.
 Still, Mr. Bishop said the mayor would prefer a privately financed hotel to a publicly financed one. 
 The city's economic development agency, the Baltimore Development Corporation, which deliberates in private, said it rejected two other hotel plans, primarily privately financed but calling for tens of millions of dollars in public subsidies. M.J. Brodie, president of the development agency, said it rejected them in part because they would have required the city to pledge tax revenues toward the repayment of bonds if the hotel did not do well.
 But Mr. Brodie said he expected that the hotel, which would be one of the city's costliest public projects ever, would generate revenue exceeding the cost of the bonds, and that profits would flow into the city.
 If not, the city would divert up to 25 percent of hotel occupancy tax revenue toward that shortfall, and the hotel's operator, Hilton Hotels Corporation, would pay up to $25 million to cover the difference between the revenue and the cost of repaying bonds. 
 Critics question whether the city should be in the business of developing and owning a convention hotel, which would be built on city-owned parking lots just north of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Some critics point to a report released by the Brookings Institution in January that found the convention industry was contracting and attendance was falling. Councilman Keiffer Mitchell said he was drafting a referendum to let voters decide on the hotel. ''I have a hard time explaining to my constituents that the city wants to invest $305 million to build and operate a hotel downtown, and we're fighting for crumbs,'' he said. 
 More money, he said, should go to poor neighborhoods, with some 16,000 vacant or abandoned homes. 
 Mr. Mitchell sees a direct connection between blight and the sad cycle of violence, poverty and despair in a city where half of those who start public high schools never finish, where the homicide rate last year was five times greater than that of New York City and where health officials suggest that almost one in 10 people are drug addicts.
 Along Bethel Street, the Rev. Calvin Keene of Memorial Baptist Church pointed to houses that looked as if they had been bombed and an alley strewn with debris. ''Look at the squalor these people have to live in; it's unbelievable,'' Mr. Keene said.
 Tiffany Burks, 19, a warehouse clerk sitting on a stoop, called out to Mr. Keene and two other ministers, who were walking by. ''Please pray for me.'' They did, laying hands on the young woman and two other people with her.
 Across the street, around two dozen spray-painted names with ''RIP'' next to them -- all homicide victims -- cover a gray wall. 
 Myra Johnson, a 47-year-old cook at the Baltimore Convention Center, pointed to the memorial wall. ''That's my nephew up there,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''There's another nephew. All these are people who got killed around here.''

HEADLINE: Brooklynites Take In a Big Development Plan, and Speak Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Diane Cardwell and Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Sipping her morning coffee, Karen Bornarth stared with amazement yesterday at the new building plan that would create a towering row of skyscrapers around a proposed Nets arena east of Downtown Brooklyn, and forever change the borough's cozy skyline.
 ''The idea of having a sports team in Brooklyn is nice,'' said Ms. Bornarth, a 34-year-old baker, over her newspaper in Ozzie's Cafe on Seventh Avenue in Park Slope. ''But how on earth did we go to having all of this?'' 
That reaction, in varying forms, was echoed throughout Brooklyn yesterday as the expanded building designs were made public, showing a project of much more sweep and ambition than was hinted at in 2003 when the arena proposal was first announced. The new designs set off a range of emotions, from fury and disbelief to skepticism to a few notes of cautious support.
 Many Brooklynites said they were shocked simply by the scale of the $3.5 billion development, the largest proposed outside Manhattan in decades. It would include 17 buildings, many of them soaring 40 to 50 stories high, and add 15,000 residents and 1.9 million square feet of office space to an area that many view as already choked with traffic.
 Several of them called the project an aesthetic disaster that would mar the borough's distinctive low-roofed charm, further clog the streets and make the subways even more difficult to navigate. Some took issue with the jazzy, unconventional designs, by the architect Frank Gehry and the developer Bruce C. Ratner, while others worried that the project could harm the area's small businesses and drive steep housing prices still higher.
 But some residents and business owners said they welcomed a proposal that could bring in new money and jobs.
 Demetrius Pettway, 37, an aspiring writer and music producer, noted that the area to be developed -- a 21-acre stretch between Atlantic Avenue and Dean Street -- is surrounded not just by million-dollar brownstones, but also by housing projects where many residents are unemployed. ''The people in there will probably depend on something like this to get some work,'' he said, gesturing toward a project, the Fort Greene Houses. ''It's good for the prosperity of the area.''
 Henry Rosa, 55, the co-owner of a sporting goods store at Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street, said: ''I suspect it will be great for us. Once the project is complete, with new residents here, it will bring us more traffic.'' But he said that if he lived in the area, he would probably be angry.
 In fact, most residents of the neighborhoods around the proposed development -- Fort Greene, Boerum Hill, Park Slope and Prospect Heights -- seemed eager to challenge almost every aspect of the project. That is no great surprise: huge new developments are not an easy sell in an area that takes great pride in its quiet, historic charm. Many residents had already opposed the arena plan.
 Officials of the local community boards -- 2, 6 and 8 -- have said they will not comment on the plan until they see Mr. Ratner's formal proposal to buy and develop the railyards at the center of the site. That proposal, along with any other possible bids, was to be submitted today to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the yards.
 Some of the community groups that have long opposed the project said that they, too, were waiting to see Mr. Ratner's proposal. But they were not shy about criticizing Mr. Gehry's newly unveiled architectural models. ''We feel these models are an insult to the community,'' said Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and a leader in opposing the Ratner development plan. ''These models have no relationship to the community.''
 Many residents said they felt the same way.
 ''It's just awful,'' said Mona McNamara, 30, sitting at an outdoor table at a cafe in Fort Greene with her 6-month-old daughter, Gwendolyn. She rattled off a list of concerns: that the project would aggravate street and subway congestion, create more pollution, harm local small businesses, require heavy city and state subsidies that would hurt taxpayers, and fragment the area by cutting off Fort Greene from neighborhoods to the south, like Park Slope.
 Worst of all, many residents said, the project would make Brooklyn look and feel more like Manhattan -- or any other city.
 ''Manhattan more and more feels like a mall,'' said Ms. Bornarth, in Park Slope. ''The nice thing about this part of Brooklyn is that it still feels small, and it has small businesses. It's what makes the borough great.''
 Some of the project's critics said they were intrigued by Mr. Gehry's architectural sketches; others said the designs seemed profoundly out of touch with Brooklyn's gritty charm.
 ''On a visual level, is it really wise to let an architect like Frank Gehry, whose designs are bold and unconventional, do the whole thing?'' said Heather Barrow, 38, an architectural curator and former city planner. ''It doesn't seem like an organic project.''
 But even the project's fiercest opponents tend to concede that Brooklyn could use more housing and development -- a need that some city planners and development experts have raised in defense of Mr. Ratner's plans.
 ''It's creating a downtown central business district, which in contemporary terms means mixed use on a scale significantly higher than what Brooklyn has had before,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose housing subsidiary has developed homes near the Atlantic railyards. ''But cities across America have seen that creating density at the urban center, with a combination of commercial, retail and residential, is really the key to both a success downtown and to preservation of the surrounding residential neighborhoods.''
 Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, expressed caution over the scale of the development and its effect on transit services, but said that such projects would be necessary to serve the city's growing population.
 ''We've got to think about areas in the city where we can accommodate that growth,'' he said. ''Some of it's going to be on the waterfront and in old warehouse districts, but some of it will have to happen around transit hubs like this one.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Tuesday about Frank Gehry's design for the first phase of the Grand Avenue development project in Los Angeles misstated the location of the proposed Atlantic Yards project that Mr. Gehry is designing in Brooklyn. (The error also appeared in sports articles on Feb. 9 and April 11, in the City section on Jan. 15 and in several articles in 2003, 2004 and 2005.) It is on rail yards and other land in Prospect Heights and on a block in Park Slope; it is not in Downtown Brooklyn, although it is near that neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Home Sweet Office Tower

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
The condo and apartment conversion craze has hit a wall here -- a sleek corporate wall of smoked glass and cheap steel girding.
 It was bound to happen. Across the country, buildings with character -- old garment factories, warehouses, Art Deco skyscrapers and Beaux-Arts firehouses -- are being revived as condominiums and loft apartments as cities try to draw residents back to their core. But with that historic stock depleting, developers are now turning to uglier candidates for condo makeover: moribund office towers.
From Dallas to Fort Worth, Los Angeles to Chicago, developers are lifting the corporate skin off these skyscrapers. They are installing new windows, limestone facades, balconies and contemporary ornament, and in some cases stripping the buildings to curtain walls and I-beams to do it. 
 ''You've got to take off some of the old ugly facades and let there be glass and light,'' said Laura Miller, the mayor of Dallas. ''If you take the skin off and restore it, it's beautiful.''
 These glass-and-steel monoliths sprang up in droves from 1950 to 1980, when cities like Dallas experienced explosive and unchecked commercial development. In the 1950's, Dallas added 7.2 million square feet of office space, second only to New York City, according to an article in May 1960 in The Dallas Morning News. 
 But as those buildings aged and jobs fled Dallas during the dot-com recession, many of those buildings emptied, giving Dallas the highest office vacancy rate in the country. From 2000 to 2005, amid a glut of office space, office rents declined by 22 percent, according to Reis Inc., a real estate research company.
 Although the city's numbers have improved over the last year, 26.5 percent of its office space is still vacant. Downtown alone, nine million square feet of office space sits vacant, according to the brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield.
 ''These buildings have kind of been shunned,'' said Ted Hamilton, who is working with his father, Larry, to redevelop and partly reface the vacant Fidelity Union Life Towers downtown to create 435 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail space.
 Developers like the Hamiltons have snatched up these buildings -- some boarded up, some 15 percent occupied -- for $10 a square foot and concocted sales pitches for lofts and new retailing spaces. The city is eager to unload its outmoded office stock and is serving up tens of millions of dollars in tax incentives for construction, exterior renovation and landscaping.
 Dallas could use 10,000 residential units downtown, and about 3,800 have been built or are being developed, according to the Central Dallas Association.
 In other cities, the choice to tear down or redevelop a dilapidated old building can instantly ignite an emotional battle, pitching preservationists and historians against developers. Less so in cities like Dallas, said Art Lomenick, managing director for the Trammel Crow Company, a Dallas real estate brokerage firm.
 ''It's not that old of a city,'' Mr. Lomenick said. ''You've got buildings that are functionally obsolete now that were built in the 50's and 60's. They're not architecturally significant. They're terrible.''
 Razing or refacing often boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, said Joseph Sapp, a San Diego developer who plans to reface three downtown office buildings here and convert them to apartments. If the building's footprint is not too big (sprawling office floors beget cavelike apartments) and its bones are solid, it is often cheaper and faster to reface than rebuild.
 ''You're just buying it for bupkis,'' Mr. Sapp said. ''Everything's already intact. Think of it as a big tenant improvement job. I call them recycling.''
 Mr. Sapp's company, 3J Development, plans to replace the dark-glass shell of an empty 1961 office building at 1600 Pacific Street with walls of blue glass, tack on balconies, add a contemporary cornice and cut terraces into the building. 
 On Main Street, he will expose the original stone facade and cornice of the Praetorian, a 1908 office building with a face that was girded in glass and silvery metal during the 60's. Other developers along Main Street have unwrapped small older buildings and set up stores and restaurants.
 ''It looks horrible,'' Mr. Sapp said of the Praetorian's current state, which resembles a foil wrapping. ''I can't believe they did what they did. We're going to completely redo the exterior. It will have a unique look to it -- like that older-building look in New York.''
 Mr. Sapp is in contract to buy 211 North Ervay, a turquoise-paneled building from the 1950's, and will reface it. Some preservationists have objected, saying the building is an understated piece of Modernism, but the mayor, Ms. Miller, said she was elated about the building's makeover.
 ''That has been the bane of my existence since I became mayor,'' three years ago, she said.
 To peel a building, developers have to examine its frame -- where the columns are placed, how the exterior curtain wall is attached and what sort of additions the structure can support. In Fort Worth, after a tornado ravaged the Bank One Tower in 2000, developers saved the building from demolition, deciding to pare it down to the skeleton and rebuild, inside and out.
 Workers scaled the building like window washers to unbolt the aluminum curtain wall and expose the concrete frame, said Brian George, an architect on the project. They tacked on balconies, affixed a new curtain wall, installed aqua-green windows and are now setting a metal crown on the roof, which will be lighted from below to glow at night.
 Other cities are performing similar face lifts, having decided that many Modernist buildings' visages have not aged well. 
 In Chicago, developers have removed the black glass of the old Montgomery Ward & Company headquarters -- called the ''Darth Vader building'' in The Chicago Tribune -- and installed a blue-green coat to convert the tower to condos. Other conversions involving refacing are under way in Philadelphia, Miami and Stoneham, Mass.
 In Dallas, some of the before-and-after building renderings are as striking as photos in a weight-loss brochure. 
 At 1217 Main Street, British developers have sketched out plans to morph a dark and vacant five-story office into an Edenic mix of offices, stores and restaurants, where waterfalls flow down a crystal-clear facade and a giant red awning sweeps up to a roof garden planted with palms. New stone and metal panels would complete the picture.
 Other developers are learning that their reach exceeds their grasp. The Hamiltons, the father-and-son developers, drew elaborate ideas for their Fidelity Union conversion, adorning the towers with scores of new windows that protruded like gems, new girding and gill-like flourishes. 
 Now they have scaled back the plan, in part because they are seeking federal tax credits and must conform to the National Park Service's standards -- the park service runs the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program -- that developers preserve the historic quality of a building.
 ''We couldn't do this'' and still be eligible for the $20 million tax credit, Ted Hamilton said in an interview, as he surveyed the original drawings.
 Sometimes, money dictates the look. The building known as 1200 Main Street is a classic black-and-brown office box being transformed into condos costing $120,000 to $600,000. The developers will carve balconies into the building, giving it notches and texture, but they said it would cost too much to replace the building's exterior.
 ''This building has been here since 1972,'' said Audra Hall, the senior sales manager for the project, as she walked through the renovated apartments. ''It is what it is.''

HEADLINE: Aircraft Sales Lead the Way, As Manufacturing Picks Up 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Factory orders rose 2.9 percent in May to $394.1 billion, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, largely driven by sales of aircraft and other highly expensive items.
 Commercial aircraft orders increased 164.9 percent, and orders for other long-lasting goods as a whole climbed 5.5 percent in the month. But orders for nondurable goods like food and textiles barely changed, rising 0.1 percent. 
The overall figure was just shy of analysts' expectations of 3 percent growth. It was the largest increase in factory orders in more than a year and the third consecutive month of growth. Orders rose 0.7 percent in March and April after falling 0.5 percent in February. 
 The report helped drive the major stock indexes higher yesterday. It followed a report last week from the Institute for Supply Management that said manufacturing activity rose 2.4 percent in June. The institute's manufacturing index rose to 53.8, from 51.4 percent in May. A reading above 50 means that manufacturing is expanding.
 Economists have been waiting for signs of growth in manufacturing, which has taken much longer than other parts of the economy to recover from a slowdown that started in 2001.
 Some analysts warned that despite the recent positive reports, the manufacturing recovery is not yet on a firm footing. Aircraft orders are not expected to stay at their current high rate, and orders for industrial machinery, computers, fabricated metals and some nondurable goods fell in May. 
 Marisa DiNatale, an economist with Economy.com, an independent economic research company based in West Chester, Pa., noted that there were mixed signals and weakness in manufacturing. ''We kind of have to wait and see to make any definitive statements,'' she said.
 Even now, the manufacturing recovery has yet to create new factory jobs, which dipped slightly to 14.3 million in May. That number remains at lows not seen since the late 1950's. At the end of 2000, by contrast, manufacturers employed 17.2 million people.
 Stephen Stanley, chief economist with RBS Greenwich Capital, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland, held out little hope that factory jobs would return to pre-2000 levels soon, if ever, given the movement of production to China and other low-cost countries. ''I don't think you will see massive improvements,'' he said.
 But he also said that recent reports could be a sign that manufacturers are finally in a position to increase capital investments after cost-cutting in recent years.

HEADLINE: St. Vincent Medical Centers System Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, the largest Catholic hospital system in New York State, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday morning, citing years of mounting debts and falling revenues.
 St. Vincent officials said that services at the center's seven hospitals and other health care facilities would not be affected by the Chapter 11 filing, and that no job cuts were planned. Within the past year, however, the St. Vincent system has been forced to close one hospital -- St. Joseph's in Flushing, Queens -- and to begin the process of closing two more, Bayley Seton on Staten Island and St. Mary's in Brooklyn. 
Even those familiar with the precarious financial situation of hospitals across the city were surprised that St. Vincent was forced to take such drastic action.
 ''We are seeing one of the great, proud names of health care in the United States being squeezed financially to the point where they have to seek protection from the federal courts,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a nonprofit trade association representing 250 hospitals in the metropolitan area. ''It is an example of the economic vise that the health care system has been put in in New York and across the country.''
 The announcement comes as hospitals across the state brace for the findings of a newly appointed committee intended to identify hospitals that are the best candidates to be closed. St. Vincent officials said that the message from Albany was clear: there would be no more bailouts of financially struggling institutions.
 ''All of us in New York are looking at that commission over our shoulders,'' said David Speltz, the president and chief executive of St. Vincent.
 By filing for bankruptcy, St. Vincent hopes to ease its debt burden and restructure its finances, allowing it to better balance its books. If the bankruptcy petition is accepted in court, the hospital system will be protected from any action by creditors seeking to collect payment.
 St. Vincent has debts of roughly $1.1 billion, according to Bernadette Kingham-Bez, a senior vice president. Last year, the system had revenues of $1.6 billion and a net operating loss of $143.5 million, more than officials expected. In a statement, St. Vincent said that an initial independent audit in 2004 had overstated earnings by $60 million.
 The center has been struggling to regain its financial footing for years, from nearly the moment that the St. Vincent system was created in 2000, the result of a merger of several Catholic hospitals. 
 The merger was seen as a way of consolidating costs and allowing the Catholic hospitals wrapped into the system to continue their mission of providing care for the poor and uninsured. But the landscape soon changed, and hospitals found themselves with too many beds, too few patients and less reimbursement from public and private insurers. At the same time, medical costs -- from equipment to malpractice insurance -- were skyrocketing.
 By last year it was evident that St. Vincent needed to regroup, as the system continued to lose millions. The hope was that the closings would stanch the flow of cash and that millions of dollars would be saved through improved billing. So far, the system has not been brought back to financial health.
 Officials stressed that daily work would go on unchanged and that all 12,000 employees would continue to be paid on time.
 St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village, the system's flagship, was founded in 1849 and has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the region's best Catholic hospitals. It is connected to the New York Medical College, and has one of the leading AIDS programs in the country, areas that Mr. Speltz said would remain untouched. 
 And even as the St. Vincent system as a whole is under tremendous pressure, it is in the midst of building a $20 million trauma center. The money raised for that project, hospital officials say, is protected from the bankruptcy proceedings.
 The hospital system is sponsored by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn and Sisters of Charity of New York, but its board acts independently of the church.
 The system has been serving 600,000 patients, and includes -- in addition to the two hospitals that are in the process of closing -- Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica, Queens; St. John's Queens Hospital in Elmhurst; St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan; St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital (also in Manhattan); St. Vincent's Hospital Staten Island; and St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester. 
 Hospital officials say that the savings from those closings, which have not yet been realized, will go a long way toward getting the rest of the system out of debt.
 But St. Vincent's situation is emblematic of a broader problem among the state's hospitals, among the most financially troubled in the nation. The state has far too many hospital beds, and has suffered from state laws and federal aid formulas that have reduced its ability to respond to changes in care. Adding to the burden in New York is the fact that about 25 percent of the people living here have no health insurance.
 In 2004, St. Vincent provided $104 million in charity care. Mr. Speltz said the system would not change its commitment to providing care for the poor.
 Mr. Speltz, who was brought to St. Vincent specifically to deal with its troubled finances, has dealt with similar problems in hospitals from Florida to Boston. But in all his years, he said, he has never seen a grimmer picture.
 ''New York is in some of the deepest health care distress that I have seen in my career,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Africa Tackles Graft, With Billions in Aid in Play

BYLINE: By SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria 

 BODY:
One of Dora Nkem Akunyili's lowest moments as a corruption fighter came about two years ago when her son told her not to visit his boarding school. Obumneme Akunyili, age 13, did not want anyone to know that she was his mother.
 It was not out of shame. Since becoming Nigeria's top food and drug regulator in 2001, his mother had broken the back of an illicit trade that had flooded Nigeria with fake medicines. She had taken on importers, distributors and an array of officials willing to risk Nigerian lives for a bribe. 
 But her son feared what might happen should her enemies track him down. So he told everyone that his mother was an aunt. 
 ''That caused me a lot of pain,'' Mrs. Akunyili said. ''He denied I was his mother. But the young boy saw the danger.'' 
 In Nigeria, even children understand corruption's menace. Increasingly, so do the donors that have poured more than $300 billion into African nations since 1980 -- and watched too much of it vanish into a sinkhole of fraud, malfeasance and waste.
 Now the efforts of reformers like Mrs. Akunyili are being scrutinized at meetings where donor countries consider aid to Africa, as leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations will do this week at Gleneagles, Scotland.
 The summit meeting has been billed as a turning point for Africa, where the billions have begun to flow again. Foreign aid to the continent reached a 17-year low in 1999, but in May, the richest nations agreed to write off $40 billion in loans owed by the world's 18 poorest countries, all but four of them in Africa.
 No African nation points up the challenge quite like Nigeria, a country that is both hampered by corruption and trying to control it. Awash in oil and gas that has flooded its treasury with $300 billion in the past 20 to 30 years, Nigeria remains utterly destitute, in no small part because of waste and graft. Officials like Mrs. Akunyili have scored some victories, but few corrupt officials have been convicted and millions of aid dollars still go astray. So donors are confronted with the question in Nigeria, as in much of Africa, of how much improvement is enough. 
 Corruption has not only robbed Africa of money to help lift some of the world's poorest people out of poverty. Around the world, it has also stalled economic development and tarnishes people's faith in government and, often, democracy itself. 
 The host of the summit meeting, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, wants to double global aid to Africa to $50 billion a year by 2010. Although he appears unlikely to reach that goal, aid is clearly on the rise: both the European Union and the United States propose to double their assistance during that period because African nations are lagging further behind their industrialized counterparts and richer nations fear that failed states can become breeding grounds for terrorism. 
 And while the United States devotes less of its wealth to foreign aid than the other nations at the talks, it has already tripled aid to Africa since 2000.
 But this new giving is increasingly dependent on proof that its recipients are controlling corruption and governing wisely. Mr. Blair's Commission for Africa, which he established last year, concluded in a report in March that ''without progress in governance,'' including tackling corruption, ''all other reforms will have limited impact.''
 The United States has been even more blunt: ''Countries like ours are not going to want to give aid to countries that are corrupt or don't hold true to democratic principles,'' President Bush said last month after meeting with South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki.
 That this tough-love approach is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom is one measure of the turnabout in the approach to foreign aid since the cold war, when both sides showered cash on African allies with scant regard to how much was stolen or wasted. 
 Still, how high to set the good-governance bar -- and deciding who clears it -- is in the eye of the donor. Jeffrey D. Sachs, a Columbia University economist who wrote a December 2004 report to the United Nations on fighting poverty, said that at least two dozen poor nations, many in Africa, are well-enough run to manage a rapid infusion of aid. The Bush administration's Millennium Challenge Account, set up last year to promote economic growth in poor countries, says just seven impoverished African nations qualify, with another six on the verge.
 There is ample fodder for pessimists and optimists alike. On the positive side, a growing number of African nations are edging away from crime and autocracy toward democracy and openness. Ghana, which marked its first peaceful democratic transfer of power in 2000, is often cited as a regional model of reform. Tanzania's president, Benjamin Mkapa, claims that an anticorruption campaign has led to a four-fold increase in government revenue in the decade since the nation's first multiparty elections. Zambia is trying its former president, Frederick Chiluba, for stealing $488,000 in state funds -- even though he handpicked the successor whose government has charged him.

Crucial Role for Donors
 Yet a May study by the World Bank found that between 1996 and 2004, the quality of governance deteriorated in as many African countries as it improved.
 Kenya is a painful illustration: a government ushered in two years ago on an anticorruption platform saw its widely respected anticorruption czar quit in frustration in February, apparently because his work was thwarted. The United States and Germany quickly withdrew nearly $10 million in aid. 
 Whether the new wave of African aid avoids the pitfalls of the past depends not just on its recipients, development specialists say, but also on the donors, who have often pushed poorly devised projects, refused to coordinate their efforts or demands with one another and failed to monitor the impact of their largesse.
 Foreign aid must be tied to teaching poor nations how to build accountability into their governments, development specialists contend. In some countries, it is not even clear whether the executive branch or the parliament controls the budget, said Steven Radelet, a senior fellow for the Washington-based Center for Global Development. He warned, however, that such improvements typically require generations to take root.
 Nigeria is one of many nations where aid has been wasted, or simply stolen. Lagos, home to 15 million of Nigeria's 137 million people, is among the world's most troubled cities, replete with open sewers, foul tap water, garbage-strewn roads and traffic that perennially seems at a standstill.
 Not including World Bank loans, which in some years totaled as much as $1 billion, Nigeria took in $3.5 billion in aid from 1980 to 2000. That was a few hundred million less than Sani Abacha has been accused in news reports of stealing in the five years he ruled Nigeria as a military dictator before his death in 1998. Dismayed, donors pulled back or out. Aid in 1999 totaled half the 1990 level.
 Later audits disclosed scores of botched projects financed with hundreds of millions of dollars in international loans. Nigeria's government never even cleared the site for an $18 million construction project. Millions were spent on paper mills that never produced any paper. Eighteen projects costing $836 million were never completed; another 44 either never operated or were quickly shut down, the Nigerian Finance Ministry reported. Of 20 other projects started between 1985 and 1992, more than half had little impact or were unsustainable, the World Bank concluded.
 But with the 1999 election of Olusegun Obasanjo, donors' enthusiasm reawakened. Mr. Obasanjo's anticorruption credentials seemed impeccable: he helped found Transparency International, an anticorruption group, and strongly backed a program by African leaders to review each other's adherence to democracy and good governance. Since his election, aid to Nigeria has doubled. 
 Yet Mr. Obasanjo's first term ended with little progress. ''He wanted a second term, and he believed that if he took the anticorruption war too seriously, they would make sure he didn't get a second term,'' Jibirin Ibrahim, a political scientist and director of Global Rights, a Nigerian pro-democracy group, said of corrupt officials. ''Which was a strategic mistake, because these people were able to further entrench themselves in the system.''
 Now, with two years left in his second term, Mr. Obasanjo's crusade appears to have regained steam. In recent months, his education minister was arrested for bribing legislators. His housing minister was fired for selling government property at cut-rate prices. And the police inspector general was led away in handcuffs on charges of money-laundering. 
 Some early initiatives also appear to be bearing fruit. Oby Ezekwesili, a senior aide to the president, said the government had saved $1.3 billion since the start of 2003 by insisting on competitive bidding in awarding contracts. 
 But the list of unfinished business is formidable, including removing the constitutional guarantee of immunity for the nation's most senior officials and opening government records to the public.

Bribes and Bottlenecks
 Other obstacles remain. 
 Although Mr. Obasanjo's first act as president was to establish an anticorruption commission, the office has secured just two corruption-related convictions among the 85 people it has charged in its five years. 
 Mustapha Akanbi, a retired judge who heads the commission, said he suspected that some judges have been paid off to toss out cases. 
 Government officials have also resisted change. 
 After investigators uncovered bribes to a hospital medical director, Mr. Akanbi said, the health minister refused to fire him until Mr. Akanbi complained personally to the president. ''Every single step you take, there are bottlenecks,'' said Mike Sowe, the commission's spokesman.
 When Mrs. Akunyili took over as director of Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration four years ago, perhaps four-fifths of her agency's regulators were corrupt, she said in a recent interview. Even worse, two in three drugs sold publicly were either unregistered or unsafe for consumers. 
 Mrs. Akunyili knew the danger well: her sister, Vivian, a diabetic, died in 1988 after what she believes was an injection of fake insulin. 
 Every few weeks, Mrs. Akunyili's agency made a show of burning heaps of fake drugs collected at airports, seaports, illegal factories and distributing houses. A spot check last year showed the impact: only one in eight drugs was unregistered. Major pharmaceutical companies have now returned to Nigeria, and other African nations have agreed to lift their bans on Nigeria's drugs. 
 Doctors were among the most grateful. ''We know the drugs are real now, because the patients don't come back with the same symptoms,'' said Sister Josephine Ngama, a senior doctor at Ancilla Catholic Hospital on the outskirts of Lagos. ''People had been trading in these fake drugs for years.''

Honored and Imperiled
 Mrs. Akunyili has been showered with awards, but her family is pressing her to quit. 
 Seven months after she took office, 10 armed men invaded her home, leaving only after learning that she was not there. 
 In December 2003, armed gunmen attacked her car. A driver in a nearby bus was killed. One bullet went through Mrs. Akunyili's blue headdress, grazing her skull. 
 ''It's like a war,'' she said. ''They are fighting back.'' 
 Reformers like Mr. Akunyili stand out partly because they are so rare. 
 ''Hopefully, they are going to do enough good that people are going to be attracted to them,'' said Victoria Kwakwa, the lead economist for the World Bank here. ''It is going to have to start with small groups, because you don't have the base. If you did, you wouldn't have gotten to this point to begin with.''

HEADLINE: Gulf Storm Worries Market; Oil Revisits $60 and Backs Off

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5 

 BODY:
Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, briefly exceeding $60 a barrel -- a level economists describe as worrisome for global growth. Energy traders said a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico was the leading factor behind the rally.
 After reaching as high as $60.10 a barrel, light crude oil for August delivery settled 84 cents higher, at $59.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The storm, code-named Cindy, is not expected to disrupt supply significantly or do any damage, but general anxiety about the hurricane season is ''causing a little bit of pressure in the market,'' said Carl Larry, an oil analyst at Barclays Capital in New York.
 Another reason that crude oil prices are moving higher at the start of the third quarter, Mr. Larry said, is that institutional investors who had taken profits in May and June are now buying energy futures again. ''That's the speculative interest in the market,'' he said.
 In spite of traders' nervousness about potential supply disruptions, analysts and brokers say there is plenty of oil and gasoline to meet demand for the time being.
 The Minerals Management Service said Tuesday that an evacuation of some rigs and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico had resulted in the loss of almost 50,000 barrels of oil a day, roughly 3 percent of daily production of 1.5 million barrels.
 Mark Bugg, scheduling manager at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, said strong waves and wind suspended the offloading of a tanker offshore, but that its onshore terminals continued to supply refineries with petroleum. Mr. Bugg said that based on current weather forecasts, he expected the offshore installation to be up and running by late Wednesday.
 Crude oil futures are almost 50 percent above the level a year ago. The average retail price of regular gasoline in the United States is now $2.23 a gallon, and consumption is continuing to rise.

TRACK AND FIELD
Isinbayeva Breaks Own Pole-Vault Mark
 Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia broke her world record in the women's pole vault yesterday, clearing 16 feet 2 inches at the Athletissima Grand Prix meet in Lausanne, Switzerland. Isinbayeva, the Olympic champion, set the previous record of 16-1 3/4 last September.
 In other events, Ronald Pognon of France defeated Justin Gatlin, the Olympic champion, to win the men's 100 meters; Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas ran a season-best 10.84 seconds in the women's 100; and Jeremy Wariner won the 400 in 44.96.
 Pognon won in 9.99 -- the first time he has run under 10 seconds. Aziz Zakari of Ghana was second in 10.02 and Gatlin was third in 10.03.
 Gatlin, who said his left leg felt tight, has a scheduled showdown Asafa Powell, the world-record holder, in Rome on Friday.

GOLF
Ames Wins Skins Title
 Stephen Ames took five skins yesterday to win the Canadian Skins Game title. Jack Nicklaus finished second, followed by John Daly and Vijay Singh in the two-day competition at Nicklaus North golf course. Ames, a Canadian, collected $92,443 for a two-day total of $120,578.
 Nicklaus matched his first-day total with a tap-in birdie worth $48,231 on the first hole of the back nine. Playing under steady rain on the back nine of a course he designed in 1995, Nicklaus totaled six skins and $96,462.
 Daly, who just missed an ace on the 210-yard 17th, was third with a two-day total of $52,250. Singh, the PGA Tour money leader, was shut out for the second consecutive day. 

PRO FOOTBALL
Incentive for Saints
 The state of Louisiana handed the New Orleans Saints a check for $12,415,267.53 yesterday, its annual multimillion-dollar payment to keep the team there, a Superdome official said.
 Under a 10-year, $186 million agreement negotiated by former Gov. Mike Foster's administration in 2001, the state makes annual payments to the Saints. Gov. Kathleen Blanco has been trying to renegotiate the agreement but has agreed to make the payments.
 The state struggled to pay the Saints in past years and has yet to repay a loan from an economic development fund to make its 2004 payment. 

PRO BASKETBALL
Liberty Ends Skid
 Vickie Johnson scored 18 points to help the visiting Liberty break a three-game losing streak with a 67-55 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks last night.
 Becky Hammon added 12 points and tied a career high with 10 assists for the Liberty (6-7).
 Los Angeles's Chamique Holdsclaw, the W.N.B.A.'s leading scorer, missed seven of her first eight shots and finished with 10 points. 

ALL-STAR RESERVES -- Lisa Leslie and Chamique Holdsclaw of the Los Angeles Sparks, and the Connecticut Sun's Nykesha Sales were each selected yesterday to their sixth W.N.B.A. All-Star Game.

HEADLINE: Iowa Cuts Added Costs In Title Insurance Policies

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: DES MOINES 

 BODY:
When Rae Ann Dankovic bought a sprawling town house in the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny early in June, she paid $624 for Iowa's equivalent of title insurance.
 Title insurance, which is intended to provide protection against any disputes that may arise over ownership of property, is one of many required costs faced by home buyers. It is an expense that has come under increasing scrutiny as regulators in California and Colorado investigate whether buyers have been overcharged for the insurance.
 Some of the biggest title insurers, the regulators say, were paying as much as half of the policy premium for referrals of customers, suggesting that title insurance might be overpriced in much of the country. 
 In Iowa, though, title insurance costs are often 20 to 30 percent lower, sometimes even more, than average nationwide. The state banned conventional title insurance in 1947 after the collapse of insurers in Sioux City, and it instead offers an equivalent called title guarantee. 
 Ms. Dankovic, 37, a lawyer who moved here from Columbus, Ohio, to work for a property casualty insurance company, would most likely have paid somewhere around $784 for title insurance for a similar home elsewhere in the country, based on rates provided by the American Land Title Association, the industry trade group. 
 Title insurers say there are many variables that make a direct comparison difficult. But the Iowa experience with title insurance underlines questions that have been raised about its cost in the wake of state regulatory investigations. Indeed, about a dozen other states, including New York, have now begun inquiries of their own. 
 The title insurers have stopped the payments for referrals, which they contend involved only a small part of their business. One big insurer, the First American Corporation, has started to pay $24 million in compensation to customers in eight states. Two others, Fidelity National Financial and LandAmerica, are in settlement talks with the regulators in Colorado and California. 
 All three companies said they believed that they had done nothing wrong and that they thought that the payments, which they described as part of reinsurance or risk-sharing arrangements, were permissible. 
 Regulators are not arguing that other states adopt Iowa's system. But John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner in California, said the Iowa system showed that coverage could be provided at lower cost. ''The title insurance business model operates with large amount of unnecessary expense,'' Mr. Garamendi said. ''They give away vast amounts of money in marketing to Realtors and others, and that creates inefficiency in the system.''
 Iowa does keep its expenses down. In other states, the biggest expense for title insurers is commission for their agents. The agents get about 85 percent of the premium on a policy compared with an average of about 10 percent for agents selling auto and home insurance. Title insurance agents not only sell policies but also search real estate and other legal records before policies are issued. 
 In the Iowa system, though, there are no title insurance agents and therefore no agent commissions. There is also very little spending on marketing. In Iowa, firms specializing in real estate research check property records, and their work is reviewed by a lawyer. The firm and the lawyer each receive a fee. Then, for another fee, the state issues a certificate that serves as title insurance. The three components are the equivalent of title insurance in most states and together are generally less expensive. 
 ''We're lower than just about any other state and, in some cases shockingly so,'' said Loyd W. Ogle, director of the Iowa title guarantee division in his office here. Mr. Ogle contends that the title search process in Iowa is more thorough and that this contributes to lower claims.
 Some title insurers say they think that prices may be lower in Iowa at least partly because of a lower cost of living and a lower incidence of fraud. But they also say there may be some savings on expenses in their business that can be passed on to home buyers.
 For several years, title insurers have been trying to persuade the Iowa Legislature to permit them to set up offices in the state, and meantime they have been increasingly selling policies from out of state for transactions conducted by national banks and mortgage brokers.
 Sometimes the title insurers match the Iowa price, sometimes they sell for less, as they try to expand their foothold, Mr. Ogle said. The law is not clear on the out-of-state sales, he said, and no action has been taken against any title insurer.
 Title insurance is intended to pay off a mortgage should a dispute arise over ownership or use of a property. But claims are rare and real estate experts say they are often resolved for a few thousand dollars. Title insurers typically pay about 4 cents of every dollar of premiums for claims, according to Demotech, an industry tracking firm in Columbus, Ohio, compared with payouts of about 80 cents on the dollar by auto and home insurers. 
 Even though sales jumped to $15.2 billion last year amid the housing boom from $7.2 billion five years ago, title insurance remains a tiny niche of the insurance business. The business is dominated by five companies that have 90 percent of the market. 
 The title insurers say they believe that their policies are appropriately priced. But two of them, First American and LandAmerica, are reducing prices on many refinancing transactions in California and are considering similar reductions in other states. ''We're doing it because it's good business and because it's consistent with the desires of the insurance departments,'' said Theodore L. Chandler Jr., the chief executive of LandAmerica.
 Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center for Economic Justice, a consumer advocacy group in Austin, Tex., said that competition among title insurers was not for home buyers but for agents, and that agents competed for referrals from home builders, mortgage lenders and real estate companies. 
 ''They don't compete for the ultimate buyer,'' Mr. Birnbaum said. ''The title insurers don't lower their rates. They take the extra premium and compete for business.''
 Home buyers are often barely aware of title insurance. Mortgage lenders arrange for the coverage to protect their loans and require the buyer to pay for it as a condition of getting the loan. The charges are routinely listed on closing statements, but lenders rarely call attention to them and the home buyer tends to focus on the much larger purchase price of the house. 
 David Shogren, a Methodist minister in Urbandale, outside Des Moines, and his wife, Cherry, a nursing manager at a local hospital, said they were not aware until later that they had bought Iowa's form of title insurance. 
 ''You're signing so many documents in quick succession,'' Mr. Shogren said as he was moving into their new three-bedroom house. ''I basically just trusted them,'' he said, referring to the lawyers, bankers and real estate agents at his closing. 
 Ms. Dankovic, the lawyer and town house buyer, said her closing went smoothly, but added, ''I didn't have any options, they just laid it out for me.''

HEADLINE: Risky Mortgage Business

 BODY:
By any measure, the housing boom -- now almost four years old -- is one for the record books. A recent study by The Wall Street Journal found that in 55 places, housing prices had risen by at least 30 percent in three years, after inflation. Together, those 55 markets now account for an unprecedented 40 percent of all housing value in the United States. 
 What makes this boom particularly unnerving is that it owes much of its longevity to the explosion in the number of risky mortgages. Many borrowers are likely to be pinched, if not creamed, when interest rates rise or housing cools, leaving them unable to make payments, refinance on favorable terms or sell at a profit. Lenders may be even more vulnerable than borrowers, which may mean an economywide disruption if -- or when -- housing prices stagnate or decline. 
 The traditional mortgage -- 20 percent down with a fixed interest rate -- is being eclipsed by loans with low down payments or none at all, many with adjustable interest rates. These inherently risky mortgages are now routinely offered with features that allow a borrower to pay only the interest due for an extended period, or, even more dicey, with the ''option'' to pay less than the interest due each month while adding the unpaid portion to the loan balance. One-fourth of all home buyers -- including 42 percent of first-time buyers -- made no down payment in 2004, according to the National Association of Realtors. Nearly one-third of all new mortgages this year call for interest-only payments (in California, it's almost half), according to Loan Performance, a mortgage data firm.
 Another risky aspect of these sorts of mortgages is that they attract relatively hard-pressed borrowers. Egged on by lenders where mortgage-making has been the one consistent profit center, they tend to be people who can't afford a traditional fixed-rate loan -- even at the current low rates.
 It's a safe bet that lenders wouldn't be so freewheeling if they had to worry about being paid back in full. But it's unusual for lenders to bear the entire risk of the loans they make: they sell many mortgages to private investment banks, which slice and dice them into various securities -- an interest-only portion, say, and a principal-only portion. Those securities are then sold to other investors, like mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, European insurance companies and the central bank of China, to name a few. Investors now hold $4.6 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. That's more than the outstanding value of United States Treasuries. 
 So far, the mortgage-backed market has generated cash and profits galore. Someday, however, someone will lose money. No one knows who, when or how much because housing has never been so frothy, risky mortgages so ubiquitous or the market in which they trade so vast. Also unknowable is the quality of lenders' and investors' hedges, the complex investing strategies that are supposed to cover losses in the event of turmoil, like a default-inducing spike in interest rates. Many of the players in this market are not subject to government regulation, and those that are haven't exactly been under the microscope. Last May, federal banking regulators announced that they planned to issue new guidelines for mortgage lenders -- as soon as early next year. 
 The lack of transparency, meanwhile, is a growing risk in its own right. Lenders and investors know they are interdependent, but they don't know which ones may be a weak link or which may be left holding the bag when economic conditions change. Such uncertainty could make lenders skittish about giving mortgages to either good or bad borrowers. 
 The rates on half of all adjustable-rate mortgages reset within three years of being issued, suggesting that trouble may be just around the corner. It's high time for Congress to focus on the implications for the entire economy of boom-time mortgage lending -- and for regulators to pay more attention.

HEADLINE: Big British Grocery Chain to Cut 1,400 Jobs

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: LONDON, July 5 

 BODY:
Asda, the second-biggest grocery chain in Britain, plans to eliminate 1,400 jobs and use the savings to reduce prices in an effort to win back business from Tesco, the market leader.
 Asda, a unit of Wal-Mart Stores, will cut 200 jobs at its headquarters, or 10 percent of the staff there, and 1,200 store positions, Andy Bond, chief of Asda, said Tuesday in an interview. Asda, based in Leeds, England, has about 140,000 workers in Britain. 
Mr. Bond, who became chief executive in March, said Asda's performance had been below expectations. The company's share of the $202 billion British grocery market fell to 16.4 percent in the three months ended June 19, from 16.5 percent a year earlier, according to the market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 Tesco's share rose to 30.3 percent from 27.9 percent.
 ''They are losing market share, and how do you compete on market share in the supermarket business?'' said Don Gher, chief investment officer at Coldstream Capital Management, which is based in Bellevue, Wash., and manages $650 million, including Wal-Mart shares. ''You have to compete on price and service. They are going to cut jobs and invest in lower prices.''
 Asda had sales of $:14.4 billion ($25.3 billion) in 2003, the most recent annual figure available. Tesco's were $:31 billion in the year that ended in February. Asda accounts for about 50 percent of Wal-Mart's sales outside the United States and 10 percent of total sales, $285.2 billion in 2004.
 Mr. Bond said Asda would use the money saved by eliminating jobs to make even deeper cuts in retail prices. He said the chain took $:230 million in price cuts in the last year, compared with Tesco's total of $:147 million.
 Tesco, though, has expanded more quickly into nonfood areas like financial services and car insurance and it introduced its Finest brand line of food to attract a broader range of customers in 1998, four years before Asda started selling its Extra Special line of premium goods. 
 ''Asda missed the boat completely on broadening its food range, and now it's struggling to attract the wealthier customer, which Tesco enjoys serving,'' said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Planet Retail in London.
 Mr. Bond, who succeeded Tony DeNunzio as Asda's chief executive in March, declined to say by how much he would trim costs or which headquarters departments would lose workers. He also declined to say when the workers would be laid off.

HEADLINE: Florida's Zeal Against Castro Is Losing Heat

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Terry Aguayo contributed reporting from Miami for this article.

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 5 

 BODY:
Fidel Castro is not dead, but he has haunted Miami for nearly 50 years. This is a city where newscasters still scrutinize Mr. Castro's health and workers conduct emergency drills to prepare for the chaos expected upon his demise. Spy shops still flourish here, and a store on Calle Ocho does brisk business in reprints of the Havana phone book from 1959, the year he seized power.
 But if Mr. Castro's grip on Cuban Miami remains strong, the fixation is expressed differently these days. The monolithic stridency that once defined the exile community has faded. There is less consensus on how to fight Mr. Castro and even, as Cuban-Americans grow more politically and economically diverse, less intensity of purpose. Some call it shrewd pragmatism, others call it fatigue. 
 In May, Luis Posada Carriles, a militant anti-Castro fighter from the cold war era, was arrested here on charges of entering the country illegally and was imprisoned in El Paso, where he awaits federal trial. Barely anyone in Miami protested, even though many Cuban-Americans consider Mr. Posada, 77, to be a hero who deserves asylum. 
 A month earlier, two milestones -- the 25th anniversary of the Mariel boatlift, which brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States and transformed Miami, and the fifth anniversary of the seizure of Elian Gonzalez -- passed almost quietly. 
 When a Miami Herald columnist went to Cuba in June and filed dispatches critical of Mr. Posada, who is suspected in a deadly airline bombing and other violent attacks, indignant letters to the editor were the only protest. In the past, Cuban-Americans boycotted The Herald and smeared feces on its vending boxes to protest what they considered pro-Castro coverage. 
 This city where raucous demonstrations by exiles were once as regular as summer storms has seen few lately. One theory is that the people whose life's mission was to defeat Mr. Castro and return to the island one day -- those who fled here in the early years of his taking power -- have grown old and weary.
 ''We are all exhausted from so much struggle,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the Democracy Movement, an exile organization that once ran flotillas to the waters off Cuba to protest human-rights abuses. Mr. Sanchez, 50, also belonged to Alpha 66, an exile paramilitary group that trained in the Everglades, mostly in the 1960's and 70's, for an armed invasion of Cuba, and later protested around the clock outside Elian Gonzalez's house. Now, he said, he prefers less attention-grabbing tactics, quietly supporting dissidents on the island from an office above a Laundromat. 
 The subtler approach is gaining favor. Cuban-Americans have grown more politically aware since the Elian Gonzalez episode, many say, when their fervor to thwart the Clinton administration and the boy's return to his father in Cuba drew national contempt. Americans who had paid little attention to the policy debate over Cuba tended to support sending Elian home, polls showed, and were put off by images of exiles blocking traffic and flying American flags upside down in protest. 
 ''Elian Gonzalez was a great lesson, a brutal lesson,'' said Joe Garcia, the former executive director of the Cuban-American National Foundation, a once belligerent but now more measured exile group. ''It woke us up.'' 
 Mayor Manny Diaz, a Cuban-American whose political career took off after he served as a lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives, said he decided afterward it was more important to heal the wounds in Miami than to criticize the Castro government. Mr. Diaz did not mention Cuba in his State of the City speech this spring -- an absence the local alternative newspaper called ''downright revolutionary.'' In fact, Mr. Diaz said he had never used Mr. Castro's name to rouse support.
 ''I wish he'd get run over by an 18-wheeler tomorrow,'' Mr. Diaz said of Mr. Castro. ''But as mayor, I'm supposed to fix your streets and your parks and your potholes.''
 Also revolutionary is that Cuban-Americans, solidly Republican since President John F. Kennedy's decision not to support the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, are reconsidering their allegiance. Most still stand by President Bush, which helps explain their silence after the arrest of Mr. Posada. Yet they also say Mr. Bush has repeatedly let them down.
 He has continued the ''wet foot, dry foot'' policy that President Bill Clinton adopted, letting Cuban refugees who make it to shore remain in this country but sending back those stopped at sea. Mr. Bush also adopted new restrictions last year on visiting and sending money to relatives in Cuba, which all but the most hard-line exiles say hurts Cuban families more than Mr. Castro.
 More recently, the Bush administration discussed reassigning to Iraq a special military plane it bought to help broadcast TV and Radio Marti in Cuba, a priority of exile groups. 
 ''The Cuban-American community helped elect this guy,'' Mr. Garcia said, ''and even then Cuban-Americans get short shrift.''
 Mr. Garcia made waves last fall by resigning from the Cuban American National Foundation to join a Democratic advocacy group. Jose Basulto, the leader of Brothers to the Rescue, a group that flew over the Florida Strait in the 1990's seeking rafters in distress, held a news conference in 2003 to announce that he was abandoning the Republican Party. 
 But while Mr. Garcia, 41, has severed ties with the Bush White House, Mr. Basulto, 64, has hope. His new goal is the indictment of Mr. Castro's brother and chosen successor, Raul Castro, for drug trafficking or for the 1996 shooting down of two Brothers to the Rescue planes by Cuban fighters, in which four men were killed.
 Mr. Basulto announced in May that he was offering $1 million for information that could lead to the indictment. So far, he said, he has received no word from Washington. 
 ''The United States is duty bound, duty bound, to act in bringing justice for these guys,'' Mr. Basulto said, speaking of the downed pilots. Like other outspoken exiles, he questions the administration's ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq before Mr. Castro. 
 ''We don't want to see a double standard,'' he said. ''We don't want to see democracy in Iraq and not in Cuba. We are owed that much.''
 His frustration was echoed by Miguel Saavedra, the leader of Vigilia Mambisa, a hard-line exile group. Mr. Saavedra said some exiles had been discouraging protests for fear of antagonizing the White House -- but not his faction. 
 ''We're not calming down,'' he said. ''We're not tired. We haven't surrendered.''
 But when Vigilia Mambisa tried to rally support for Mr. Posada in May at the revered Cuban restaurant Versailles in Little Havana, and at the Torch of Friendship, a downtown monument, only a few dozen people showed up. Their shouts could not pierce the buzz of traffic. 
 The eclipse of the old exile passions is looming in a more literal way down the street from the Torch of Friendship, at the Freedom Tower, an elegant yellow beacon where more than half a million Cuban refugees were processed in the early years of the Castro government. 
 The family of Jorge Mas Canosa, the founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, once had plans to spend $40 million restoring the building as a museum of the exile experience. The tower's new owner is Pedro Martin, a Cuban-American who remembers going there in the 1960's to pick up food for his family. 
 The museum is still in the works, but Mr. Martin's larger plan is to erect a 62-story condominium building around it, all but making the Freedom Tower 
vanish from the Miami skyline.

HEADLINE: Israelis in Gaza: Departure Is Certain, Details Are Not

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 5 

 BODY:
After her trip here last month, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced to much fanfare on June 19 that Israel and the Palestinians had agreed to demolish the 1,600 or so houses of Israel's settlements in Gaza, with the Palestinians to be paid to clear away the rubble.
 But a senior Israeli official says that there is no such agreement, that his government has yet to decide whether to demolish the houses and that the Israelis and the Palestinians continue to disagree over what might happen to the rubble. 
 More likely, he said, given the political sensitivity of the issue, Israel will simply avoid making a decision and leave the houses. Ms. Rice, he said, may have been misinformed by overeager officials, and what started as a hazy agreement in principle is foundering over specifics. 
 Sean McCormick, a State Department spokesman, responded on Tuesday, saying in a telephone interview: ''The agreement on the principles announced by the secretary stands. I understand the two sides are working on the details of implementing the agreement.'' 
 The confusion over the houses is a prime example of the crucial decisions left unmade only six weeks before Israel is to pull nearly 9,000 settlers out of Gaza and 600 out of four small settlements in the northern West Bank. It also shows the need for a strong United States presence in the negotiations that is currently missing, critics of the Bush administration say.
 Muhammad Dahlan, the Palestinian minister in charge of coordinating the civilian side of the disengagement, is both angry and astonished. ''With 45 days to go, we can't get an answer from the Israelis on any serious question,'' he said in an interview on Saturday in his Gaza City office. ''They say they want to coordinate, but to every question we ask, we cannot get an answer.''
 The senior Israeli official, when told about Mr. Dahlan's complaint, said simply, ''He's right.'' The Israeli military and civilian bureaucracy, trying to balance security and openness, between leaving Gaza entirely and trying to maintain customs and security control over its boundaries, has been busily debating issues while the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon itself is split, he said.
 ''There is a real tension between our desire to control and our desire not to be responsible for Gaza,'' the official said.
 The official, who is involved in supervising all aspects of the Gaza withdrawal, agreed to speak freely only if he was not identified , because of the extreme sensitivity of the negotiations. 
 He has a list of some 10 major undecided issues about the withdrawal, including Mr. Dahlan's urgent questions about how Palestinian workers and Palestinian products, both manufactured and agricultural, will be able to move in good time between Gaza and Egypt and Gaza and Israel, and therefore to the West Bank and the rest of the world.
 In the end, he said, ''we'll do it in the Israeli way.''
 ''You make a decision today because you have to, when all the minor problems build up to a huge problem that you can muster the political weight to try to solve.'' Some decisions are urgent; others can wait.
 Mr. Dahlan, speaking of a radical Islamic group that combines militancy and politics, said: ''If the United States and the Israelis don't move more quickly, this will be a failed experiment in Gaza, and Hamas will pick up the pieces. Sharon seems to want chaos in Gaza. The Americans should be here in this time, working to bring people together.''
 That is a judgment shared by two former American officials, Dennis B. Ross and Martin S. Indyk, who remain involved in American-Israeli relations.
 James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president, is working to coordinate the economic side, and Lt. Gen. William E. Ward has been appointed by Washington to help the Palestinians improve and coordinate their security services. 
 ''But who is pushing the overall political coordination to make sure it gets done?'' asked Mr. Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel and now director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. ''Both sides are wrapped up in internal politics, and a high-level American adviser should be here to help.''
 The combination of Israeli politics and Palestinian disorganization, especially on the security side, is threatening the success of a coordinated Gaza handover, both he and Mr. Ross said. 
 There is a real risk now that the possibility of handing over Israeli greenhouses to the Palestinians as a working business will be lost, Mr. Ross said, adding, ''Those could provide 15,000 jobs for Palestinians.''
 Some settlers, in the absence of any decisions, are dismantling their greenhouses. But in any event, it is not clear how perishable agricultural products from those greenhouses can be moved quickly out of Gaza to markets the Israeli settlers have established in Europe.
 No goods can be shipped directly from Gaza, which lacks an airport or seaport. The ideal route is the current one, through Israel, which raises security questions. Specifically, how can Israel quickly inspect the goods for security, to ensure there are no explosive devices or ammunition being smuggled into Israel or the West Bank? There is no Israeli consensus on how to change the current system -- every Palestinian truck unloaded by hand, and the inspected goods then loaded onto an Israeli truck -- to one where containers travel unopened ''door to door.''
 That is one of the key issues embedded in the larger problem of the connection between Gaza and the West Bank for people and goods. Mr. Dahlan wants a ''safe passage,'' a strip of Israeli territory connecting the two. The Israelis are reluctant to grant territory now, without negotiation over territorial compensation, and they are nervous about security. They have offered to build the Palestinians a railroad between northern Gaza and Hebron, but the Palestinians also want a roadway. Mr. Wolfensohn has proposed a cheaper ''sunken road,'' a roofless tunnel at least 15 yards deep that can also be walled to ensure that no Palestinians can leave the road in Israel.
 But there has been no Israeli decision about the road, which could take three years to build. In the meantime, both sides are talking about Israeli-guarded convoys of Palestinian vehicles, equipped with tracking devices, that could travel on existing roads, mostly at night, and would represent a temporary solution. 
 Nor, say officials of both sides, is there agreement on how Israel will inspect goods coming into Gaza from Egypt, in order to preserve the customs unity of Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. Who will be sovereign over Gaza after the Israeli military leaves and the occupation ends? Should civilian law apply? Should entry permits for Palestinian workers from Gaza be handed out by the Interior Ministry or still by the military? Should Israel allow Palestinians to immigrate to Gaza?
 In the northern West Bank, Israel still must decide how to treat the territory it is giving up, which is about the size of Gaza. Will it be handed over to Palestinian security control, and if so, under what legal status?
 Separately on Tuesday, Hamas confirmed that it would not participate in a Palestinian government before legislative elections, which were postponed and have not yet been rescheduled, and Israel said it was close to an agreement with Egypt on the stationing of 750 Egyptian border police along the Gaza border to help prevent smuggling. The presence of the Egyptians could help Israel decide to pull its army out of Gaza altogether and leave the international border by the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Facing Differences With Major Allies, Bush Arrives in Europe for Talks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Alan Cowell contributed reporting from Edinburgh for this article.

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN, July 5 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived Tuesday in Denmark, his first stop on a four-day European trip that even before it began seemed sure to show the United States at odds with many of the other big industrial nations on a variety of issues.
 It is the president's fourth trip to Europe since he began his second term in January, reflecting an effort by the White House to help address the tensions between the United States and its allies over Iraq. From Denmark, which he is visiting as a show of thanks for its commitment of troops to Iraq, Mr. Bush will fly on to the Gleneagles golf resort in Scotland on Wednesday for the annual summit meeting with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia. 
 There, Mr. Bush will confront an agenda, developed primarily by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, that has laid bare deep differences between the American administration and all or most of the other governments on hand when it comes to the best means of fighting global warming and attacking poverty and disease in Africa.
 Against the backdrop of unabated bloodshed in Iraq, the leaders are also expected to discuss how to nurture efforts to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians, with the European nations pressing for steps to assure stability and economic progress in Gaza as Israel withdraws from that territory this summer. And the leaders will review the attempt by Britain, France and Germany to negotiate with Iran to end that nation's nuclear program. 
 Despite the busy agenda, the policy rifts and the protests likely to greet the leaders in Scotland, Mr. Bush will make the trip with much of his attention still focused on the home front and his first Supreme Court nomination. 
 Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said aboard Air Force One en route here that Mr. Bush had spent part of the flight reviewing dossiers on some of at least a half-dozen candidates under consideration to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced Friday that she was retiring. 
 The leaders of the Group of 8 countries will meet here at a time of tension among them. Mr. Blair and President Jacques Chirac of France have been having an intense disagreement over the European Union's budget. The relationship between Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has shown signs of strain. And even Mr. Bush's most rock-solid foreign alliance, with Mr. Blair, appears to have found its limits on many of the issues to be taken up in Scotland.
 Under prodding from Mr. Blair, Mr. Bush has announced a series of steps in recent weeks to show that the United States supports doing more to alleviate poverty in Africa. 
 Just last week, Mr. Bush announced a new plan to fight malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. He has promised to do more to streamline his program for sending aid to Africa, the Millennium Challenge Account. And he points to a substantial increase in aid and a program to fight AIDS in Africa as concrete evidence of America's commitment to help the world's neediest people.
 But he has repeatedly refused to sign on to a commitment sought by many anti-poverty campaigners for the United States to increase aid to Africa to a specific level relative to total the size of the American economy. He has also rebuffed Mr. Blair and the leaders most other big industrial nations on proposals for reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, refusing to agree to any plan that includes numerical limits on those emissions, saying such an approach would be economically ruinous. 
 Meanwhile, the summit meeting's British hosts cautioned that the gathering may yield less than anti-poverty campaigners are expecting. 
 Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, provided a fresh indication that the world's most industrialized nations have not reached the kind of agreement on key issues like help for Africa and climate change that campaigners are demanding. 
 Interviewed on the BBC, Mr. Brown, a prominent advocate of measures to alleviate poverty in Africa, said he had told campaigners: ''I know that you will tell us we've got to do more. I know that what you will say is that what we can achieve is perhaps not good enough.''
 ''But we have got to bring the whole of the world together,'' he said. ''What Britain says is one thing; what we can persuade the rest of the world to do together is what we will get as the outcome of Gleneagles.'' Britain's caution drew a tart response from Sir Bob Geldof, the musician-turned-activist who organized huge rock concerts around the world last Saturday in support of his campaign to ease Africa's poverty by changing aid, trade and debt policies.
 ''I don't think the chancellor should try lowering the bar at this stage,'' Sir Bob said as he left London for Edinburgh by train along with campaigners from France, Georgia, Mali, Sierra Leone and Britain. ''We have come for victory. It has to happen now. Not to do it now would be grotesquely irresponsible. It is unacceptable for politicians to say 'prepare to be disappointed.'''
 Sir Bob has urged a million people to march on Edinburgh Wednesday in what he has called a ''Long Walk to Justice'' to bring pressure to bear on the leaders at the summit meeting. But street demonstrations here on Monday have already raised worries that protests could turn violent.
 Scottish police warned on Tuesday that officers would not tolerate unauthorized or violent protests. ''We will not flinch where we encounter such behavior and will deal with it in a robust and measured way,'' said Chief Constable John Vine.

HEADLINE: Wooing and Winning And Weight of Expectations

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE race is finally over. That ''New York 2012'' clock I've watched for the last year and a half on my mantel has counted down to zero. 
 After a grueling battle involving London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris for the right to play host to the 2012 Olympics, we will have a winner announced this morning. Critics who have monitored Olympic bid campaigns say they can't remember a race this combative and this unpredictable. 
Before she went to bed late last night, the I.O.C. member Anita DeFrantz said this was the first time she did not have a sense of which city had made the winning bid. 
 Paris had long been viewed as the front-runner to stage the 2012 Summer games. ''Nobody asked me what city was in the lead,'' DeFrantz said in a telephone interview from Singapore. ''I think the media just makes those decisions. I haven't been asked once.'' 
 So I asked who she thought was in the lead. ''I really couldn't tell you now,'' she said. ''Usually, at least for me, it's more clear-cut; this time, it is not.''
 DeFrantz did not think this bidding process was any more hotly contested than others. The difference, she said, was that for the first time New York was in the mix. 
 ''This is the first time New York has experienced the bid process,'' she said. ''It's always significant. It's always a big deal.'' 
 With all due respect to DeFrantz, who has been an I.O.C. member since 1986, the Pursuit of 2012 was a study in glitter. For all the talk about scaling back the Games, the 2012 race was driven by an unprecedented use of celebrity power. Famous athletes, politicians, and business tycoons genuflected before I.O.C. members.
 Paris had President Jacques Chirac of France and the movie producer Luc Besson; London had Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and the soccer star David Beckham; New York took Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Muhammad Ali; Madrid had Queen Sofia of Spain; and Moscow, Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov of Russia. 
 Ed Hula, the editor of the newsletter Around the Rings, has covered eight bidding campaigns. He said this was by far the most intense. ''These are cities that excel at public relations and self-promotion,'' he said of Paris, London and New York. ''They are the big guys in the world neighborhood. You don't get much bigger than these three cities.'' 
 The celebrity barrage made in the final days before the vote seemed more like something out of Oscar week, with celebrities parading in and out of hotels and chatting up I.O.C. members at receptions. 
 DeFrantz said that there was a unique twist to this 2012 bid. 
 In the past, I.O.C. members could visit potential host cities to meet with the bid committee. That is no longer allowed and the bid committees have to find other ways to get the I.O.C.'s attention.
 ''I know that it's different because the rules are different,'' DeFrantz said. ''But the deal is, we're the ones who vote, so you want to be able to make sure that the people who vote know what the city offers to the athlete, what it offers to the Olympic movement and how hosting the Games will affect the city.''
 There is, of course, a larger question. Why did these cities climb over one another to get these Games? There is little evidence to suggest that the Games solve long-term unemployment problems. Post-Olympic reports often show that host cities lose money and often wind up with herds of concrete white elephants. 
 ''Each city is different,'' DeFrantz said. ''Sydney wanted to prove that they could do it. For Athens, I think it was a little bit of the fact that this was their event and they hadn't been able to host it since 1896.''
 The truth is, everyone wants the Games because everyone wants a piece of Olympic booty. If you're Woody Johnson, the Jets' owner, you use the Games as a Trojan Horse to hide your real goal: a new football stadium. If you're Fred Wilpon, the Mets' principal owner, you want the Games to get you out of a dump called Shea Stadium and into a new baseball palace. If you're a developer, you're salivating at the chance to get an Olympic contract. 
 The British journalist Andrew Jennings has written three scathing critiques of the Olympic movement and the I.O.C. He co-wrote ''The Lords of the Rings'' and wrote ''The New Lords of the Rings'' and ''The Great American Swindle'' about the Salt Lake City scandal. 
 ''One of the frequently uniting factors of all these bids, for all these cities is a small group of people who wish to get richer than they already are or have jobs for even longer,'' Jennings said yesterday by telephone from England.
 ''Whichever city wins tomorrow -- there's seven years' work for that lot. The unifying factor is self-interest by property speculators.''
 In the wake of stricter guidelines, the new lobbying strategy was to wow the committee members with glamour and power. 
 I think we've stumbled on a new Olympic motto: 
 If you can't bribe 'em, seduce 'em.

HEADLINE: Africa in the Balance

 BODY:
Eight men are about to decide the future of hundreds of millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. The choices President Bush and his fellow leaders make this week in Scotland will help determine whether more than two million children under 5 will keep dying every year of diseases that can be easily and cheaply treated, whether 40 million young people will still be unable to go to school and whether 300 million Africans will continue to lack access to clean water. 
 A well-designed package of increased aid, further debt relief and trade fairness could strikingly reduce these shaming indices of extreme poverty at a very affordable cost. America's share of the $25 billion a year in additional aid for Africa sought by the British prime minister, Tony Blair -- weighted for national income -- comes out to less than $50 per person. But adding fairer trade to the package would actually leave taxpayers in wealthy countries better off than they are today because the rich world now pays more than $350 billion a year in agricultural subsidies. 
 In recent days Washington has announced welcome but largely unilateral aid initiatives and declined to join other countries in committing a fixed share of national income to development assistance. We hope that summit-meeting chemistry and Mr. Blair's bold exhortations will lead Mr. Bush to go further. New aid money will go furthest if it is committed for several years ahead so African countries can invest in training new health workers and teachers. Donors need to harmonize their aid efforts so the various conditions demanded by different donors do not work against one another. 
 A growing number of African countries now recognize that development also requires effective and accountable governance, financial transparency, and a welcoming environment for enterprise and investment. South Africa has been a leader in this area, and important steps have also been taken by Mozambique, Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda. Nigeria is finally starting to get serious about corruption. But these hopeful trends will produce results only if the rich world agrees to provide the financial support Africa cannot yet provide for itself. The point of this week's push for aid is not to create permanent dependency, but to unleash self-sustaining growth. Mr. Blair has provided more than his share of the needed leadership; Mr. Bush should at least supply America's share of the needed cash.

HEADLINE: Ireland's Economic Model

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 While Thomas L. Friedman may be correct that ''the Irish-British model is the way of the future'' (''Follow the Leapin' Leprechaun,'' column, July 1), it is unfortunate that to secure this economically prosperous future, a nation must sacrifice its identity.
 I spent six months studying in Cork, Ireland, and found myself increasingly disheartened. As I looked out over the ocean from the seaside village of Cobh, I felt an oppressive melancholy seeing the view sullied by a large number of foreign manufacturing plants. Gaelic, the native tongue, is dying everywhere but the west coast, which has been left out of much of the globalization.
 Although the ''bad old days'' of emigration and poverty are behind the Irish people, it saddens me that Mr. Friedman hopes that other countries will follow their model; that will certainly cost those countries much of their individuality, as it did the Irish.

HEADLINE: Rally on Wal-Mart Outlook Even as Oil Climbs Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
An improving sales outlook at Wal-Mart Stores sent stocks higher yesterday as investors, also cheered by a jump in factory orders, looked past another uptick in the price of oil.
 Wal-Mart raised its sales projection for June to the highest level since May 2004. That means ''2 percent of the economy is coming out and saying their sales are better than forecast,'' said John Lynch, the chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments in Boston.
 Investors also latched on to the strongest increase in factory orders in 14 months. Although most of the gain reflected demand for airplanes and parts, the data also indicated that orders may have been stronger in June than in May. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.36, or 0.66 percent, to 10,371.80.
 Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.55, or 0.88 percent, to 1,204.99, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 21.38, or 1 percent, to 2,078.75.
 Stocks may be helped by ''a developing consensus on Wall Street that the market is poised to have a better second half of the year,'' said Timothy G. Connors, the chief investment officer for value equities at Delaware Investments in Philadelphia. Investors are predicting the end of the Federal Reserve's yearlong run of interest rate increases and a move by international central banks to stop increasing interest rates, he said.
 Wal-Mart's news was particularly comforting to Wall Street because that retailer and other discounters had partly attributed sluggish sales gains to higher gas prices that limited consumers' ability to spend on items that are not necessities. The upbeat outlook allowed investors to shrug off oil's higher price. A barrel of light crude settled at $59.59, up 84 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Stocks fell in recent sessions as crude hit new highs, but some analysts said investors are putting too much emphasis on oil prices.
 ''Energy is 10 percent of business costs,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''Wages are a bigger concern; they're 70 percent of business costs.'' Investors who watch wages closely for signs that they are on the upswing are waiting for labor cost data in the second-quarter productivity report in late July.
 Wal-Mart was up $1.52, or 3.15 percent, to $49.80. Other retailers gained on the news: J.C. Penney rose 94 cents, to $54.05, and Gap rose 44 cents, to $20.26.
 Merck rose 4 cents, to $31.10, after a judge declined to postpone jury selection in the nation's first state-level wrongful death trial related to the painkiller Vioxx. 
 General Motors gained 12 cents, to $34.77, after saying it would extend its employee discounts offered to all buyers through Aug. 1. The incentives took G.M.'s June sales to their highest monthly level in 19 years.
 Ford Motor, which announced that it, too, would allow customers to buy vehicles at employee rates, finished up 9 cents at $10.40.
 DaimlerChrysler fell 38 cents, to $40.10, after the company denied rumors it would issue a profit warning for the second half of the year and said its Chrysler division would offer a similar deal to the G.M. discount. 
 The carpet and flooring company Mohawk Industries rose $5.30, to $87.50. Mohawk said Monday that it would pay $2.6 billion for Unilin Holding, a leading maker of laminate flooring based in Belgium. 
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 7/16, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.11 percent, from 4.05 percent on Friday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Costly Race Reaches Its Frenzied Finish 

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Wednesday, July 6 

 BODY:
With just hours to go before the final vote, New York's Olympic bid organizers unveiled their vision of the 2012 Games in a presentation that stressed the city's international flavor, its organizers' enthusiasm and the economic boost the Games would give the Olympic movement.
 The bid founder, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, nervously told the members of the International Olympic Committee the story of his Olympic dream, which began at a World Cup soccer match at the Meadowlands 11 years ago.
''We are a city that wraps its arms around you,'' Doctoroff said. ''When you score a perfect 10, the crowd will rise and cheer, no matter where you are from.''
 This was New York's last pitch before the 116-member I.O.C. chooses the 2012 Olympic city from among New York, Paris, London, Madrid and Moscow. 
 The New York bid videos included testimony from dozens of athletes, from the tennis star Serena Williams and the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard to the basketball legend Magic Johnson and the cycling champion Lance Armstrong, in describing the plans for the Olympic sites.
 President Bush appeared via video, as did former President Bill Clinton. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg emphasized that the new Olympic stadium plan had been approved.
 ''Let me be clear, we are going ahead and building this stadium,'' Bloomberg said. ''It is going ahead because New Yorkers never give up. Not now, not ever.''
 He also strongly emphasized that New York was not in Singapore as a setup for a bid in 2016, a charge the other bid cities have been using against the New York bid. As Bloomberg introduced Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, she echoed that theme, saying, ''2012 is the right time for New York. And it's the right time for the world to experience New York.''
 Both Doctoroff and Bloomberg veered briefly from the strategy of avoiding mention of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Late in Bloomberg's remarks, he highlighted New York's rebound from the tragedy, telling the I.O.C. members that in the aftermath, New Yorkers had told themselves, ''We can recover. We will rebuild. We must continue to welcome everyone.''
 The closing video featured a torch run through the city, including a small snippet that showed a child's handwritten sign outside Trinity Church. It was a drawing of the twin towers and said, in crayon, ''The sky was so blue.'' The presentation order was decided by random drawing, with each city given 45 minutes for a presentation and 15 minutes to answer questions from I.O.C. members. Moscow, London and Madrid were to follow Paris and New York. The voting was set to begin at 5:45 a.m. Eastern time, with the announcement of the result scheduled to be televised live by NBC at 7:43 a.m. 
 The voting was scheduled to proceed by rounds with the city receiving the least number of votes dropping out after every round. The rounds were to proceed until one city had a majority of the votes.
 Paris began its presentation to the I.O.C. with a note of humility, a nod to the criticism that its past two bids were too arrogant and had turned off an organization that likes to be wooed.
 Mayor Bertrand Delanoe quickly referred to those previous bids. ''Each defeat has served to increase our determination,'' he said, in French. Then, in another nod to previous criticisms about the reluctance of the French to speak English, he spoke a few sentences in English. ''I want to thank you for setting the bar so high and pushing us further toward excellence,'' he said.
 French President Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the presentation for Paris's last bid, in 2001, made the most emotional appeal. He emphasized his long relationship with many I.O.C. members and talked about the French people's desire to host the Games. ''I shall vouch for this,'' he said in French. ''You can put your trust in France. You can trust the French. You can trust us.''
 The video portion of the Paris presentation was produced by the French filmmaker Luc Besson and it had a peculiarly French flair, opening with an aerial tour of the city, showing Olympic rings floating around landmarks.
 In the question-and-answer session, I.O.C. members asked about anti-doping plans, about guarantees for building the Olympic village and, oddly, about the quality of French air-conditioning.
 The presentations by the five delegations ended what had become the most expensive campaign ever for an Olympic Games, with the cities spending an estimated $150 million combined.
 Dr. Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, had preached in favor of reining in the bid process. He had insisted the I.O.C. not add new sports like golf until others were dropped. And he said he wanted to keep the Games manageable enough for a country in Africa to play host one day.
 But the 2012 campaign only underlined how far the I.O.C. is from achieving Rogge's goals.
 New York City's efforts alone cost $35 million, Doctoroff said, all of it raised from private donations. The other cities did not release the amounts they spent, but all of them staged similarly expansive campaigns.
 To top it off, some I.O.C. members say they believe that on Thursday, none of the 28 summer Olympic sports will be voted off the program, leaving the Games as large and as costly as ever.
 Rogge, at a news conference this week, tried to put the best face on the bid process. ''When I am asked who will be the winner, I am always inclined to say the winner will be the International Olympic Committee,'' Rogge said.
 But he admitted to wincing at the size of the campaigns, which included cities' flying dozens of celebrity guests, elite athletes and high-profile politicians to Singapore for the final days of lobbying. 
 ''I like to see Olympic champions, but I don't think the whole candidature process must be one of glitter and stars,'' he said. ''We like to see the support of the government authorities and the support of the sports, so if they are bringing leaders and sports stars, fine. That is not a problem.''
 The last days of the race for the Games drew the president of France, the prime ministers of Britain, Russia and Spain, as well as Spain's Queen Sofia. New York had Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lend her star power. The British prime minister, Tony Blair, spent two and a half days here before flying back to Scotland on Tuesday night to serve as host for the G-8 summit meeting, which begins today.
 In many ways, the Olympic movement cannot help itself. It seems magnetically drawn to anything big, favoring elaborate opening ceremonies and grand gestures like around-the-world torch relays while giving press credentials to nearly 15,000 news media representatives for the Summer Games, which usually feature 10,000 athletes.
 Peter Ueberroth, the United States Olympic Committee chairman who oversaw the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, the first money-making Olympics in history, was one of those sounding a note of caution. The 1984 Games did not receive government money or donations and were financed entirely by sponsorships, television revenue, merchandising and ticket sales. Eight years after the 1976 Games nearly bankrupted Montreal, the profits realized in Los Angeles were considered a phenomenal achievement.
 Rogge said that since then every Games has turned an operational profit. The overall I.O.C. marketing revenue has increased by 31 percent, reaching $866 million for 2005-09. Television rights revenue has jumped to $3.5 billion for the 2010 Winter Games and the 2012 Summer Games.
 Ueberroth is among those who say he does not believe such increases will continue and that the next television contracts may shrink as networks struggle to make sports broadcasts as profitable as they once were. 
 ''I think the I.O.C. is coming to realize, hopefully, that they need to put some restraints on that or it will backfire,'' Ueberroth said. No longer, he added, will cities keep bidding until they get the Games if the costs keep going up.

HEADLINE: The Big Tug of War Over Unocal

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

 BODY:
As the lobbying heats up in Washington over Unocal, a midsize American oil company, the battle lines in the takeover contest are now drawn clearly, if oddly, by its suitors.
 In one corner stands the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, a company controlled by a Communist government. Despite that, its pitch is straight out of the capitalist playbook: just let markets work, free of political meddling. And, yes, we have the higher bid, at $18.5 billion.
In the other corner is the American oil giant, Chevron, whose capitalist credentials date back to its days as part of the Rockefeller Standard Oil Trust. Its pitch is that the American government should get involved because the upstart has an unfair edge from Chinese government financing. 
 The state company, Chevron adds, would be likely to hoard Unocal's oil and gas for Chinese consumption. The strong suggestion is that America's energy security would be better served by the lower bid of Chevron, at $16.8 billion.
 ''They're not playing by commercial rules; it's not fair trading,'' Peter J. Robertson, the vice chairman of Chevron, said in an interview last week. ''We will produce more oil and gas, and put it into the world supply.''
 Chevron, the sixth-largest corporation in America, has an established presence in Washington to make its case, with a sizable internal team and outside lobbyists and policy advisers like Wayne L. Berman, a principal of the Federalist Group who served in the administration of the president's father and has been a leading fund-raiser for President Bush. (Mr. Berman's wife, Lea, is the White House social secretary.)
 Working for Chevron as well is Drew Maloney, the Federalist Group's chief lobbyist for House Republicans, who formerly was the legislative director for Tom DeLay of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the House.
 To counter Chevron's home-field advantage, the Chinese newcomer, Cnooc, has moved quickly to enlist lobbyists, policy and media advisers of its own. It has signed up the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, whose partners include major fund-raisers for President Bush like Alan D. Feld and James C. Langdon Jr. Another major Bush fund-raiser, Bill Paxon, a former Republican representative from New York, is a senior adviser to Akin Gump. 
 The media adviser for Cnooc's takeover fight is Public Strategies, whose vice chairman is Mark McKinnon, who guided President Bush's media campaign in the 2000 and 2004 elections.
 The Chevron side is certainly winning the early rounds in Washington. The House of Representatives, by huge majorities, passed two measures last Thursday that protest the Chinese bid -- an amendment to cut off funding for any government review that might allow the Chinese offer to proceed, and a nonbinding resolution that lists objections to the bid and calls on President Bush to order an immediate investigation on national security grounds.
 The competition for Unocal, to be sure, touches a host of American anxieties about China that have little to do with the merits of the bids by Chevron and the Chinese oil company. China's rapid rise as an economic power, its military ambitions and American jobs lost to efficient Chinese manufacturers are among the concerns.
 ''What we're seeing in Washington shows the hysteria about China,'' noted William A. Reinsch, a former trade official in the Clinton administration who is a member of United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an advisory group to Congress.
 ''It means that any deal like this is going to be debated in a red-hot rhetorical atmosphere.''
 Raising the decibel level in Washington works to Chevron's advantage. But with its global reach, including investments in China, Chevron has to be careful.
 ''This isn't about bashing China,'' Mr. Robertson of Chevron said. ''But we've got to compete for this asset.''
 Exploiting the political qualms created by the Chinese bid is part of the game plan. Asked why Chevron's lower bid should be more appealing, Mr. Robertson emphasized the risk in the Chinese offer. ''There's no certainty that they can get through the regulatory and political process,'' he said. 
 Uncertainty also helps Chevron because it moved first for Unocal in April, and the Unocal board has approved Chevron's offer. To open up a bidding war, Unocal shareholders must reject the Chevron stock-and-cash offer in a vote scheduled for Aug. 10. Cnooc made its higher, all-cash bid on June 23.
 The Cnooc side says it offers the cool reason of the market, a higher bid, while portraying Chevron as fanning populist prejudice. ''It's a lot easier to raise political uncertainty than to raise cash,'' said Mark Palmer, managing director of Public Strategies, who is the former head of public relations for Enron.
 At Akin Gump, the Cnooc team is led by Daniel Spiegel, the partner in charge of the firm's international practice. Lobbying on behalf of Cnooc appears to be an uphill struggle so far. Take, for example, the House resolution last Thursday evening stated that allowing the Chinese oil company to buy Unocal would ''threaten to impair the national security of the United States.'' It passed 398 to 15.
 The Cnooc side, Mr. Spiegel said, has been trying to talk to as many people in Congress and in policy research organizations as possible. ''We're just telling them the facts, something that is in short supply,'' he said.
 The Cnooc talking points are that 70 percent of Unocal's oil and gas reserves are in Asia, and mostly under long-term contract to Asian nations like Thailand and Indonesia; Unocal's American oil and gas production accounts for less than 1 percent of American consumption, and Cnooc has pledged that United States production will remain in the United States market; and Unocal jobs in America will not be cut, if Cnooc takes over.
 Representative Jim Moran, a Virginia Democrat, was one of the 15 who voted against the House resolution, which he called ''wrongheaded.'' Such moves, Mr. Moran said in an interview last Friday, risk ''retaliation'' from China, which holds vast investments in United States Treasury bonds as China recycles dollars it holds because American consumers buy so many goods made in China. Without the Chinese buying bonds, interest rates in the United States would rise, which in turn would probably increase inflation, threaten the booming housing market and depress consumer spending.
 ''If the Chinese are not going to be allowed to turn over $18.5 billion in return for stock in Unocal, they are going to be less inclined to invest their money in U.S. Treasury bonds,'' Mr. Moran said.
 Yet Mr. Moran is in the minority in Congress these days.
 With his resolution, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of California, said in an interview last Friday that he wanted to ''send a message to the administration about the depth of Congressional concern'' about the Cnooc bid. 
 Mr. Pombo agreed with the Chevron complaint that about a third of the financing for the Cnooc bid came from low-interest or no-interest loans from Chinese banks, and that the financing was an unfair government subsidy. ''But my biggest concern is the preservation of Unocal's energy assets in friendly hands,'' he said. ''If a company is owned by a foreign government, its loyalty is going to be to that government.''
 Chevron's headquarters in San Ramon, Calif., is in Mr. Pombo's district. He is an advocate for the oil industry in Congress, and Chevron donated $10,000 to his campaign in 2004 (of the $1.5 million he raised).
 Mr. Pombo said he did talk to a Chevron lobbyist before he wrote a letter of concern to President Bush in mid-June, when rumors of a Cnooc bid first circulated.
 But Mr. Pombo said he had not talked to Chevron representatives in the last two weeks, and Chevron was not involved in drafting his resolution last week. His interest, said Mr. Pombo, who is chairman of the House Resources Committee, stems mainly from his belief that oil is a strategic asset.
 By contrast, he said he saw no public policy issue with the recent $2.5 billion bid by Haier, a Chinese appliance maker, for Maytag, which he regarded as similar to the Japanese buying Rockefeller Center at the end of the 1980's. 
 ''I didn't like it, but it was no big deal,'' Mr. Pombo said.
 Many economists and oil experts question whether owning oil and gas in the ground really does increase a nation's energy security because there is a deep global market for buying it by the barrel or by the tanker. But that is a subject of lively debate, and the potential strategic significance of oil is why the Chinese bid for Unocal has stirred such interest.
 ''A lot of this is corporate self-interest and local politics, but there is also a legitimate question to ask,'' said Larry M. Wortzel, a former military attache to the American Embassy in Beijing and a member of the Congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission. ''Do we want a foreign power, whose military intentions in the long term are not clear, to own energy assets inside our border?''
 The answer to that question, if a Cnooc bid proceeds, will probably be made by President Bush, after an investigation by a multiagency group, the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States.
 The Chinese government has begun some lobbying of its own. At an energy conference in New Orleans last week, Zhang Guobao, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission in China, declared: ''To spread the 'China threat' and try to curb China's progress and starve its energy needs is not in the interest of world stability and development. Such attempts are doomed to fail.''
 In an angry statement on Monday, the foreign ministry chided Congress for its ''mistaken ways'' and told it to ''stop interfering'' in the takeover contest. ''Cnooc's bid to take over the U.S. Unocal,'' the ministry statement said, ''is a normal commercial activity between enterprises and should not fall victim to political interference.''

HEADLINE: At the Potential Sites, What Might Have Been

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
THEY'RE the Olympic sites that would have been -- the planned New York locations for the 2012 Summer Games, which instead will be held in London. After the International Olympic Committee's vote was announced yesterday in Singapore, I stopped by several of those places to learn what the New Yorkers who work or live there thought of New York's loss. And, like New York itself, the opinions were diverse. 
 Outside Madison Square Garden, where the basketball tournament would have been held, several people didn't seem to care much, but Richard Mayo did. 
 ''I care and I'm disappointed,'' said Mayo, a 55-year-old Internet specialist who lives in Upper Manhattan. ''It would've opened up international tourism and it would have upgraded our security. I would have come to the Garden to see basketball.''
 Sam Ciner of Far Rockaway, a buyer of excess inventory who was wearing a Yankees cap, said he believed that New York was better off without the Olympics.
 ''Since 9/11, the city has had tremendous expenses,'' he said. ''And for me, the Olympics lost a lot of its luster ever since they started using pros -- the N.B.A. basketball players and the N.H.L. hockey players. It's not the same. Go back to using the college kids.''
 Hank Carol, a printing salesman who commutes from Fords, N.J., objected to the increased security the Olympics would demand.
 ''There's enough security around here without adding to it,'' he said. ''Everywhere you go, there's security -- airports, everywhere.''
 Dawn Shurmaitis, on her way to her office at the public television station WNET, said she had mixed emotions. She was disappointed for New York, but, with a glance at the Garden, she remembered the sidewalk detours created by security precautions during the Republican National Convention there last summer.
 ''And the fear,'' she said. ''With a big event like the convention or the Olympics, you never know what might happen.''
 Over on the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn, where the aquatics center for swimming and diving would have been built, two Verizon workmen, John Gardner and Christian Cunningham, were outside a warehouse near Grand Ferry Park along the East River.
 ''I think the city's overcrowded enough as it is,'' Gardner said. ''The money the city would spend on the Olympics could be spent better.''
 Cunningham said: ''I wouldn't want to lose this nice little park. It's cozy, you bring your lunch, there's a nice breeze on a hot day.''
 Up the block, Milton Pilamunga, a taxi driver from Ecuador, leaned on the door of a shiny black sedan. 
 ''New York doesn't deserve the Olympics,'' he said sternly. ''We have too many problems here without having the Olympics.''
 Up near the Queens entrance to the Midtown Tunnel, on 51st Avenue in Hunters Point, Anthony Rotondo, a 38-year-old operations manager for D&E Electric, proudly glanced across the rooftops toward where the Olympic Village -- housing for the thousands of Olympic athletes -- would have been built.
 ''I was hoping for the Olympic Village,'' he said. ''I've lived and worked on this block my whole life. It would be good for the neighborhood, good for the economy of the city. But the old-timers didn't like it. All the people who complained are in rent-controlled apartments. The old-timers don't want change.''
 Two blocks away, Christina Choi, a business student at Baruch College, said she thought the neighborhood was already too crowded.
 ''Even the Fourth of July was too crowded last weekend,'' she said. ''I'm for the Olympics, but not here in Hunters Point.''
 On the grass of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the lake would have been the site for Olympic rowing, Rob Campana, a New York City firefighter, and his fiancee, Debra Edwards, a seventh-grade teacher, were adjusting their bicycles.
 ''The Olympics would have been exciting,'' Campana said. ''I'm disappointed.''
 Edwards added that ''it would have been good to have the infrastructure.''
 Across the Grand Central Parkway from Shea Stadium, where the Mets' proposed stadium would have been converted into the Olympic stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies and the track-and-field events, Jaswant Singh stood outside his recently opened Stadium Gas station on Roosevelt Avenue.
 ''I wish the Olympics were here,'' he said. ''It would be good for business.''
 Business would have also been important in the area around Yankee Stadium, the planned site of the Olympic baseball tournament. On the quiet afternoon of an open date in the Yankees' schedule, Chris Persky, the manager of Stan's Sports World across River Avenue, was surrounded by stacks of Yankees caps, jerseys and T-shirts.
 ''The Olympics would have been good for business here,'' he said.
 When told that the Olympic five-ring logo was costly, Persky smiled.
 ''I would have found a way,'' he said. ''But during the Olympics, Yankee stuff would have been enough. Yankee stuff sells to everybody in the world.''
 Yankee stuff sells better, apparently, than New York sold itself to everybody in the world of the I.O.C.

HEADLINE: U.S. Service Industries Grew Briskly Last Month 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Service industries in the United States grew faster than forecast in June as companies increased hiring.
 The Institute for Supply Management reported yesterday that its index for nonmanufacturing companies, including financial services and retailers, increased to 62.2 last month from 58.5 in May. A figure higher than 50 indicates expansion. 
 The hiring gauge of the institute, a purchasing managers' group, rose to a four-month high in June. Last week, the Federal Reserve said that the economy's expansion remained firm, even amid record prices for crude oil.
 ''It's clear that energy prices aren't slowing business activity,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. ''It's a good, solid reading.''
 The gauge is close to the 62.4 average for all of last year, when economic growth of 4.4 percent was the fastest since 1999, and the index surpassed forecasts. In June, it had been expected to rise to 58.7.
 The index also includes utilities, mining and construction and covers some 87 percent of the economy. 
 Mitchell L. Stapley, chief fixed-income strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Mich., commented: ''If you look at an ideal economy, this is about it right now. We have economic growth at about 3.5 percent probably on average for the rest of the year, the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent and consumer inflation probably running about 2 percent.''
 The institute's employment index jumped to 57.4, the highest since February, from 53.4. Retail, transportation, legal services and construction companies were among those reporting the highest rates of job growth in June.
 Some economists say the institute's employment gauges may be a harbinger of the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is to be released tomorrow. 
 Yesterday's index follows the release last Friday of the institute's manufacturing gauge. It rose to 53.8 in June from 51.4, the first increase in seven months.

HEADLINE: Study Challenges Assumptions About Money Being Remitted to Mexico 

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 6 

 BODY:
Sending money home to Mexico is a ritual in the migrant experience in the United States. The modest wire transfers of cash pay for food, school supplies, even a new home for family members left behind in Mexico.
 But a new study has cast doubt on the amount of transfers -- $16.6 billion last year -- that actually goes to families. The study, by an official in the Social Development Ministry and two professors at the College of the Northern Border, a research institute outside Tijuana, concludes that families receive only about half of that amount. 
''We're just not finding $16.6 billion in Mexican households,'' said Rodolfo Tuiran, who released the study last month. Dr. Tuiran, a demographer who used to run the National Population Council in Mexico and is now an under secretary at the Social Development Ministry, is raising new questions on the amount of money being sent and where it winds up.
 The amount of transfers has jumped 150 percent since 2000, and is now the second-largest single source of foreign exchange after oil exports. The central bank estimates that remittances could total $20 billion this year.
 But Dr. Tuiran disputes those figures. The estimate of remittances by the United States Commerce Department for 2004 was only $9.6 billion, a discrepancy too large to be explained by different counting methods, the study says. The number of Mexican migrants to the United States grew 16 percent from 2000 to 2004, a modest rise next to the boom in remittances. Just as startling is the discrepancy between the destination of the cash and its distribution. The central bank reports that the state of Chiapas receives 3 percent of all remittances, even though Mexico's national statistics agency found that Chiapas accounts for only half of 1 percent of Mexican households that receive money; each household in Chiapas therefore would be receiving thousands of dollars, even though the average transfer is only about $325, the study said. The magnitude of the cash flows is a charged political issue in Mexico. President Vicente Fox often refers to Mexicans working in the United States as ''heroes.'' Meanwhile, the migrants are demanding a greater say in Mexico's affairs on the strength of the cash they send home. 
 The remittances have become so large that economists and business leaders here say the Mexican government has become overly dependent on them, relying on the money to increase the balance of payments and mask a decline in foreign investment, and using it as a substitute for broader anti-poverty programs. 
 The American ambassador to Mexico, Antonio O. Garza Jr. touched a nerve when he said in a speech in May, ''Let's be honest with each other -- reliance on remittances from the U.S. and windfall revenues from high oil prices is simply not an economic policy.'' 
 Jesus Cervantes, the central bank official in charge of tallying remittances, argues that most of the increase reflects better reporting thanks to increasing use of electronic transfers; if anything, ''we are underestimating the number,'' he said. The bank, he said, is fully confident that the remittances are going to Mexican families.
 But the effect of the remittances on poverty in Mexico is one of the most controversial conclusions of the study. Dr. Tuiran argues that remittances have had no better than a marginal effect on poverty, as fewer than 6 percent of Mexico's extremely and moderately poor households receive any of the money. That group makes up about 50 percent of Mexico's population.
 Under Mr. Fox's government, the number of Mexicans living in extreme poverty, which the government defines as those who do not have enough to eat, has dropped to 17 million, from 24 million, the government says. The Tuiran study, by playing down the role of remittances on poverty, lends support to the government's antipoverty programs, making critics of the Fox administration uncomfortable. 
 ''The first big suspicion I have is whether the purpose of this is to study remittances or to support the Fox government,'' Primitivo Rodriguez, an immigration expert here, said. While the money flows to families may be overestimated, the remittances not only mitigate poverty, but have a multiplying effect on jobs and consumer spending, he said.
 ''This study smells of political urgency,'' he said. Campaigning has already begun for next year's presidential election. 
 Roberto Suro, the director of the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, an organization that does research on Hispanics in the United States, said the Tuiran study was based on data -- both Mexican and American -- that was not wholly reliable.
 The Commerce Department figures are based on outdated models, he said, while Mexico's household surveys typically understate the proportion of families that receive remittances. Surveys in the United States suggest that figure is around 17 percent, well above the 7 percent Mexico estimates, Mr. Suro said. 
 More migrants are sending money home ''because there is now a culture of remittances that has become quite forceful,'' he said. ''Part of this culture is that if you don't send remittances, you're viewed as selfish.''
 The Tuiran study called for a breakdown of the central bank's numbers. 
 ''It's fundamental that we find out the origin and destination of the $16.6 billion that is entering Mexico,'' said Jorge Santibanez, the president of the College of the Northern Border and a co-author of the study. 
 The central bank, he said, could be counting payments by tiny stores in Mexican neighborhoods of Los Angeles or Chicago that import Mexican candy and other treats. In Chiapas, which sends few migrants to the United States, the central bank could be including payments by relatives in the United States to smugglers who lead Central Americans into Mexico and on to the United States. The tally could even include donations to the growing number of evangelical churches in Chiapas from individuals in American congregations. 
 Although the small size of transfers makes it unlikely that the drug trade launders money this way, small amounts of drug money might be reaching Mexico this way, Dr. Santibanez said. 
 Despite the doubts, the study raises legitimate questions about the money reaching Mexican families, Mr. Suro of the Pew group said.
 ''This is a cautionary note, and an important one,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Expatriates Without Neighborhoods Find Their Niches

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In this city of dozens of convivial ethnic neighborhoods, there are some people who do not have one.
 Australians, for example. Where do Australians go when they want a touch of home, to be called mate with a soothingly flattened and elongated vowel, to have a proper flat white coffee and Vegemite toast, to talk to someone who understands why Aussie beaches reign supreme and who knows how to relax?
Greeks have Astoria, Russians Brighton Beach and Guyanese Richmond Hill, but the New York area's roughly 15,000 Australians have had to make do in far-flung fashion. No worries, mate! They congregate at restaurants in Lower Manhattan like Eight Mile Creek and the Sunburnt Cow, particularly when rugby or cricket is on the telly, or at tiny Ruby's, which has the proper flat white (an almost frothless cappuccino). They head to Van Cortlandt Park for footy -- a version of Gaelic football. 
 ''You can talk in your own language and enjoy yourself and feel like you're back home,'' said Jim Ferguson, an administrator at Toys ''R'' Us who was enjoying a beer the other day at Eight Mile Creek as well as the dry, laconic humor of the Australian owner, bartenders and patrons. ''You're with your mates.''
 New York can be a particularly lonely place for certain expatriates like Australians, British, Japanese and Norwegians who are without neighborhoods because, unlike true immigrants, so many are here for a limited run, either working for a few years for a native company or jump-starting a career in fashion, art or the news media. Many have left large families behind and some vacillate painfully between staying here permanently or returning. But when homesickness strikes, these nationals have patched together their own hodgepodge of haunts where they can nibble comfort food and hear congenial voices.
 Many of the city's 4,000 Norwegians get a little piece of Norway at the Norwegian Seamen's Church on East 52nd Street, where they can attend a prayer service or read a book in the mother tongue, see some native art or maybe hear a work by the composer Edvard Grieg. (Except for some delis and an annual parade, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, pretty much stopped being a true Nordic neighborhood a generation ago as descendants of Norwegian immigrants either moved or married non-Norwegians.)
 Anki King, a Norwegian-born painter who has lived in New York for 11 years, got to know compatriot artists by dropping in to sample the church cafe's daily offerings of fresh waffles with preserves and to read Norwegian newspapers. Now she relishes observing the world with friends through ''our Norwegianness.''
 ''There's our connection to nature,'' she said. ''No matter where we go we see the colors. We sort of grew up with the darkness of the forest and the blue of the summer night.''
 For the 30,000 or so British-born immigrants in New York, the closest thing to Piccadilly Circus is a single block of Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich Village where, side by side, there is a shop that serves a proper afternoon tea with brewed leaves and a strainer as well as a zingy ginger cake bathed in Bird's Custard; a fish and chips parlor where the varieties include whiting, cod and haddock, and the clerks ask whether you want the order salted mild or heavy; and a British provisions store. British patrons are also a short walk from Myers of Keswick on Hudson Street, a museumlike grocery 20 years old where fresh bangers and steak and kidney pie are available, Heinz Baked Beanz are arranged in the window in a traditional terraced pyramid, and British chocolates like Flake, Aero and Crunchie are bountiful.
 Nicky Perry of London opened her Greenwich Village tea shop in 1990 because she could not find a decent cup of tea. On some days, she says, 30 percent of her customers are British. Many are fashion hair stylists and photographers who live nearby. 
 ''It's what they miss from home -- the hankering,'' Ms. Perry said of her self-made British ghetto. ''It has been referred to as an alternative British Embassy because we get calls from people who say, 'We called the British Embassy and they told us to call you.''' 
 Some of the 60,000 Japanese in the New York area find their way to St. Marks Place and East Ninth Street, a two-block enclave that has two Japanese markets, a half-dozen sushi restaurants, a karaoke bar, a spot for renting Japanese videos and Hoshi Coupe hair salon, where customers can specify the flourishes they want in Japanese and get a brief neck massage to boot. 
 Masako Hoshi, the owner, a small woman with blond-tinted hair and scarlet rectangular glasses, said she chose the location 14 years ago after realizing that thousands of Japanese lived below 14th Street. 
 ''Our customers feel like they're in Japan when they're here,'' she said. 
 A second Japanese cluster has flowered on East 41st Street between Fifth and Madison around Book Off, a used book store that has three orderly aisles of pocket-size comic-book novels, as well as two floors of Japanese books, CD's and DVD's. Once Book Off settled on the block five years ago, travel agencies, a Japan Airlines office and an English-language school followed.
 ''We're making our own country community on 41st Street,'' said Emi Simeron, the secretary-treasurer of the American division of Book Off, which has 800 stores in Japan and four in the United States.
 The other day, Yuki Kumagai, 25, was browsing among the adventure comics. He came here a year and half ago from a suburb of Tokyo to study economics at the College of Staten Island and for a chance to get some American business internships. 
 ''I miss Japanese culture,'' he confided in halting English. 
 Of course, there are expatriates who have swallowed New York completely -- perhaps by marrying an American or falling in love with the city's energy -- and scrupulously avoid chauvinistic hangouts. Philip Hall, a 38-year-old artist from Sydney, Australia, who manages the Grey Art Gallery at New York University, said he pines for his native country's wide open spaces but not much else. He has discovered Australian freshness and genuineness among Midwesterners and his land's laid-back temperament among Californians.
 ''I didn't come here to be part of an Australian clique, and I don't need to hear Australian accents or be with someone wearing an Akubra,'' he said, referring to the bushman's hat. 
 Many Australians get their dose of national spirit in more simple fashion -- by gathering in one another's homes for a barbie, which is even more of a national ritual than the American barbecue. ''It's more the company than the actual place we go to,'' said Della Bass, a 34-year-old fashion photographer. 
 Some of the consulates work hard at keeping up the national esprit de corps, knowing many of these temporary Americans will return to their native land. The Australian Consulate rents space to Advance -- Australian Professionals in America, an independent organization that brings together newer immigrants with successful Australian business people (Australians have either been chief executives or presidents of McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Kellogg's.)
 ''People love it here,'' said Elena Douglas, the chief executive of Advance. ''We're well liked and integrate easily and people construct a really good life for themselves. But it doesn't mean that you don't have the regular shipments of Vegemite and Tim Tams.''

HEADLINE: Do Tax Cuts for the Wealthy Stimulate Employment?

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, is the author of ''Luxury Fever.''

 BODY:
THE centerpiece of the Bush administration's economic policy has been large federal income tax cuts aimed mainly at top earners. These tax cuts account for much of the $2 trillion increase in the national debt projected to occur during the Bush presidency. They prompted a large group of Nobel laureates in economics to issue a statement last year condemning the administration's ''reckless and extreme course that endangers the long-term economic health of our nation.'' 
 The question of whether to make the tax cuts permanent is still on the Congressional agenda. So it is an opportune moment to examine the president's argument in support of them. 
Mr. Bush never pretended that the tax cuts were needed to make life more comfortable for the well to do. After all, with the bulk of all pretax income gains having gone to top earners in recent years, this group has prospered as never before. 
 Rather, the president portrayed his tax cuts as the linchpin of his economic stimulus package. He argued that because most new jobs are created by small businesses, tax cuts to the owners of those businesses would stimulate robust employment growth. His policy thus rests implicitly on the premise that if business owners could afford to hire additional workers, they would. But whether owners can afford to hire is not the issue. What matters is whether hiring will increase their profits.
 The basic hiring criterion, found in every introductory textbook (including those written by the president's own economic advisers), is straightforward: If the output of additional workers can be sold for at least enough to cover their salaries, they should be hired; otherwise not. If this criterion is met, hiring extra workers makes economic sense, no matter how poor a business owner might be. Conversely, if the criterion is not satisfied, hiring makes no economic sense, even for billionaire owners. The after-tax personal incomes of business owners are irrelevant for hiring decisions. 
 The president's defenders might respond that business owners often need money up front to cover the hiring and training costs incurred before new workers can effectively contribute to extra production. The tax cuts put that money in their pockets. That is true but does nothing to alter the basic hiring rule. 
 Owners who used their tax cuts to finance the initial costs of new hiring would be acting, in effect, as their own bankers, lending money to themselves in the hope of future returns. The test for whether such internal loans make economic sense is exactly the same as the test for external loans. 
 A loan from a bank makes sense if the firm's ultimate gain from hiring extra workers is enough to cover not only their salaries but also repayment of the loan plus interest. Internal loans must meet the same standard. They are justified only if the firm's gain from hiring extra workers is enough to cover their salaries and repayment of the loan, including the interest that owners could have earned had they left their tax cuts in the bank. In hiring decisions, the implicit costs of internal loans have exactly the same economic standing as the explicit costs of external loans.
 In brief, the president's claim that tax cuts to the owners of small businesses will stimulate them to hire more workers flies in the face of bedrock principles outlined in every introductory economics textbook.
 A second way the Bush tax cuts might have stimulated employment is by inducing the wealthy to spend more on consumption. But a large share of the tax windfalls received by the wealthy are not spent in the short run. And even among those who are induced to spend more, the main effect is not increased demand for domestically produced goods and services, but rather increased bidding for choice oceanfront property and longer waiting lists for the new Porsche Carrera GT. Such spending does little to stimulate domestic employment.
 Had the dollars required to finance the president's tax cuts been used in other ways, they would have made a real difference. Larger tax cuts for middle- and low-income families, for example, would have stimulated immediate new spending because the savings rates for most of these families are low. And their additional spending would have been largely for products made by domestic businesses -- which would have led, in turn, to increased employment. 
 Grants to cash-starved state and local governments would have prevented layoffs of thousands of teachers and police officers. And many useful jobs could have been created directly. For instance, people could have been hired to scrutinize the cargo containers that currently enter the nation's ports uninspected.
 Economists from both sides of the political aisle argued from the beginning that tax cuts for the wealthy made no sense as a policy for stimulating new jobs. And experience has proved them right. Total private employment was actually lower in January 2005 than in January 2001, the first time since the Great Depression that employment has fallen during a president's term of office.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Oil Prices Offset Some Positive Data 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday as oil prices climbed to a record, causing investors to look past a report showing strong growth in the service sector of the economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.12 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 10,270.68, after rising 68 points on Tuesday. Broader stock indicators also fell yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 10.05 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,194.94, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 10.10 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,068.65. 
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 4.96 points, or 0.76 percent, at 648.27. 
 Oil closed above $61 a barrel for the first time as investors worried that Tropical Storm Cindy would hamper production in the Gulf of Mexico and refinery capacity along the coast. Reports of power failures at two Valero Energy refineries heightened investors' fears. A barrel of light crude settled at $61.28, up $1.69, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''There are a number of crosscurrents in the market right now that make it difficult to find a direction,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke. ''The services report was a very pleasant surprise, and added to generally positive economic data. But then you have oil, which could slow the economy.''
 The Institute for Supply Management's services index for June came in at 62.2, higher than the 58.9 that economists had expected, and better than the 58.5 reading in May.
 Bonds gained ground after a strong sell-off in the previous session. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.07 percent, from 4.11 percent late Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, increased 9/32, to 100 14/32. 
 Optimism about the United States economy pushed the dollar to an 11-month high against the Japanese yen. But the dollar lost ground against the euro and other major currencies. Gold prices rose.
 Shares of Valero Energy dropped $1.46, to $83.50, after the company said power failures would reduce oil refining capacity slightly. Global demand for oil and distillates has threatened to overtake supply, and any reduction in refining capacity is seen as pressure on crude futures. 
 Analysts said bigger problems might lie ahead for the economy. 
 ''The thing here is that crude oil prices at $60 just isn't new anymore,'' said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. ''The longer it stays up here, the more the market gets used to it. Now, when we see second-quarter earnings, and we're getting some grumblings about oil affecting the bottom line, that'll be a true test.''
 Some investors were also nervous since the government's weekly energy inventory report, usually released on Wednesday, was delayed a day by the Fourth of July holiday.
 PacifiCare Health Systems surged $4.41 a share, to $77.09, after it confirmed that it would be acquired by UnitedHealth in a $8.1 billion cash- and-stock deal. UnitedHealth gained 27 cents a share, to close at $53.50.
 Halliburton fell 93 cents, to $48.71 a share, even after the Army awarded the company a $4.97 billion contract to provide logistics support in Iraq. The contract is $1 billion more than the previous year.
 Zions Bancorp lost $4.69, to close at $68.67, after it announced it would buy Amegy Bancorp, which is based in Texas, for $1.7 billion in cash and stock, or $23.32 a share. Amegy fell $1.05 a share, to $21.93.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.46 billion shares, compared with 1.37 billion traded on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: In a Basement, and Things Are Looking Up

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
''I WAS what you call a poor working-class citizen,'' said Michelle Johnson, sitting at her kitchen table. Ms. Johnson, 49, a mother of five and a member of the Shinnecock Indian tribe, lives on the Shinnecock reservation on the South Fork of Long Island. ''I worked really hard, but it just seemed like my money was going in pockets with holes in it.'' 
 ''One day,'' she recalled, ''I said, I'm going to build my house.'' 
In 1997 she started. She is still building.
 The Shinnecock tribe is absorbing the reactions to a land claim it filed in federal court on June 15 for large parts of the adjacent town of Southampton, the first of two expected lawsuits that could seek billions of dollars in settlement. Leading daily lives on the 800 acres that they call, familiarly, ''home,'' tribe members are going about their business: building and improving houses for their families, taking care of children and going to work.
 It is an ordinary world that looks much like any other, anywhere else: a rural suburb where children chase each other on bicycles down tree-shaded roads choked on either side with wild rosebushes and honeysuckle.
 And it is also extraordinary, in ways that the ''outside,'' which is how the Shinnecocks describe the world beyond their reservation, rarely sees.
 The cemetery, which sits by the bay above a beach rich with clams, has headstones with names like Thunder Bird carved into them, as well as markers for Smiths and Quinns. The maps of the United States in classrooms where children take remedial studies, after their regular school day in Southampton, show the locations of Indian tribes across the country.
 The summer lushness is deceiving. Though white-collar professionals like lawyers and teachers live on the reservation, as well as blue-collar workers like contractors and hotel employees, the median income of the 238 households on the reservation, many including three and four generations of a family, is only $14,055, according to the 2000 census. Census records also show that many of the households are run by single, separated or divorced mothers, who are the primary wage earners on the reservation. General unemployment in 2000 was 7.7 percent of the civilian work force there.
 Having one's own home here is not a dream simply realized. Because the tribe owns the land collectively and allots sites to members who decide to build, the approximately 500 Shinnecocks who live on the reservation are ineligible for mortgages. Budgets to start building can be small, and most houses are modest or incomplete. It is not untypical for a project to continue for years, proceeding in fits and starts that depend upon fresh lines of credit from new credit cards. (The few bigger homes on the reservation have generally been paid for with money earned during extended periods living and working on the outside.)
 To skip a stone across Heady Creek, where Ms. Johnson's house sits and where, in a different era, the tribe skated in the winter, would be to risk hitting any of the fresh-minted multimillion-dollar mansions that now form the Shinnecocks' views, or the powerboats that streak by in the summer.
 The tribe's second lawsuit, expected be filed later this month, will probably claim the entire town of Southampton, including the rich village at its heart, a move that could further isolate the Shinnecocks, already nearly an island.
 In anticipation of the curiosity -- idle or ill-intentioned -- that might follow the filing of the suits, new signs, as fierce as dogs, went up in early June at the heads of the roads that run into the reservation, instructing anyone not a member of the tribe to ''Keep Out.'' At the neighboring Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, the 113-year-old course where the United States Open is sometimes played, the image of an Indian in traditional headdress is being removed from the club's logo, news that seemed both to sadden and to steel a group of Shinnecocks discussing it in mid-June outside the tribal offices.
 But Ms. Johnson, like others, has life to war with first. An income tax refund of $13,000, which she accrued after failing to file returns for three years, became the down payment on beginning her house. In 1997, she hired a mason to dig and lay a basement as a foundation for $1,000. Then she and her family moved into it. Ms. Johnson put up a rubber roof to keep out rain.
 ''Paycheck to paycheck I was building my home after that,'' she said, ''adding the Sheetrock, adding the electric, doing a lot of the work myself. I lived here with no windows, no doors: me and my kids, one big huge space and one bed.'' Ms. Johnson works for the reservation and earns $340 a week.
 She laughed, and caught her breath.
 ''The birds would come in and fly around,'' she continued. ''It was kind of rough, but we just roughed it.''
 In addition to Ms. Johnson's labors, the house began to find its shape through a string of kindnesses from people who donated materials or volunteered to work.
 That was before the fire.
 ''Thanksgiving Day, two years ago, my house caught fire,'' Ms. Johnson recalled, her back straight, as though she were interviewing for a job. What was a three-bedroom home in the basement of her unfinished house was wiped out.
 Ms. Johnson, like some other Shinnecocks, also uses an Indian name. Hers is Mishnaymatanuway, which translates as ''strong woman full of faith,'' she said. Mishnaymatanuway is depicted traditionally as a woman in a canoe paddling upstream.
 ''We just stripped the whole house of the burnt debris, and this is where we're at right now,'' Ms. Johnson said. Her father and sister helped her build a wood frame upstairs, which looked in mid-June as full of promise in its raw timber as any suburban home at the end of a driveway anywhere. A local roofing company gave Ms. Johnson shingles for a roof, and a member of the tribe, Brad Smith, who is a contractor, got together a group, including men from outside the reservation, to put the roof up two days before Christmas Eve of last year.
 ''So that's my story,'' she said. ''I'm almost there.''
 Ms. Johnson had worked off the reservation, living in a rental apartment, before deciding to stop paying rent, which was $1,100 a month, build her house and ''move home,'' as the Shinnecocks say.
 ''If I didn't live on the reservation, I would live in a nice, comfortable home, where we didn't have to struggle,'' she said of her former apartment. Ms. Johnson herself grew up with her mother, father, sisters, brothers and aunts and uncles in a house on the reservation that was ''one big room,'' she said.
 ''I opt to live this way and struggle,'' she explained, speaking personally, but also, as was clear, speaking as a Shinnecock.
 ''We've struggled all our lives.''

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's column demonstrates how the redefining of medicine in America as a health care industry, where economics and consumerism are the central issue rather than health, undermines our efforts to find real solutions to the continual growth of degenerative illness.
If medicine can reclaim its traditional role in society, and the medical pluralism fostered by the alternative-medicine movement can be realized, then we will be better able to begin to change our focus away from the commerce of disease and toward an understanding of how to achieve health.

HEADLINE: New England Officials Plead To Keep Military Bases Open

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 6 

 BODY:
Officials from five of the six New England states lobbied the independent commission analyzing the proposed military-base closings on Wednesday to spare their states, saying the Pentagon used faulty information, inflated savings and incomplete criteria.
 Testifying before four of the nine members of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, officials from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island argued that closings would leave the region without a strong military presence, imperil economies and jeopardize national security.
 The region could lose more than 12,000 civilian positions, about half the losses from closings nationwide. 
 Three of the largest installations in the region, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Me.; the Naval Submarine Base in Groton, Conn.; and Otis Air National Guard Base in Sandwich on Cape Cod, are on the proposed list. 
 ''The loss of 12,000 jobs would be nothing less than a federally induced recession, one that our region would not recover from quickly,'' Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire said.
 Officials from Maine and New Hampshire said the Pentagon did not incorporate into its calculations the documented efficiency of the Portsmouth yard, where Navy officials last week presented the base one of the highest awards. 
 The 205-year-old shipyard, which works with nuclear-powered submarines, returns ships to the fleet faster than any other yard, officials said, and its skilled-labor base, which takes eight years of apprenticeship and work to fully cultivate, could not be easily copied at another site.
 Workers have indicated that they would be loath to move to bases in Norfolk, Va.; Puget Sound, Wash.; and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
 ''This shipyard cannot be replicated,'' Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said. ''The people who work there cannot be replicated.''
 The Defense Department recommended keeping Pearl Harbor open because of its strategic location. 
 In a letter last week, Anthony J. Principi, head of the base commission, asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for more information about why Pearl Harbor was chosen to stay open over Portsmouth. Mr. Principi said after the hearing that information presented to the panel showed Portsmouth as more efficient than Pearl Harbor.
 New Hampshire and Maine officials said the Pentagon had overstated the cost savings of closing the base by failing to take into account millions of dollars in costs for personnel, nuclear cleanup and construction at other bases. 
 Earl Donnell, who has worked at the yard for 37 years and who represented its management, said the Navy would save $916million by 2019 if the yard remained open. 
 Using numbers compiled by state officials, if the base closed, the Pentagon would lose $425million by 2020 because of increased costs elsewhere.
 ''They overestimated the capacity to perform work without Portsmouth,'' Mr. Donnell said.
 The hearing took on the feel of a rally, as thousands of employees and supporters rode school buses provided by the states for the 60-mile trip on Interstate 95 in a summer rain with a police escort. Clad in yellow T-shirts reading ''Save Our Shipyard,'' the group packed the hearing, adding a bright yellow wash to the staid convention room. 
 They cheered for the commission as it arrived, and Mr. Principi acknowledged them with a wave and a smile. 
 Many took personal days from work, but assured reporters that there were enough workers at the base to finish work on two submarines by the end of t he month. 
 ''Here's a government facility that's finally saving money, and they want to close it,'' said Wayne Hughes, 52, an inspectional supervisor from Alton, N.H., who has worked at the base for 28 years. ''That's why you see so many yellow shirts. Everyone's upset. I feel they're sending the wrong message -- that hard work doesn't pay off.'' Officials from Connecticut and Rhode Island said the Pentagon had failed to take into account the depth of the Groton base, which includes the submarine school and nearby Electric Boat, the submarine builder. A state analysis said closing the base would cost the military $274million.
 Officials said that the Pentagon was biased against the base, giving extra weight to sites that can handle carriers, as well as submarines, and that Washington had failed to take into account the cost of building extra piers at Kings Bay, Ga. 
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell said Connecticut was not treated fairly in the process. The chairman of the state's base commission, John Markowicz, accused the Pentagon of erecting a ''protective do-not-close line'' around Kings Bay.
 ''Faulty data gathering has undermined the military-evaluation process,'' Mr. Markowicz said. 
 A spokesman for the Pentagon, Lt. Col. John A. Skinner, said in an e-mail note that it was ''committed to ensuring the commission, Congress and the public have access to the information necessary to understand the department's recommendations.'' 
 The recommendations, Colonel Skinner said, are a ''product of comprehensive data analysis and a healthy and full debate.''
 The hearing developed into a case for shoring up the submarine arsenal, which the Pentagon has considered cutting. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said closing the bases could be a backdoor way to trim the arsenal. 
 ''Such an analysis is not only short-sighted,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''We believe it is dangerous, as well.'' 
 The panel gives final recommendations to President Bush in September.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Plan Draws a Rival, And It's Smaller

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A rival of the developer Bruce C. Ratner submitted a competing bid yesterday to buy and develop the site of a proposed Nets basketball arena in Brooklyn, throwing up the first significant obstacle to Mr. Ratner's ambitious plan to create a dense urban hub at the eastern edge of Downtown Brooklyn.
 The plan, which would not include a sports arena, was drafted in close consultation with community advocates who oppose Mr. Ratner's project. It portends a potential replay of the heated and costly battle between Cablevision and the Jets football team over a proposal, now scuttled, for a stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. 
 The new bid was submitted by Gary Barnett of the Extell Development Company to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the railyards that would be the site of the development. It proposes the creation of a corridor of apartment buildings undulating over the yards, with shops, landscaped walkways, recreation areas and housing for roughly 4,800 people, according to plans made available to The New York Times.
 With 11 buildings ranging from 4 to 28 stories, the project would be substantially smaller than the proposal by Mr. Ratner and the architect Frank Gehry, which seeks to build a ridge of skyscrapers as high as 60 stories around the Nets arena, with office space, housing for up to 18,000 people and possibly a hotel. 
 The new plan is tailored to address some of the major criticisms of the Ratner proposal.
 ''This is a historic opportunity for the development and further revitalization of the property and the surrounding neighborhoods of Brooklyn,'' Mr. Barnett said in a statement. ''The scale of our proposed project and the amount of open space is contextual with the surrounding neighborhoods, and we look forward to working with the community.''
 Extell, a citywide real estate company, recently agreed to purchase a huge swath of riverfront land and three apartment buildings on the Upper West Side from a group of investors and Donald J. Trump.
 Neither of the competing developers yesterday would release the details of their bids, including how much each is willing to pay for the land. But the Extell proposal, unlike the Ratner plan, limits the project to a three-block area of Atlantic Avenue between Fifth and Vanderbilt Avenues. It would not require the use of eminent domain to seize properties in the area, nor would it permanently close city streets. 
 It would also not require public subsidies beyond $200 million from the city and state to build a platform over the rail beds and would be subject to the city's rigorous land-use review process. Mr. Ratner's plan would undergo review by the state. 
 ''These are the core principles we have been fighting for from the beginning, and we believe that it is their intention to work with the community,'' said Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, a coalition of groups opposed to Mr. Ratner's proposal.
 The bids by Mr. Ratner and Extell were the only ones submitted to the transportation authority by yesterday's deadline. The authority typically selects a winning bid on the basis of a variety of factors, not only how much money is initially put up, but also how much future revenue a project might generate.
 As a developer, Mr. Barnett has clashed with Mr. Ratner before. He sued to block a deal with the city and state for the development company Forest City Ratner to build an office tower for The New York Times Company in Midtown. That suit was unsuccessful, and Mr. Ratner is now the development partner for the new Times headquarters being built on Eighth Avenue.
 When Mr. Ratner first unveiled his Nets arena project in 2003, it was hailed by many in Brooklyn who saw the return of a professional sports team as evidence that the borough's resurgence was in full flower. Mr. Ratner was also able to build a base of support for the project among key government officials and community advocates who saw it as an economic engine for the borough and a source of jobs and low-cost housing.
 But at the same time, opposition quickly took hold among residents, community leaders and civic advocates who criticized planning discussions between the developer and government officials as exclusionary and secretive. 
 Critics have also charged that the scale of the development would choke already congested streets, displace residents and small businesses, tax city services, blot out sunlight and generally erode the quality of life in a borough known for its low-scale charms.
 When the transportation authority solicited bids in May, Mr. Goldstein said, his group sent out a solicitation of its own: about 100 letters to developers across the country inviting them to submit proposals. Extell responded, he said, met with the group and drafted a bid using, but not completely meeting, the group's own guidelines.
 As envisioned in Mr. Barnett's plan, designed by John Cetra and Nancy Ruddy, a husband-wife architectural team who live in Brooklyn, 10 apartment buildings, most of them either 17 or 28 stories tall, would wind in an S-curve from Fifth to Vanderbilt Avenues, between Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Street. One building, a four-story structure at Sixth and Atlantic Avenues, has been designated for community use, possibly as a school.
 The plan calls for street-level shops and restaurants in some of the apartment buildings, which would include 573 subsidized rental apartments and 1,373 market-rate condominiums. It would also provide 1,000 parking spaces.
 In addition, the project would allow for 167,137 square feet of open space, including landscaped walkways and terraces, sitting areas and recreation zones.
 The project, if approved, could be completed as soon as 2009, according to the plan. The Ratner development would be finished as early as 2011. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Tuesday about Frank Gehry's design for the first phase of the Grand Avenue development project in Los Angeles misstated the location of the proposed Atlantic Yards project that Mr. Gehry is designing in Brooklyn. (The error also appeared in sports articles on Feb. 9 and April 11, in the City section on Jan. 15 and in several articles in 2003, 2004 and 2005.) It is on rail yards and other land in Prospect Heights and on a block in Park Slope; it is not in Downtown Brooklyn, although it is near that neighborhood.

HEADLINE: When Ronnie Met Sandy

BYLINE: By Lou Cannon. 
Lou Cannon is the author of '', Ronald Reagan: A Life in Politics.''

DATELINE: Summerland, Calif. 

 BODY:
IN setting out his domestic agenda, President George W. Bush has made a point of following in the ideological footsteps of President Ronald Reagan. But if Mr. Bush wants to emulate his role model with his first Supreme Court appointment, he should give greater weight to politics and intuition than ideology. That was, after all, how Mr. Reagan chose Sandra Day O'Connor for the court in the first place. 
 The seeds of Justice O'Connor's appointment were planted in the 1980 presidential campaign. In mid-October, most surveys gave Mr. Reagan a narrow lead over President Jimmy Carter, but his political strategist Stuart K. Spencer worried about a trend in the campaign's private polls, which showed support slipping among women voters. Mr. Spencer discussed this ''gender gap'' with the candidate and suggested different ways of addressing it. Out of this discussion came a Reagan proposal to name a woman to the Supreme Court. 
Some true-blue conservatives on Mr. Reagan's staff were not thrilled. The first vacancy on the court might be the chief justice, they said. Would Mr. Reagan want a woman for that job? Mr. Reagan never really answered the question but mollified these critics by slightly watering down the proposal. In Los Angeles on Oct. 14, he promised to name a woman to ''one of the first Supreme Court vacancies in my administration.'' Mr. Spencer told me recently that he thought this hedge made the proposal less politically dramatic, but he had no doubt that Mr. Reagan meant to put a woman on the court. 
 With Americans held hostage in Iran and the economy in tatters, the proposal received little news media attention during a campaign that turned on other issues and Mr. Reagan's performance in a debate with Mr. Carter. Mr. Reagan won the debate and the election. The court was back-burner news in February 1981 when Justice Potter Stewart sent word to the new administration through Vice President George H.W. Bush that he intended to retire after the court's term ended in June. 
 When Mr. Reagan met with his aides to discuss a potential replacement, he recalled his promise and said he wanted a female justice. One of the aides reminded Mr. Reagan of his ''one of the first'' formulation. Mr. Reagan observed that President Carter had not had any Supreme Court vacancy to fill and said this one might be his only chance. After this exchange, it was clear that Mr. Reagan considered his campaign promise unambiguous, and Attorney General William French Smith, who had once been Mr. Reagan's lawyer in Hollywood, got the message. 
 Although Mr. Smith had a list of 20 candidates, including eight men, he never sent it to Mr. Reagan. The attorney general narrowed the list to four women, one of them a moderately conservative Arizona appeals court judge named Sandra Day O'Connor. 
 Because others on the list had more imposing legal credentials, Judge O'Connor was no sure thing. But she had a friend in court -- literally -- in William Rehnquist, then an associate justice, whom she had briefly dated when they were both students at Stanford Law School, and the endorsement of her home state senator, Barry Goldwater, then Mr. Conservative of the Republican Party. Attorney General Smith liked her, too. Most important, as Mr. Reagan later said, he was ''charmed'' by Judge O'Connor. When he interviewed her in the White House, they spent much of the time discussing horses and Judge O'Connor's childhood on an Arizona ranch. Mr. Reagan never interviewed anyone else. 
 The appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor involved more than personal chemistry. Mr. Reagan was no lawyer -- indeed, he delighted in telling anti-lawyer jokes -- but he was consistent in identifying the kind of people he wanted on the high court, or for that matter, any court. As Mr. Reagan saw it, judges should interpret the law, not make it, a broad and relatively inclusive conservative rubric that in his eyes embraced everyone from Sandra Day O'Connor to Antonin Scalia to Robert Bork to Anthony Kennedy. Mr. Reagan didn't believe in litmus tests and didn't ask Judge O'Connor how she would rule on specific issues. As far as I can determine, Mr. Reagan never put such a question to any judicial nominee. His reluctance to do so did not stop Senate conservatives from questioning Judge O'Connor about abortion, which she said she opposed. 
 While Mr. Reagan avoided a narrow judicial screening, he delighted in making a bold political statement. He liked the symbolism of being the first president to put a woman on the Supreme Court, and later, when he named Justice Scalia, being the first to nominate an Italian-American justice. Today, Mr. Reagan might have been tempted to make a similar splash by naming a Latino. 
 Times have changed, of course. Abortion is more of a touchstone issue than in 1981, when many conservatives shared the libertarian views of the Old Right, epitomized by Senator Goldwater and the mantra that government had ''no business in the board room or the bedroom.'' Mr. Reagan himself had signed a permissive abortion-rights bill as governor of California in 1967, although he later disavowed the measure. 
 Abortion aside, politics was also less polarized a generation ago; the present continuous cycle of confrontational and mean-spirited confirmation hearings on Supreme Court justices did not begin until the Senate rejected Mr. Bork in 1987. Mr. Reagan was angry at losing that confirmation battle, but he was unperturbed as Justice O'Connor moved slightly leftward on the court, upheld abortion rights, and became the centrist she is today. In his memoir, ''An American Life,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''she turned out to be everything I hoped for.''
 So far, President Bush seems to be steering a low-key, nonconfrontational course in his search for Justice O'Connor's replacement. Let's hope he keeps trimming his ideological sails and doesn't shrink from practical politics in making his decision. After all, our country and the court are arguably better off because Ronald Reagan insisted on keeping a promise he made during the heat of a presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Bid Was Worth a Shot, Even Long

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Charles V. Bagli, in New York, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Thursday, July 7 

 BODY:
He came here predicting outright victory, but after his hopes of winning the Olympics for New York collapsed Wednesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged what many others in the city had been saying for several years: the bid had been a long shot.
 Garnering only a handful of votes and falling behind three other cities was an embarrassing end to a quest that ultimately consumed a great deal of the mayor's time, resources and political capital.
 But speaking to reporters crammed into a hallway of the Raffles Hotel here after the elimination, the mayor said he had no regrets and offered only praise for the aide who led him down what ended up being a dead-end road of Olympic dreams, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. Along the way, they struggled against widespread public indifference at home, the failure of their West Side stadium plan and European opposition.
 As Mr. Doctoroff smiled wanly beside him, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''I don't think Dan could have done anything differently. It was, when we started this -- he knew it was a very high risk, if you will, process. The odds on winning were not good.'' 
 Not three hours after the loss to London -- and after his city had even finished behind the far less talked about proposal from Madrid -- Mr. Bloomberg was off to his private plane bound for New York. He left maintaining that the bid had been good for the city regardless, that it had helped spur development while raising the city's profile internationally. 
 ''This effort was a catalyst for getting a lot of things going,'' he said.
 The reverberations from the loss, of course, were far from over. Already his Democratic opponents had begun drafting statements portraying his bid as a wasted effort, just as they have long made the bid and the West Side stadium a subject of considerable scorn.
 His enthusiasm, however quixotic it may have seemed to those who did not share it, refused to be dampened. Despite the long odds the mayor cited Wednesday and the adversity that arose all along, he and Mr. Doctoroff had soldiered on, driven by an entrepreneurial spirit they shared as persistent businessmen who had made millions -- in Mr. Bloomberg's case, billions -- by taking big risks. Friends said they were also fired by a quest to identify their public lives with the kind of public monuments that have become rare in New York.
 More than that, though, Mr. Bloomberg and his aides said he never wavered because he ultimately became a true believer in what was already a mission for Mr. Doctoroff. His aide was an enormously successful young investment banker in 1994 when he had a struck-by-lightning experience at a World Cup semifinal soccer game between Italy and Bulgaria at Giants Stadium. 
 ''The stands were packed with screaming, flag-waving Italian and Bulgarian New Yorkers,'' Mr. Doctoroff told the Olympic voters during his presentation Wednesday. ''I wondered, why hasn't New York ever hosted the Olympic Games?''
 Mr. Doctoroff pursued his nascent plans for the Games by first courting the city's business titans, knowing it would take great corporate support, and Mr. Bloomberg became a donor. But they were still relative strangers when Nathan Leventhal, the former Lincoln Center president who headed Mr. Bloomberg's transition, asked Mr. Doctoroff to advise Mr. Bloomberg on prospects for an economic development czar, and to consider taking the job himself.
 Reminiscing Wednesday at the Ritz Carlton Hotel here before the vote, Mr. Doctoroff said he decided to meet with Mr. Bloomberg because he considered it an opportunity to build support for his Olympic quest.
 Mr. Bloomberg recalled being struck by a like-minded man, an established investment banker who was pursuing his Olympic goal the same way Mr. Bloomberg had built his business empire, Bloomberg L.P., in the face of predictions it would fail. 
 ''You make a decision based on instincts -- is this a guy who's honest and hard-working and can sell?'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a separate interview at the Ritz during a lull on Wednesday. ''In his business, you've got to stand a lot of down time and a lot of failures. You know, you go every day, you get knocked down, you've got to keep coming back, coming back, coming back, and Dan, what he did for a living, it was obvious to me he was one of those guys.''
 Mr. Doctoroff, seeing in Mr. Bloomberg a fellow businessman willing to push an agenda regardless of the politics, said he came out of the meeting ready to take the job, ultimately paying $1 a year, with a promise from Mr. Bloomberg that his Olympics agenda would become the city's Olympics agenda. 
 ''He's just a person who does what's right, he's not beholden to anyone, and that to me was really a very powerful opportunity,'' Mr. Doctoroff said.
 From the beginning, Mr. Doctoroff had also promoted a New York Olympics as a real chance to build up undeveloped parts of the city with the unusual assistance of corporate donations.
 ''I wouldn't have taken the job and he wouldn't have given it to me unless we were fundamentally in sync in how we thought about economic development,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, ''and seeing the Olympics as a way to achieve it.''
 Mr. Doctoroff cited the Williamsburg-Greenpoint redevelopment, the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, and, of course, the West Side rezoning approved by the City Council. That rezoning was intended in part to help pay for the ill-fated West Side stadium that was to serve the Olympics and become home to the Jets and big conventions.
 Now more than ever the miscalculation on the stadium -- from an attempt to push its acceptance through without state approval to the failure to foresee the multimillion-dollar effort by Cablevision to kill it -- seems to have been a fatal flaw in the Olympics bid. 
 ''All along, the stadium was the Achilles' heel of the plan,'' said Michael T. Cohen, chairman of the executive committee of GVA Williams, a downtown real estate company, who said he was supportive of the Olympics. ''So much time, effort and energy was expended unilaterally without the kind of grass-roots support that was needed to bring the Olympics to this city.''
 The privately financed group Mr. Doctoroff founded, NYC2012, put billboards and stickers promoting the bid on taxis, subways and buses while Mr. Bloomberg's team and the Jets built a coalition of support that included the Rev. Al Sharpton and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, major construction unions and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem. 
 Polls show that the West Side stadium was a considerable drain on public support for both the Olympics and Mr. Bloomberg. The blase reaction back home to the loss made it clear that whatever support the bid may have won among the city's elites, the populace had not caught City Hall's Olympic fever.
 Mr. Doctoroff logged 175,000 air miles in the last six months traveling around the world trying to build support for this week's Olympic vote. And, with a Queens replacement for the stadium in hand, Mr. Doctoroff believed he was making enough headway with International Olympic Committee members to have a long-shot victory in sight. City Hall was confident enough for the mayor to be willing to call Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton personally for the final push here.
 Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Doctoroff and others involved in the process said Mr. Bloomberg's support for his deputy never wavered. (The two did, however, publicly argue over their final presentation during one rehearsal earlier this week, a result, according to people who were present, of the tension they were feeling heading into the vote and nothing else.)
 Mr. Bloomberg said Wednesday that he wanted and expected Mr. Doctoroff to stay on for new fights during a second term, should he win one in November.
 ''The people who say when you lose it's bad, in the world that I come from and Dan comes from, it's another deal,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''You go on.''
 He added, ''If you're not going to be around when it delivers, so what? You will, even if the public doesn't know, you'll know that you did it.''

HEADLINE: A Deft Balance In Orchestrating China's Oil Offer

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN; Steve Lohr contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 6 

 BODY:
Fu Chengyu, the chairman of Cnooc Ltd., says that profits, not politics, are behind China's most ambitious takeover bid, his company's $18.5 billion proposal to buy the Unocal Corporation.
 Strategic energy policy and the whims of Beijing leaders do not concern him much, Mr. Fu, an English-speaking, American-trained executive, said. ''I have no talent for politics,'' he said, ''only business.''
 Yet Mr. Fu, who is also Cnooc's Communist Party secretary, recently made the company a showcase for President Hu Jintao's political campaign ''to keep party members in the vanguard.'' China's leading official newspaper, The People's Daily, prominently cited an aphorism Mr. Fu coined, ''Excelling at political work makes us stronger competitors.'' 
 As Cnooc attempts China's largest foreign acquisition, Mr. Fu faces delicate dual tasks. He has had to prove his political reliability to Chinese leaders even as he works to persuade the United States that his company cares only about commerce.
 For all of China's economic growth along market models, the Communist Party still holds sway over big investments and personnel appointments at the elite state-owned businesses. Suspicions of political motives behind Cnooc's offer to buy Unocal have already fueled opposition to the deal in Washington.
 Philip Andrews-Speed, an expert on China's energy industry at the University of Dundee in Scotland, remarked: ''China's energy strategy is to make its oil companies into major players globally. But to accomplish that, they may have to show that the companies are not in fact following a government strategy.''
 Chinese officials, with $650 billion in foreign exchange reserves, have been urging the biggest and best-known companies to go out into the world to acquire technology, expand their markets and emulate Western multinationals.
 Yet in the critical areas of energy and high technology, the largest Chinese companies are often viewed as mercantilist fronts for a one-party state, focused more on serving China's needs than pursuing profits.
 Ultimately, China's full integration into the global economy could depend on whether companies like Cnooc establish a convincing commercial track record abroad -- or on political change in Beijing.
 Cnooc has always been a hybrid. It owes its existence to a government directive in 1982 that anointed it as the joint-venture partner for overseas companies exploring for oil in Chinese waters. The company is now in the inner sanctum of the top 50 state-owned companies, many of them with the political leverage of government ministries. It takes on risky exploration projects in disputed waters of the East China Sea. 
 Cnooc's public relations line during the battle for Unocal has been enforced by the powerful Propaganda Department of the Communist Party, local journalists and editors said. 
 On the other hand, Cnooc is unusually lean and profit-driven. It employs just over 2,500 people and offers few of the social perks, like schools, housing and hospitals, that bloat the budgets of most big government-run enterprises. 
 The company's shares trade in Hong Kong. Outside directors on its board have a real say in the company's affairs, initially delaying its plans to buy Unocal for further study. Company managers hone their skills in partnerships with Western concerns.
 Mr. Fu and Cnooc's public relations teams in Beijing, Hong Kong, Dallas and Washington emphasize that the bid for Unocal should be seen as a matter of market economics, not politics. That capitalist-flavor appeal has been amplified by the company's American lobbyists and media advisers, the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and Public Strategies.
 ''The idea of buying Unocal was purely initiated by our company,'' Mr. Fu said during an interview in his spacious office suite overlooking the diplomatic quarter of Beijing. ''The idea did not come from the government, and not one cent of government money is involved in the deal.''
 Mr. Fu, 54, speaks English with only a hint of a Chinese accent, having learned the language when he got his master's degree at the University of Southern California. He spent his early years at Cnooc working in joint ventures with foreign companies, including Chevron, his rival in the bidding for Unocal.
 He has cultivated a Western image, telling visitors that he prefers coffee to tea for the extra caffeine jolt it gives him and hinting that he thinks like a maverick, not a politically correct steward of one of the country's influential businesses.
 Asked about his relations with Chinese leaders, he jokes that there are few he can talk to. 
 ''I don't think there's anybody in the government who understands our business,'' he said. 
 Yet whether or not they understand, there are signs that they care. Cnooc has followed a path set by the Politburo and repeated by President Hu as recently as last week, when he told a Politburo session on energy, ''We must enthusiastically push ahead with international cooperation to develop energy resources and fully make use of international markets.''
 The company's proposal to buy Unocal was vetted by the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and ultimately approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, two people briefed on Cnooc's negotiations said. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the Chinese central bank, helped put together the financial package, these people said.
 The terms of the financing reflect Cnooc's elite status. In addition to injecting its own cash and using bridge loans from J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, its investment bankers, the company will rely on a big bridge loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest state-owned commercial bank, and a capital infusion from its parent.
 Cnooc says the loan from the bank was made on commercial terms. But at $6 billion, it is exceptionally large by Chinese standards. It comes shortly after Beijing transferred $15 billion from its foreign-currency reserves to the Industrial and Commercial Bank to help it prepare for its initial public offering.
 China National Offshore Oil, the parent of Cnooc Ltd., will provide $7 billion. Cnooc agreed to pay back $2.5 billion, interest-free, by offering new shares within two years. Some $4.5 billion is payable over 30 years at the relatively low interest rate of 3.5 percent.
 Mr. Fu acknowledged that the government reviewed the financing. But he said this was only because Cnooc wanted to use domestic funds overseas, requiring a relaxation of foreign exchange controls. He said the bank loan, while large, was ''entirely commercial,'' and the infusion from the parent company should not be considered political either.
 The contention that the deal is devoid of politics has become a propaganda theme in China. Newspaper journalists said they were instructed last week by the Propaganda Department to write about only the commercial implications of the Unocal purchase, not its strategic value.
 Liu Jianchao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, emphasized the same point when asked at a news briefing about the objections of members of the United States Congress.
 ''I think this is normal business activity,'' he said. ''The relevant people should not make a fuss and should not interfere in business deals for political reasons.''
 But some trade experts say that Cnooc may have miscalculated in thinking that its free-market argument would be persuasive, and underestimated the protests its bid would provoke in Congress. ''The reaction shows how much ambivalence there is in the United States about China and the globalization it represents,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz, a trade official in the Reagan administration and president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. ''And as a rising military power, China is not viewed as a strategic partner but as a strategic competitor.''
 Overseas, it is Cnooc's sister oil and gas companies, the China National Petroleum Corporation and the China National Petrochemical Corporation, known as Sinopec, that often undertake the most politically and diplomatically sensitive energy projects. China's energy ties to Iran and Sudan, which have put it at odds with American foreign policy, do not involve Cnooc.
 But Cnooc has taken the lead in developing offshore gas deposits in the East China Sea, throwing itself into the center of a hot political dispute between China and Japan, which both claim the rights to develop reserves there.
 The East China Sea project suffered a setback late last year when Cnooc's two foreign partners in the richest discovery, the Xihu Trough, withdrew. The two, Shell and Unocal, were recruited in part for their expertise in deepwater exploration.
 Shell and Unocal cited commercial reasons for dropping out. But they pulled back at a time of rising animosity between China and Japan, also a big importer of oil. By buying Unocal, Cnooc could again make use of the American company's technology in the East China Sea and in other ventures. 
 Mr. Fu said the withdrawal of Shell and Unocal had no bearing on the decision to buy Unocal. He said that he did not consider the Xihu Trough an especially difficult challenge and that the technology for ocean exploration was available elsewhere.
 However sincere his focus on commerce, politics and business do mix in China's state-guided market economy. Mr. Fu's predecessor as Cnooc's leader, Wei Liucheng, shepherded the company through its overseas share listing. He is now governor of Hainan Province.
 Mr. Fu said he expected no such reward, whether or not Cnooc acquired Unocal. ''I feel confident that in 10 years I can make Cnooc one of the world's leading oil companies,'' he said. ''But if someone places me in the government, I am sure my performance will be much worse.''

HEADLINE: Bush Arrives at Summit Session, Ready to Stand Alone

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ALAN COWELL; Richard W. Stevenson reported from Glasgow for this article, and Alan Cowell from Gleneagles.

DATELINE: GLASGOW, Scotland, July 6 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived in Scotland on Wednesday for a summit meeting of the big industrial nations after signaling that he would not budge on one of the most contentious issues dividing the United States from its allies -- how best to address global warming. 
 Mr. Bush reached the site of the meeting, the golf resort of Gleneagles, under heavy security and amid skirmishes between the police and protesters, who say the leaders of the eight nations gathered there have done too little to meet their pledge of making real progress in attacking poverty and disease in Africa.
 Mr. Bush's approach to the environment is one of several topics on which he is at odds with other governments as well as public opinion in much of the world. 
 Before flying to Scotland from Denmark, he vigorously defended his foreign policy at a news conference with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Mr. Bush said that there was ''total transparency'' at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba and that the International Red Cross was free to inspect the center at any time. To those Europeans skeptical of his claims, Mr. Bush said he would ''suggest buying an airplane ticket'' and going to ''take a look for yourself.''
 Mr. Bush said the war in Iraq had been justified despite its unpopularity in many nations, saying the conflict was ''laying the foundation for peace.'' And he sought to counter criticism that the United States has been stingy in providing aid to Africa, saying his administration had taken a leading role in fighting AIDS and malaria there, and had promised to double aid from current levels by 2010. 
 He was especially pointed in asserting his view that the other big democracies were going down the wrong path in insisting that curbing global warming requires a commitment to numerical goals for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. 
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, the host of the meeting of the Group of 8 leaders, has been laboring to find some compromise on the issue for the United States to join the other industrial nations in a commitment to taking action against global warming. 
 At the news conference, Mr. Bush acknowledged there was a problem, saying, ''I recognize that the surface of the earth is warmer and that an increase in greenhouse gases caused by humans is contributing to the problem.''
 But he made clear that he wanted to depart from the thinking behind the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that sets targets for lowering emission and that Mr. Bush rejected early in his first term. The agreement has been ratified by the other Group of 8 nations, and the leaders of China and India are scheduled to join the talks about global warming on Thursday. 
 ''The reason it didn't work for the world is many developing nations weren't included in Kyoto,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I've also told our friends in Europe that Kyoto would have wrecked our economy. I don't see how you can be president of the United States and agree to an agreement that would have put a lot of people out of work.''
 Mr. Bush said it was time to move on to a ''post-Kyoto era,'' in which all nations concentrate on developing technologies that reduce emissions rather than on imposing quotas on emissions.
 Mr. Blair later signaled that there was little hope of achieving his goal of agreement on concrete commitments to reduce emissions, but said the summit meeting would nonetheless succeed in focusing attention on the problem. 
 ''What I hope at this summit is that we can set a different direction of travel that gives us a possibility, when Kyoto expires in 2012, of getting an international consensus,'' he said in an interview with Sky News of Britain.
 Along with the debate over climate change, aid to Africa will be the big issue taken up at the meeting, where Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush have been joined by the leaders of the other Group of 8 countries, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia. 
 After arriving at Gleneagles, Mr. Bush met with Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, who has led a worldwide public relations campaign to cancel debts owed by African governments and provide more direct aid to the world's poorest nations. Earlier, in Denmark, Prime Minister Rasmussen gently chided the United States and the other big industrial democracies for not doing more, saying Denmark was far more generous. 
 ''In fact, if all G-8 countries matched our effort, Africa would get $90 billion a year, instead of only $25 billion,'' he said, glancing at Mr. Bush. 
 In Scotland, police officers in riot gear fought a day of skirmishes with protesters who blocked roads leading to Gleneagles.
 The clashes began early in the day as hooded demonstrators in Edinburgh walked across roads ahead of buses carrying journalists and others on the 40-mile drive to the resort. Some protesters chained themselves together across the M9 highway, forcing its closing for four hours.
 The most serious clashes, still far from the violence of some earlier Group of 8 meetings, came in midafternoon, when hundreds of demonstrators broke away from a peaceful march and tried to breach a steel security fence thrown up around the Gleneagles estate.
 The police flew in reinforcements by helicopter and, with batons, charged after protesters who fled across a field. Mounted police officers also confronted protesters, some of whom carried banners saying ''Fight Poverty, Not War, Bring the Troops Home'' and chanted slogans like ''They say drop bombs, we say drop the debt.''

HEADLINE: Ireland's Success Story

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman (''Follow the Leapin' Leprechaun,'' column, July 1) argues that Germany and France must either follow Ireland and adopt the Anglo-Saxon social model or become ''museums.''
He is right that low labor costs have been a key to Ireland's success. But making it easier to fire workers was not what made the difference; the Irish ''social model'' has changed little since the early 1990's, when unemployment was 15 percent. 
 Far more important was government-led coordination of collective bargaining and tax policy.
 The Anglo-Saxon free-market model is not the only viable alternative. Germany and France will be more successful if they look to models closer to home, like the Netherlands, Norway and Austria, three strong welfare states with labor regulations similar to those of Germany and France, but with unemployment rates lower than the United States and with employment rates much more impressive than Ireland's. 
 And they've done it without Ireland's Anglo-Saxon levels of inequality and poverty!

HEADLINE: In Americans, Lurking Fears Rise to Surface

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO; Reporting for this article was contributed by Anthony Ramirez, Colin Moynihan and Robin Shulman, in New York; Carolyn Marshall, in San Francisco; Katie Zezima, in Boston; Terry Aguayo, in Miami; and David Bernstein, in Chicago.

 BODY:
Even on a roaring uptown No. 6 train in Manhattan, there is a certain kind of quiet that veteran riders can sometimes sense. And yesterday, when the morning rush seemed almost to shiver in the aftershock of a terrorist attack on commuters in London five hours earlier, was one such time.
 It is the quiet of being reminded that one's entire life, if it is lived in any urban area of this country, is a soft target.
 ''You notice it in the vibe of the train,'' said Geoff Hoffman, an uptown No. 6 rider who described himself as a painter. ''Everyone's brow is furrowed. Everyone's thinking about it. Just look around.'' 
 It is usually hard to say what everyone is thinking about, but yesterday you could say it: ''It's dangerous to live here,'' said Craig Fols, an actor. ''But I thought this through after 9/11. It's a kind of danger I'm going to live with.''
 In Chicago, Boston, Miami and San Francisco, people said similar things yesterday, whether with a certain bravado, or on the legs of denial, or from a more tentative resolve. ''When I stop to think about it, I don't feel very safe,'' said Nancy LaMantia, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., business owner. ''But then again, on a day-to-day basis, I feel fine.''
 The American psyche, if such a four-time-zone mind exists, has for the past four years been poised somewhere between the frantic alarm of Sept. 11, 2001, and the daily routine of the low-grade anxiety that has replaced it. But with a bombing in the heart of a world capital like London -- a capital so closely related to America culturally -- that equilibrium seems lost, and in its place yesterday, you could sense the raw emotion, and even the fatalism behind it.
 ''It's only a matter of time before something happens in New York again,'' said Jason Falk of Brooklyn. He described his certainty about his statement as ''definitive.''
 Phil Spencer, a sales executive from Kansas City who was interviewed in Chicago, said: ''Things are just not the same as they were before 9/11. ''It's just different. I wouldn't call it a sense of fear. Call it a sense of awareness.''
 Since 9/11, public officials have asked Americans to walk a fine line between the real likelihood of further attacks and the real demands of keeping their society -- the world's largest economy, and the ultimate bulwark against world terrorism -- humming at full strength.
 It's a trick not everyone has managed to pull off.
 ''It's like we live in two parallel existences,'' said Peter King, a Republican congressman from Long Island who is chairman of a House subcommittee on emergency preparedness. ''You know something could happen, and yet you don't want to alarm people constantly, or get too specific in your recommendations.''
 Indeed, some law enforcement officials, including those in New York, have admitted for years to being stumped about why terrorists, clearly capable of the spectacular attack, have so far not tried to hit the vulnerable transportation systems of this country's major cities.
 There are, of course, some protections in place. But, said one high-ranking New York law enforcement official, ''If you absolutely wanted to, you could do it. My feeling is, it's a matter of time.''
 Why such a time has not come may be a matter of good police work or good luck on the part of Americans. But many of the latter made it clear they would prefer something more solid to bank on.
 ''They should give us guidelines, offer some solutions,'' said Catherine Crawford, a nursing student interviewed on the subway. ''It's unnerving.''
 Most of the antiterrorism preparations are vast government initiatives. They include such programs as border and port security, biological research, military intelligence and, of course, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which President Bush has justified, in part, as a strategy for keeping the terrorists over there rather than over here.
 But Americans yesterday voiced some concerns about terror preparedness at the micro-level. ''You know, I feel most vulnerable probably in my home drinking my water from my tap, or something like that,'' said Nicole Hardesty, 31, a grade school teacher from Evanston, Ill. ''If something's going to happen, I'm thinking it's going to happen like that.''
 From interviews, there seemed to be as many strategies for handling the anxiety of the possible next attack as there are people in the nation. 
 Denis Peters, 43, a real estate developer in Miami, said he never used public transportation. Olivia Suchman, 30, an urban planner in San Francisco, said she kept herself focused on ''how life is precious,'' and avoided thinking about the ruthless brutality of some people in the world. 
 ''I don't even let my mind go there,'' she said. 
 Johnnie Lane, 48, an air-conditioning salesman from Manhattan, said, ''When your time is up, your time is up.''
 Kathy Reul, 44, a health care worker from Queens, confided to a reporter: ''I drink a beer every day on the subway. I don't have it in a cup. I have not seen a police officer on a subway train in a long time. If I can get away with having a beer, I can get away with having a bomb.''
 Norris Beren, the author of ''When Disaster Strikes,'' a planning guide, says that people should not give in to fatalism. ''Everyone should have a plan,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''If an attack happens, an d you cannot use a phone, and you cannot go home, you should have a plan in place. You should know who will back you up and pick up your kids from school. You should know where you will go, by pre-arrangement, to meet a family member.'' The more a person has planned ahead, the better off he or she will be in a crunch, he said.
 In the streets yesterday, the war on terror proceeded apace by improvisations both large and small.
 ''Don't put your hands in the bags,'' a police officer gently instructed a tour guide, watching as the guide followed company orders yesterday at Times Square by opening and searching all handbags and shopping bags of tourists boarding his Gray Line double-decker.
 ''If something turns up missing, they'll accuse you of stealing,'' said the officer to the guide, Jonathon Council of Amityville, N.Y.
 ''Oh, thanks, I wouldn't have thought of that,'' said the tour guide, a brand new soldier in the war on terror, cheerfully returning to his searching. This time he was careful to feel each bag from the outside and look inside without touching.
 ''Like this?'' Mr. Council said.
 ''Good,'' said the officer.

HEADLINE: Safe Deposit Boxes Multiply in Banks Downtown

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A feng shui master has already checked the new Commerce Bank building that will open today at 155 Canal Street in Chinatown to confirm ''that everything is facing the right way,'' said William G. Leung, the manager of the new branch.
 Befitting its prominent corner location in Chinatown, at Bowery Street, the bank will have trilingual cash machines in Chinese, English and Spanish. And its 30 employees will converse in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as in English.
It is hardly a coincidence, furthermore, that today, the eighth, because some people of Chinese descent consider eight a lucky number, ''is a fortunate day, good for business,'' said Mr. Leung. 
 Oh. One more thing. 
 The new bank will have 7,500 safe deposit boxes, instead of 500 in the average Commerce branch. ''Culturally, this is something very different for us,'' said Gregory B. Braca, a senior vice president of the company who manages the 38 branches in New York City. 
 In fact, construction work on the bank was nearing completion in January until ''we began hearing that we needed more safe deposit boxes,'' Mr. Braca recalled. ''We didn't know. So we began rebuilding from the bottom up, until we had a brand new building -- and an extra floor, just for the boxes.'' 
 Chinatown, in fact, is safe deposit box country, one aspect of the highly competitive, and escalating, bank war in the neighborhood. Across the street from the new banking interloper, the domed HSBC branch at 58 Bowery has 21,000 safe deposit boxes. And the HSBC branch at 11 East Broadway has 12,000. 
 What is going on here?
 ''There is a waiting list for safe deposit boxes in Chinatown, and that can become Commerce Bank's competitive advantage,'' said Charles Lai, executive director of the Museum of Chinese in the Americas at 70 Mulberry Street. A safe deposit box ''gives you a sense of privacy,'' said David S. Chen, the executive director of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a community group that provides social services. ''Chinese don't flaunt their wealth, especially the old-timers. And when you have a bank statement, anyone could know how much you have.''
 Some Chinese immigrants live principally in a cash economy, with many family members pooling their income, Mr. Chen said. 
 And immigrants sharing rented rooms ''don't want to keep their valuables around,'' Mr. Lai said, ''since keeping everything under the mattress was for the 1940's and 1950's.'' 
 Many apartments are small, and so residents entrust to the boxes items like cash, significant paperwork, bankbooks, checkbooks, sentimental photographs, mementos and jewelry, ''because it's portable and can be worth a lot of money,'' Mr. Chen said. 
 ''My parents are a good example,'' said Paul W. Ho, senior vice president for the Asian market domain at HSBC Bank U.S.A., a unit of HSBC Holdings Corporation. ''Every time they get invited to a wedding, they go to the safe deposit box. They retrieve their jewelry, and go to the wedding. Then they put it back. That's my mom.''
 It is the first Commerce Bank assault on the neighborhood, where some other competitors are long established. For example, as the modern-day descendent of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, HSBC established its first Chinatown branch 28 years ago at 50 Bowery Street. Now it has three branches, Mr. Ho said, ''and we're opening up another one soon.'' 
 Indeed, there are more than 30 bank branches in Chinatown, Mr. Leung said, and the number continues to grow. Within three blocks of the new Commerce branch are a Citibank, an Abacus Federal Savings Bank, a United Orient Bank, a Chinatrust Bank and a Bank of East Asia. 
 Why so many? ''It's like the man said when they asked him why do you rob banks?'' Mr. Braca said. ''Because that's where the money is.''
 Financial institutions are responding to the high savings rates of Chinese-American residents, Mr. Lai said. ''Saving isn't just for a rainy day -- when you see your entire life as a rainy day,'' he added. ''Saving is an important part of the safety net -- in a mattress or in a bank.'' 
 Banks are also proliferating because ''though Chinese may live in other neighborhoods, many open their accounts in Chinatown,'' Mr. Chen said. ''When I came here 30 years ago, I lived in Brooklyn but I opened up my bank account on Mott Street.''
 Indeed, Manhattan has only 24 percent of the city's Chinese-Americans, or 90,158, according to the 2000 census ; 71 percent live in Brooklyn and Queens. Those of Chinese descent make up the largest Asian-American group in New York City, nearly half of the Asian-Americans in the city. Three-fourths of them are immigrants. 
 As a consequence, ''Chinatown is an important economic engine for the banking industry in the city,'' Mr. Lai said. The aggregate deposits in Chinatown bank branches exceed $5.4 billion, according to a study by the Asian American Federation of New York, a nonprofit public policy organization. 
 ''Plenty of competition is good for everybody,'' said Mr. Ho of HSBC.The 7,000-square-foot Commerce Bank branch will feature speckled white marble floors, blond figured-anigre wood, jazzy red neon striping and the company's distinctive red logo, ''a fortunate coincidence,'' Mr. Braca said, ''since our color signifies good luck.'' 
 Deposit boxes at the new branch will cost $50 to $250 a year, depending on their size. The bank will be open seven days a week; its Sunday hours will be 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, ''Chinatown had seven-day banking more than a decade ago because it's busier on the weekend,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Many Chinese who moved out of the neighborhood come back on weekends to shop, to buy food, to get a newspaper, and to visit relatives.''
 Like some of its other competitors, Commerce Bank will provide customer-service workers to make it easy for patrons to wire money transfers and buy money orders ''since many immigrants have families back home, and they send them money,'' Mr. Lai said.
 Like its Chinatown competitors, Commerce Bank will go after retail consumers, small businesses and nonprofit organizations. ''It's so important to know everyone here,'' said Kelvin Kan, the commercial banking director in the new Commerce branch. ''In Chinatown, it's all about credibility.''
 Therefore, the bank has sought local expertise in hiring its personnel, including Mr. Kan, who worked for HSBC for 10 years, and Mr. Leung, who has been a manager at North Fork Bank and Citibank.
 To attract customers, the bank is sponsoring a lion dance promotion today at noon, as well as clowns, balloons, free hot dogs, pretzels and, bien sur, dim sum. 
 And since it's Chinatown, there will be a raffle for the luckiest deposit box of them all: 888, since ''many depositors want an account with lucky number eight at the end or the beginning,'' Mr. Leung said. 
 Not to mention four raffles today and tomorrow, Mr. Leung said, ''for prizes of $888 in cash.''

HEADLINE: Our Ally, Our Problem

BYLINE: By Peter Bergen.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
AS the shock waves from yesterday's terrorist attacks in London -- which seem to be the work of jihadist militants -- reverberate across the Atlantic, a grim truth should become increasingly clear: one of the greatest terrorist threats to the United States emanates not from domestic sleeper cells or, as is popularly imagined, from the graduates of Middle Eastern madrassas, but from some of the citizens of its closest ally, Britain. 
 Richard C. Reid, the ''shoe bomber'' who tried to blow up an American Airlines jet flying between Paris and Miami in 2001, is British. So is Saajid Badat, who pled guilty in London four months ago to plotting to use a shoe bomb similar to Mr. Reid's to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in late 2001. And Ahmed Omar Sheik, who orchestrated the 2002 kidnapping-murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, is a British citizen of Pakistani descent who graduated from the London School of Economics. 
In 2004 British police arrested 12 terrorist suspects, many of them British citizens (including Qaeda operative Abu Issa al-Hindi), who were allegedly plotting attacks both in Britain and the United States. American law enforcement officials accuse Mr. Hindi of leading the surveillance of financial targets in New York and Washington between August 2000 and April 2001. Those targets included the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Prudential building in Newark and the New York Stock Exchange. 
 And two years ago, British citizens engaged in a highly unusual suicide attack outside the country, a foreshadowing of how such an attack might be mounted in the United States. On April 30, 2003, two Britons of Pakistani descent walked into Mike's Place, a jazz club near the American Embassy in Israel. Once inside, the younger of the two men succeeded in detonating a bomb, killing himself and three bystanders, while the other man fled the scene. If such an attack can happen in Israel, a country with the most rigorous counterterrorist defenses in the world, it can also happen here.
 Why have so many of these terrorists come from Britain? Many British Muslims are young and poorly integrated into society and therefore vulnerable to extremism. In fact, Muslims have the youngest age profile of any religious group in Britain; around a third are under the age of 16. The unemployment rate among British Muslims runs almost 10 percentage points above the national average of about 5 percent. In the case of 16- to 24-year-old Muslim men, the unemployment rate is 22 percent. Not surprisingly, polls of British Muslims show a considerable sense of anger. Eight out of 10 believe that the war on terrorism is a war on Islam, while a poll conducted last year, under the auspices of the Guardian newspaper, found a surprising 13 percent who said that further attacks by Al Qaeda or a similar organization on the United States would be justified. One rap video that surfaced in Britain last year called ''Dirty Kuffar'' had lyrics that included the following verse: ''O.B.L. [bin Laden] pulled me like a shining star! Like the way we destroyed them two towers, ha-ha!''
 Last year a British government report estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 British Muslims are supporters of Al Qaeda or related groups. The estimate was based on intelligence, opinion polls and a report that 10,000 Muslims attended a 2003 conference held by Hizb ut-Tahrir, described by the Home Office as a ''structured extremist organization.'' British authorities believe that between 300 and 600 British citizens were trained in Qaeda and Taliban camps in Afghanistan. For this reason, and because of Britain's relatively permissive asylum laws, Arab militants living in London sometimes jokingly refer to their hometown as Londonistan. 
 Here's the problem for the United States: Under our Visa Waiver Program, residents of Londonistan who hold a valid British passport can board a plane for the United States without an interview by an American consular official. 
 This program also applies to more than a score of other European countries, like France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, that meet the criteria for visa-free travel to the United States. Unfortunately, while these countries may enjoy a low visa refusal rate, grant reciprocal visa-free travel to Americans and issue machine-readable passports -- all criteria for inclusion in the waiver program -- many of them have also had a hard time integrating their growing Muslim populations. Even before yesterday's attacks, there was plenty of evidence from episodes like the Madrid bombings in 2004 that these countries contained sleeper cells with the ability and motivation to carry out major terrorist operations and even, perhaps, to attack the United States itself. 
 As declining populations in Europe are replaced in part by rising Muslim emigration from the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, economic resentment and sectarian strife seem likely to grow. Tinkering with visa regulations might help, but it is unlikely to change the reality that Islamic militant groups in Britain, as in several other major European countries, represent a growing threat to the United States that will continue for many years to come.

The London Stock Exchange remained open after the terrorist attacks, though the market closed lower after setting a trading volume record. [C7.]

Experts said photographs from the London attacks, taken with cellphone cameras and digital cameras, were posted online in greater numbers and with greater speed than they had seen in past major events. [A12.]

In 2006, the program will begin paying for prescription drugs for its 43 million members. [C9.]

Retailers' Sales Show Increases for June
Nearly across the board, retail sales increased in June, from luxury to midmarket to discount. The reasons were varied: hotter weather, hotter fashion, more markdowns and less concern about gas prices than experts had anticipated. [C1.]

Family Pursues a Tax Shelter Case
Among the civil lawsuits filed by dozens of individuals against the accounting firm KPMG over sham tax shelters, one case stands out because of its size -- $188 million -- and because it is a rare example of an entire family buying a bogus shelter. [C1.]

Chip Maker Gets Its Story, and Its Name, Out Front
Hector Ruiz, left, chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, would like you to understand exactly why his company is suing Intel, its larger and much-better-known rival.

New Claims for Jobless Benefits Rise
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance benefits rose by 7,000 to 319,000 last week, with a significant portion of the rise related to temporary layoffs in the auto and school sectors, the Labor Department said. [C9.]

Schwab Says It Plans to Stay Independent
The Charles Schwab Corporation, the discount broker, said it had no interest in being acquired after its shares surged on speculation that it might be a takeover candidate. [C7.]

Credit Card Processor Hires Security Auditor
CardSystems Solutions, the credit card payment processor at the center of one of the biggest data breaches in recent history, said that it had hired a security auditor and that it hoped to comply with the industry's security standards by the end of August. [C4.]

Wary Eastern Europeans Look to Russia Again
When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did trade between Russia and the Eastern European countries it had so long controlled. Only in the last couple of years have East European companies begun to cast off many of the suspicions and rediscover the huge market to their east. [C4.]

HEADLINE: Leadership Dispute Causes a Split in a Powerhouse of Fund-Raising for Conservative Causes

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
A rift among the handful of millionaires behind the Club for Growth, a conservative fund-raising powerhouse, has degenerated into accusations of stolen donor lists and betrayed principles.
 The dispute began in December when Stephen Moore, the organization's president, was privately ousted by the group's board and publicly announced his resignation. But as the disagreement becomes public, it threatens to confuse or divide other supporters of the group. 
 Mr. Moore, along with some prominent club members including Arthur B. Laffer, a board member, along with Mallory Factor, a businessman, started a similar group, the Free Enterprise Fund. Three others on the previous five-member board -- Thomas L. Rhodes, a former partner in Goldman Sachs and president of National Review; Richard Gilder, a fund manager; and Jackson T. Stephens, of the Arkansas banking dynasty -- remained. 
 The dispute spilled out into the group's broader membership in late May, when Mr. Moore sent many of the club's members a fund-raising letter for his new group. ''As you may have heard, I left the Club for Growth after I lost control of a board fight and was forced to resign as president and C.E.O. -- despite our fabulous electoral successes in 2004,'' Mr. Moore wrote in the letter. 
 ''To see the club splintered this way was a heart-breaking tragedy, but the good news is most of the original founding committee members of the old Club for Growth that we built into such a political juggernaut helped me launch the Free Enterprise Fund,'' he continued. He said he was leaving to join The Wall Street Journal's editorial board and turning the new group over to Mr. Factor, adding that there remained ''a crying need'' for an organization to hold Republican officials' ''feet to the fire.''
 In response, lawyers for the club sent Mr. Moore and his new group letters threatening legal action, accusing him of having stolen the club's mailing list. ''We know of no source from which the Free Enterprise Fund lawfully could have obtained the mailing list used for the May 26 letter,'' said a letter dated June 21. ''The club is preparing to forcefully pursue legal remedies,'' including a suit for damages and a complaint to the Federal Election Commission, the letter continued.
 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Factor dismissed the accusations, saying that the new group had obtained its mailing list legitimately from third parties. 
 For his part, Mr. Factor accused the club of betraying its free-market principles by turning to regulators to squelch a competitor. ''This country was built on competition,'' he said. ''The only people who get threatened by competition are the ones without new ideas,'' who, instead of building a better mousetrap, ''have lawyers and the government shut down the other guy's mousetrap.''
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity because they had pledged confidentiality to the board, current and former Club for Growth board members on both sides of the dispute said the tone reflected lingering animosity around Mr. Moore's ouster. Mr. Moore's opponents in the organization accused him of being a sloppy manager. They complained that he made caustic comments to the news media about President Bush and others, irking other board members. 
 Some faulted what they called Mr. Moore's disorganized management in part for the narrow defeat of Representative Pat Toomey, one of the candidates the club backed most heavily, in his Republican primary challenge to Senator Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania. When polls showed Mr. Toomey lagging badly a few weeks before the primary, Mr. Moore pulled back from greater spending. When the gap narrowed to just a few thousand votes in the end, some wondered if he had lost faith prematurely.
 Mr. Moore's supporters, including Mr. Factor, credited him with helping the club raise and spend $20 million on the 2004 election, after taking it over with almost nothing in the bank six years ago.
 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Toomey, the new president of the Club for Growth, said the organization was dropping its accusations about the mailing lists and defended its initial vigilance. ''We simply sent the letter asking, 'How did you obtain this list?''' he said. ''We have an obligation to defend the privacy of our members.'' He contended that the suggestion that the Club for Growth resented competition was ''ridiculous.''
 ''If they want to do the same thing that we do, they are welcome,'' he said. ''It is a free country. If they are going to add a voice for economic freedom, I say more power to them.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise Slightly On Layoffs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance benefits rose by 7,000 last week, with a significant portion of the rise related to temporary layoffs in the auto and school sectors, the government said on Thursday.
 First-time claims for state benefits rose to 319,000 in the week that ended July 2 from a revised 312,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. 
Analysts had forecast a rise to 319,000 from 310,000 in the week ended June 25.
 A Labor Department analyst attributed a ''significant portion'' of the increase in claims to layoffs in the automobile industry, which has begun its annual shutdown for model changes, and to layoffs of temporary employees of school systems, like bus drivers and cafeteria workers.
 The closely watched four-week moving average of claims fell for the third consecutive week, slipping to 320,500 from 324,000 the previous week. It was the lowest level since March 5.
 The number of people who remained on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of benefits fell 16,000, to 2.58 million, in the week ended June 25, the latest week with numbers available.

INTERNATIONAL A2-14

37 Are Killed in Attack On London Mass Transit
Bomb explosions tore through three subway trains and a red-painted double-decker bus in a coordinated terror attack during London's morning rush hour, killing at least 37 people, injuring about 700 and leaving the city stunned and bloodied but oddly stoic. A1

Investigators searching for clues in the attacks say the three bombs used in the Underground appeared to have been detonated by timers, not suicide bombers, and that a fourth device may have been intended for a target other than the city bus that it destroyed. A1

The past 24 hours for Prime Minister Tony's Blair of Britain have been a roller-coaster ride from triumph to tragedy. Mr. Blair flew back to London after the bombings a day after opening the summit meeting of the Group of 8 major industrial nations in Scotland and after London was awarded the 2012 Olympics. A13

The bombings in London knocked the meeting of major industrial nations off its focus on global warming and African poverty and turned it into a forum for world leaders to pledge unity in confronting terrorism. A13

Egyptian Diplomat Killed in Iraq
The insurgent group Al Qaeda in Iraq said it had killed Egypt's ambassador-designate in Iraq, five days after gunmen had seized him on a street in western Baghdad where he had driven alone to buy a local newspaper. A1

Genocide Suspects Still at Large
Western diplomats and military officials are struggling to explain why two Bosnian Serb leaders indicted in the killing of Muslim men and boys during the Bosnian war remain at large. A3

A coalition of government agencies, business and environmental groups has offered a blueprint for improving the health of the Great Lakes. A16

Drug Discount Fight
Pharmaceutical companies are pouring millions of dollars into a campaign to defeat a measure on the November ballot in California that would pressure them to lower drug prices for millions of residents. A16

Hurricane Hits Caribbean
Hurricane Dennis swirled into a powerful Category 4 storm, with its fierce winds and rain killing at least four people in southwestern Haiti as the storm lashed the Caribbean. The hurricane's winds grew to 135 m.p.h. as it sideswiped Jamaica. A18

State Revenues Rebound
State revenues rose in the last year as the nation's economy produced more sales of goods and services and generated more income for individuals and corporations, the National Governors Association reported. A20

Capitol Hill Prepares For Battle
The Senate is in recess, and President Bush has yet to select a candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy, but scores of aides on Capitol Hill are knee-deep in preparations for upcoming nominations fight. A1

Kidnap Suspect Kept Blog
Joseph E. Duncan III, the convicted sex offender accused of kidnapping Dylan Groene, 9, and Dylan's sister Shasta, 8, from their rural Idaho home, spent months on the Internet documenting his internal struggle with right and wrong. A18

NEW YORK/REGION B1-6

Newest Crop of OfficersIs First Majority Minority
The 1,600 recruits who will become police officers next week make up the first graduating class in the history of the New York Police Department in which members of minorities make up the majority. The difference is seen by many as a significant marker in the department's slow racial evolution. B1

Retired Detectives Granted Bail
A federal judge in Brooklyn ordered two retired city detectives charged with murdering for the mob released on bail, saying the evidence was ''not strong'' and citing concerns with the statute of limitations. B1

HEADLINE: Fighting Terrorism at Gleneagles

 BODY:
As the leaders of the richest nations carry on their annual conference despite the bombings in London, they have a chance to embrace what should be an essential element of any long-term global strategy against terrorism. By adopting a coherent plan to tackle the extreme poverty of Africa, the leaders of the G-8 countries will also take on the civil wars, governmental breakdowns and illicit financial flows of one of the world's most troubled regions.
 For weeks, this page and people around the world have exhorted the leaders deliberating in Scotland to rise to the challenge of Africa for reasons of human compassion and economic fairness. But there are security reasons, too, starting with the way Africa straddles the increasingly fraught divide between Islamic and Christian civilizations. That schism has found expression in some of the continent's longest-running conflicts. 
American military forces fought what may have been their first encounter with the new international terrorism in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, a dozen years ago. Five years later, Al Qaeda destroyed United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Since then, terrorists linked to Al Qaeda have struck at Israeli tourists in Kenya and actively fished in the troubled waters of West Africa's civil wars. Failed states that cannot provide jobs and food for their people, that have lost chunks of territory to warlords, and that can no longer track or control their borders send an invitation to terrorists.
 And with Africa now on track to be the source for 25 percent of this country's crude oil imports by 2015, Washington has a special interest in promoting the continent's peaceful development and avoiding the nexus between oil money and terrorism that has developed in the Middle East. That concern underscores the importance of the other main issue on the meeting's agenda: global climate change and the need to find alternatives to polluting fossil fuels. 
 Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has led the world on the issues of African development and climate change, will have to divide his attention between London and Gleneagles. There could be no finer way for his fellow leaders to show solidarity, and strike a blow against terrorism, than by rallying to the vital substance of his summit meeting agenda.

HEADLINE: Omnicare Buys NeighborCare, A Rival, for $1.55 Billion 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Omnicare, the provider of drugs to nursing homes, agreed yesterday to buy its rival NeighborCare for $1.55 billion in cash, creating an institutional pharmacy behemoth.
 The friendly deal, which was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, comes more than a year after Omnicare first made an unsolicited takeover bid in June 2004.
Earnings at the two companies are significantly dependent on Medicare, the federal government program that provides insurance for the elderly and disabled. In 2006, the program will begin paying for prescription drugs for its 43 million members. 
 The Moody's and Standard & Poor's debt rating services will both keep Omnicare on watch for possible downgrades because of debt linked to the deal, and also because of a separate acquisition this week.
 ''The deal is obviously more expensive'' than the previous offer, said Diana Lee, a Moody's analyst. ''Layered on top of that, there is uncertainty regarding the legislation'' for Medicare.
 Omnicare will buy all outstanding shares of NeighborCare common stock for $34.75 a share.
 The offer price is significantly higher than the original bid of $30 a share made last year.
 Omnicare said the acquisition, which is expected to close during the third quarter, would allow the company to cement its market leadership in providing prescriptions to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
 The merged company will have a nationwide network of pharmacies serving long-term care providers in 47 states and the District of Columbia with nearly 1.4 million beds.
 ''Omnicare's acquisition of NeighborCare expands our reach and presence and enhances our opportunities for efficiencies through economies of scale,'' Joel F. Gemunder, the chief executive of Omnicare, said. 
 NeighborCare, which previously said its shareholders would be better served by its current business plan than a takeover, said yesterday that Omnicare's latest offer was in the best interests of its shareholders. 
 ''We are pleased that Omnicare has recognized the values inherent in our enterprise,'' John J. Arlotta, chairman and chief executive of NeighborCare, said. ''We now believe that we can create even greater value by combining with Omnicare.''

HEADLINE: Free To Choose Obesity?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The obvious model for those hoping to reverse the fattening of America is the campaign against smoking. Before the surgeon general officially condemned smoking in 1964, rising cigarette consumption seemed an unstoppable trend; since then, consumption per capita has fallen more than 50 percent.
 But it may be hard to match that success when it comes to obesity. I'm not talking about the inherent difficulty of the task -- getting people to consume fewer calories and/or exercise more may be harder than getting people to stop smoking, but we won't know until we try. I'm talking, instead, about how the political winds have shifted. 
Public health activists were successful in taking on smoking in part because at the time corporations didn't know how to play the public opinion game. By today's standards, the political ineptitude of Big Tobacco was awe-inspiring. In a famous 1971 interview on ''Face the Nation,'' the chairman of the board of Philip Morris, confronted with evidence that smoking by mothers leads to low birth weight, replied, ''Some women would prefer having smaller babies.''
 Today's food industry would never make that kind of mistake. In public, the industry's companies proclaim themselves good guys, committed to healthier eating. Meanwhile, they outsource the campaigns against medical researchers and the dissemination of crude anti-anti-obesity propaganda to industry-financed advocacy groups like the Center for Consumer Freedom.
 More broadly, the ideological landscape has changed drastically since the 1960's. (That change in the landscape also has a lot to do with corporate financing of advocacy groups, but that's a tale for another article.) In today's America, proposals to do something about rising obesity rates must contend with a public predisposed to believe that the market is always right and that the government always screws things up.
 You can see these predispositions at work in an article printed last month in Amber Waves, a magazine published by the Department of Agriculture. The article is titled ''Obesity Policy and the Law of Unintended Consequences,'' suggesting that government efforts to combat obesity are likely to be counterproductive. But the authors don't actually provide any examples of how that might happen. 
 And the authors suggest, without quite asserting it, that because people freely choose obesity in a free market, it must be a good thing. 
 ''Americans' rapid weight gain may have nothing to do with market failure,'' the article says. ''It may be a rational response to changing technology and prices. If consumers willingly trade off increased adiposity for working indoors and spending less time in the kitchen as well as for manageable weight-related health problems, then markets are not failing.''
 How can medical experts who see obesity as a critical problem deal with an ideological landscape tilted in the direction of doing nothing?
 One answer is to focus on the financial costs of obesity, and the fact that many of these costs fall on taxpayers and on the general insurance-buying public, rather than on the obese individuals themselves. (To their credit, the authors of the Amber Waves article do mention this issue, although they play it down.)
 It is more important, however, to emphasize that there are situations in which ''free to choose'' is all wrong -- and that this is one of them.
 For one thing, the most rapid rise in obesity isn't taking place among adults, who, we hope, can understand the consequences of their decisions. It's taking place among children and adolescents. 
 And even if children weren't a big part of the problem, only a blind ideologue or an economist could argue with a straight face that Americans were rationally deciding to become obese. In fact, even many economists know better: the most widely cited recent economic analysis of obesity, a 2003 paper by David Cutler, Edward Glaeser and Jesse Shapiro of Harvard University, declares that ''at least some food consumption is almost certainly not rational.'' It goes on to present evidence that even adults have clear problems with self-control.
 Above all, we need to put aside our anti-government prejudices and realize that the history of government interventions on behalf of public health, from the construction of sewer systems to the campaign against smoking, is one of consistent, life-enhancing success. Obesity is America's fastest-growing health problem; let's do something about it.

HEADLINE: Who Cares About Inflation?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
INFLATION is coming. Politicians, while they may not actually want it, prefer it to the alternatives in both Europe and the United States.
 It was a quarter-century ago that inflation was widely viewed as a threat that needed to be vanquished, even if it brought recession and pain. To the surprise of many, the effort was successful. 
But with inflation having been quiet for years, political attention has shifted. Now other things, like growth and employment, seem far more important.
 That was on display in Brussels this week as the European Parliament voted 296-to-287 to reject a report supporting the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. That may not force a change in policy, but it sent a clear message that politicians want the central bank to get the blame for high unemployment.
 In Washington, the new attitude is reflected in the Bush administration's effort to persuade China to revalue its currency, a move that would raise import prices. A vote in the Senate indicated that 67 senators want to raise tariffs on Chinese goods if China does not comply.
 Two decades ago, a New York congressman named Chuck Schumer campaigned against protectionist bills, saying his constituents wanted cheap imported clothing. Now a Democratic senator, he is one of the authors of the China tariff bill, and talks about ''making China play fair in the global trading market.''
 One economist who thinks inflation is on its way back is Larry Kantor, the head of research at Barclays Capital in New York. He ticks off the reasons that inflation fell in the 1980's and 1990's. For one, there was widespread acceptance of the Bundesbank religion, named after the German central bank, which culminated in legislation that ordered the European Central Bank to aim at inflation, not growth. 
 There was also the declining price of oil, the productivity boom that came from improved information technology, and the emergence of cheap exports from China and India. By the mid-1980's, American fiscal policy was even getting tighter. 
 NOW oil prices are rising and fiscal discipline has vanished. The productivity boom is fading and resistance to the China effect is rising.
 The Fed began to back away from the old-time religion for central banks in the late 1990's, when Alan Greenspan chose not to worry about what would previously have been viewed as excessive growth. The European Parliament vote shows how faith has faded in Europe.
 So why is there not a general belief that inflation is coming back? In part it is because a lot of attention is put on the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes changes in volatile food and energy prices. Ignoring energy prices now is a bit ridiculous.
 ''Inflation will continue to creep up,'' Mr. Kantor forecasts, ''and the Fed will have to do more than it has.'' He notes market watchers have almost always underestimated the rise or fall of the federal funds rate, and he thinks that is happening again. The market thinks that rate, now 3.25 percent, will not top 4 percent.
 On the day after the European Parliament vote, I suggested to Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank president, that it was becoming clear that politicians no longer cared about inflation. He did not agree.
 ''They have to care,'' he said, ''because the people care.''
 Yesterday the bank refused to lower its short-term rate, which at 2 percent is already very low. But public pressure on the bank is likely to intensify, reflecting the fact that people care less about inflation than about other economic problems. It may take a sustained period of rising prices to change that.

HEADLINE: After Bleak Period, States' Revenues Rise, Governors Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
State revenues rose significantly in the last year as the nation's recovering economy produced more sales of goods and services and generated more income for individuals and corporations, the National Governors Association reported Thursday.
 ''The revenue picture for most states improved dramatically in fiscal 2005,'' said the report, based on a survey of state fiscal conditions. The survey was conducted by the governors' group and the National Association of State Budget Officers.
 The two organizations said they expected the improvement to continue in the coming year. 
 ''In fiscal 2005,'' the report said, ''revenues exceeded original budget projections in 42 states, and five others met their targets. Only three states' revenues were below their budget projections.'' 
 This was in sharp contrast to the dismal financial picture in late 2002, when a similar survey said that ''nearly every state is in fiscal crisis,'' facing the worst fiscal problems since World War II, because of plunging tax collections and soaring medical costs.
 States are cautious about the fiscal outlook over the next 5 or 10 years. Health costs are still on the rise. Medicaid has become the largest, fastest-growing category of state spending. Many states report a pent-up demand for spending on elementary and secondary education. And many states say they must increase contributions to pension plans for state employees.
 Those problems may be more manageable with the rebound of state revenues.
 Revenues flowing into state general funds rose 4.7 percent in the 2005 fiscal year, to a total of $521 billion, and state budget officers expect an increase of 3.6 percent, to nearly $540 billion, in the coming year, the report said.
 Money in a state's general fund, raised primarily from sales and income taxes, is not normally earmarked for a specific purpose. In most states, the 2005 fiscal year ended last week.
 ''Collections of sales, personal income and corporate income taxes exceeded budgeted amounts in nearly every state,'' the governors said. ''Sales taxes were 1.1 percent higher, personal income taxes were 2.1 percent higher and corporate income tax collections were 8.8 percent above original estimates.''
 Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' association, said, ''We have a strong economy now.''
 In contrast to the states, the federal government brought in less revenue in 2004 than in 2000, in part as a result of tax cuts and a sluggish economy. Federal spending increased 28 percent between those years. Many states, unlike the federal government, are required to balance their operating budgets.
 Mr. Scheppach predicted that Medicaid would grow an average of 9 percent to 10 percent a year in the next decade, as it has in the last five years. That implies significantly higher costs than projected by the Congressional Budget Office, which projects Medicaid growing an average of 7.8 percent a year in the next decade. Federal and state spending on Medicaid now exceeds $320 billion a year.
 More than 50 million low-income people are on Medicaid. Mr. Scheppach predicted that more people would qualify because of a continued erosion in health insurance coverage provided by employers.
 In the next few days, the Bush administration plans to appoint a commission to recommend ways to rein in the growth of Medicaid.
 Duane A. Goossen, the state budget director in Kansas, said: ''Virtually all states went through a big revenue dip several years ago. Now most of us appear to be coming out of that revenue slump, returning to a more stable condition.''
 But Mr. Goossen, the president-elect of the state budget officers' association, said states still had reason for concern. ''In Kansas over the last five years,'' he said, ''our average Medicaid growth has been roughly 12 percent a year. Our revenues, on average, grew a little over 3 percent a year in the same period. We expect the same kind of disparity in the future.''
 Mr. Scheppach said governors would try to protect elementary and secondary education, but he predicted that ''you will see cuts in higher education'' to help finance Medicaid if states are not given more freedom to control the costs of Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance program.
 State spending is on the rise, with the resurgence of tax collections. In the 2005 fiscal year, spending from state general funds grew 6.6 percent, to a total of $525 billion. That is close to the annual average of 6.5 percent since 1979, when state officials began systematically tracking such data.
 But in the last five years, spending from state general funds had increased more slowly, by an average of 3.9 percent a year. And Mr. Scheppach said the growth would probably average 4 percent to 5 percent a year in the next decade.

California Budget Is Approved
 SACRAMENTO (AP) -- With uncharacteristic dispatch, the California Legislature approved a $117.5 billion budget on Thursday. The budget was approved 64 to 13 in the Assembly and 34 to 4 in the Senate.
 The governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is expected to sign it early next week, the earliest date California has approved a state budget in five years.
 Approval in both houses of the Legislature comes just two days after Mr. Schwarzenegger and the legislative leaders from both major parties announced a compromise negotiated over the Fourth of July weekend. Last year's budget wasn't passed until July 29.
 An unanticipated infusion of about $4 billion from the improving state economy also allowed the state to spend $1.3 billion on road and transportation projects, return $1.2 billion to city and county governments and pay down some of its debt.

'LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL 2005' The chic-est festival of the summer puts a premium on cultural crosspollination. Among its offerings are the New York artist Robert Wilson's version of an Indonesian creation myth, ''I La Galigo''; a show about the life and work of the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, created by Stephin Merritt, an American musician, and Chen Shi-Zheng, a Chinese director (and, incidentally, starring an Irish actress, Fiona Shaw); and the French master Ariane Mnouchkine's epic spectacle about Iranian and Kurdish refugees.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE CONSTANT WIFE' A stylish production of a creaky 1926 comedy by W. Somerset Maugham. Kate Burton stars as a well-heeled English wife who scarcely raises an eyebrow at her husband's philandering, scandalizing her friends. Maugham's dialogue isn't quite as witty as the brisk Ms. Burton and Lynn Redgrave, who plays her imperious mother, manage to make it sound (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300. (Charles Isherwood)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:50) Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)


'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the genocide of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'BIG TIMES' Did you hear the one about the three actresses who wrote themselves a play? The punchline is this sweet, slender homage to the glory days of vaudeville, complete with goofy jokes, gags and good music by the Moonlighters: kids are as likely to enjoy it as adults. Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

'BOOCOCK'S HOUSE OF BASEBALL' Paul Boocock finds beauty in great moments from New York Yankee history, and he hates President Bush, but his attempt to merge these two preoccupations into a one-man show is as lame and listless as the 2005 Yankee pitching staff. (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)352-3101.(Neil Genzlinger).

* 'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' With razor-sharp cheekbones and two voluminous puffs of hair resting on top of a delicate wisp of a body, Staceyann Chin, the author and star of this new autobiographical solo show, is a caricaturist's dream. Her appealing if not terribly original show follows her from a tumultuous childhood in Jamaica to New York City, where she starred on Broadway in ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam.'' (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)

'DRIVING ON THE LEFT SIDE' It's called a ''reggae play,'' and the band Reggaelution is one of the best things about this story of an American woman's fling with a Jamaican musician (watched by her father and his mother). Unfortunately, an actor plays the lead musician, which blunts the impact both of the band and of this too-pat play, which goes for laugh lines at the expense of credibility. (2:30). TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, garment district, (212)868-4444. (Midgette)

'DRUMSTRUCK' The noisy novelty at Dodger Stages, is a mixed blessing. Providing theatergoers a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating; and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'BIRDIE BLUE' The stern competence of Lieutenant Van Buren, the formidable figure played by S. Epatha Merkerson on ''Law & Order,'' is a long way from the warm but addled Birdie Blue, the title character in the new play by Cheryl L. West at the Second Stage Theater. The gifted Ms. Merkerson has no trouble bridging that emotional distance, but there's little she can do to patch the dramatic holes in Ms. West's fragmentary, seriously unsatisfactory play (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212)239-6200. (Genzlinger)

'MANUSCRIPT' Three talented, attractive young actors and some skillfully shaggy dialogue are the only reasons to see Paul Grellong's inconsequential play, a revenge tale centering on the theft of an unpublished manuscript expected to be of great literary merit. Implausibility is a big problem: there are plot holes here you could easily drive a hardback copy of ''Infinite Jest'' through (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PARIS LETTER' Jon Robin Baitz's ambitious but schematic play is a morality tale about a misspent life and the dangers of sexual repression. Cleanly directed by Doug Hughes, it features a pair of excellent performances by the superb actors John Glover and Ron Rifkin. But Mr. Baitz gets himself trapped in the mechanical working of an overcomplicated plot (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Midtown, (212)719-1300.(Isherwood)

*'SWIMMING IN THE SHALLOWS' Can man-shark love survive in the post- ''Jaws'' era? Adam Bock's screwy, perfectly cast play poses this and other questions you didn't know needed asking, in hilarious fashion (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212)246-4422. (Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)

'TWELFTH NIGHT' Just because the Aquila Theater's broad, crowd-pleasing interpretation lacks subtlety doesn't mean that it's not effective, in its way. Even if the costumes are a bit too cute -- are the oversize codpieces really necessary? -- the design is crisp and nicely realized, and the performances have more verve and clarity than most summer Shakespeare productions (2:15). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 25th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)

Off Off Broadway

'THE HOLLOW MEN' The four-member British comedy troupe Hollow Men is generous to a fault. At the Village Theater, the generosity is manifest in the high number of brief skits flowing through the roughly 90-minute, two-act show. The fault is that while the performers are expressive, their comedy routines are short on high humor, and as food for thought, their bleak slices of life don't provide enough of a Munch. (1:45) Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village; (212)253-2164. (Van Gelder)

'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101.(Brantley)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' When the eccentric millionaire Harry Thaw shot and killed the famed architect Stanford White on the roof of Madison Square Garden almost a century ago, the subsequent trial of the century -- the first of many in the 20th -- was a perfect storm of celebrity scandal. Don Nigro's ''My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon,'' recounts the sensational events with nuance and admirable research, but the passionless production unfortunately has the whiff of the whiff of Masterpiece Theater (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)

'PINEAPPLE & HENRY' Linda Segal Crawley's says if only walls could speak. What they have to say is that people don't always get what they want. That perception lacks novelty, and so does the play, directed by Scott C. Sickles. Though never less than watchable, it is mostly unremarkable in characters, situations and language (1:50). Workshop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, (212)695-4173, ext. 5, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)

'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Eloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday. (Van Gelder)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'THE ADVENTURES OF SHARKBOY AND LAVAGIRL IN 3-D' (PG, 94 minutes) There's a reason that children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape their dream worlds into coherent and compelling stories -- a task the director Robert Rodriguez (''El Mariachi,'' ''Sin City'') also fails to accomplish in this muddled quest narrative based on characters and themes created by his 7-year-old son, Racer Max. (Dana Stevens)

'ALMOST BROTHERS' (No rating, 103 minutes, in Portuguese) Recent Brazilian history and class warfare are the interwoven themes of this powerful but confusingly edited story of the embattled friendship between a white middle-class political activist and a black slum dweller who becomes a drug lord.(Stephen Holden)

*'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Manohla Dargis)

*'THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED' (No rating, 107 minutes) This electrifying French film is the story of an enforcer and would-be concert pianist that hinges on the struggle between the two sides of the male animal, the beauty and the beast. For the adult moviegoer, the film is a well-timed gift; it's also essential viewing. (Dargis)

'BEWITCHED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director Nora Ephron forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)

* 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In this contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome, where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug of war between two cliques, one left wing and bohemian, the other right wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured and entertaining.(Holden)

'CINDERELLA MAN' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The best parts of Ron Howard's ingratiating, Depression-era weepie about the boxing underdog-turned-topdog James J. Braddock are, unsurprisingly, Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, actors who could steal a movie from a basket of mewling kittens and an army of rosy-cheeked orphans. Renee Zellweger also stars. (Dargis)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism.(A.O. Scott)

'DALLAS 362' (R, 100 minutes) The directorial debut of Scott Caan, the 28-year-old son of the actor James Caan, ''Dallas 362'' tracks the troubled friendship between Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) and Dallas (Mr. Caan), two boys just out of their teens whose lives have become stalled in an endless cycle of drinking, bar brawls and minor arrests. ''It's a whole thing'' is this film's catchphrase, a line the two boys use to gesture inarticulately toward the complexity of any subject they can't understand. Scott Caan's debut film is not quite yet a whole thing, but it offers up enough interesting fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for. (Stevens)

'A DECENT FACTORY' (No rating, 79 minutes, in English, Finnish and Chinese) A cursory, irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization, this documentary film was shot and directed by a Frenchman, Thomas Balmes, who tagged along with representatives of the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia on a trip to one of the company's suppliers in China. (Dargis)

*'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

'5x2' (R, 90 minutes, in French) A couple's relationship unravels backward, from divorce through the birth of their child to their first meeting. Interesting, but chilly. (Scott)

*'GEORGE A. ROMERO'S LAND OF THE DEAD' (R, 94 minutes) An excellent freakout of a movie in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. The twist here is that as the walking dead have grown progressively more human, the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. You won't go home hungry.(Dargis)

'HEIGHTS' (R, 93 minutes) In its aspirations, design and worldview, ''Heights'' resembles a number of other films about cozily connected souls, a soap-operatic subgenre that might be called We Are the World. Everybody hurts, as Michael Stipe likes to sing, but people in ''Heights'' seem to hurt more or at least spend a lot of time nursing that hurt in brooding silence and noisy confrontation. (Dargis)

'HERBIE: FULLY LOADED' (G, 95 minutes) ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be THIS silly. Lindsay Lohan, who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut gives it a charismatic star boost. (Holden)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

'THE HONEYMOONERS' (PG-13, 90 minutes) Not the greatest, baby, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)

*'HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE' (PG, 118 minutes) The latest animated enchantment from Hayao Miyazaki. Lovely to look at, full of heart and mystery. ( Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

'LILA SAYS' (No rating, 89 minutes, in French) Ziad Douieri's film, about a 16-year-old French girl's provocative verbal seduction of a 19-year-old Arab boy takes the raw material of social realist melodrama and turns it into a sad and sexy pop song. (Scott)

'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo, expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)

*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)

'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)

'MODIGLIANI' (R, 128 minutes) In every particular, the screen biography of the Italian painter and sculptor offers a case study of how not to film the life of a famous artist. Andy Garcia's wooden lead performance leads its list of the movie's sins against art history. (Holden)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

*'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, onetime bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'REBOUND' (PG, 97 minutes) In the tepid family comedy, Martin Lawrence is a disgraced college basketball coach who finds humility and community values while coaching a team of junior high school geeks. Ick is the word. (Holden)

*'RIZE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) A documentary about clowners and krumpers -- that is, fiercely athletic hip-hop dancers battling in (and with) the streets of Los Angeles. Kinetic and inspiring (Scott)

'SEX, POLITICS AND COCKTAILS' (No rating, 90 minutes) In this debut feature written, directed and edited by Julien Hernandez , Sebastian Cortez (played by Mr. Hernandez) is a 31-year-old Cuban-American filmmaker who finds work making a series of documentaries about gay culture, Sebastian asks his friend Daria (Marisa Petroro), a soap-opera actress, to introduce him to her circle of gay friends, a raucous group given to margarita-swilling and trading raunchy stories. The common theme of these scattered vignettes seems to be that, straight or gay, it's tough to find love and commitment in a world filled with venal, grasping nitwits. (Stevens)

'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Stevens)

*'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

*'TROPICAL MALADY' (No rating, 118 minutes, in Thai) Perched between two worlds, two consciousnesses and two radically different storytelling traditions, this Thai feature shows the young filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness. (Dargis)

'TWIST OF FAITH' (No rating, 87 minutes) Another demoralizing documentary about sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church (it was broadcast on HBO last week). As in so many cases in which priests have been accused of abuse, the details of the alleged crimes are maddeningly elusive. The documentary is an unhappy one, with no satisfying resolution. (Virginia Heffernan)

'UNDEAD' (R, 100 minutes) ''Undead,'' the debut feature from Australian twins Peter and Michael Spierig, is a broad, preposterous mishmash of zombie horror, old-fashioned sci-fi, spaghetti western, slapstick comedy, and high-tech ''Matrix''-style action. After small meteorites shower the quaint fishing village of Berkeley, Australia, infected inhabitants are transformed into brain-munching maniacs; then extraterrestrials inexplicably appear to save humankind. A stale, derivative mess that borrows heavily from every zombie and alien movie worthy of imitation. (Laura Kern)

'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)

*'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)

* 'THE WORLD' (No rating, 133 minutes, in Mandarin) Globalization and its discontents form the molten core of ''The World,'' Jia Zhangke's fictionalized look at life inside a Disney-like entertainment park in China. This quietly despairing vision comes equipped with an ethnographic attention to detail, glints of surreal comedy and a scaled-down replica of the twin towers. (Dargis)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

JOEY BELTRAM (Tomorrow) Mr. Beltram, a techno pioneer, is the headliner at this party; expect a night of dance music both hard and squelchy. With the veteran German D.J. Chris Liebing, as well as Misstress Barbara, known for her tough but meticulous techno sets. 10 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780, $20 in advance, more at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh)

BLIND BOYS OF ALABAMA, CITIZEN COPE (Sunday) After more than 60 years as a group, the Blind Boys of Alabama are no longer boys but gray-haired pillars of gospel quartet singing. Led by Clarence Fountain, they proclaim their reverence in close harmonies and gutsy improvisations that leap heavenward. The latter-day beatnik Citizen Cope wallows in after-hours laments. 3 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, free. (Jon Pareles)

THE BRAVERY, THE DEAD 60'S, NIC ARMSTRONG (Wednesday) The Bravery was supposed to be New York's Next Big Post-Strokes thing, but rumored ego issues have provoked skepticism. Liverpool's Dead 60's play derivative, serviceable ska and dub punk. Hailing from Nottingham, England, the energetic and versatile player-singer Nic Armstrong pays homage to 60's British rock from the Kinks to the Yardbirds. His purist take on the garage-rock revival has little use for the winking irony of other such acts. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20, $23 at the door, sold out. (Laura Sinagra)

BRAZILIAN ART & FILM FESTIVAL OF NYC (Tonight and Tomorrow) This multi-format celebration of all things Brazilian kicks off with Rio de Janeiro's controversial social activist rapper Gabriel the Thinker, who takes on issues from gated-community wealth to police brutality. Tomorrow, Nacao Zumbi carries on the ''mangue beat'' music pioneered by the late bandleader Chico Science, a mix of maracatu drums, funk rock guitar and rap. 7 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212) 360-2777, free. (Sinagra)

CONSTANTINES, OXFORD COLLAPSE (Tonight) The lead singer Bry Webb's baritone may rumble like that of other currently popular post-punk revivalists, but the Constantines' acute sense of drone and sting sets their darkly pulsing indie rock apart. The Oxford Collapse offers shaggy art-rock that recalls acerbic mid-American forbears like the Embarassment. Tonight at 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston, (212)260-4700. $10. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, (718) 230-0236, $10. (Sinagra)

CONTRAMANO (Tonight) This Argentine, Spanish and Texan transplant trio happily go dumpster diving for new wave leftovers just like lots of other Williamsburg bands, but they also hang on to their Latin roots and come up with something quirkier. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $12. (Sinagra)

MARIA DE BARROS (Tonight) Born in Senegal but raised in Mauritania and Rhode Island, Ms. De Barros is a Cape Verdean singer in the Cesaria Evora style. She sings in Spanish and the Portuguese-African dialect kriolu, mining her inherited island traditions, from the upbeat ''coladeira'' a salsalike style, to soulful mornas and tricky funanas. 10 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $20. (Sinagra)

DINOSAUR JR, BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE, RADIO 4, MAGIK MARKERS (Thursday) Dinosaur Jr, the seminal band that melded the apathetic cool of American punk with the guitar blare of stoned classic rock reunites its contentious original lineup. The Magik Markers opens, its noise-rock builds from buzzes to maelstroms of feedback. Broken Social Scene and Radio 4 also play. 6 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Field, 72nd Street at Fifth Avenue, (212)360-2777, $37.25, $40 day of show. (Sinagra)

DO MAKE SAY THINK (Tomorrow) Bearing a passing resemblance to the work of the Canadian dirge merchants Godspeed You Black Emperor, Do Make Say Think builds songs in similar ominous waves. But this band has much jazzier prog rock tendencies. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $13, $15 at the door.(Sinagra)

DUNGEN (Thursday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring both black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703, sold out. (Sinagra)

THE FAB FAUX: THE LET IT BE ROOFTOP SESSIONS (Tuesday) The note-perfect Beatles tribute band isn't trying to win a costume contest. It's here to channel the original Fab Four's music, tone for tone, interval for interval, attack for attack. Here it tries to harness the acrimonious frisson of the ''Let It Be'' rooftop sessions. 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival at the World Financial Center Plaza, West Street and Vesey Street, (212)528-2733, Free. (Sinagra)

ERIK FRIEDLANDER (Tuesday) This popular avant-garde cellist is bent on showing his instrument's range and applicability to diverse musical missions, veering easily from familiar deep, resonant tones to underworld shrieks and brutally sawed scrapes. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $10. (Sinagra)

HOP FU: 'PRODIGAL SON' SOUNDTRACKED BY ILLSTYLE (Tonight) The local arts and D.J. collective Illstyle makes hip-hop's fascination with martial arts remarkably manifest, creating a new soundtrack for the chop-socky flick ''Prodigal Son.'' 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free ($3 suggested donation). (Sinagra)

ALLAN HOLDSWORTH (Tonight) The jazz fusion guitarist Mr. Holdsworth has for the last few years been exploring more stripped down forms than his signature synthesizer work. He's been playing with acoustic rhythm sections and recording spare jazz standards while preparing for the release of his recent career retrospective. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $26 to $30. (Sinagra)

WYCLEF JEAN (Thursday) If his head seems too big sometimes, the former Fugee Wyclef Jean's heart is in the right place. His wistful strummers and Caribbean-tinged hip-hop continues to incorporate global elements for purposes beyond dancefloor incitement. His soundtrack to the award-winning documentary ''The Agronomist'' furthered his advocacy of Haitian causes. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, 66th Street and Columbus Avenue, (212)721-6500. $25 to $40. (Sinagra)

CAROLE KING (Wednesday) The story of this Brill building songwriter who emerged from behind the scenes to declare her independence and vulnerability on the lite-rock classic ''Tapestry'' remains compelling decades later. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, (212)247-4777, $44.50 to $99.50. (Sinagra)

KENN KWEDER (Tuesday) The Philadelphia songwriter and guitarist Kenn Kweder has been writing prickly tunes about the arty urban subculture for three decades now. His onstage volatility used to rile the folkies, but when the punks came along and dug him, he rebuffed record label offers, preferring to do things his own way. 8:30 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, (212)941-8100, $15-$20. (Sinagra)

LADY SOVEREIGN, DJ A-TRAK, CATCHDUBS (Wednesday) Few MC's ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like this adorably brash 17 -year-old. Her appearance on this year's ''Run the Road'' compilation (Vice) was one of that excellent album's highlights and her first American show is hotly anticipated. 10 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $12. (Sinagra)

ERIN MCKEOWN, IDA (Wednesday) This folk singer-songwriter has evolved since her days of spare, collegiate confessionals in the Ani DiFranco vein. Her new material is more lushly produced, and her musing more universal. Her Brooklyn band's harmonies mimic the binding sinews of for-better-or-worse relationships. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100, $15, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)

JOHN MELLENCAMP, JOHN FOGERTY (Tomorrow) Grown up and still pugnacious, John Mellencamp packs his three-chord heartland rock with anti-authority taunts and tough-minded comments on racism, family farms and woman trouble. John Fogerty's wild-eyed wail and distilled guitar twang are utterly undiminished, the sound of a mythic backwoods Southland where barefoot girls dance in the moonlight. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y, (516)221-1000, $35 to $79. (Pareles)

NAPPY ROOTS (Tonight) Though they've worked with the impresario Li'l Jon, their preference for shimmy over crunk, and their insistence on talking about the poor instead of the super-rich keeps them on margins of the mainstream. 11:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $20, $22 at the door. (Sinagra)

POLYGRAPH LOUNGE (Tomorrow) Rob Schwimmer and Mark Stewart, two busy studio musicians fresh from touring with Simon and Garfunkel, indulge their more lighthearted side in Polygraph Lounge, which deploys a Spike Jones sensibility and a lot of low-tech and toy instruments. 5 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, 9th Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn, free (suggested donation $3). (Pareles)

*REGGAE CARIFEST (Sunday) In years past, this annual summer concert brought dancehall reggae's leading lights to New York City, giving a charged-up crowd a chance to cheer for their favorite performers -- and boo their least favorites offstage. This year's installment pairs shouters (the ferocious Bounty Killer, the manic Elephant Man, the manic and ferocious Capleton) with their sweeter counterparts, including the protest singer Luciano, the impassioned crooner I Wayne (the man behind the hit ''Satisfy Her'') and the Hasidic upstart Matisyahu, who is likely to have either a very good day or a very bad one. 2 p.m., Randall's Island, (718) 856-5946 or (718)856-3336, $35 to $60. (Sanneh)

ROYKSOPP (Wednesday) This Norwegian duo made late 90's chill-room music for ravers exhausted by years of uptempto adventuring. Their warm buzzes and loops served to remind dancers of dancefloor fun while giving tired bodies an occasion to loll. Recently, they've worked with the electro-pop singer Annie. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $20, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

SAOSIN, ANBERLIN (Sunday) These two emo bands specialize in rousing songs that embrace melancholy while nodding at chaos: Anberlin's songs strain toward grandeur but Saosin's twitch a little more and kick a little harder. With code: Seven and Terminal. 5 p.m., the Downtown, 190 Main Street, Farmingdale, N.Y., (516)293-7700, sold out. (Sanneh)

SUGAR WATER FESTIVAL: ERYKAH BADU, JILL SCOTT, QUEEN LATIFAH, FLOETRY (Tuesday) Popular purveyors of soulful female self-determination gather for a mini-tour of neo-soul stylings: Ms. Badu's slinky, cheeky afrocentric scrape, Ms. Scott's warm Philly funk, Queen Latifah's gutsy approach to her own hip-hop juvenilia and more recently, jazz standards, and Floetry's groovy uplift. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, NY, (516)221-1000, $21-76. (Sinagra)

DONNA SUMMER (Tomorrow) The disco diva who teamed up with the producer Giorgio Moroder to steam up the dancefloors with 70's and 80's hits like ''Love to Love You Baby'' and pop radio with burners like ''Bad Girls'' has long since left the sexpot thing behind for Jesus, but she still revisits her old hits with gusto. 8 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $20 to $68. (Sinagra)

SON VOLT (Tuesday) Back when he played country punk with Jeff Tweedy in the seminal band Uncle Tupelo, the singer and guitarist Jay Farrar gained adherents as the gruff, prematurely grizzled half of the duo, writing rueful songs about working class defeat in deadend towns, and some grudging prayers to the open road, too. A decade of solo work has reaffirmed that posture. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, (212)533-2111, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)

TEGAN AND SARA (Thursday) These Canadian twins' lyrics about love and loss are underground girl anthems. As of late, their acoustic folk has given way to power pop, a rich mix of shining guitar and pumping keyboards topped with their tart vocals. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $17, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

TODD TERRY (Thursday) In the 1980's and early 1990's, this New York house-music D.J. helped define the sound of the city's dance clubs: his version of house music is tough and raucous, connecting dots between disco and hip-hop. With Pete Moss and Mark Whitmore. 11 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100, $7-$20. (Sanneh)

TURIN BREAKS, WEST INDIAN GIRL (Thursday) The duo Turin Breaks plays meditative folk pop. Named after a kind of LSD, the West Indian Girl makes trippy shoegazing pop. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $18, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

VISHAL VAID (Tomorrow) The vocalist and harmonium player Vishal Vaid draws his inspiration from South Asian ghazal, modally sung improvisatory love poetry. He plays two different sets here with Rahis Khan on tabla and Bashir Khan on Indian banjo. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200, $15. (Discounted tickets available for those who purchase tickets for both concerts.) (Sinagra)

THE WAILERS (Wednesday and Thursday) Three members of the band that backed Bob Marley, Al Anderson on guitar, Earl Wya Lindo on keyboards and Aston Barrett on bass, are still the core of the Wailers, whose rhythms transformed reggae and rock forever. Wednesday at 7 p.m., Hudson River Festival, Rockefeller Park, Battery Park City, (212)528-2733, free; Thursday at noon, BAM R&B Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush and Myrtle Avenues, Downtown Brooklyn, (718)636-4100, free. (Pareles)

LUCINDA WILLIAMS (Thursday) With homely details and the names of southern cities, Lucinda Williams maps geography of loss and longing in her songs. The twang and determination in her voice, along with her rock-ribbed, country-rooted melodies, insist that she won't crumble even in the toughest romantic circumstance. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)496-7070, $40 to $70. (Pareles)

NEAL CAINE QUARTET (Thursday) ''Backstabber's Ball,'' Mr. Caine's debut on Smalls Records, assigns the bassist's appealingly laid-back melodies to two tenor saxophonists, Stephen Riley and Ned Goold; they appear here with the drummer Ali Jackson. Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212)675-7369; cover, $10. (Chinen)

JOEY CALDERAZZO TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Calderazzo, an energetic and probing pianist, enjoys more than a passing rapport with the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts; together they make up three-fourths of the powerfully cohesive Branford Marsalis Quartet. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20.(Chinen)

(Chinen)

MAYNARD FERGUSON & HIS BIG BOP NOUVEAU BAND (Tuesday through July 17) His signature high notes have inevitably lost some luster, but Mr. Ferguson is still a bravura trumpeter and charismatic bandleader, and this ensemble suits both sets of skills. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

ROBERT GLASPER EXPERIMENT (Wednesday) There isn't a young musician with more buzz at the moment than Mr. Glasper, a bright and well-rounded pianist recently signed to Blue Note Records. The ''experiment'' in the title is a license to go beyond jazz-trio territory, and possibly indulge serious affinities for hip-hop, house and soul. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132; no cover. (Chinen)

JOHN HICKS TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) Notes bunch up in Mr. Hicks's piano chords, filling his fists; he keeps a few fingers agitatedly moving around within the chords, keeping a bop pulsation constant through the wall of sound. He wears time loosely, letting himself fall behind the beat, and he makes thick, heavyweight brocades of music. 9 and 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662; cover, $25 (Ben Ratliff)

ERIC LEWIS TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) Until recently a pianist for the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, getting the music's repertory history under his fingers and bringing a thrilling unpredictability to his performances, Mr. Lewis is going it alone now.

(Chinen)

*JEREMY PELT QUARTET (Through Sunday) The clarion tone and preternatural poise of Mr. Pelt's trumpet playing have earmarked him as a rising star in the jazz mainstream; this engagement immediately precedes the release of ''Identity,'' his second MaxJazz album. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20-$25.

TYSHAWN SOREY'SOBLIQUITY (Tonight and Sunday) Mr. Sorey's explosive drumming has been a welcome new force in the contemporary avant-garde; his original compositions provide fodder for this band, with the saxophonist Jacam Manricks, the guitarist Liberty Ellman and the bassist Carlo DeRosa.

LEW TABACKIN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) As a tenor saxophonist, Mr. Tabackin combines gut instincts with encyclopedic command of jazz styles; as a flutist he favors Far Eastern timbres and scales.

Opera

LAKE GEORGE OPERA (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) It doesn't get much lighter than this: ''The Mikado'' and Rossini's ''Italian Girl in Algiers'' are the summer's two offerings from the Lake George Opera, featuring able young singers, including Georgia Jarman as Yum-Yum and Jennifer Dudley as Rossini's Isabella.

(Anne Midgette)

'RINALDO' (Tomorrow, Monday and Wednesday) The Berkshire Opera Company has offered solid performances of both standard and offbeat works over the years and has ensured that Tanglewood isn't the area's only musical attraction. In past years, the company has been hampered by theaters that didn't quite match its ambitions, but this season it is presenting some of its performances at the newly renovated Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington, Mass. Its season opener is a semistaged production of Handel's ''Rinaldo,'' with a cast that has Christine Abraham in the title role, as well as Maureen O'Flynn, David Walker and John Cheek. Gary Thor Wedow conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Monday at 2 p.m. at the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center, Greet Barrington, Mass.; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Chapin Hall, at Williams College, Williamstown, Mass., (413)442-0099, $25 to $75.

Classical Music

BANG ON A CAN SUMMER MUSIC INSTITUTE (Starting Thursday) New music tends to find more sympathetic ears in the art public than many concert halls. Bang on a Can's summer learning program accordingly goes into the museum -- specifically, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Starting Thursday, daily concerts in the late afternoon showcase the institute's faculty, including the group's three original founders and, this year, Steve Reich. Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams, Mass., (413)662-2111. Concerts are free with gallery admission: $10, $8 for students, $4 for children. (Midgette)

CARAMOOR (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Thursday) Celebrating its 60th anniversary this season, Caramoor presents concerts on a vast scenic estate in northern Westchester County. Tonight, musicians from the Moab Music Festival in Utah take on Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' and Milhaud's jazz-infused ''Creation du Monde,'' but the weekend's main event is a rare staging of Bellini's opera ''La Sonnambula'' tomorrow with Will Crutchfield conducting the Orchestra of St. Luke's and the coloratura soprano Sumi Jo in the title role. Sunday, it's a family concert led by Michael Barrett, and Thursday, the Jupiter Trio plays works by Beethoven, Dvorak and Schnittke. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252, $15 to $85. (Jeremy Eichler)

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. Tonight, Adam Golka offers a program of mostly 19th-century piano transcriptions. Tomorrow and Sunday, it's music by Schubert, Beethoven, Faure and a new work by Adolphus Hailstork with Mark Peskanov, violinist; Jeanne Mallow, violist; Sophie Shao, cellist; and Doris Stevenson, pianist. Thursday brings piano trios by Beethoven and Schubert. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; $25 for students. (Eichler)

MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow and Sunday) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., now in its 90th season, offers its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. Tomorrow, the pianist Frederic Chiu performs works by Debussy, Ravel, Griffes and two works by Prokofiev (the Piano Sonata No. 2 and ''Visions Fugitives''), a composer Mr. Chiu has recorded with distinction. On Sunday, the flutist Carol Wincenc and the pianist Gina Raps play a hefty program with works by Bach, Faure, Debussy, Varese, Enescu, Griffes and Hindemith.

MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tonight and Sunday) Offering a mix of choral music, jazz, chamber concerts and a few other things as well, this venerable festival, now air-conditioned for the first time, presents medieval and Renaissance music sung by a costumed choir called the Everyman Guild tonight, and the Avalon String Quartet playing Haydn, Beethoven and the Brahms clarinet quintet (with Alexander Fiterstein) on Sunday afternoon, with the Salisbury Band as an anachronistic warmup. Tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 3 (band concert at 2), Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860)824-7126, $25, $12 for students under 24. (Midgette)

NAUMBURG ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Sure, the New York Philharmonic gets most of the attention, but Central Park has never been a one-orchestra green space. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, and on Tuesday, Carlos Miguel Prieto leads music by Barber, Bernstein, Copland, Ginastera and others. 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Band Shell, Central Park, midpark at 72nd Street, (718)340-3018, free. (Eichler)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) To fill out the calendar in the weeks between the end of the official season in June and the beginning of the popular free concerts in the parks in July, the orchestra is presenting its ''Summertime Classics'' series. If these programs, for the most part lighter works, don't go as far in the pops direction as the mighty Boston Pops, they should have some popular appeal. And the concerts are presented at budget prices. Tonight's program, ''Young at Heart,'' has chestnuts like ''The Nutcracker'' Suite and Britten's ''Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.'' Tomorrow and Sunday the series ends with ''Soiree Francaise,'' featuring arias and songs from French opera and operetta. Both programs are conducted by Bramwell Tovey, who has a gift for introducing each work with wry British humor. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $19 to $49; half-price for children 12 and under tonight.(Anthony Tommasini)

TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Thursday) James Levine inaugurated his tenure as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra last fall with, you could say, a cosmic bang: Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the ''Symphony of a Thousand.'' A few days later he repeated that work at Carnegie Hall for his first official visit to New York as the head of the orchestra. Tonight, yet again, he begins his first summer at Tanglewood with the piece, though this team of vocal soloists includes some newcomers, among them the soprano Deborah Voigt and the tenor Johan Botha. Kurt Masur takes charge of the Boston Symphony for two programs tomorrow (the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and Bruckner's Fourth) and Sunday (Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto with Emanuel Ax and the Tchaikovsky Serenade for Strings). Ms. Voigt sings a recital on Tuesday and the Beaux-Arts Trio commemorates the 50th anniversary of its debut on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., in the Music Shed; Tuesday and Thursday at 8:30 p.m., in Ozawa Hall; Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200, $19 to $85; lawn seats for $16 and $17.

As usual, the casts are starry: Paloma Herrera, Carlos Acosta, Diana Vishneva, Maxim Beloserkovsky, Gillian Murphy and Angel Corella are to be in the ''Swan Lakes.'' Although Alessandra Ferri, scheduled for the first ''Giselle,'' is out for the season with an ankle injury, there will still be strong casts for all the ''Giselles.'' Particularly noteworthy nights include Tuesday, with Ms. Vishneva, Vladimir Malakhov and Veronika Part, and Thursday, when Amanda McKerrow is to give her final performance with the company. Tonight, tomorrow and Monday through Thursday at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000 or www.abt.org, $22 to $130. (John Rockwell)

ARTICHOKE DANCE COMPANY (Thursday through July 17) Lynn Neuman's ''Look at Me (when I talk to you),'' a new work about moments that precipitate action or change, shares a program with the circuslike ''Origins.'' Thursday through July 17 at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212)334-7479 $20, $10 students, 65+ and dancers. (Jack Anderson)

BARD SUMMERSCAPE: MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Through Sunday) As part of this summer season's theme of ''Copland and His World,'' the troupe dances ''Appalachian Spring,'' which Graham created to a luminous score by Aaron Copland, as well as ''Herodiade,'' to Hindemith, and ''Cave of the Heart,'' to Samuel Barber.

IT'S A DANCE THING, TWO! (Tonight through Sunday) Fifteen young choreographers present works in a summer showcase.

(Anderson)

*MERCE CUNNINGHAM'S 'OCEAN' (Tuesday through July 16) Those who have reservations about Mr. Cunningham's choreography find it all pretty much the same: anonymous, small-scaled, determinedly abstract dancing with grating electronic music. ''Ocean'' is very different, a grand spectacle. In 1996 I presented its American premiere at the first Lincoln Center Festival. Now, for its 10th installment, the festival is bringing it back for an encore, this time not in Damrosch Park but in the new Rose Theater. Mr. Cunningham's last collaboration with his longtime partner John Cage, ''Ocean'' uses a musical score (realized after Cage's death by Andrew Culver) for 112 droning musicians placed around the audience, with the dancers in the middle. Mr. Cunningham, true to his aesthetic, denies that he intended anything aquatic, but with blue-green costumes and lighting and David Tudor's outboard-motor-like electronic sounds, it certainly seems that way. Tuesday through July 16, 8 p.m. Rose Theater, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)271-6500, www.lincolncenter.org, $35 to $70. (Rockwell)

(Anderson)

TERE O'CONNOR (Opens Wednesday) Don't be fooled by the title. Everything's fluid in ''Frozen Mommy,'' a study in evocative shifts of situation and characterization. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org $20, $12, students, 65+ and D.T.W. members (Anderson).

*JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Aug. 3) This venerable, idyllic rural festival is now in full swing. Tonight through Sunday Ronald K. Brown and his Evidence company, with jazz and Billie Holiday, will alternate with Rennie Harris's Puremovement hip-hop troupe from Philadelphia. Mr. Brown at the Ted Shawn Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m. $45; $40.50 for students, seniors 65+ and children. Mr. Harris at the Doris Duke Studio Theater, tonight and tomorrow at 8:15 p.m., tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m. $20; $18 for students, 65+ and children. Wednesday (through July 17) Alonzo King's Lines Ballet from San Francisco opens a run, alternating starting Thursday with Ben Munisteri and his six-member modern-dance troupe, in a program that includes a world premiere. Lines at the Shawn Theater, Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m. $50; $45 for students, 65+ and children. Mr. Munisteri at the Duke Studio Theater, Thursday at 8:15. $20; $18 for students, seniors and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found on www.jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.; (413)243-0745. (Rockwell)

PILOBOLUS (Opens Monday) Dancers bend like pretzels and tie themselves into knots in acrobatic choreography that stretches the performers' bodies and viewers' minds. Monday through Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800 or www.joyce.org $42, $32 Joyce members. (Anderson)

SITELINES: TOM PEARSON (Through July 16) ''Reel'' choreographically uses the rotunda of a former United States Customs House to comment on themes of dominance and reconciliation. Today, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3888. free. (Anderson)

VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Through Sunday) A choreographer from Slovenia explores themes of personal perseverance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Midtown, (917) 363-4229 $30, performance with reception, $15 performance only, $25 students and 65+, tomorrow; $15, $12 students and 65+, Sunday (Anderson)

Museums

*AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

*BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914,' through Sept. 4. This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs, by other artists, including James McNeill Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. (See above.)(Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

*EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'FROM CALLOT TO GREUZE: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM WEIMAR,' through Aug. 7. This show sprints through French art of the 17th and 18th centuries and reveals it to be a phenomenon of varying moods and accomplishments. The 70 drawings, including some by Claude Lorrain, Watteau and Boucher, from the municipal holdings of the German city of Weimar. And many were acquired by that collection's first curator, the great writer, philosopher and lover of all things French, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)

*GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

*GUGGENHEIM: 'ROBERT MAPPLETHORPE AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION: PHOTOGRAPHS AND MANNERIST PRINTS,' through Aug. 24. This exhibition juxtaposes obsessively styled, drunkenly body-oriented art from the late 18th and late 20th centuries, achieving a fairly even rate of exchange in an unusually elegant installation. But the prints, having more to begin with, come out ahead and look remarkably fresh. (See above.) (Smith)

*INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA,' through Sept. 4. The Dauguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. At 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Cotter)

*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)

*MET: MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES, through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of both his life and his work. (See above.) (Smith)

MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,' through Sept. 11. A selection of fair-to-good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Ken Johnson)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: LEE FRIEDLANDER, through Aug. 29. A gigantic retrospective of this great photographer of the American vernacular scene, whose sly and haunting works (grungy cityscapes, wild landscapes, portraits and nudes) can put you in mind of Auden's remark that ''every 'original' genius'' has something ''a bit shady about him.'' In Mr. Friedlander's case, it's a compliment. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Michael Kimmelman)

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART:'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CEZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cezanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with, scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approach and sensibility. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Robert Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (Smithson didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavanger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 60's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM: BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)

Galleries: Uptown

'JOAN MITCHELL SKETCHBOOK: 1949-51' The 60 pages from a single notebook document an eventful period in this American painter's life, years that saw her moving between New York and Paris, and changing from a figurative to an abstract painter, consolidating a connection to French modernism, particularly to Cezanne and early Mondrian; and absorbing the spirit of the New York painters she felt closest to, Willem De Kooning, Arshile Gorky. Francis M. Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, Upper East Side, (212)472-6800, through July 15. (Cotter)

Galleries: 57th Street

RALPH BACERRA: 'OPULENT FIRE' Beautiful and technically awe-inspiring new teapots by this Los Angeles-based ceramicist have organically shaped, multi-part bodies cast from tree branches and surfaces richly glazed in fine geometric patterns. Garth Clark, 25 West 56th Street, (due to renovations of the main lobby), (212)246-2205, through Aug. 12.(Johnson)

ELIZABETH HEYERT: 'THE TRAVELERS' A touching show of 31 nearly life-size portraits of black people, dressed to the nines but with their eyes closed. They are dead, it turns out, and lying in their coffins. The set and costume designer for their opulent repose is a Harlem mortician named Isaiah Owens, who upholds a fading custom still observed by some blacks, of paying respect to the dead by seeing them off in sartorial splendor. Photographing them, Ms. Heyert came to believe that the portraits were not about death but about people's lives and their sharing of ''family, faith, traditions.'' Once you get over the startle factor, you can appreciate the elegance and restraint of her response to Mr. Owens's vision. Edwynn Houk Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street, (212)750-7070, through July 23. (Glueck)

'OK/OKAY' This entertaining two-gallery exhibition introduces 14 European artists whose works in nontraditional media tend to read like overproduced one-liners. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, (212)925-2035; and Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212)998-6780, through July 16. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing, but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through July 22. (Johnson)

'ELEVEN NGUYENS AND THE THIRTY YEAR LOSS' The independent curator Trong G. Nguyen has conceived a novel and bittersweet way to celebrate the recent anniversary of the surrender of South Vietnam to the communist North on April 30, 1975. He has gathered together works by 11 contemporary artists who all share the name Nguyen, which is pronounced "win." He contributes a cake with thick frosting of yellow paint and lettering that reads "Happy Birthday War." Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212)564-4480, through July 30. (Johnson)

'EVERLAND' This enchanting, 11-person show of fantasy landscapes assembled by independent curator David Gibson includes the watercolorist Russell Nachman's contemporary fairy painting; Ruth Waldman's delicately drawn web of mutant organs; confectionery table-top sculptures by Linda Ganjian, Kim Keever's constructed photograph of a scary, murky yellow mountainscape; and Sandra Bermudez's photograph of orchids whose petals turn out to be tiny Vegas showgirls. Annina Nosei, 530 West 22nd Street, (212)741-8695, through July 23. (Johnson)

'HOMOMUSEUM: HEROES AND MONUMENTS' With multiculturalist monuments to all kinds of minorities in place, how about a National Gay Hall of Fame, celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered culture? This group show of 27 artists could have been sharper and more exploratory than it is, but has good work and packs a lot of history. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 30. (Cotter)

*MOMUS AND MAI UEDA: 'I'LL SPEAK, YOU SING' From 1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, Momus, the Scottish-born alternative-music legend, makes up stories, while Ms. Ueda, a Japanese performance artist, sings, comments and moves about.

'MONOCHROME IMAGE' This show of single-color works in two and three dimensions include a man's suit, hat and shoes cast in pink rubber by David Baskin; a life-size giant squid of yellow crocheted yarn by Mary Carlson; an orange sculpture resembling a big clown's smile by John Monti; and a yellow wooden relief like a section of wainscoting by Francis Cape. Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212)463-9666, through July 22. (Johnson)

RICHARD STIPL: 'BLOC SABBATH' A dark minded humanist and skillful sculptor, Mr. Stipl creates small, creepy, extremely realistic, painted heads of grimacing men with secret society emblems or images of famous women tattooed on their shaved skulls. An ensemble of 10 one-fourth-life-size nude men on a shelf represents a Boschian satanic ritual. Claire Oliver, 513 West 26th Street, (212)929-5949, through July 23. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'ANIMAL TALES' This entertaining show presents paintings of all kinds of animals in all kinds of styles: fantasy creatures painted naturalistically, real animals painted surrealistically, cartoon hybrids and old-fashioned allegorical beasts.

*MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a re-creation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

ALLAN DESOUZA: 'THE LOST PICTURES' New pictures by this conceptualist photographer meditate on the photograph as a memorial object. Mr. deSouza placed prints made from old family slides around his home, allowing them to become faded and abraded and to accumulate hair, dust and other debris. He then turned them into large, glossy digital prints in which the ghosts of the original images haunt the new, busily textured, semi-abstract surfaces. Talwar, 108 East 16th Street, Union Square, (212) 673-3096, through July 29. (Johnson)

'EXCEEDING PAINT/EXPANDING PAINTING' In conceptual or formal ways, 14 artists subvert traditional painting. Approaches range from mildly rebellious -- as in Arturo Herrera's fusion of Abstract Expressionism and Disneyesque cartooning painted on the wall -- to mildly offensive, as in Philippe Meste's semen-splattered mirror. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778, through July 16. (Johnson)

VITALY KOMAR: 'THREE-DAY WEEKEND' The work in Mr. Komar's first solo show is more personal and less zanily satirical than the art he produced with his long-time collaborator Alex Melamid, but it does involve ingenious play with political and cultural signifiers. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212)226-3232, through July 29. (Johnson)

SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)

*VISUAL GLOSSOLALIA LUISE This unusual show of mediumistic writing -- often imaginary and usually embellished -- includes works by eight mostly American self-taught artists and one extraordinary Burmese yantra book from around 1900. Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212)343-2161, through July 15. (Smith)

Last Chance

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE' Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100, closing on Sunday. (Smith)

DANA FRANKFORT: WHAT'S SO FUNNY In her debut exhibition, this young painter tries to add her own twist to the long tradition of language-based painting by inserting familiar words and phrases into fields of bright, shiny monochrome color. ''Yes,'' ''Now'' and ''Halleluiah,'' spelled in blocky letters that fill the canvases, glide in and out of view. Brooklyn Fire Proof, 101 Richardson Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)302-4702, closing on Sunday. (Smith)

MET: 'DEFINING YONGLE' through July 10. This show of imperial art in early-15th-century China is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China, closing on Sunday. (See above.) (Smith)

MET: 'MAX ERNST' Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus, closing on Sunday. (See above.) (Cotter)

'WOODS' Works made of and about wood and trees include miniature firs in Styrofoam planters by Carin Mincemoyer; conflations of Minimalist form and furniture-making craft by Richard Bottwin; a walk-in spiral maze by Leo Berk; Caitlin Bermingham's oddly creepy fake plants; Eric Kidhart's faux-populist illustrations made using woodburning tools; and Justin Witte's white-on-white cartoon visions of bizarre woodland activities.

HEADLINE: Here Comes the Japanese Bride, Looking Very Western

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1 

 BODY:
As a soprano sings ''Ave Maria,'' a Japanese couple march down the center aisle of a hotel chapel, past white trumpet lilies, to the altar where an American ''pastor'' stands, gold cross gleaming on white robes.
 ''Before God and these witnesses, I pronounce you husband and wife,'' intones Damon Mackey, a California native who took a two-day course to perform weddings on weekends, supplementing his income as an English teacher and part-time actor.
 In Japan, where a love affair with Western ''white weddings'' is leading to a collapse in Shinto ceremonies, a new figure is taking over the altar: the gaijin, or foreign, ''pastor.''
 Only 1.4 percent of Japan's 127 million people are Christians, but Christian-style ceremonies now account for three-quarters of Japanese weddings. To meet market demand, bridal companies in recent years have largely dispensed with the niceties of providing a pastor with a seminary education, keeping the requirements simple: a man from an English-speaking country who will show up on time, remember his lines, not mix up names and perform the ceremony in 20 minutes. 
 From a small beginning a few years ago, the Western wedding ''priest'' has suddenly become an established part of modern Japan's cultural tableau. The lure of easy money has prompted hundreds of foreign men to respond to newspaper advertisements here, like the one that read: ''North Americans, Europeans wanted to conduct wedding ceremonies.'' 
 ''Now all the hotels have chapels with someone dressed up as a priest,'' said William J. Grimm, a Maryknoll priest who edits The Catholic Weekly of Japan. 
 In fact, the less overtly religious the pastor, the better. Hotel managers generally discourage proselytizing by authentic Christian pastors.
 ''The companies like the nonreligious guy who just follows the script,'' said Mike Clark, a Japanese language student who performed weddings before moving home to Canada last fall.
 The boom in what some Japanese magazines call ''foreign fake pastors'' speaks volumes about modern Japan's attachment to appearances and its smorgasbord approach to religion. Japanese often choose Shintoism for childhood age ceremonies, Christianity for weddings and Buddhism for funerals.
 ''Of course, words are important, but in a ceremony it is more about the whole image,'' Masahiko Sakamoto, 25, said after watching Kenyon L. Nelson, a retired businessman from Missouri, perform a wedding at a hotel bridal fair. ''And a foreigner fits better into a Western wedding than a Japanese person would.''
 Maki Oyama, his fiancee, said firmly that she wanted a white dress, a foreign pastor and a hotel chapel wedding. She added, ''In soap operas you have more examples of white weddings than of Shinto ones.''
 The passion for Western-style weddings was first fueled in the 1980's by the televised weddings of Prince Charles and Lady Diana and of the Japanese pop star Momoe Yamaguchi. Since 1996, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the number of Christian weddings has nearly doubled while the number of Shinto weddings has plunged by two-thirds. 
 Western weddings revolve around love and elevate the bride to a princess, Japanese say. In a tradition-bound Shinto wedding, where the bride is encased in a wig and a kimono, the ceremony seems to be more about the merger of two families.
 Only civil unions are legally valid here and with Japan's economy treading water, about 70 percent of all couples go on to have an optional religious ceremony. Now, hotels are tearing out money-losing Shinto shrines and replacing them with the ersatz Christian chapels staffed with a foreign ''priest.'' 
 ''I am supposed to finish in 18 minutes,'' Victor Spiegel, a 37-year-old Florida native, said after walking a pair of models through a touching, if briskly paced, wedding ceremony for a bridal fair. Overhead, a movie camera had run on a ceiling track, filming a three-woman chorus singing ''Ave Maria,'' the couple marching past red roses suspended in crystal columns, and white curtains opening to a hotel garden where a green neon cross glowed in the afternoon sun.
 Mr. Spiegel, an English teacher who performs more than 100 weddings a year, said that sometimes ''the hotel will do 15 in a day.''
 At a bridal fair here, couples insisted that the Christian ''pastor'' had to be a foreigner. Youichi Hirahara, a 27-year-old civil servant, said: ''It would seem very unreal and fake if there was a Japanese person conducting the ceremony. Very shady actually.'' 
 Among foreigners, competition has depressed the pay for a wedding ceremony to $120, from $200 five years ago. In a society that revolves around business cards, the card of one part-time ''pastor'' reads: ''Max von Schuler Kobayashi: Performer, Actor, MC, Wedding Minister.'' 
 While the prime motivator for the Western wedding ministers is cash, many take an extra pride in their work. 
 ''My goal was to make at least one person cry at each ceremony,'' said Mr. Clark, the Canadian student. He said performing weddings was a great part-time job ''but kind of kooky, kind of surreal.'' 
 ''There was the whole factory aspect of it, the 20-minute turnarounds,'' he said. ''All icing, no cake. Then, there I was, an atheist, reading and reciting these Japanese Christian scripts that I barely understood.''
 Reg Hackshaw, 42, a New Zealander who performs weddings, said he was ''raised as a Catholic, but got fed up with the hypocrisy.'' Asked if spending his Sundays dressed as a priest and marrying non-Christians at a hotel ''chapel'' conflicted with his agnosticism, Mr. Hackshaw answered: ''O.K., I am dressing up in a robe, but it's not a religious ceremony. It's a performance.'' 
 ''The number of times someone has asked what church I belong to I can count on one hand,'' added Mr. Hackshaw, who teaches English and works as a disc jockey during the week.
 Noting that he had conducted over 2,000 wedding ceremonies, Mr. Hackshaw said that Japanese brides demanded foreign ministers, saying: ''They identify Christianity as something foreign. And, because it is foreign, they want a foreign pastor.''
 At the hotel lobby here, where Mr. Sakamoto and his fiancee were planning their wedding with a foreign pastor, a similar view was heard.
 ''You don't see a foreign person doing a Shinto wedding, do you?'' he asked. ''Now that would be strange.''

HEADLINE: Initial Panic Selling Followed by a Numbing Business as Usual

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Mark Landler reported from Frankfurt for this article and Jonathan Fuerbringer from New York. Jennifer Bayot and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 7 

 BODY:
Markets across Europe were thrown into turmoil on Thursday morning, with stocks and currencies plunging after the deadly rush-hour explosions in London. But they recouped much of their losses by day's end, as the talk of another terrorist attack took on a numbing familiarity.
 The trading pattern was similar in New York, where images of bloodied commuters and hastily evacuated office buildings are not new. All three major American stock gauges even managed to wind up slightly higher.
''I hate to sound cold hearted, but investors, to a large extent, have become immune to terrorist attacks,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany. 
 The British pound and the dollar fell sharply right after the explosions, as traders dumped both for the perceived safety of the euro and the Swiss franc. 
 Trading floors in London, some ringing with the sounds of passing sirens, were swept by panic selling in the morning before calming down by lunchtime. 
 Oil prices also swooned, reflecting fear that a fresh terrorist strike in Europe could dampen economic growth. 
 But the dollar rebounded by the afternoon in New York and was little changed against the euro and the yen. After dropping almost 4 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil recovered much of its ground in afternoon trading, falling 55 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $60.73 a barrel. The pound, however, wound up down 0.8 percent against the dollar. 
 The FTSE 100-share index tumbled by 207 points, or 4 percent, shortly after trading began, as word of the explosions spread. By the close of trading, it was down only 1.4 percent.
 Shares of airlines, travel-related companies and insurers were the hardest hit.
 The London Stock Exchange, which is near St. Paul's Cathedral, was not affected by the explosion at Liverpool Street Station, several blocks northeast. But the Swiss bank UBS evacuated its offices at 100 Liverpool Street, near the station.
 In New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.93 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,197.87, after falling 1 percent earlier in the day. 
 Even travel stocks rebounded after sharp declines in the morning. A Bloomberg index of 31 airline, hotel and other travel stocks ended the day up 0.3 percent after falling as much as 1.9 percent.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell sharply, to 3.93 percent, in overnight trading in New York, attesting to a sudden surge of investors into the haven of the government bond market. But by late Thursday in New York, the yield was back to 4.06 percent, down just a tick from 4.07 percent Wednesday, as the immediate explosion jitters dissipated.
 ''This is a reminder that geopolitical risk is still alive in the world,'' said Lorenzo Codogno, co-head of European economics at Bank of America in London. ''Confidence is an issue, but it's too much to say that the whole global economy will slow down because of this single event.''
 If history is any guide, the economic fallout will be fleeting, as it was after the train bombings in Madrid last year. Even the devastating attacks in September 2001 were only a temporary setback for the American economy, which was climbing out of a recession at the time.
 The psychological shock of the bombings could dent the confidence of British consumers, economists say, but that would only add to the continuing slowdown in consumer spending in Britain.
 ''These events do not have as long-lasting an effect as markets, with their knee-jerk reaction, would suggest,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''The Madrid and London bombings are of the sort we have seen in the past.''
 While the bombings all but paralyzed one of the world's leading financial centers -- and disrupted a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations in Scotland -- the death toll was lower than the attacks in Madrid or New York and Washington.
 ''As terrible as it is, it's nowhere near the extent of 9/11,'' said Steve Massocca, the head of trading at Pacific Growth Equities, an investment bank in San Francisco. ''I think, ultimately, it's going to have next to no effect on the financial markets.''
 In a note to clients, economists at Goldman Sachs said three things would have to happen for the attacks to jeopardize financial markets: terrorists would have to hit more targets; consumers would have to cut their spending significantly; and central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England would have to make major policy changes.
 The Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which were both meeting Thursday as the news broke, left interest rates unchanged: at 4.75 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
 Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, spoke by phone with Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He said the bankers were satisfied that the markets were functioning properly.
 ''We are alert, we are vigilant, we monitor all developments,'' Mr. Trichet said at a news conference in Frankfurt.
 After the September 2001 attacks, the world's major central banks pumped money into the financial system to stabilize it. The attacks also temporarily incapacitated New York's financial markets, disrupting payment and settlement procedures -- none of which occurred in London.
 ''9/11 was very, very unusual,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''It was the first of these attacks, and it directly hit the financial sector.''
 Still, the Center for Economics and Business Research, an economics research firm in London, predicted that the Bank of England might convene an emergency session to discuss a cut in rates.
 ''If the impact on the FTSE and, more importantly, the pound worsens, the bank may consider cutting rates so as to prevent additional negative pressure upon the U.K.'s consumer slowdown,'' it said in a note.
 In the United States, the full impact of the attacks on consumer confidence will be evaluated in the weeks leading up to the next Federal Reserve policy-making meeting on Aug. 9. The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates on June 30, and indicated that it was inclined to continue raising them.
 ''The good news here is the next F.O.M.C. meeting is a long way away, and there's a lot of opportunity for gathering information,'' said Raymond W. Stone, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
 Predictably, the sell-off hit shares of airlines, tourism and travel companies, and insurers the hardest. British Airways; Lufthansa; Hilton Hotels; Munich Re, the big German reinsurance company; and TUI, a German tourist operator, all fell sharply, before recovering somewhat.
 Shares of British Airways suffered their steepest decline since Sept. 20, 2001, the week after the American attacks, falling as much as 9.5 percent. By late afternoon, they were down 4.2 percent.
 Some companies rushed to reassure the market. TUI, for example, said it did not expect a drop in its bookings for London, citing the unwavering response of travelers after the Madrid bombings.
 Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurance company, said it had reduced its exposure to terrorist incidents, though it did not comment on the size of potential claims. In Britain, insurers take part in a pool that covers damage from terrorist attacks, limiting their individual exposure.
 While fears of terrorism might depress air travel temporarily, analysts said, the airlines are better prepared to deal with it than in 2001, having gone through painful cost-cutting exercises.
 ''For all the geopolitical impact of this, the markets are beginning to expect that it won't affect the profits of most companies, except possibly airlines, travel-based stocks, and insurers that have major exposure,'' said Nick Sloane, a trader in Frankfurt with the Swedish bank SEB.
 Analysts said the rebound in the price of oil during the day reflected the fact that investors concluded that the London bombings were not likely to disrupt the global economy or the demand for oil, which means oil could swiftly return to record levels.
 ''It will have a fairly fleeting effect,'' said Antoine Halff, the director of energy at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York. ''Lately, supply issues have taken the lead in driving the market.''
 For workers in the City, as London's financial district is known, the biggest worry was how to get home. Mr. Mayer of Deutsche Bank said he planned to hike to Waterloo Station and hope the suburban trains were running. If not, he said, he might end up sleeping in his office.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased Last Month

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Americans went on a shopping spree last month. And they didn't bypass Wal-Mart.
 Nearly across the board, retail sales increased in June, from luxury to midmarket to discount -- from $200 bathing suits on Fifth Avenue to $2 plastic pool toys in the mall. The reasons were varied -- hotter weather, hotter fashion, more markdowns, and less concern about gas prices than the experts had anticipated. Wal-Mart, the world's largest store chain, came roaring back from dismal sales and bad press in May to report increases of 4.5 percent in sales at stores open at least a year for its middle and working class customers, who rushed in to buy air-conditioners and summer clothes. 
Analysts had predicted that Wal-Mart's sales, store-for-store comparisons between this June and last June, would come in at 3.2 percent, following a string of unexciting monthly results. For Wal-Mart, the $288 billion retailer, that 1.3 percent difference alone moved the retail composite up more than half a point last month, to a 5.5 percent increase over June 2004, according to Goldman Sachs.
 ''Wal-Mart is such a bellwether, such a behemoth, that it dominates the retail landscape, so much so that other smaller retailers look to it for guidance,'' said Kenneth Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, which gathers analysts' predictions. 
 But it was not only Wal-Mart. Luxury goods continued to sail and the country's challenged department store sector also did well, notably Saks Inc. and Saks Fifth Avenue. The executive team at Saks Fifth Avenue, under pressure from two federal investigations into its accounting and buying processes, recorded a 7 percent increase. Sales at Kohl's, a moderately priced store chain, were up 14.4 percent, further cementing the notion of a turnaround there. 
 Retailers who cater to teenagers -- known as fickle customers -- rose 4.5 percent a year ago, but soared 14.8 percent this June, fueled by a resurgent Abercrombie & Fitch (up 38 percent) and by American Eagle Outfitters, whose own turnaround has been affirmed in the last year (up 28 percent).
 The Gap, the country's biggest specialty chain, did not exactly soar -- results for June were flat compared with a year ago -- but analysts called that an achievement: Gap had reported decreases for seven months. Limited, another company with worrisome results lately, also came in flat, although Goldman Sachs called both the Gap's and the Limited's performance ''tepid.''
 The month's better-than-estimated numbers ''knocked analysts for a loop,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''Although last year's numbers were relatively easy to beat, analysts knew that, and figured that into their projections.'' 
 The weather, he said, ''really drove summer apparel and outdoor furniture, both of which took a big hit in May,'' which was unseasonably cool. ''There was clearly pent-up demand.''
 Another factor was consumer confidence, which hit a three-year high in June. ''Normally those readings do not correlate,' he said, ''but they did in June.'' Other analysts credited the still-hot real estate market and the still-low mortgage rates, which yesterday stood at less than 5.25 percent for a 30-year-fixed-rate loan.
 Altogether, the analysts guessed too low 67 percent of the time, according to Retail Metrics. But there were a few surprises on the other end, too. Aeropostale, a youth-oriented company on a roll, missed the fashion, and reported 2 percent growth, less than the 3 percent to 5 percent estimated by analysts.
 Margaret Mager, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a report issued yesterday that ''preppy'' and ''boho'' -- short for bohemian -- trends were still going strong.
 But Ms. Mager worried about a ''potential denim tsunami,'' as chain after chain loaded up on jeans for the back-to-school season, ''which could cause increased supply to outstrip demand.'' 
 ''In this event,'' she wrote, ''intensified price competition may lead to dampened margins.''
 Eric M. Beder, a retail analyst at Brean Murray, further noted that most of the clothes sold were summer merchandise -- a good chunk of it marked down. Nevertheless, the clearance sales should allow the retailers ''to enter the key back-to-school and fall selling season relatively clean,'' he said, which ''should provide the potential for a strong third quarter.''
 Why did so many analysts get it wrong?
 Analysts, mostly based in New York City and a few other large cities, said they failed to see a strong buying trend in the Midwest, and some, like Mr. Beder, did not realize how heavily the merchants would discount after a dismal May.
 Dampening the euphoria found in so many of his colleagues' reports yesterday, Mr. Beder said June ''really doesn't give you a feel for what we're going.''
 ''This was a trendless month,'' he said. ''People bought seasonal apparel because it was hot and cheap, a good combination.'' 
 July, with its focus on back to school introductions, he said, ''will provide the first real look at consumer demand and how the retailers are going to do.''
 ''If July is as strong as June,'' Mr. Beder said, ''it's going to be a great year.''

HEADLINE: Subway and Bus Blasts in London Kill at Least 37

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Reporting for this article was contributed by Richard W. Stevenson from Auchterarder, Scotland; Sarah Lyall, Don van Natta Jr., Heather Timmons, Stephen Grey, Wendy Ginsberg and Daniel Altman of The International Herald Tribune from London; Elisabeth Rosenthal of The International Herald Tribune from Rome; and Richard Bernstein from Berlin.

DATELINE: LONDON, July 7 

 BODY:
Bomb explosions tore through three subway trains and a red-painted double-decker bus in a coordinated terror attack during London's morning rush hour on Thursday, killing at least 37 people, wounding about 700 and leaving the city stunned and bloodied but oddly stoic.
 On Wednesday, London bubbled over with joy at winning the 2012 Olympics. On Thursday, commuters on the city's subways -- the Tube -- were plunged into the nightmare of a subterranean bloodbath, when the first explosion blasted a subway train 100 yards into the tunnel at Liverpool Street station at 8:51 a.m., according to a police chronology. Seven people died. 
 The next explosion occurred at 8:56 a.m. near King's Cross station, where the death toll was 21, the police said. 
 Twenty-one minutes later, at 9:17, a third blast ripped through a train coming into Edgware Road underground station, killing seven.
 Above ground, at 9.47 a.m., an explosion tore open the roof of a No.30 double-decker bus with such force that it threw debris high into the air. The blast, at the junction of Upper Woburn Place and Tavistock Square, was so powerful that it took hours to determine that two people had died.
 The entire subway network was closed as rescue workers went deep below ground to look for the dead and wounded. Police officers in yellow slickers sealed off streets, and bus services were halted.
 ''It is reasonably clear that there have been a series of terrorist attacks in London,'' a shaken-looking Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters before he left the Group of 8 summit meeting he was host for at Gleneagles, Scotland. The attack, he said, was timed to coincide with the summit meeting. 
 Mr. Blair flew back to London to lead emergency ministerial meetings here, leaving the other seven leaders -- including President Bush -- for several hours.
 Immediately after the attacks, the United States raised its terror alert level from elevated to high for mass transit systems, and European nations also increased mass transit security precautions.
 A group describing itself as being affiliated with Al Qaeda took responsibility for the attacks on a Web site, but the police said they were unable to confirm the authenticity of the claim. The group, the Secret Orgnization of Al Qaeda in Europe, said the attacks had been undertaken to avenge British involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 The attacks were the worst in British memory since World War II.
 Some of the wounded were ferried to hospitals swathed in silvery space blankets, their faces blackened with soot. The police said seriously wounded people had lost limbs and were badly burned. 
 Three million people ride London's subway system each day. The blast initially spread chaos with police cars, ambulances and fire engines speeding across the city.
 Since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, the police here have been rehearsing emergency procedures and seemed to be following pre-arranged measures, urging people to stay where they were, tune into television, radio or Web site and avoid central London.
 When transportation was cut off, tourists gathered at the gates of Hyde Park, lining up to ask police officers how to reach the airport or other destinations. Ten-minute subway rides became 45-minute walks. A woman eight months pregnant was told her trip home would take two hours. 
 Around 11 a.m. along Edgware Road, pedestrians at the police barriers sought directions on how to get around cordoned-off areas. 
 Yusuf Pandor, 40, of North West London, was looking to return to his car on the other side of the barriers. Just more than an hour earlier, he was one of many good Samaritans helping pull bombing victims into the nearby Hilton Metropol. 
 ''They were shaken, bleeding,'' Mr. Pador said. ''One woman was badly injured, burned on her face. She had it covered. People were just shocked.''
 Loyita Worley, who works for a city law firm, told the BBC that she was in the subway when an explosion took place in the next carriage, while it was in a tunnel.
 Ms. Worley, 49, said: ''All the lights went out and the train came to an immediate halt. There was smoke everywhere, and everyone was coughing and choking, but remained calm. We couldn't open the doors.''
 Benjamin Velazquez, 34, a banker from Brooklyn, said he was visiting London to work and had been aboard the train attacked near Liverpool Street station. ''There was a loud bang, and it felt like something was falling on top of the train,'' he said. ''Then dust was flying around, black dust. And then smoke.''
 He said it had taken about 45 minutes to be rescued, and he broke down in tears once above ground, calling his mother to assure her he was in good shape, just as people did on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 He said he realized from the beginning that there had been an attack because a subway car ahead of his had been blown outward to reveal the seats within. ''The whole side of the train was open,'' he said.
 Some Londoners took the bombings in their stride, citing their long experience of Irish Republican Army attacks -- but with the key distinction that the I.R.A. often issued warnings of when it would strike, and has observed a form of truce for more than eight years.
 ''We've seen all this before in a way,'' said Sgt. John Burnett, a police officer patrolling under the tall chestnut trees near where the bus was attacked. ''We've been fighting the I.R.A. for years in London. So bombs are nothing new. 
 ''But the difference is that I.R.A. provided some warning for their attacks. It seems the hallmark of these attacks is we get no warning, whatsoever. It was a matter of when, not if.''
 By evening, some parts of the city were eerily calm, the usually thronged streets around some railroad stations cordoned off and empty while thousands of people packed the sidewalks, stranded by the lack of public transportation. Stores closed early, West End theaters canceled their shows for a night, and the Covent Garden Opera House was shuttered. The theater closings were thought to be the first since World War II, with the exception of state funerals.
 There were several theories about the strategy and methodology of the bombings, including the possibility that the devices in the subway were set off by timers.
 British officials have been forecasting a major terror strike on London since the Sept. 11 attacks, particularly since Britain sided with the United States in the war in Iraq. Mr. Blair, speaking before he left Scotland for London, said, ''Just as it is reasonably clear that this is a terrorist attack or a series of terrorist attacks, it is clear that it is designed and aimed to coincide with the opening of the G8.'' 
 He said it was ''particularly barbaric'' that the attacks coincided with a gathering intended to combat African poverty and global warming.
 ''The terrorists will not succeed,'' he said. ''Today's bombings will not weaken in any way our resolve to uphold the most deeply held principles of our societies and to defeat those who would impose their fanaticism and extremism on all of us. We shall prevail and they shall not.''
 In a recorded message later from his office at 10 Downing Street, a somber Mr. Blair declared, 
 ''The purpose of terrorism is just that -- to terrorize people and we will not be terrorized.'' 
 In his broadcast, Mr. Blair sought to prevent any backlash against British or foreign Muslims, noting that while terrorists said they acted in the name of Islam, most Muslims in Britain and around the world were ''decent law-abiding people who deplore these acts of terrorism as much as we do.''
 The Anglican bishop of Stepney in East London, Stephen Oliver, said, ''It's very important that we reassure the wider community because a great deal of damage can be done to social cohesion through fear.''
 In Gleneagles, Mr. Bush drew the comparison between the aims of the summit and the bombers.
 ''On the one hand, you have people working to alleviate poverty and rid the world of the pandemic of AIDS and ways to have a clean environment and, on the other hand, you have people working to kill people,'' he said.
 ''The contrast couldn't be clearer between the intentions and the hearts of those who care deeply about human rights and human liberty, and those who kill, those who've got such evil in their hearts that they will take the lives of innocent folks.'' Mr. Bush said. ''The war on terror goes on.'' 
 The blast spread worries across Europe, particularly in those lands that are seen as allies of the United States -- Spain until last year, Italy and others. 
 ''This should be a wake-up call for us all, since England has the best antiterrorism tradition in Europe,'' said Francesco Sidoti, a security expert at the University of L'Aquila in Italy. ''We were unprepared.'' 
 ''This has nothing to do with the old-style domestic terrorism that Europe is used to,'' he said referring to scattered acts of violence committed by groups like the Red Brigades in Italy.
 Italy's prime minister and president expressed their outrage at the attacks, as did Pope Benedict XVI, who called the bombings ''barbaric acts against humanity.''
 In Germany, which has more than 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, Otto Schily, the interior minister, urged Germans to be vigilant because their country was a potential terrorist target. ''We have to be cautious and increase our vigilance at various locations,'' he said.
 In Iraq, the London bombings were met with widespread sympathy among Iraqis, who have become accustomed to bombings that have subjected cities like Baghdad, Mosul and Kirkuk to a casualty toll, on many days, similar to that sustained in the British capital. In offices, restaurants and workshops across Baghdad, people gathered to watch live television images of the turmoil in London, and offered condolences to Britons working in Iraq.
 ''It was with deep sorrow that we heard the news of the bombings in London, and of the civilian casualties,'' Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the Iraqi prime minister, said in a message to Mr. Blair. ''This terrorist action that has no connection to any religion or any humanitarian values.'' 
 ''I'd like to send my deep condolences to you and through you to the British people generally, and to the victims' families especially,'' Dr. Jaafari said. ''All countries that experience terrorism must work together to defeat it and create a peaceful world.''
 The Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, offered his own condolences to Britain, and echoed Dr. Jaafari's sentiments. ''Terrorism is an international plague, and all nations should fight it together, because if we don't it will spread even further than it already has,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bombings Rewrite Agenda for World Leaders in Scotland

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: AUCHTERARDER, Scotland, July 7 

 BODY:
The bombings in London on Thursday knocked the meeting of major industrial nations off its carefully scripted focus on global warming and African poverty and turned it into a forum for President Bush and other world leaders to pledge unity in confronting terrorism.
 Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, as the host, had set an agenda that was intended in part to shift the attention away from his support for the war in Iraq and his partnership with Mr. Bush. But even before the first working session started, it was apparent that the tone and substance this meeting of the Group of 8 leaders had been violently reshaped. 
 Mr. Bush learned of the attacks from Mr. Blair a little over an hour after they occurred, around the start of the first formal meeting, said Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary. Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada told reporters that Mr. Blair had informed each of the leaders individually as he greeted them, and then updated them when the session began. 
 Although Mr. Blair left for London several hours later, Mr. Bush and the other leaders who had gathered here at the Gleneagles golf resort made a show of sticking more or less to their schedule of meetings and discussing their differences over how to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
 But Mr. Bush and the American delegation were clearly focused on the terrorist threat. The American president left a meeting during the middle of the morning and, sitting outside his hotel suite, held a videoconference over a secure line with his national security team in Washington to discuss the possible threat to the United States.
 His aides subsequently participated in hourly videoconferences with officials in Washington. During the day, Mr. Bush held informal conversations with some of his counterparts from other nations, and although his aides declined to be specific about what they talked about, they said it would have been natural for him to raise the issue of combating terrorism.
 ''The contrast couldn't be clearer between the intentions and the hearts of those of us who care deeply about human rights and human liberty, and those who kill, those who have got such evil in their hearts that they will take the lives of innocent folks,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The war on terror goes on.''
 If the bombings were intended, as Mr. Blair said, to disrupt the summit meeting, they also had the effect of unifying a group of leaders who have had their differences over everything from the war in Iraq to trade and exchange rates. 
 In addition to the leaders of the eight major industrial nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia -- those of China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa were also on hand for Thursday's session.
 ''The leaders will stand firm against this evil,'' said President Vicente Fox of Mexico, adding that the bombings had stirred them all to work harder at coming to agreement on a wide variety of issues, including trade and global warming. ''It is passing from word to action, the spirit coming out of this meeting,'' Mr. Fox said.
 Two European leaders who were frequently at odds with Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair over the war in Iraq pledged to stand shoulder to shoulder with Britain. President Jacques Chirac of France, who has also been squabbling with Mr. Blair on other issues, said his nation was in ''total solidarity'' with the British. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany said the international community ''must do everything in its power to fight terrorism together with all the means at its disposal.''
 The display of unity may have masked what is sure to be a debate in Britain and elsewhere over whether Britain was attacked because of Mr. Blair's strong support for the invasion of Iraq. And there was little public talk here about the adequacy of international counterterrorism efforts nearly four years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon. 
 With Mr. Blair absent, his place at the meetings was taken by his foreign secretary, Jack Straw. The leaders here canceled their group photo, and some of them acknowledged an obvious degree of distraction. Protesters and advocacy groups that had sought to use the meeting as a platform for their views on addressing poverty and the environment struggled to be heard, or gave up. 
 ''There has been a great pall cast over the discussion,'' Mr. Martin said.
 It was unclear whether the unity over combating terrorism would extend to the other issues on the table here. By the end of the day, environmental groups were circulating what they said was a draft of the communique on global warming, an issue on which Mr. Bush has been at odds with most of the other leaders. 
 Reflecting Mr. Bush's concern that too stringent a response to global warming could harm the American economy, the draft contained no specific agreement on concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a schedule. It contained a commitment to act with ''resolve and urgency'' on the issue, but also it contained broad caveats that some environmental groups said rendered it almost meaningless.
 ''While uncertainty remains in our understanding of climate science, we know enough to act now and to put ourselves on a path to slow and, as science justifies, stop and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gases,'' the draft said. 
 Briefing reporters on how the day unfolded, Mr. McClellan said Mr. Bush never considered leaving the summit meeting. After learning of the London bombings at the start of the first meeting, Mr. Bush summoned his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, and asked him to begin coordinating the American response, Mr. McClellan said.
 Around the same time, he said, Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, learned of news reports about the bombings from one of his deputies, Joe Hagin. Between them, Mr. McClellan said, Mr. Hadley and Mr. Card began calling other officials, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney, who was at his home in Wyoming.

HEADLINE: Boom in Jobs, Not Just Houses, As Real Estate Drives Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: FREDERICK, Md. 

 BODY:
Danilo Molina has never flipped a house to make a quick profit from rising real estate values. He has not refinanced a mortgage. He does not even own a home. 
 Nonetheless, the decade-long housing boom has been very good to Mr. Molina, a slight 21-year-old with a shy smile. He has been working on construction crews since he arrived in this country from El Salvador six years ago, and today he supplies workers, including himself, to build new houses in this fast-growing county roughly 50 miles northwest of Washington.
 ''I saw my friends -- they make money,'' he said on a sun-baked recent afternoon in front of a half-finished house, describing his career choice. ''Now I've got a small company.'' 
 Mr. Molina is one small part of what might be called the real estate industrial complex, the economic engine that has become one of the few reliable sources of growth in recent years. Encompassing everything from land surveyors to general contractors to loan officers, the sprawling sector has added 700,000 jobs to the nation's payrolls over the last four years, according to an analysis by Economy.com, a research firm. 
 Combined, the rest of the economy has lost nearly 400,000 jobs over the same span, which stretches back to the start of the most recent recession, in 2001.
 For all its benefits, the newfound power of real estate has also left the country vulnerable to a housing slowdown, which many economists expect over the next few years. Residential housing now makes up 16 percent, or $1.9 trillion, of the gross domestic product and is the economy's largest single sector, slightly bigger than the industries and services that supply health care, according to Economy.com. 
 Frederick, an old farming area not far from the Antietam, Gettysburg and Harpers Ferry battlefields, is a typical housing-dependent community, where new homes are sprouting from the ground even as the values of existing ones are still soaring. Much of the interior West and less crowded parts of California and Florida have also been adding real estate jobs by the thousands.
 In suburban office buildings, like the ones run by Citigroup and Wells Fargo here in Frederick, mortgage companies have hired back-office workers to handle the crush of loans generated by low-interest rates. Planned communities in the nation's expanding exurbs employ carpenters, plumbers and garbage haulers. Laid-off workers from other industries are trying their hand at selling real estate.
 ''We've been building since the Pilgrims landed,'' said Joe L. Beynon, 52, who became a project manager for a home builder here after the music school he was helping to found failed to get off the ground. ''I don't think you'd ever run out of a source of work in this industry.''
 In Frederick and the surrounding parts of suburban Maryland, one of every nine jobs is in real estate. The share would be even greater, builders say, if worries about overcrowding in schools and on roads had not caused county officials to reduce the number of building permits they have granted.
 Naples, Fla., a growing area in southwestern Florida that has had to rebuild in the wake of recent hurricanes, leads the country with one out of every six jobs in a housing-related business.
 [The Labor Department reported Friday that the economy added 146,000 jobs in June, roughly 30,000 of them in housing.]
 The economic growth of the real estate industrial complex has only added to its longstanding political clout. The housing and construction industries gave $167 million to campaigns during the 2004 election cycle, more than the agribusiness, defense, energy and computer industries put together, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. 
 Republicans received about 65 percent of the industries' contributions during the 2004 election cycle. In recent months, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and George Allen, Republican from Virginia -- senators often mentioned as 2008 presidential candidates -- have been among the biggest recipients.
 Beyond money, the housing complex has the benefit of a constituency that numbers in the tens of millions: American homeowners. When President Bush appointed a commission to study tax changes, he suggested that only two provisions, the tax breaks for charitable contributions and for payments of mortgage interest, were untouchable.
 Unlike other industries that have boomed recently -- health care and technology in particular -- real estate has the advantage of relatively low barriers to entry. A college degree, let alone one from a medical or business school, is not a prerequisite for a middle-class income, as Mr. Molina has discovered.
 A few months ago, he was helping build a house at Worman's Mill, a 1,500-house development just north of the city of Frederick, when he noticed a carpenter putting up a gazebo on some grass in the middle of a road. Mr. Molina walked over and said he wanted to learn how to do that kind of detailed work.
 Today, he is a subcontractor for that carpenter, Ronald Malatak, and makes probably $1,500 in a typical week after paying the other workers on the crew, Mr. Malatak said. Working 10 hours a day, Monday through Saturday, they earn $12.50 to $17 an hour.
 ''Make no mistake about it -- it is labor,'' Mr. Malatak said, as one of the men walked across the sloped roof of a wood-frame house. ''But they make good money.''
 Mike Muren is only a year older than Mr. Molina and is benefiting even more from the boom. He began answering phones at the offices of Mackintosh Realtors, amid the painted row houses of downtown Frederick, when he was still in high school. Rather than go to college, he decided to stick around and get his license to sell real estate. 
 ''I thought, 'This doesn't look too difficult. I could probably do this,''' said Mr. Muren, tall and lanky, with a cellphone microphone clipped to the collar of his deep blue shirt. After high school, he passed his Realtor's test, traded in his Camaro for a Toyota Camry and began selling houses.
 Last year, he made about $250,000 and, to the great amusement of his colleagues, now drives a Cadillac CTS. 
 ''A Cadillac?'' Betsy Cain, another agent in the office and the mother of one of Mr. Muren's high school classmates, remembers asking him when he brought her out to the parking lot to see it. ''You're 22 years old!'' 
 To Mr. Muren, it is all part of the job. ''I could probably go to six years of college and not make as much in five years of work as I did last year,'' he said. 
 Across the real estate sector, though, incomes are lower on average -- about $38,000 -- than they are in the rest of the economy, where the typical yearly pay is about $41,000. While mortgage brokers, architects and some real estate agents do much better, call-center employees at banks and janitors tend to make relatively little.
 Parts of the business have also become far more productive, requiring many fewer workers than were once needed for the same amount of output. Mortgage bankers, for example, no longer have to sort through the mounds of paper they once did and their software for assessing risk is much more powerful.
 The First Horizon Home Loan Corporation, which has a branch in Frederick, employs about 5,900 people today, up from 4,000 five years ago, said Jerry Baker, the chief executive. But the volume of loans the company handles has more than doubled over the same period.
 ''The story here is twofold,'' Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said. ''Real estate has been an important job creator in bad times, but it's also a reason we haven't created a lot of jobs'' elsewhere in the economy since the recession ended in late 2001. That is because growth in the housing industry does not put as many people to work as does growth in other industries. ''It's this bright shining light in the economy,'' he said, ''that doesn't create a lot of jobs.''
 Today, the biggest concern is that the light will dim as long-term interest rates rise or, at the very least, stop falling. Fixed mortgage rates are now barely above their lowest point in more than a generation.
 Moreover, if housing prices in the hottest markets actually begin falling, as some economists fear, the vast real estate sector could act as a drag on the entire economy. About 40 percent of housing booms in rich countries over the last three decades have ended in busts, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund. Busts almost inevitably led to recessions, the study found.
 Federal Reserve officials, like many analysts, are hoping that other industries will take up any slack created by a housing slowdown and start to expand more quickly. People in Frederick are hoping that a slowdown, if it comes, will be a lot gentler than the real estate slump that hit in the late 80's, around the time that the housing markets in New York, New England and California also started struggling.
 ''If we were to go back to a market like we had in '89,'' said Buzz Mackintosh, an owner of Mackintosh Realtors, ''there would be a lot of cold slaps to the face.''

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Fell in May 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers unexpectedly fell in May, declining the most since December 1990, as customers switched from costly bank debt to cheaper home-equity loans.
 Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, fell $3 billion, or 1.7 percent at an annual rate, to $2.127 trillion in May, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. 
Nonrevolving debt, which includes car loans, fell $3.8 billion, the most in 13 years.
Total credit declined for the first time since November 2003 and by the most since a $5.4 billion decline more than 14 years ago.
 A Bloomberg News survey of 34 economists had forecast a median increase of $4.1 billion in consumer credit in May.
 In April, consumer debt rose $1.16 billion, less than originally estimated. Revolving credit, which includes borrowing with credit cards, rose $725 million in May after falling $566 million in April, the Fed's statistics showed.
 House prices are at historic highs, and consumers are choosing home-equity loans pegged to falling mortgage rates over more expensive credit card and consumer loans. 
 A separate Commerce Department report yesterday said stockpiles at United States wholesalers rose for a 16th consecutive month in May, led by autos and lumber. Sales were unchanged. 
 The 0.1 percent increase brought the total value of inventories to $350.1 billion and came after a revised 0.7 percent gain in April. Sales were $295.5 billion, the same as in April.

HEADLINE: Commerce Shows Resilience as Terrorism Intrudes on a Summer Week

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
COORDINATED terror bombings in London shook up an otherwise sleepy week in business and finance. One midsize merger was announced in the United States, even after much of Wall Street seemed to have headed for the Hamptons after the Independence Day holiday. And American automakers renewed their price-cutting showroom fight to the finish.

MARKET SHOCK -- The explosions that killed at least 50 people and wounded hundreds more in London briefly unnerved financial and commodities markets around the world, but major indexes rallied after the initial shock passed and recouped about half their losses by the end of the first day. After the second day, European markets had recouped almost all their losses, and American markets were sharply higher. The attacks, which came a day after the city was chosen as the site of the 2012 Summer Olympics, did not close markets in London, the center of foreign-exchange transactions and a major hub of commodities and stock trading.
The price of oil for delivery in the near future fell from a record high of more than $62 a barrel after the attacks as traders worried that additional terror bombings could slow economic growth, reducing the demand for oil.

VITAL SIGNS -- Dispelling doubts about the health of Medicare-related businesses, UnitedHealth, the nation's No.2 health insurer, offered $8.14 billion to buy PacifiCare Health Systems of California. If successful, the acquisition would give UnitedHealth almost as many subscribers -- about 25.7 million -- as the industry leader, WellPoint, as well as additional leverage with its suppliers.
 PacifiCare's Medicare-related business was particularly attractive as it includes private Medicare-subsidized insurance, Medigap supplemental coverage to bridge shortfalls between what services cost and what the government pays, and the new Medicare drug coverage benefit that begins next January. The number of people over 65, and thus eligible for these Medicare-related services, is forecast to grow by more than 30 percent, to almost 50 million, in the next decade.
 UnitedHealth's bid for PacifiCare is likely to encourage additional consolidation in the industry, analysts said. WellChoice, the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield in New York, is one potential takeover target, as is Humana, which is focused on the Midwest and the Southeast.

SKY HIGH -- Seeking to build on its recent revival and bury recent scandals, Boeing hired one of the nation's best-known managers as chief executive, and locked him in with a generous pay package. The executive, W. James McNerney Jr., who has run 3M since 2001, will receive $1.75 million in salary and a $4 million bonus from Boeing this year, as well as $25 million in restricted stock and $22 million in supplemental retirement benefits.
 What makes him worth it? He was a finalist to succeed Jack Welch at G.E., where he had gained aerospace experience running the aircraft engines division. While he didn't get that job, he remains well known and highly regarded on Wall Street. That will help Boeing restore its reputation after several scandals, including one involving a multibillion-dollar no-bid Pentagon contract. That led to jail time for Boeing's finance chief and the resignation of its chief executive.
 Hiring Mr. McNerney puts pressure on Airbus, its sole rival in big airliners, to settle a squabble between its French and German investors, to fill its own vacant chief executive job and to get its A380 superjumbo program back on schedule. Airbus recently said its first A380 deliveries could be delayed by as much as six months.

MOTOWN SHOWDOWN -- After General Motors' latest price-slashing promotion proved a huge hit with car buyers, Ford and Chrysler reluctantly matched the offer to try to hold on to their dwindling market share. All three will now let everyone buy their cars -- all but the most popular models, anyway -- for the same discounted price as their employees. And they will often kick in cash rebates of a few thousand dollars, too.
 In a sign of faith in its past -- or despair for its future -- Chrysler also rehired its former chief executive and chief television pitchman, Lee A. Iacocca, to come out of retirement and make a new series of commercials. The ads will end with the slogan he made famous when he was leading Chrysler out of bankruptcy in the 1980's: ''If you can find a better car, buy it.''
 Money that consumers save in buying such deeply discounted cars today may be lost when they try to sell the cars later, analysts warned. Discounts have already reduced demand for used cars by making new cars more affordable, they said, and brisk sales now mean a glut of used cars in the future, further depressing prices.

NOT SO FAST -- After a jury acquitted Richard M. Scrushy, the founder of HealthSouth, on 36 criminal counts of false reporting, conspiracy, fraud and money laundering, a federal judge in his hometown, Birmingham, Ala., told regulators to explain why she shouldn't dismiss a related civil lawsuit they had filed against him.
 Lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission did so, saying that they will pursue the lawsuit, in which they are seeking $785 million in civil fines and restitution to shareholders. The civil lawsuit had been put deferred until the criminal case was decided.
 Mr. Scrushy's lawyers have said he wants his job back at HealthSouth, but the company's new managers have flatly rejected that idea. The S.E.C. lawsuit also seeks to forbid him to serve as an officer or director at any publicly traded company.

Death Toll Rises to 49 In London Bomb Attack
Investigators have concluded that the bombs that ripped through three subway trains and a bus in London were crude devices containing less than 10 pounds of explosives each -- a finding that supports a theory gaining momentum among authorities that the plot was carried out by homegrown extremists rather than terrorists exported to England. A1

Police in London said they were hampered by fears of structural damage to subway tunnels at the sites of the explosions and by vermin, particularly at the site between King's Cross and Russell Square, where numerous bodies had yet to be recovered. A7

As officials across Europe scrambled to beef up security in the wake of the London bombings, the tension was greatest in Italy, a country many experts regard as the next terrorism target because of its involvement in the war in Iraq. A8

Europeans have refused to sacrifice civil liberties in the fight against terrorism, criticizing the United States for restricting its citizens' rights for the sake of security. Even with the London attacks, there is little indication that this view is changing. A8

G-8 Sees Progress on Africa
Striking tones of optimism and defiance a day after the attacks in London, President Bush and the leaders of seven other big industrial nations concluded a summit meeting saying they had made progress in addressing African poverty and global warming. A1

Iraq Asks Muslims for Support
Iraq's transitional government reached out to Arab and other Muslim nations, asking them not to be intimidated by the killing of Egypt's top diplomat in Iraq by an Islamic terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda. A5

Copter Victims Memorial Draws Many Supporters
More than 2,000 people gathered at a memorial service in Virginia Beach for eight members of the Navy Seals and eight Army special operations soldiers who died on June 28 when their helicopter was shot down in a ravine in eastern Afghanistan. A1

Residents Brace for Hurricane
Coastal residents from the Florida Keys all the way to Louisiana scrambled or held their breath as Hurricane Dennis plowed through Cuba, killing at least 10 people, before surging toward the Gulf of Mexico barely a month into hurricane season. A9

Rumors Follow Rehnquist
Rumors of an imminent retirement announcement by 80-year-old Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who has been ill with thyroid cancer, reached a frenzy of bizarre proportions. A9

Court Upholds Abortion Ruling
A federal appeals court upheld a ruling by a Nebraska district court that struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which banned a method of abortion generally used after the first trimester. A11

EDUCATION

Seeking End to Loan Loophole
Margaret Spellings, the education secretary, joined the chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, John Boehner, in asking Congress to close a loophole allowing lenders to claim a 9.5 percent government subsidy on certain student loans. A10

Ms. Spellings also suggested that the federal No Child Left Behind law, which requires that public school children be tested in reading and math, could be expanded to include other subjects. A11

Cardinal Questions Evolution
An influential cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, which has long been regarded as an ally of the theory of evolution, is now suggesting that belief in evolution as accepted by science today may be incompatible with Catholic faith. A1

PERSON: HARUTOSHI FUKUI

HEADLINE: For a Hungry Audience, a Japanese Tom Clancy

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
GROPING for a career as he neared 30, Harutoshi Fukui decided to become a novelist while still working full time as a security guard. In little time he quit that job, after winning a prestigious Japanese literary prize in 1998 for ''Twelve Y.O.,'' a political-military thriller whose title recalls Gen. Douglas MacArthur's infamous comment that Japan was a nation of 12-year-olds.
 Now 36, Mr. Fukui has to his name a handful of best sellers whose common themes -- postwar Japan's mistaken path, its wounded pride, the sense of stagnation today and the need for a virile military -- resonate in a country shedding its pacifism and rearming itself.
 This year, three big-budget war movies based on Mr. Fukui's stories are being released here, a sign of how much Japan itself has changed in the short time that he has risen from obscurity to pop culture prominence. Unlike Hollywood, Japan's film industry traditionally avoided making movies with military themes, especially ones in which the military was portrayed heroically. 
 What is more, the Self-Defense Forces used to participate mainly in ''Godzilla'' movies, typically keeping public order as the lizard ran amok. But for the first time in postwar Japan, this year's movies, with the full cooperation of the military, show the armed forces doing what they have yet to do in the real world since World War II: fight and kill.
 ''It can undoubtedly be attributed to the times,'' Mr. Fukui said.
 Mr. Fukui sat down for an interview here on Monday, looking a little out of place, underdressed in jeans and a T-shirt, in the Imperial Hotel's lobby cafe. While demure about his success -- ''my life hasn't changed that much,'' Mr. Fukui said -- he seemed a little weary, perhaps somehow world-weary, compared with his demeanor during an interview in April in his neighborhood in eastern Tokyo. 
 Back then, the first movie, ''Lorelei: The Witch of the Pacific Ocean,'' a World War II tale of a Japanese submarine that foils American plans to drop a third atomic bomb, on Tokyo, was already a certified hit. In June, the second movie, ''Sengoku Jieitai 1549,'' or ''Samurai Commando Mission 1549,'' was released, offering a story of Self-Defense Forces sent back in time to a Japan riven by civil war.
 This month, ''Bokoku no Aegis,'' or ''A Lost Country's Aegis,'' will open, featuring some of Japan's biggest male stars in a story about a terrorist who infiltrates a Japanese military vessel. The terrorist in the novel is clearly identified as North Korean; in the movie, though, he could be from either North Korea or China, two countries with which Japan's relations have recently worsened.
 THE novels and movies, not to mention Mr. Fukui himself, have been embraced by conservatives eager to revise Japan's war-renouncing Constitution and transform the Self-Defense Forces into a full-fledged military. After all, they show how military force is used to save Japan. But conservatives dwell little on the three movies' warnings to Japan that this age could produce charismatic extremists.
 Mr. Fukui said, ''I wouldn't want the audiences to come out of this just wanting to shoot a gun.'' 
 In each movie based on one of his stories, a central character echoes the increasingly popular belief among the right wing here that postwar Japan, emasculated by America and content with making money, has lost its soul. In ''Lorelei,'' one character, Colonel Asakura, wants America to annihilate Tokyo with an atomic bomb so that Japan can be reborn; if Japan simply submits to America, Colonel Asakura says in one of the movie's most memorable lines: ''Japan will degrade itself and become a slave to the United States. Does a country like that have any worth?''
 In ''Samurai Commando,'' scheduled to be released in the United States late this year, a Colonel Matoba wants to alter Japan's history to spare the country its ''horrible defeat'' in World War II and its present humiliation. ''I will start all over again from this age to create a strong country that will make Heisei Japanese proud to be Japanese,'' he said, using the word for the present era of Emperor Akihito.
 Those sentiments, Mr. Fukui says, are the movies' most salient because they reflect widespread feelings among Japanese that their country is stumbling forward.
 ''We want to change; something is wrong with us now,'' he said. ''Somehow we feel we've come to a dead end. In this kind of age, there is the possibility that characters like that, who hold grudges, will emerge in the real world.''
 Those extremists, though destroyed in his stories, are more attractive than the heroes. The good guys, in another commentary on today's Japan, ''have no strong vision,'' he said.
 Mr. Fukui's stories reflect prevailing beliefs among the political class. But more than speeches or newspaper editorials, the big-budget movies based on his stories may go a long way toward influencing ordinary Japanese who, according to polls, have yet to be convinced that Japan needs a strong military. 
 ''There seem to be young people who are tremendously influenced by my work, more than I expected,'' Mr. Fukui said. ''Out of those, some will keep thinking and may hold positions to move the world in the future.'' 
 Little, except a youthful interest in composing movie scripts, had prepared Mr. Fukui for a writer's life. In college, he studied economics, but dropped out because he found holding odd jobs -- like selling goods on bullet trains -- more interesting. 
 After deciding to write novels, he learned from ''how to become a novelist'' manuals that the best way to be published is to win a new writer's award, so he set himself that goal, which he accomplished with ''Twelve Y.O.'' 
 Mr. Fukui focused immediately on the Self-Defense Forces, which, despite having long enjoyed one of the world's biggest military budgets, are severely constrained by the MacArthur-imposed peace Constitution. To Mr. Fukui, the forces are perhaps ''something like a miniature of postwar Japan.''
 LIKE many Japanese, he believes that postwar Japan's unequal alliance with the United States infantilized its culture. Japan accepted dependence on the United States as long as it was allowed to become rich.
 ''We were 12-year-olds just as Americans said,'' he said. ''But over the last five years, we think we've become at least 14-year-olds. There is a clear difference between 12 years old and 14 years old, when self-consciousness sprouts and the person reaches adolescence.''
 In recent years, faced with a nuclear North Korea and a rising China, an increasingly nationalistic Japan has begun confronting its neighbors directly. Japan, he said, is enduring the difficulties of adolescence.
 ''I think it's something close to hysteria,'' he said. ''It's like a person who says, 'The world is a scary place, and I should learn to fight like my father.' But the same person says, 'I want to get away from my father and go my own way.'
 ''Yet, once he leaves home, he finds no job, no place to live. He can't find a way to make a living. He'll carry smoldering discontent that he has to live this way until he's at least 16 or 18 years old.''

HEADLINE: L.I. Community Focus of Debate On Immigrants

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., July 8 

 BODY:
Mexico's consul general for the New York region said on Friday that the Long Island community of Farmingville had become a national flash point on immigration issues because of the latest conflict over day laborers evicted from overcrowded houses cited as unsafe.
 The consul general, Arturo C. Sarukhan, criticized local officials at a news conference here on Friday, saying they should help relocate the displaced tenants and soothe local tensions.
 ''I would say that Farmingville, except for the Arizona border, seems to be a unique flashpoint or red flag on the map,'' Mr. Sarukhan said in a separate interview. ''Farmingville has become a symbol of how we need to solve the profound dislocations that have been occurring'' in immigration. 
 The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, may have been ill-advised on Farmingville, Mr. Sarukhan said, urging him ''to rethink his position'' and heal local rifts. Mr. Sarukhan said he would seek ''a face-to-face meeting'' with Mr. Levy next week. 
 Mr. Levy replied in an interview that he had already met the consul general and knew his views. ''If it's possible to fit him in, we'll see what we can do,'' Mr. Levy said about another meeting. ''But,'' he added pointedly, ''I don't need a lecture.''
 Mr. Levy also found himself at odds with nine members of his own Hispanic Advisory Board, who complained he had ignored them and quit in protest. Newsday reported the resignations on Friday.
 But Mr. Levy, a Democrat who took office last year, said he had met with the board more often than his Republican predecessor did in 12 years, and described most of those who quit as disgruntled Republican holdovers.
 In vitriolic volleys in the past three weeks, critics called Mr. Levy ''racist'' and accused him of ''ethnic cleansing'' in Farmingville, while he retorted that the critics were ''extremists'' and the ''lunatic fringe.''
 Farmingville has been torn for several years as thousands of Mexicans, many of them illegal aliens, flooded into its mostly white working-class neighborhoods. Longtime residents often complain about throngs of men congregating on sidewalks, waiting to be hired for the day, and about blight they say is caused by overcrowded flophouses. Advocates for the Mexicans say most are hard-working and fill a demand for low-paid manual labor. 
 The tensions have prompted protest marches on both sides, and even violence. In 2000, assailants pretended to hire two laborers, then beat them nearly to death. In 2003, a house was set afire by teenagers, and the Mexican family sleeping inside barely escaped.
 Emotions boiled over anew last month as the Suffolk police assisted Brookhaven Town officials in arresting a landlord and closing a 900-square-foot single-family house for safety violations. Inspectors said that they found 44 beds and that up to 64 men had stayed there.
 Neighbors hailed the crackdown as overdue. Town officials said they were investigating other overcrowded houses in Farmingville, more than 150 at last count, and estimated that there were 300 more such house in other parts of Brookhaven Town.
 But advocates for the immigrants object that they had no warning and were forced into homelessness. Mr. Levy said that the county social service agency would help those who were eligible, but that illegal aliens did not qualify, and that nonprofit agencies would be enlisted to find them temporary quarters.
 Mr. Sarukhan said he was not questioning the county executive's ''decision or authority to enforce those fire codes.'' But he faulted Mr. Levy for not meeting with representatives of the Mexicans, and for failing to use ''the bully pulpit'' of his office to heal Farmingville's wounds.
 ''The day laborers are not criminals,'' he said. ''They are law-abiding. They are hard-working, and most are taxpayers.'' He urged a broad discussion among the two governments and local officials, including issues of gangs and international trade.
 The county's role has been ''totally exaggerated,'' Mr. Levy said, because the town is responsible for code enforcement. But he wholeheartedly supports it, to rescue tenants from dangerous conditions and protect neighborhoods from slumlords. 
 Mr. Levy said that the consul general ''would have been more productive if he had announced he was giving money to the county to help residents from Mexico who are here illegally.'' He also urged that Mexico improve its economy so its citizens will not be lured across the border.
 ''The constituents are overwhelmingly behind me in our effort to enforce the law,'' Mr. Levy said. The issue has generated hundreds of calls and letters, which he said run nine to one in support. ''Just today I finished taping a television show and a woman from Farmingville came up and kissed me and thanked me for standing tough.''

HEADLINE: Share Prices Defy an Oil Spike and the London Bombings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stock markets in Europe rebounded yesterday, wiping out almost all of the losses incurred after Thursday's bombings in London, while stocks moved sharply higher in the United States -- winding up what has turned out to be a surprising week for equities.
 Despite the new high for the price of a barrel of crude oil on Wednesday, the bombings in London on Thursday and the weaker-than-expected June jobs report yesterday, all three main American stock market gauges rose this week.
Yesterday, after climbing 13.99 points, or 1.2 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed for the week at 1,211.86, up 1.5 percent. Yesterday was the best day for the S.&P. 500 since May 4.
 The Nasdaq composite index had its best day since April 21, climbing 37.22 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 2,112.88, up 2.7 percent for the week. And the Dow Jones industrial average had its best day since April 21, rising 146.85 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,449.14, up 1.4 percent for the week. 
 American stocks, which rose steadily from the opening, got an extra boost in the afternoon when the price of oil suddenly dropped below $60 a barrel, even as Hurricane Dennis neared the United States. 
 The FTSE 100 index in London recovered all of Thursday's loss and finished the week up 1.4 percent. The CAC 40 index in Paris also rebounded from Thursday and was up 0.7 percent for the week. The DAX index in Germany and the Madrid Stock Exchange general index were down just slightly for the week after erasing most of Thursday's losses. 
 James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, said if he had known about oil, the bombings and the jobs report, ''I would have said it might be a tough week.''
 Part of the explanation for the rebounds here and abroad is that investors are now prepared for the risks of terrorist attacks and have already proved they can handle the impact. Some investors even see these sell-offs as an opportunity to buy. After the 1.5 percent decline in the S.&P. 500 on March 11, 2004, the day of the Madrid train bombings, the index rose 1.3 percent the next day.
 The Madrid general index dropped 2.1 percent on the day of the March bombings and was down 4.9 percent over the next two trading days. But by April 8, the index had bounced all the way back.
 Another reason for the rebound in Europe is that stock markets there have had a good run this year so far, unlike the American stock market, with many of the leading stock indexes at or near multiyear highs.
 As for Wall Street, Mr. Paulsen said that the resilience in stocks might in part reflect the recent string of positive economic reports, including the strong retail sales reported Thursday and the big jumps in the manufacturing sector and the service sector indexes for June compiled by the Institute for Supply Management.
 ''It may just be hard to keep this stock market down,'' he said, citing the economic reports and the fact that longer-term interest rates, which affect the cost of mortgages, are still so low.
 While the June employment report of 146,000 new jobs was weaker than the 200,000 consensus forecast, the May jobs number was increased to 104,000, from 78,000. ''So it was not that bad,'' Mr. Paulsen said. 
 Oil, however, still has to be a worry. With Hurricane Dennis on the horizon, there is concern that damage to drilling rigs could send the price of oil even higher. Although oil ended the week below $60 a barrel, a price in the high $50's is not very comforting. On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude oil for August delivery slipped $1.10, or 1.8 percent, to $59.63. The high reached Wednesday was $61.28 a barrel. While that new high helped send stocks lower on Wednesday, investors seemed to ignore the week's spike yesterday.
 Investors will be turning their focus to second-quarter earnings reports. More than 20 companies in the S.&P. 500 are expected to announce earnings next week, with General Electric scheduled to report at the end of the week. The true flood begins the following week, with as many as 120 companies announcing, including Intel, according to Thomson Financial.
 Wall Street analysts are forecasting that second-quarter earnings will rise 7.5 percent, from the quarter a year ago. That is down from the 13.9 percent growth rate for the first quarter and would be the first single-digit earnings growth in the last eight quarters. But earnings growth is expected to move back into double-digit territory in the third and fourth quarters, according to Thomson Financial.
 Better-than-expected earnings reports from Alcoa, the aluminum maker, and Accenture, the business consultant, helped stocks rally yesterday.
 But the bottom line for stocks is still negative. The Dow is down 3.1 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq is off 2.9 percent and the S.&P. 500 is unchanged. And all three are still locked in trading ranges below their recent highs.
 And Mr. Paulsen said stocks had to break out of these trading ranges before investors could really talk about a rally.

HEADLINE: At Mosque That Recruited Radicals, New Imam Calls for Help in Catching Bombers

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The new imam at the Finsbury Park mosque, once a hotbed of radical Islam, had a message for those who gathered for prayer on Friday, a day after four bombs killed at least 49 people: help identify the bombers, he told them. Show your anger at what happened here. 
 His call to cooperate was a stark and deliberate contrast to a former imam, Abu Hamza al-Masri, now detained and facing extradition to the United States to face terrorism-related charges. Under his leadership, the Finsbury Park mosque became a recruiting center for jihadists for holy wars from Bosnia to Afghanistan. 
 It is that image the residents of this North London immigrant neighborhood are working hard to shed, eager to demonstrate to an increasingly anxious country that they are not to blame for the attacks on Thursday and that Finsbury Park has rid itself of extremists. 
 Already, residents here were bracing themselves, fearing they would become targets. ''It'll soon be 'kick-a-Muslim week' if we don't watch out,'' said one young man who declined to give his name. Already, there have been some retaliatory acts against Muslims in Britain. 
 The struggle in Finsbury Park reflects the broader divide between two Muslim worlds in Britain -- the majority of moderates and the radical Islamists who live among them. For years, a relatively small band of radical Islamists hijacked Finsbury Park's image and threatened its economic rejuvenation.
 But the moderates are reclaiming the mosque. They installed a new board of trustees who brought in the new, moderate imam. The mosque now offers a course on Islam for non-Muslims. The neighborhood's other, smaller mosque has thrown open its doors in an aggressive program to show London and the world that they do not harbor terrorists. It holds regular ''open mosque weekends,'' in which all comers are invited to tour the mosque, watch videos about its charitable programs and eat from a buffet of halal food. 
 ''When we held our last one in May, 1,200 people came,'' said Fadi Itani, the younger director of the smaller mosque, standing in the courtyard hung with banners advertising another open-mosque weekend in July.
 A stream of Muslims, many in conservative Islamic dress, streamed into the square concrete mosque's small courtyard on Friday from a busy street of brick storefronts. 
 Like most moderate Muslims, Mr. Itani expressed a weary frustration about the latest attacks. ''As a Muslim, to be honest, I've had enough,'' he said. 
 In many ways, Finsbury Park is a microcosm of Britain's Muslim community: a traditionally immigrant neighborhood that has housed Irish and Italians as they arrived and moved up in British society. It was largely inhabited by Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants by the 1960's. In the 1970's, they bought a row of dilapidated houses on Saint Thomas Road and transformed them into an Islamic community center and later tore down the houses to build a four-story red-brick mosque.
 By the late 1990's, North African Arabs arrived, many of them fleeing Algeria's bloody civil war between Islamists and the country's military-backed secular government. Among them came dozens of Muslim extremists, and within a few years, they took over the Finsbury Park mosque, which was riven by leadership squabbles. As imam, they brought in Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, better known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born fundamentalist preacher known for his extremist anti-Western views.
 Though his following was small, Mr. Mustafa's presence loomed over the neighborhood and fragmented the community.
 ''Most of us went to the other mosque,'' said Mounir Kirati, who arrived as an Algerian refugee in 1998, as he made his way back from prayers. ''We didn't like their interpretation of Islam.''
 Muhammad Ali, a bearded man in a brown robe, said the extremists' presence had cast a pall over the economic revival that the neighborhood is undergoing. Nearby Blackstock Road, lined with shuttered shops 20 years ago, is now bustling with Algerian-owned cafes and Somali-owned telephone shops.
 The police raided the Finsbury Park mosque in January 2003, and Britain's moderate Muslim community leaders orchestrated Mr. Mustafa's ouster.
 ''That place is now safe in the hands of mainstream Muslims,'' said Ahmed Sheik, president of the Muslim Association of Britain, which helped install the mosque's new board. ''We have no fear of the radicals coming again.'' 
 The Finsbury Park mosque cannot prevent Muslims with extremist beliefs from coming to pray, but they can no longer use the premises for other activities, said Muhammad Kozbar, the new secretary of the mosque's board of trustees. As proof that the mosque has been reclaimed, he said the average congregation for Friday Prayer has tripled from what it was in its radical days.
 ''The extremists are a very tiny minority,'' said Talal Karim, who served for 20 years in the local government responsible for Finsbury Park. ''The moderate majority has outmaneuvered them.''
 But the frustration of the community is growing as evidence mounts that Muslim immigrant citizens or the children of immigrants in Europe are increasingly populating the rank and file of terrorist organizations. Of 140 people implicated in European terrorist activities since 1993, 24 percent were European nationals, according to a study by Robert S. Leiken and Steven Brooke at Washington's Nixon Center, an independent think tank.
 For many Muslims here, condemning terrorism does not mean condoning American or British policies.
 ''It is correct to say Islam forbids the killing of civilians, but we need to have a larger discussion about why these actions happened,'' said Imran Waheed, spokesman for the British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a global Islamist party working for the return of an Islamic caliphate, whose activists handed out leaflets outside the Finsbury Park mosque as people left Friday Prayer. ''What we want is equity or parity between the life of a Briton in the suburbs of London and a farmer in Iraq,'' he said.
 Opposition to Britain's role in Iraq has turned the area's Muslim community away from the governing Labor Party and toward the upstart Respect Party of George Galloway, who issued a statement Thursday saying that his party had warned that the war in Afghanistan and Iraq would increase the threat of terrorist attack in Britain. 
 Massoud Shadjareh, chairman of Britain's Islamic Human Rights Commission, argued that injustice lends legitimacy to extremist discourse.
 ''There needs to be a separation between those who are committing those atrocities and those who are passionate about injustice,'' he said, adding that dismissing extremists outright only isolates them and makes them more likely to turn to violence. ''We need to encourage that passion and give them avenues within the civil society to deal with injustices.''
 ''We have far greater experience as victims of terror than as perpetrators of terror,'' said Mr. Waheed of Hizb ut-Tahrir, saying that the community's reaction to the killing of Muslims in Afghanistan and the Middle East has been ''remarkably restrained.''
 ''People need to understand the feeling on the Muslim street,'' he said. ''People hate the foreign policy of Britain and the United States, and the West needs to consider whether constant interference in the Muslim world is productive.''

HEADLINE: Dollar Strength Blunts Pain Of Rising Oil Prices for U.S.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
With oil priced in dollars, who's sorry now? 
 Oil prices are up a lot this year, but the pain in the United States may be less than almost anywhere else. The dollar revival arrived just in time to blunt the effect. 
When oil futures settled down $1.10 yesterday, at $59.63 a barrel -- after topping $61 on Wednesday -- the price in dollars had risen 37 percent since the end of 2004. But the rise was even greater for other countries. Measured in euros, the rise was 56 percent, and it was 50 percent in yen and 52 percent in pounds.
 There are other factors at work, of course, but this may help to explain why European growth has been more anemic than that in other regions. It also does not help that the largest economies in the euro area, unlike Britain, are not oil producers.
 Since October 1990, when oil prices last peaked in advance of the first Persian Gulf war, the United States has suffered less compared with other countries, both in local currencies and adjusted for inflation. 
 Adjusted for inflation, prices in the United States did not exceed the most recent peak -- in 1990 -- until this week. But while the 1990 peak lasted only a brief period and quickly receded, high prices this year have lasted for months, and the futures market, at any rate, apparently believes they will not soon go away.
 In Europe, local-currency oil prices have risen more since the 1990 peak, whether in nominal terms or adjusted for inflation. In Japan, the nominal change is smaller, but there has been almost no inflation since 1990, and in real terms the increase has been greater than in the United States.
 Measured in dollars, oil prices yesterday were 48 percent higher than at their peak of $40.42 on Oct. 11, 1990. But on an inflation-adjusted basis, the rise was just 1 percent. That compared with inflation-adjusted increases of 21 percent to 23 percent in Japan, Britain, Germany and France. The worst pain has been in Italy, where the price of oil is up 31 percent when adjusted for inflation -- and has more than doubled when expressed in local currency. 
 In fact, the effects on consumers are not as bad as one might expect from such figures, simply because all major countries impose substantial taxes on gasoline purchases. 
 The taxes generally are based on volume, not price, which means that a doubling of crude oil costs will lead to a much smaller percentage increase in pump prices with taxes included. There are other factors, like profit margins for refiners, that affect the retail price, but crude costs and taxes remain the primary ones.
 As a general rule, the higher the tax level, the less impact -- on a percentage basis -- a rise in crude oil costs will have on retail gasoline prices. Because Europe generally has higher gasoline taxes than does the United States, the impact of higher crude oil prices has not been as great on retail prices.
 But that does not offset the fact that the rise in crude oil costs this year has been less painful for the American economy. That is the direct opposite of the impact during the last half of 2004, when oil prices rose and the dollar was weak. 
 One casualty of the market moves has been talk that oil prices should be based on a basket of currencies, not just dollars. That seemed like a good idea to some oil-exporting countries when the dollar was weak, but now they are quite happy to be collecting surprisingly strong dollars.

WHEN is a bubble not a bubble?
 If your only news sources were headlines, magazine covers and cable TV, you would be shaking in your Hush Puppies over the economic meltdown that prognosticators say will surely come after the ''housing bubble'' pops, as it surely will. Comparisons are made to the technology bubble, which, when it burst, sent the Nasdaq down 80 percent and helped propel the country into a recession.
 But hold on a minute. Barry Ritholtz, a contributor to TheStreet.com's RealMoney, points out the essential differences between the rising stock prices of the late 1990's and the rising home prices of today. Home prices in some markets, Mr. Ritholtz writes, may fall 25 percent to 30 percent. This is a ''significant correction,'' but it's not the bursting of a bubble. 
 Furthermore, the difference is not only one of degree, but of kind, he writes. ''Homes are illiquid assets that take several months to sell; stock can be liquidated instantly. The housing market is regional, with an uneven distribution of asset appreciation. Equities are national, and even global.
 ''Lastly, there is an intrinsic value of a house as a place where you can live. Compare this with a company whose only asset was a sock puppet and it's clear why a profitless, assetless, publicly traded company can go to zero. Barring an external disaster like Love Canal, houses will not.''
 To be sure, there are regional bubbles in the housing market. Bubbles need speculators, and speculators abound in places like San Francisco, Washington and other coastal cities. But even here, much of the price appreciation has to do with demographic shifts, rising employment and rising incomes. 
 Mr. Ritholtz notes that populations in South Florida and Las Vegas, which have had the biggest price gains, ''are growing at two to three times the national rate, so it's no surprise that their home prices have been appreciating rapidly.''

BUBBLE BATH -- What is usually left out of all the bubble talk is the effect of rising home prices on working families. A study by the Center for Housing Policy financed by Freddie Mac, freddiemac.com, concludes: ''When it comes to decent, affordable housing for working families, the landscape is changing, but not for the better.''
 ''The number of America's working families spending more than half their income on housing grew 76 percent in just over half a decade. In addition, six out of 10 immigrant working families with critical housing needs are Hispanic and one-third are from Mexico.''

BEHIND THE HEDGES -- Thomas K. Brown is a former top bank-stock analyst and the current operator of Second Curve Capital, a hedge fund that concentrates on the financial services sector. For three years, he has run bankstocks.com, an opinion site that concentrates on, what a surprise, the financial services sector.
 Merely a repository of cheerleading for the fund's own investments? Yes, in part. The tagline, ''your source for independent insights on the financial services industry,'' does not quite hold up, given that the writers put their money where their words are. 
 But the site offers a valuable look at the thought processes of fund managers. And other than the tagline, the site does not pretend to be objective. In the ''Why We Write'' section, Mr. Brown says, ''The site lets us evangelize about companies that we like.''

JUST PARODY IT -- Nike's appropriation (read: without permission) of the cover of the hard-core punk band Minor Threat's 1981 self-titled debut album for use in a marketing campaign has inspired creative Photoshop-wielding Web denizens to make their own ad-album mashups at ilXor.com. For example, there is a Sinead O'Connor album cover pitching Fantastic Sam's and an Andy Warhol's big banana cover for the Velvet Underground & Nico sporting the Chiquita logo. There are others, including many that cannot be adequately described in a family newspaper. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: For Security Guards, Some Lessons in Living Up to the Name 

BYLINE: By ABEER ALLAM

 BODY:
Their eyes glued to their instructor, seven security guards got their first lesson in how to spot a potential terrorist. 
 ''It is not going to be Osama bin Laden coming down Fifth Avenue,'' said the instructor, Sgt. Jim Mastricovo, a New York police officer who also teaches at the Police Academy. ''It is going to be anybody -- the most inconspicuous, the most benign person you can see.'' 
In post-Sept. 11 New York, Sergeant Mastricovo said, security guards are more than ever on the front lines protecting the city from terrorists. 
 The class is part of a training program sponsored by Local 32BJ, a building service workers' union, and the Realty Advisory Board, an association of building owners. 
 The program provides 40 hours of training on how to respond to emergency situations, including terrorist attacks.
 In a recent class taught by Sergeant Mastricovo, a three-hour session at a Manhattan office, a range of issues were covered, including the threat posed by packages without return addresses, the detection of biological or chemical attacks, and warnings about women in short skirts trying to befriend guards as well as people who ask questions about a building's ventilation system. 
 Under state law, security guards who work in privately-owned buildings must have eight hours of general training to be certified. 
 The law makes no mention of counterterrorism training, though it does define terrorism as a possible threat.
 At the announcement of the antiterror training program in April, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, ''All New Yorkers will benefit from having thousands of extra trained eyes and ears on the streets on the lookout for trouble.'' 
 So far, 105 guards have completed the program, with a curriculum and textbooks developed by the city's Office of Emergency Management, the Police Department and John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Fisher Brothers and Vornado Realty Trust, two of New York's largest real estate companies, are among those that have enrolled guards in the program. 
 But the program has reached just a small fraction of the nearly 60,000 private security guards who Local 32BJ estimates work in New York City.
 Mike Fishman, president of the local, said many business owners did not fully embrace the importance of having well-trained security guards. 
 ''For all of us,'' Mr. Fishman said, ''this became very clear after 9/11, when we had people in every building across the city -- nearly 2,000 buildings. Everybody had a question about what they should do in case the terrorist attacks continue.'' 
 Partnership for New York City, a business group that focuses on the city's economy, has tried to persuade business owners to participate in the program. 
 ''This is part of an overall effort to assure businesses that are thinking about coming to New York that we have the world's most outstanding security program,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the partnership. ''Not only a police department, but also private security that is a world-class standard.'' 
 Vornado and Fisher Brothers are paying the union and the realty board $125,000 to train their employees, and are paying the guards their wages for the five days necessary to complete the program. 
 Union officials said some businesses were reluctant to send their guards because companies might have to pay better-trained guards higher wages.
 Robert D. McCrie, a professor of security management at John Jay College who helped draft the state-mandated general training for guards, said the new counterterrorism classes had made a good start by covering major topics.
 But more effective training, he said, would provide interactive activities rather than the video clips and slide shows now used in the program. Security guards, he said, have to be put in situations that require them to figure out how to react to different threats. 
 Still, security guards who participated in the antiterror course said it was beneficial. 
 ''The job is more demanding, more complicated than before Sept. 11,'' said Carlos Bossa, 32, who has been a guard at 731 Lexington Avenue for seven years. ''Now I know what to look for.'' 
 Each class in the program ends with a written quiz to reinforce that session's lessons.
 ''The people that are looking to hurt us are highly trained, highly sophisticated, highly educated, and they are watching us all the time,'' Sergeant Mastricovo said. ''So we need to train as many people as possible to be sophisticated in observation. I train them to be safe. If they are safe, we are safe.''

HEADLINE: Al Qaeda's Smart Bombs

BYLINE: By Robert A. Pape. 
Robert A. Pape, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, is the author of ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism.''

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
WHILE we don't yet know who organized the terrorist attacks in London on Thursday, it seems likely that they were the latest in a series of bombings, most of them suicide attacks, over the past several years by Al Qaeda and its supporters. Although many Americans had hoped that Al Qaeda has been badly weakened by American counterterrorism efforts since Sept. 11, 2001, the facts indicate otherwise. Since 2002, Al Qaeda has been involved in at least 17 bombings that killed more than 700 people -- more attacks and victims than in all the years before 9/11 combined. 
 To make sense of this campaign, I compiled data on the 71 terrorists who killed themselves between 1995 and 2004 in carrying out attacks sponsored by Osama bin Laden's network. I was able to collect the names, nationalities and detailed demographic information on 67 of these bombers, data that provides insight into the underlying causes of Al Qaeda's suicide terrorism and how the group's strategy has evolved since 2001. 
 Most important, the figures show that Al Qaeda is today less a product of Islamic fundamentalism than of a simple strategic goal: to compel the United States and its Western allies to withdraw combat forces from the Arabian Peninsula and other Muslim countries. 
 As the chart at the upper right shows, the overwhelming majority of attackers are citizens of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries in which the United States has stationed combat troops since 1990. Of the other suicide terrorists, most came from America's closest allies in the Muslim world -- Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia and Morocco -- rather than from those the State Department considers ''state sponsors of terrorism'' like Iran, Libya, Sudan and Iraq. Afghanistan produced Qaeda suicide terrorists only after the American-led invasion of the country in 2001. The clear implication is that if Al Qaeda was no longer able to draw recruits from the Muslim countries where there is a heavy American combat presence, it might well collapse. 
 As the large chart at the center of the page shows, what is common among the attacks is not their location but the identity of the victims killed. Since 2002, the group has killed citizens from 18 of the 20 countries that Osama bin Laden has cited as supporting the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
 There is good evidence that this shift in Al Qaeda's scheme was the product of deliberate choice. In December 2003, the Norwegian intelligence service found a lengthy Qaeda planning document on a radical Islamic Web site that described a coherent strategy for compelling the United States and its allies to leave Iraq. It made clear that more spectacular attacks against the United States like those of 9/11 would be insufficient, and that it would be more effective to attack America's European allies, thus coercing them to withdraw their forces from Iraq and Afghanistan and increasing the economic and military burdens that the United States would have to bear. 
 In particular, the document weighed the advantages of attacking Britain, Poland and Spain, and concluded that Spain in particular, because of the high level of domestic opposition to the Iraq war, was the most vulnerable.
 ''It is necessary to make utmost use of the upcoming general election in Spain in March next year,'' the document stated. ''We think that the Spanish government could not tolerate more than two, maximum three, blows, after which it will have to withdraw as a result of popular pressure. If its troops still remain in Iraq after these blows, then the victory of the Socialist Party is almost secured, and the withdrawal of the Spanish forces will be on its electoral program.'' 
 That prediction, of course, proved murderously prescient. Yet it was only one step in the plan: ''Lastly, we emphasize that a withdrawal of the Spanish or Italian forces from Iraq would put huge pressure on the British presence, a pressure that Tony Blair might not be able to withstand, and hence the domino tiles would fall quickly.'' 
 No matter who took the bombs onto those buses and subways in London, the attacks are clearly of a piece with Al Qaeda's post-9/11 strategy. And while we don't know if the claim of responsibility from a group calling itself the Secret Organization of Al Qaeda in Europe was legitimate, an understanding of Al Qaeda's strategic logic may help explain why that message included a threat of further attacks against Italy and Denmark, both of which contributed troops in Iraq.
 The bottom line, then, is that the terrorists have not been fundamentally weakened but have changed course and achieved significant success. The London attacks will only encourage Osama bin Laden and other Qaeda leaders in the belief that they will succeed in their ultimate aim: causing America and its allies to withdraw forces from the Muslim world.

HEADLINE: China Oil Giants Crave Respectability and Power

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and JAD MOUAWAD; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong for this article and Jad Mouawad from New York.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 8 

 BODY:
Two years ago, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and another Chinese state-controlled oil company seemed on the verge of capturing a large patch of foreign oil reserves with a handshake deal to pay $1.23 billion for part of a field in Kazakhstan.
 But the prospect was snatched away two months later when the Western companies operating the oil field asserted their legal right to buy the stake instead. For the Chinese oil executives, it was a rude defeat that emphasized their marginal status on the global energy map.
Indeed, for all their efforts over the last dozen years, Chinese companies have remarkably little to show for it -- just a string of largely second-rate, remote, dubious or uncertain energy investments for which they have mostly overpaid.
 Cnooc's leaders are determined not to be upstaged again. And with their $18.5 billion bid for the American oil company Unocal last month, Cnooc is wagering significantly more in one stroke than Chinese energy concerns have spent so far globally. 
 Turning from the steppes of Kazakhstan to the freeways of Southern California, Cnooc is endeavoring to help transform China from a marginal player in the energy markets to a powerful force in a better position to tap the world's natural resources. And in doing so, some experts say, it is ready to pay a higher price for energy assets -- a China premium, as some call it -- to raise the chances of closing a deal. 
 Cnooc's surprise offer comes at a time of concern in Washington about Chinese influence over the American economy and amid heightened fears about the nation's energy security. It has prompted suspicion and hostility from many members of Congress. 
 But viewed from China, Cnooc's thrust at Unocal only underlines the extent to which China's top three oil companies -- PetroChina; China Petroleum and Chemical, also known as Sinopec; and Cnooc -- are earnestly seeking to expand their reach. 
 Their eclectic collection spans 44 countries, including pariah states like Sudan and Myanmar -- a grab bag of holdings that would strain the management of even the biggest multinationals.
 ''They're not picking up the best stuff -- they're picking up stuff in the middle and, in some cases, the dregs,'' said Philip Andrews-Speed, the director of the Center for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee in Scotland.
 Total commitments by the three companies have reached only $15 billion over the last decade to build equity stakes in oil and gas fields outside China, according to the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
 The Chinese oil giants are belatedly following a well-trodden path -- one that France, Italy and Britain have taken -- to build national players that can secure access to the globe's energy resources. But the Chinese companies have had the misfortune of trying to build overseas empires at a time of steeply rising prices and renewed nationalism among the governments of oil-producing nations. Their combined overseas reserves remain a tenth of the reserves of a single big Western multinational like BP. 
 Cnooc, with 93 percent of its reserves in China, is the exact opposite in globalization from BP, with 93 percent of its proven reserves outside of Britain. PetroChina, the giant of China's oil industry, will still have 95 percent of its reserves in China even after the consolidation of a wide range of overseas holdings being transferred by its parent, the China National Petroleum Corporation, or C.N.P.C.
 Sinopec, mainly a refiner, has barely begun to acquire overseas assets. But C.N.P.C. and Sinopec have been active in acquiring exploration rights from Mauritania and Angola to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan so overseas reserves could rise sharply in the coming years if the companies strike oil. 
 The PIRA Energy Group, a New York-based oil consultancy, estimates that China's top three companies now control 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil production a day outside of China, or 10 percent of their domestic production. Unocal would add a daily oil production of 170,000 barrels a day and the equivalent of 260,000 barrels a day of natural gas.
 By comparison, crude production outside the United States for the three largest American oil companies amounts to 70 percent of their total output. 
 Still, Chinese oil workers are becoming a growing presence in the Middle East, Africa and South America, and their executives can now be spotted roving through remote outposts in Libya or negotiating long-term agreements in Iran or Saudi Arabia.
 C.N.P.C. has been crucial in developing the oil resources of Sudan, a country that Western oil companies have been forced to leave because of pressure over its poor human-rights record; in Algeria, Sinopec has won exploration and drilling rights to look for new sources of oil; in Venezuela, C.N.P.C. won operating agreements in bidding rounds that included oil giants like BP or Shell. 
 China's future energy appetite is expected to be enormous. The country, a net exporter of crude oil only a dozen years ago, recently surpassed Japan as the world's second-largest oil consumer. Its domestic production amounts to 3.5 million barrels a day, slightly over half the country's daily needs of 6.7 million barrels.
 Last year, oil demand in China grew by 16 percent. In 20 years, China is expected to consume nearly 13 million barrels a day, or 10 percent of what experts hope will be the world's total at the time -- with imports exceeding nine million barrels. And if production fails to expand fast enough, China could put even more pressure on global oil supplies.
 Since the mid-1990's, the Chinese authorities have mandated that their oil companies expand abroad. 
 Many China experts say that the country is so eager for overseas reserves that it will inevitably be willing to pay top dollar. Also, Chinese companies have been more willing to assume that oil prices will stay high. Most Western companies base their planning for oil projects on the idea that they should be profitable when oil is roughly $25 a barrel. 
 ''The Chinese take a long-term perspective to securing strategic resources rather than a short-term investment perspective,'' said Christopher H. Stephens, a senior partner at Coudert Brothers specializing in mergers and acquisitions in China who is not involved in the fight for control of Unocal. ''They don't face those pressures to show investment returns on a quarterly basis.''
 Other experts are more blunt. ''The Chinese are blindly going ahead with what commercial sense would not advise, blindly buying up investments in rogue states,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a strategic studies professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. 
 Fu Chengyu, Cnooc's chief executive, denied that Cnooc had been engaged in a scattershot effort to buy into any oil fields that came on the market. But he also defined the company's strategy in broad terms that did not exclude such an approach.
 Cnooc, the smallest of the three Chinese oil companies, is not the only one with global ambitions. Wang Guoliang, the chief financial officer of PetroChina, the publicly traded subsidiary of C.N.P.C., signaled his company's ambitions at a news conference on June 10. He said it ''will eventually grow from a mainly domestic oil and gas company to an international corporation with significant international oil and gas assets.''
 PetroKazakhstan, a Canadian company with substantial oil fields in Kazakhstan, one of China's western neighbors, announced last week that it had received ''approaches from a number of different parties regarding a potential corporate transaction involving either an acquisition or a merger with the company.'' Investment bankers said that PetroChina had been especially interested in PetroKazakhstan.
 Whether Cnooc's bid for Unocal includes a geopolitical premium of some sort is particularly hard to pin down because the company owns a mixture of oil and gas assets covered by a range of contracts requiring deliveries at various prices for years to come. Based on Cnooc's experience in Kazakhstan and Angola, Unocal may present some additional benefits to Cnooc, energy experts said.
 By buying a company outright, rather than stakes in existing oil fields, Cnooc avoids the risk of another government or company exercising the sort of pre-emption right on stakes that Cnooc and Sinopec lost out to in Kazakhstan two years ago. 
 With their willingness to make optimistic assumptions about oil prices and their ability to borrow heavily from the government, Chinese companies are likely to keep on making acquisitions regardless of what happens with Unocal.
 ''We evaluate things now on $24 oil,'' complained William Gammell, the chief executive of Cairn Energy of Scotland, ''but you can't make transactions on that any more.''

HEADLINE: Eminent Disdain

BYLINE: By Paul Bass and Douglas W. Rae. 
Paul Bass and Douglas W. Rae are working on a book about the 1969 murder of a Black Panther in New Haven.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
WITH all the debate over who will replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, one of the most shocking Supreme Court decisions in recent history has disappeared from the headlines. And that's a shame because it's a ruling that has huge implications for urban communities. 
 In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court last month cleared the way for the City of New London, Conn., to proceed with a plan to replace a faded residential waterfront neighborhood with office space, a hotel, a conference center and luxury apartments. Now the holdout owners of 11 residential properties will have to join the dozens of owners of houses and stores in the 90-acre neighborhood who have already fled. Two cafes, a deli, an auto body shop, a lobster business and a church have been closed. 
 In his dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas called the decision ''far-reaching and dangerous.'' He pointed to a number of studies showing that urban renewal, or ''slum clearance'' as he called it, disproportionately affected lower-income minority residents. 
 For those of us living in New Haven, it was clear that Justice Thomas understood what happened to places like this city's Spruce Street.
 In 1959, through the use of eminent domain and a desire to foster economic development, the City of New Haven demolished the one-block-long Spruce Street, which was less than 500 yards from the town green and Yale's campus. With it vanished 23 houses and stores owned by Asians, blacks and first-generation immigrants from Italy, Russia, Ireland, Poland and Greece. There was the A.&P. grocery store, the Joseph Horowitz junkyard, Afinitto's meat market, two nightclubs, Jacob Gutkin's tailor shop, Dorothy Cohen's Hebrew tutoring business and Bill Jones's trucking operation, not to mention Charley Brewster's brothel and an after-hours juke joint where visiting musicians like Duke Ellington once played.
 All these, along with row houses, apartments and single-family houses, disappeared. The plaza of stores that replaced it has since been torn down; a Walgreens now stands in its place. 
 Spruce Street was but one of the victims of the 1950's and 60's in New Haven, when an idealistic City Hall spent more federal government and foundation dollars per capita than any other in America to address poverty. (New Haven received $745.38 per citizen from the federal urban renewal program; the next closest city, Newark, received $277.33.) Through eminent domain, the city seized blocks of tenements -- or in some cases, as in today's New London, stately if sometimes neglected houses -- replacing them with sterile middle-class housing, upscale retail stores and an eyesore of a coliseum.
 Those displaced were shuttled to remote housing projects like Brookside and Quinnipiac Terrace on the western and eastern outskirts of New Haven. With them went the street life of much of the city. In 1970, as urban renewal ended, the census ranked New Haven the 38th-poorest city in America. Ten years later, it was ranked seventh, with 23.2 percent of its population living below the poverty line. Today, more than a quarter of the city's families live in subsidized housing. So much for combating poverty.
 The urban renewal experiment wasn't a complete failure. Neighborhood health clinics and Head Start programs born in that era continue to thrive. Refugees of the ''old neighborhood'' tend to romanticize the long-gone slums; they neglect to mention that rats were common or that families that could afford to leave did. And New Haven's poverty was at least equally due to larger forces like capital flight and the growth of suburbs fueled by the development of Interstate highways.
 But the fact remains that all that money and bulldozing didn't seem to help New Haven. And it certainly didn't help the poor and blue-collar families removed from their communities and sent to housing projects. 
 The New Haven experiment operated on a fallacy that is being repeated today in New London, and that was enshrined in the majority decision signed by the Supreme Court: that government should be able to take away people's modest houses or grocery stores not just to construct a clearly needed road or hospital, but also to build housing or stores for wealthy people in the name of reducing poverty. That's not just morally abhorrent, as New Haven's experience shows, it's bad policy. 
 New Haven has enjoyed a modest revival in recent years. A community-policing effort and a decision by Yale, the city's largest employer and landowner, to become active in the city's development have helped. But it's taken almost 50 years to get here -- 50 years of undoing past mistakes by rehabilitating historic buildings, redesigning housing projects and planning to replace the coliseum with shops and a theater. 
 Sadly, New London is about to repeat New Haven's mistakes, and the Supreme Court has no problem with that. Let's hope it doesn't take New London 50 years to see some improvement.

HEADLINE: Education Secretary Backs End to Student-Loan Loophole

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The secretary of education, Margaret Spellings, joined the chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, yesterday in asking Congress to close a loophole that lets lenders claim a 9.5 percent government subsidy on certain student loans. 
 Ms. Spellings called for an end to the practice, which is known as recycling. It allows lenders to use the income from loans that receive the 9.5 percent subsidy to make new loans that then receive the subsidy, too. 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been a leading critic of the subsidies, hailed the announcement as a major step forward. 
 ''I have battled to close this corporate loophole for more than two years, and this is the first time we can say with real hope that its days are numbered,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a statement. ''College aid is for students, not banks.'' 
 When the subsidy was first created in 1980, high interest rates made access to loans difficult for student borrowers. 
 Now, though, with low interest rates, the 9.5 percent subsidy represents a windfall of hundreds of million of dollars to lenders annually. 
 There have been sporadic efforts to end the subsidies. Congress tried to phase out the guarantee in 1993, but the loans ballooned as lenders made use of another loophole that allowed them to refinance loans issued before 1993 at the 9.5 percent rate.
 Last year, Congress passed the Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act, hoping to curb the growth of loans that receive the 9.5 percent rate by ending the subsidy on new loans that stemmed from new refinancing of pre-1993 obligations. But that law did not affect recycling of the proceeds from the pre-1993 obligations. 
 And it did little to curb the problem: according to data released last week, lenders received $238 million in 9.5 percent loan subsidies in the first three months of this year. 
 Last fall, Congressional Democrats accused the Education Department of being lax in preventing loan companies from exploiting the loophole, in part because of the Bush administration's political connections with lenders. 
 At the time, the department said that it was following policies set by the Clinton administration and that it lacked the authority to close the loophole. 
 A report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigating arm of Congress, said the department could stop the program at any time. 
 Yesterday, Susan Aspey, a spokeswoman for the department, said that because there was clear statutory authority for recycling, the policy could be ended only through legislation.

HEADLINE: 8 Leaders Hail Steps on Africa And Warming

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: AUCHTERARDER, Scotland, July 8 

 BODY:
Striking tones of optimism and defiance a day after the attacks in London, President Bush and the leaders of seven other big industrial nations concluded a summit meeting here on Friday saying they had made substantial progress in addressing African poverty, global warming and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 Wrapping up the gathering before rushing back to London, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said the ability of the governments represented here to agree on steps to help some of the world's neediest people, protect the environment and sow peace was the most effective rebuttal to violence and extremism.
 ''We speak today in the shadow of terrorism,'' said Mr. Blair, who had returned here from London on Thursday evening and presided over the final sessions on Friday. ''But it will not obscure what we came here to achieve.'' 
 Despite the public show of unity on the Group of 8's agenda, Mr. Bush remained at odds with other leaders over many of the details of how best to address the issues being debated and gave little ground on them.
 Mr. Blair hailed a series of agreements to alleviate poverty in Africa, his signature issue, including commitments by the eight nations to double their aid to $50 billion a year by 2010, reduce trade barriers, cancel the debts of many countries and do more to fight diseases, including AIDS and malaria. The American aid pledge represents no new money beyond that which had already been promised.
 In an unusual step, Mr. Blair had all the leaders sign their joint statements on Africa in public to press them to keep their pledges.
 ''It isn't the end of poverty in Africa,'' Mr. Blair said after the leaders met with their counterparts from seven African countries. ''But it is the hope that it can be ended. It isn't all everyone wanted, but it is progress, real and achievable progress.''
 He said the industrial nations had signed off on a plan to begin addressing global warming by opening talks this year with a group of developing countries, in the hopes of slowing and eventually reversing the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
 But Mr. Blair acknowledged that deep differences between the United States and the other nations over the issue limited the scope of the agreement, saying it amounted to ''the possibility of re-establishing a consensus.''
 Mr. Bush blocked efforts by Mr. Blair to agree on specific targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
 But he did agree to language in the final communique on climate change that, while hedged, acknowledges that the burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming, a position that his administration has at times avoided endorsing.
 Mr. Bush also signed off on the pledge by the eight nations to double aid to Africa in the next five years.
 But his point man for the summit meeting, Faryar Shirzad, a deputy national security adviser, said later that the aid commitment involved no new money from the United States. Instead, it only adds up increases agreed to previously. Mr. Bush's opposition also helped doom calls for the rich nations to commit themselves to providing a defined proportion of their national incomes for aid to Africa, a step that would have required much larger contributions from the United States. 
 Mr. Bush left the summit meeting without making any public comment on the outcome. Mr. Shirzad, talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Mr. Bush headed home, called the meeting ''a huge success.''
 But after a long campaign of advertising and lobbying, as well as the Live 8 concerts last Saturday, to press for action on the environment and Africa, members of interest groups assembled here to push their causes said the results were mixed.
 ''The world's richest nations have delivered welcome progress for the world's poorest people, but the outcome here in Gleneagles has fallen short of the hopes of the millions around the world campaigning for a momentous breakthrough,'' Jo Leadbeater, who is in charge of policy for Oxfam International, a group that advocates more aggressive action to fight poverty, said in a statement.
 Bob Geldof, the former rock star who helped lead the campaign for debt relief and more aid, said the agreements on aid and trade were a big step forward but still had to be carried out. ''Time only will tell if this has been historic or not,'' he said.
 Tony Juniper, vice chairman of Friends of the Earth International, an environmental group, said the plan on addressing greenhouse gas emissions lacked the concrete commitments necessary to make a difference, largely because of Mr. Bush's opposition. Mr. Bush has long advocated investing in technology that can help industries reduce emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels but has opposed mandatory limits on emissions, saying that to do so could harm the economy. 
 ''To cut a long story short, we don't see anything new in the communique that's going to make action on global warming happen any more decisively or any more quickly,'' Mr. Juniper said.
 The leaders discussed a wide variety of foreign policy issues, including Iraq and the Middle East. Mr. Blair announced that the eight nations would try to raise as much as $3 billion a year in aid for the Palestinian Authority over the next three years, a step intended to help the Palestinians after Israel withdraws, beginning in August, from Gaza and sections of the West Bank. The Bush administration said last month that it would work with James D. Wolfensohn, a former president of the World Bank, to assemble the aid package by seeking contributions from other countries around the world, including Arab nations.
 For all the focus on the formal agenda of the summit meeting, behind the scenes much of the talk still concerned the attacks in London on Thursday. In his public comments, Mr. Blair said that terrorism was best countered by providing a hopeful alternative.
 ''It is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness, to overwhelm the dignity of democracy and proper process with the impact of bloodshed and of terror,'' Mr. Blair said. ''There is no hope in terrorism nor any future in it worth living. And it is hope that is the alternative to this hatred. So we offer today this contrast with the politics of terror.''

HEADLINE: When Fear Stalks, Tune Out

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Tony Blair was as eloquent as ever when he faced the press at the G-8 summit meeting yesterday, but what was most impressive was what he didn't say. After uttering three sentences of gratitude to the other leaders for their support after the London attacks, he dropped the subject of terror. 
 Instead of giving murderers publicity on worldwide television, he talked about poverty in Africa and global warming. When a reporter tried to distract him by asking what ''went wrong'' in London, he said it was the terrorists' fault and went right back to the business of the G-8. 
 The prime minister was a blessed relief after the talking heads in America the past two days. As politicians vowed to win the war on terror and get more money for their districts in the process, security officials sent SWAT teams to protect commuters and divined that the terrorist threat was now orange instead of yellow (whatever that means). 
 Television and print editors rushed to assign what is known in the business as the ''Fear Stalks'' story, as in, ''We need a 'Fear Stalks Suburban Bus Riders.''' The commuters' alarm was shared by local experts. South Dakota's homeland security officials were reported to be ''monitoring the situation closely.''
 I don't mean to minimize the bloodshed in London. I lived in New York in 2001 and later in Baghdad during months of car bombings. But I got the most useful lessons about terrorism when I moved to suburban Maryland just in time for the snipers to begin their famous spree near my home in 2002.
 I could have written a ''Fear Stalks'' story about myself as I walked home from the subway the evening after the spree began. I was more tense than I had ever been in New York or Baghdad. 
 The assurances that the police were on the case meant nothing because there was obviously no way to stop one guy with a rifle from shooting me that evening. 
 That's the same situation we're in after the London attacks: it's clear that no one can stop terrorists from killing. Spending billions on airport security has simply diverted them to transit systems, and spending billions on transit systems could at best divert them somewhere else: stores, restaurants, sidewalks. Terrorists don't even need bombs. They could simply adopt the snipers' technique for spreading fear.
 President Bush briefly admitted last summer to Matt Lauer that the war on terror couldn't ever be won, but he got so much criticism that he promptly backtracked. It was a textbook Washington gaffe: perfectly true but terribly inconvenient.
 It was inconvenient because politicians like to promise a cure for any problem in the news, especially if the cure means dispensing money to constituents and campaign contributors.
 Promises to halt terror have turned homeland security spending into the biggest porkfest in Washington, and the London attacks have inspired calls for still more spending.
 Washington obviously has a role in hunting terrorists and protecting the borders, but it can't stop small-scale attacks like the ones in London, no matter how much money it gives to each Congressional district. 
 If subway riders like me in Washington and New York want to pay for better security in the hope that terrorists will attack someone else instead, we should pay for it ourselves.
 But I think that we'd be better off reconsidering our definition of victory in the war on terror. Calling it a war makes it sound like a national fight against a mighty enemy threatening our society.
 But right now the terrorists look more like a small group of loosely organized killers who are less like an army than like lightning bolts -- scary but rarely fatal. Except that the risk of being struck by lightning is much higher than the risk of being killed by a terrorist.
 It may seem coldblooded to think in probabilities after a tragedy, but contemplating those odds made my walks home a lot easier during the snipers' spree. The other strategy that helped was turning off the television whenever the police and the politicians held press conferences detailing everything they were doing to protect the public.
 Occasionally one of those officials urged people to keep their perspective and go on with life, but there was no one quite like Tony Blair. Instead of promising security at home, he discussed problems overseas that he could do something about. Instead of talking about the need for Britons to move on, he moved on.

HEADLINE: Tony Blair's Summit Meeting

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair called the outcome of the summit meeting in Scotland an ''alternative to the hatred" manifested by the terrorist bombings in London -- an apt description. The leaders of eight of the world's richest countries agreed on a package of measures to help the world's poorest, including, prominently, a doubling of their aid to Africa, to $50 billion a year by 2010 from $25 billion, the current level. 
 The sizable increase in aid to depressed countries, including the African pledge, was the most important and heartening achievement of a meeting whose successes owed much to the generous, disciplined agenda set by Mr. Blair, the conference chairman, and his willingness to see it through to the end despite the distraction of the awful events in London. Yet the meeting fell short of Mr. Blair's expectations -- indeed, of the world's expectations -- in important ways. Sad to say, the foot-dragging of the United States, particularly on the issue of global warming but also on aid, was largely responsible for most of these shortcomings. 
 In addition to doubling the dollars committed to Africa, the conference members agreed to cancel the debts of many countries, to do more to fight diseases like AIDS and malaria, and, in terms that were regrettably vague, to reduce trade barriers. They also pledged as much as $3 billion a year to help the Palestinians after Israel withdraws later this summer from Gaza and parts of the West Bank -- a gesture that could be enormously important as long as the United States and others make sure that both sides honor their commitments.
 The conference fell well short, however, of ending the agricultural subsidies that help keep farmers in developing nations in poverty. And Mr. Blair was not successful in his broader effort to persuade the United States to set a timetable for increasing its overall foreign aid to a level equal to 0.7 percent of national income by 2015. That step would require a much larger contribution by the United States, which currently provides 0.16 percent, the smallest percentage of any of the Group of 8 countries. Europe agreed to a timetable, but Mr. Bush would not.
 The summit meeting's biggest disappointment involved global warming, an issue that Mr. Blair had elevated above all others except foreign aid. In what will stand as a testament to America's influence but not, unfortunately, to its intelligence or courage, the White House succeeded in turning what might have been a powerful commitment by the industrialized nations to confront global warming into diplomatic mush. 
 The communique acknowledges that climate change is a serious ''long term'' challenge, though ''immediate'' challenge would have been more to the point. The 1998 G-8 communique, by contrast, described climate change as ''the greatest environmental threat to our future prosperity.'' 
 The new communique further commits all eight nations to work together and in partnership with major developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It does not dispute -- as Mr. Bush's administration has done so often -- the mainstream scientific view that warming is occurring and that humans and human industrial activity are largely responsible. And perhaps most important, it promises to stabilize greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at levels that will prevent environmental catastrophe.
 But these goals are vaguely stated, and, worse, there is nothing approaching a road map for achieving them. Mr. Blair had hoped for much more: mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions, like those already in effect in Europe; a trading system to mitigate compliance costs; concrete financial commitments to new technologies; specific targets for energy efficiency. But the White House would have none of it, clinging instead to Mr. Bush's approach of asking industry for voluntary reductions. 
 The net result is that little has changed on the warming issue. The rest of the industrialized nations are moving forward, honoring, however imperfectly, their commitments to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and its goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2012. America's state governments and its mayors are devising emission-reduction plans of their own. Even the United States Senate has committed itself, on paper, to a program of mandatory reductions, with hearings to begin later this month.
 And Mr. Bush? Isolated, a wallflower at the dance, and apparently content to be one.

MTV's 10-Hour Apology
 Stung by criticism of its interrupted coverage of last week's Live 8 concerts, MTV Networks has announced plans to offer 10 consecutive hours of commercial-free performance coverage today. VH1 will broadcast highlights from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and MTV will show highlights from 3 to 8 p.m. ''At MTV and VH1, we're in a constant and candid dialogue with our audience, and in the wake of the live events last Saturday, our viewers have resoundingly told us online they want to see full-set performances from their favorite artists,'' said Van Toffler, the president of MTV Networks Group, who called the concerts ''one of the most important music events of our time.'' Both MTV and VH1 will present performances by U2 (the group's lead singer, Bono, above), Pink Floyd, Orchestra Baobab, Coldplay and Paul McCartney. MTV will provide performances by Linkin Park, Jay-Z, the Killers, Kanye West and Green Day. VH1 will have Rob Thomas, the Dave Matthews Band, Sting and Maroon 5. Among others to be seen are Destiny's Child, Madonna, R.E.M., Snoop Dogg, Audioslave, Mariah Carey and the Who.

War of the Movies
 Michael Moore, below, is stirring political passions again. His Traverse City Film Festival, organized with residents of that Michigan town, has stirred right-wing opposition. Genie Aldrich, who lives in nearby Suttons Bay, has founded the Traverse Bay Freedom Film Festival in collaboration with a conservative group from Texas, The Associated Press reported. ''People are fed up and tired with the extreme left-wing radical fringe -- America haters, family haters, Christian haters,'' she said, after failing last month to persuade the city commission to deny Mr. Moore and his group permission to show films in a municipal park. Mr. Moore, a native of Flint, Mich., whose films include the documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' said: ''I like it when Republicans take ideas of mine. I have a few more where those came from, if they'd like to sit down and talk.'' The Freedom Festival, on July 29 and 30, will overlap Mr. Moore's festival, from July 27 through 31. Ms. Aldrich said hers would feature a dozen films, including ''Top Gun'' and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' as well as independent, politically oriented productions, like ''In the Face of Evil,'' a tribute to Ronald Reagan; ''Confronting Iraq,'' a defense of the war sponsored by the conservative group Accuracy in Media; and ''Michael Moore Hates America.'' Mr. Moore and other organizers say their 31-film program, with classics like ''Jaws'' and ''Casablanca'' and none of Mr. Moore's films, is nonpartisan. 

Amazon's Cash Cows
 Sorry, Shakespeare. When it comes to best-selling authors at Amazon.com, you're not just second to J.K. Rowling, below; you're 26th, right behind Tom Clancy. So says the online bookstore, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary on Thursday and issued a list of its most popular writers, The Associated Press reported. After Ms. Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, came Spencer Johnson (''Who Moved My Cheese?''); the romance novelist Nora Roberts; and Dan Brown, who wrote ''The Da Vinci Code.'' The rest of the Top 10: Dr. Seuss, John Grisham, Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, the ''Left Behind'' novelists Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, and the business writer Jim Collins.

Leo's Land
 Leonardo DiCaprio has bought a 104-acre island in the Caribbean off the coast of Belize and plans to turn it into an environmentally friendly resort, Agence France-Presse reported. An avid conservationist, Mr. DiCaprio, 30, whose films include ''The Aviator'' and ''Catch Me if You Can,'' paid about $1.75 million for Blackadore Caye, about 2.2 miles long, 210 to 630 feet wide and a 25-minute boat ride from the Belize Barrier Reef, a World Heritage Site.

Footnotes
 The run of the York Theater Company production of the Stephen Dolginoff musical ''Thrill Me: The Leopold & Loeb Story'' has been extended a second time. It will now play through the summer at the company's home at the Theater at St. Peter's, Citigroup Center, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Another block of tickets, through Dec. 31, has gone on sale for ''The Musical of Musicals -- The Musical,'' which opened in February at Dodger Stages.

HEADLINE: More Class, at Last, for the M-Class

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
PROGRESS is great, except when you are the one it leaves behind, a predicament that stings all the more when you are a company, like Mercedes-Benz, with a reputation for innovation.
 Mercedes's first high-volume S.U.V., the M-Class, was certainly an innovator when it arrived eight years ago as a 1998 model. It was among the first luxury utility vehicles, and the first from a German company; the first product of a new plant in Alabama; and the first utility with a carlike independent suspension at both the front and the rear.
But by 2005, the M-Class had been overshadowed by a pack of sport wagons that were sleeker, plusher and more up-to-date. 
 Sales faded, to 39,680 in 2003 from 52,764 in 2000, which was the model's strongest year. They dropped again last year to 25,681 as the company prepared a redesigned model.
 That new M-Class went on sale in the spring as a 2006 model, reflecting changes intended to address what Mercedes said were the biggest complaints of owners: ride, handling and cup holders. The interior, too, has been significantly upgraded from the cheap-looking plastic that marred the original.
 The first M-Class combined trucklike construction -- a body on a ladder-type frame -- with that sophisticated suspension. But later competitors, including the Lexus RX300, took things a step further, retaining the independent suspension but using a one-piece unibody that further improved ride and handling. The new M-Class makes this leap, too, with a rigid unibody nearly 6 inches longer and 3 inches wider; the wheelbase was stretched almost 4 inches. 
 The old M-Class, with its upright design and unsexy tailgate, looked like a minivan from some angles. Thankfully, the new design is sleeker and a bit aggressive, with a wedge shape more in tune with the styling of Mercedes-Benz sedans and coupes.
 I tested the six-cylinder ML350, and also drove the ML500 with a V-8 engine. In each case, the unibody construction made the M-Class feel wonderfully solid, with none of the quivers and shakes that often afflict body-on-frame trucks. With the redesigned independent suspensions, handling is agile for a vehicle so large and heavy. While the body leans if you force it hard into a turn, the motions remain well controlled, giving the driver a sense of calm and confidence.
 The steering had a pleasing, consistent weight, though enthusiasts might complain that it lacks ''feel'' -- a quality difficult to define, but something that sporting drivers miss in its absence.
 The ride is comforting, though on rough roads passengers still feel the bumps. While the brakes performed well, the pedal wasn't as crisply responsive as I'd have liked.
 While the new M-Class plays catch-up in a crowded field, its seven-speed transmission sets a benchmark. Even with the V-6 engine it is almost like having a continuously variable transmission; one gear moves seamlessly to the next.
 The new V-6, which displaces 3.5 liters and is rated at 268 horsepower, pulls strongly. All 258 pound-feet of torque is available from just 2,400 r.p.m. up to 5,000 r.p.m. 
 Pick the ML500 instead of the ML350 and you get a 5-liter V-8 that has gained 14 horsepower since last year, to 302, with 339 pound-feet of torque. Acceleration is stronger, as you'd expect, but highway fuel economy is nearly as good as that of the V-6: 20 m.p.g. for the ML350 and 19 for the ML500. Indeed, the additional sixth and seventh gears improved highway mileage by 10 pecent, Mercedes says.
 Prices, while steep, are on par with the competition. The ML350 starts around $40,000; my test model nudged $49,000 with self-indulgent options like a DVD navigation system, satellite radio, DVD player, sunroof and upgraded interior trim. The ML500 starts at $49,275.
 The interior is strikingly different from before. Instead of a flat, straight dash in mediocre plastic, there is a modern design with round vents and nicer materials.
 Mercedes went to great lengths to atone for its cup holder sins, moving the shifter off the console to make room for two adjustable holders. (One can handle a 44-ounce Big Gulp!) The shifter is now a small stalk protruding from the steering column. To shift manually with the TouchShift function, you press buttons on the back of the wheel.
 The more stylish sloping roof has stolen some cargo room. With the second row of seats up, there is 3.3 cubic feet less space; with the seats down, the deficit is 8.8 cubic feet.
 The second row is missing some nice features. The seatbacks don't recline, and they don't slide forward and back as the ones in the Lexus RX do. But the rear seat, a split bench, is now much easier to fold down. 
 The new M-Class carries only five people. If you want a third row, Mercedes will offer it in the new R-Class, a more conventional wagon.
 As always, Mercedes includes lots of safety features. Tire pressure monitors are new, and the side curtain bags have rollover sensors.
 The M-Class still has a full-time all-wheel-drive system that can transfer power to just one wheel, if only one has grip. A new feature lets the vehicle crawl down steep grades without driver interference, and an off-road mode lets the wheels spin a bit to gain traction in mud, gravel or slush. An air suspension is optional.
 While the vehicle doesn't have low-range gearing now, it will be included in an off-road package later.
 Most M-Class buyers won't care about that. They will appreciate the fact that this Mercedes provides the kind of carlike ride and handling Americans now demand in luxury S.U.V.'s, along with more style and the latest safety features. 
 The new M-Class is not so indisputably fabulous that it destroys the competition, and past quality problems may be a cause for concern. Still, the redesign brings the M-Class up to date and makes it much more competitive in a very crowded field.

HEADLINE: On the Boardwalk, Strutting Once More

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THERE was a time, back in the first half of the 20th century, when being crowned the prettiest girl in Coney Island really meant something. Coney Island in those days was a domain that included Steeplechase Park, the famous parachute jump, and one of New York's most famous beaches. And the title was hard to win, open only to the most elegant of bathing beauties, as judged in places like Childs Restaurant.
 Then, in the decades after midcentury, came crime, blight and a slow economy, and a beach known more for faded glory than seaside glamour. But now, amid a surge of optimism about the neighborhood's future, the Coney Island Chamber of Commerce is poised to hold the first known bathing beauty contest there in 50 years. Starting this afternoon, the sovereign of sand and surf will reign again. 
Times have changed, said Al O'Hagan, the chamber's executive director. The contest, in which about 20 women 18 to 24 years old are scheduled to compete for a $2,500 prize and the title ''Queen of Coney Island,'' requires more than just a pretty face; contestants, who will compete in casual wear and bathing suits, must also do well in interviews, answering questions that reflect the organizers' high hopes for the area.
 ''It's going to be questions basically directed at Coney Island and the rebirth of Coney Island, and what was their fondest wish in Coney Island growing up, and what they think of the new Coney Island and the way it's coming along now,'' Mr. O'Hagan said. 
 For the early bathing beauties, the area's grandeur was not in question, and crowns were available for every woman from infancy on up. ''They used to have the grandmother contest, they had Miss Coney Island, they had a lot of them,'' said Charles Denson, author of ''Coney Island Lost and Found'' and director of the Coney Island Voices oral history project, which is collecting an archive of New Yorkers' stories about the area. ''The flapper era was really big for beauty contests.'' 
 One popular contest was the Modern Venus, held by the outdoor pool at the Steeplechase. In 1931, that title went to a 20-year-old model named Dorothy DeMar of Hollis, Queens, who edged out Justine Rogers of Bogota, N.J., Audrey Johnson of Brooklyn and 121 other young women who lined the natatorium that day. 
 According to a newspaper called The Brooklyn Standard Union, the winner had bobbed hair, and ''her chic white bathing suit with black trimmings accentuated her sylph-like form.'' For her victory, she was presented with a sash and a silver loving cup.
 Milton Berle was the host of one of the Coney Island pageants, Mr. Denson said, and spectators could expect surprises. ''Sometimes they'd do something unusual like have an elephant show up.''
 For all their spectacle, the contests were a wholesome affair. ''They wore very proper bathing suits then,'' Mr. Denson said. ''They weren't showing a lot of skin.'' 
 Mr. O'Hagan, who was a youth in Brooklyn when the competitions faded away, noted that swimwear had come a long way since the turn of the 20th century. ''Early on, they were all down to the knees, down to the ankles,'' he said. ''They used to do the old-fashioned bathing suits, right up to the necks, with the bathing cap.''
 After a while, though, the contests began to decline as attractions like Steeplechase Park and Luna Park closed, and people began to avoid the area. ''Maybe for a few years nobody wanted to be known as the Queen of Coney Island,'' Mr. Denson said.
 But maybe no longer. Today's event, at 2 p.m. on Stillwell Avenue by the Boardwalk, will feature an all-female band called the Screaming Orphans, music from the radio D.J. Vic Latino, and corporate sponsorship, by Coca-Cola. Buoyed by all the other encouraging signs in Coney Island, like the planned pavilion next to the parachute jump, Mr. O'Hagan hopes the revived beauty pageant will follow the fortunes of the Nathan's hot dog eating contest.
 ''I remember when they first started that, it was a half-dozen people standing around watching them eat hot dogs,'' Mr. O'Hagan said. ''Now it's a big event.''

HEADLINE: On-Time Budget Heads List of Actions Taken in Legislature's 228th Session 

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 9 

 BODY:
The 228th annual session of the New York State Legislature closed in an unusually orderly fashion here on June 24, just a day later than it was scheduled to, after lawmakers who had been stung by criticism of Albany's ways took steps to try to shore up public confidence in state government. 
 It was in many respects an atypical session. The three men who control state government -- Gov. George E. Pataki; the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno; and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver -- made a show of trying to negotiate the budget in public, for a change. They passed the budget on time -- more or less -- for the first time in 21 years. And they also worked together to shine more light on actions taken by public officials and lobbyists.
 
 The moves came after the growing outcry about state government cost a few incumbent lawmakers their seats in November and gave scares to a few more. The three men who control the state -- who have been in power together for more than a decade-- all proclaimed themselves reformers and vowed to change the system. 
 The two houses of the Legislature changed some of their internal rules -- and ended the practice of allowing lawmakers' votes to be counted even when they were absent -- but most power still remained with the leaders. The Legislature and the governor agreed to require lobbyists seeking state contracts to disclose their fees and clients, closed a loophole that allowed state workers to evade ethics fines by quitting their jobs, and moved to increase oversight of the state's many public authorities, which have been breeding grounds for several scandals.
 But they did little to overhaul the state's lax campaign finance rules, and did nothing to end the gerrymandering that makes competitive elections rare. 
 Other problems were ignored as well. Instead of grappling with an order by the state's highest court requiring the state to spend more money to fix New York City's public schools, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver agreed to postpone action while the governor appeals the ruling.
 But it was a year of big issues and big fights. The Democratic-led Assembly effectively killed New York's death penalty law when a committee decided not to fix a provision of the law that had been ruled unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals. 
 In the months after the budget passed, much of the debate in Albany swirled around the proposal to build a new stadium for the Jets on the West Side of Manhattan, a project championed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. After a bruising fight, and a $42 million lobbying effort, the project was defeated in Albany on June 6 when Mr. Silver, a Democrat, and Mr. Bruno, a Republican, refused to approve the $2.2 billion project. 
 The state's efforts to pave the way for Las Vegas-style casino gambling in the Catskills went nowhere again, amid debates over how many casinos should be allowed to open, and which Indian tribes should be allowed to run them.
 As the session wound down, lawmakers moved at a frenzied pace. They came up with a package of economic incentives to aid in the recovery of Lower Manhattan, agreed on a plan to allow people to buy wine over the Internet and tweaked the so-called Rockefeller drug laws by giving about 500 more inmates the chance to seek early release.
 And, in a surprise move, the Republican-led Senate passed a bill in the session's final days that would allow pharmacists and nurses to dispense the so-called morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy after sex, to women who do not have prescriptions. The measure now heads to the desk of Governor Pataki, who is weighing his political future and has been studiously noncommittal about the bill.

Budget
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Embarrassed by criticism for missing the April 1 budget deadline 20 years in a row, all sides in Albany agreed to move to pass the budget on time. 
 The landscape changed even before the year began, when the Court of Appeals strengthened the hand of the governor in writing budgets by sharply limiting the Legislature's ability to amend his proposals. That gave the Legislature a renewed impetus to change the budget system, and this year they voted to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot this November that would shift some power back to them. 
 In this year's budget fight, the governor put forward a $105.5 billion spending plan on Jan. 18 that called for cutting Medicaid spending by $1.1 billion to help close a projected $4.15 billion deficit.
 Then things began to change. After years in which Governor Pataki, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver debated the budget behind closed doors -- a practice known here as ''three men in a room'' -- the governor called a series of public budget meetings, and invited the largely powerless minority party leaders in the Legislature to participate too.
 The meetings produced few substantive talks, but they kept up pressure for an on-time budget. Then the Legislature held its own public budget conference committee meetings, and agreed to add hundreds of millions of dollars of spending to the governor's proposal. And before April 1, it began passing the budget over the governor's objections. 
 Then came a showdown. The governor threatened to veto large swaths of their budget, but did not want to be seen as undoing the first on-time budget in 21 years. So they all held talks back behind closed doors, and the three men hammered out a deal. Twelve days after the Legislature passed its budget, it passed a revised $106.6 billion budget that put back a few more cuts the governor had sought. 
 It included about half of the $1.1 billion in cuts to Medicaid expenses that Mr. Pataki sought. It set up a preferred-drug list, making Medicaid more like many private heath insurance plans, that aides to Mr. Pataki said would save New York $60 million this year and up to $200 million next year. It increased a tax on nursing homes. It cut some benefits in Family Health Plus, a program that provides health coverage for the working poor. And it called for phasing in a cap on the growth of local Medicaid costs, and established a commission to consider closing some hospitals in the future. 
 The budget called for reducing a personal income tax surcharge on schedule, and rolled back a statewide sales tax surcharge of a quarter of a percentage point. But it extended the state sales tax on clothing under $110 that had been set to expire, and added an eighth of a percentage point sales tax surcharge in New York City and the surrounding counties to pay for mass transit. It also raised vehicle fees sharply. 
 The budget authorized a $2.9 billion transportation bond act that is set to go before the voters in November. And it added $848 million more in education spending, but, despite the court order requiring more money to fix New York City's schools, directed most of that additional money going to districts outside New York City. 

Crime, Justice and Security
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Toughens New York's drunken driving laws to eliminate a loophole that has allowed some drunken drivers who have killed or injured people in crashes to avoid long prison terms. The law changes the state's vehicular manslaughter and vehicular assault laws to eliminate the need to prove secondary factors, such as speeding or running a red light.

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would ban Medicaid and other publicly financed programs from paying for the costs of erectile dysfunction drugs for convicted sex offenders.
 Would impose harsher penalties on people who manufacture methamphetamine, the illegal drug commonly known as ''meth.''
 Would slightly soften the so-called Rockefeller drug laws, which impose lengthy mandatory prison sentences on nonviolent drug offenders, by allowing another group of inmates to petition the courts for early release. The bill passed this year would affect 513 inmates serving sentences for class A-2 felonies. Last year the governor signed a bill allowing inmates serving sentences for A-1 felonies to apply for early release. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have re-enacted the state's death penalty law by rewriting a provision that was ruled unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals in 2004. While the governor and the Republican-led Senate called for reinstating the death penalty, the Democratic-led Assembly held a series of hearings on the topic and voted against it in committee.
 Would have overhauled a law designed to let people in a community know about convicted sex offenders living there. The statute, which went into effect in 1996, called the Sex Offender Registration Act, but more commonly known as ''Megan's Law,'' would have been strengthened to include things like mandatory notification by police when a registered sex offender moves into a community; lifetime registration of all sex offenders; posting of information on all sex offenders on the Internet; using Global Positioning System technology to monitor the worst offenders.
 Would have repealed the authority to grant conditional release to inmates serving prison sentences in local jails, a little-known power that gained notoriety when it was used to free former State Senator Guy J. Velella of the Bronx. The Senate voted to end such conditional release; the Assembly did not.
 Would have overhauled the Rockefeller-era drug laws by doing away with mandatory minimum sentences and giving judges greater discretion in sending some convicts to treatment programs instead of prison. 

Food and Drink
AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would allow consumers to order wine on the Internet, from vineyards both in and out of New York, but would limit each person to buying no more than 36 cases per year from each winery.
 Would provide for the development of a brewery-trails program to encourage the state's beer industry, including with an ''I Love NY Beer'' campaign.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have outlawed, beginning in 2016, the force-feeding of waterfowl to engorge their livers to produce foie gras.

Economic Development
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Extends and expands one of the state's biggest economic development programs, the Empire Zones, which creates virtually tax-free zones to attract and retain businesses. Twelve new zones are to be created, further spreading the benefits across the state but diluting the program's original intent of luring businesses to a small number of seriously poor, distressed areas.

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would provide tax incentives for businesses that settle their offices in Lower Manhattan to help promote economic growth in the downtown area that is still recovering from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
 Would extend the state's low-cost power programs that provide cheap electricity to more than 300 businesses. 
 Would create a control board to oversee the struggling finances of Erie County, where Buffalo is located. 
 Would authorize the planned replacement of Yankee Stadium by allowing parkland to be used. Leaders also agreed to move forward with a new home for the Mets in Queens. The agreement calls for allocating $75 million in state funds for each stadium, and earmarking another $75 million for unspecified projects outside the city. 

Education
AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would tighten oversight of school finances following the disclosure that millions of dollars in taxpayer money was misspent by school officials in Roslyn, Long Island. Bills were passed that would require more training for voting members of school boards, authorize the state comptroller to audit each school district every five years, and authorize civil penalties for school officials who steal.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 For the second consecutive year, the state failed to agree on a plan to overhaul education financing across the state to comply with a ruling by the state's highest court, which found that the state had shortchanged New York City students and ordered the state to find a remedy. After the governor appealed the order, all sides agreed to avoid the issue which had snarled the 2004 legislative session. 
 Would have increased the number of charter schools above the current cap of 100 and remove New York City from the statewide cap. 

Environment
AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would begin phasing in a ban on the sale or distribution of devices containing mercury, including thermostats, switches, barometers, relays and measuring instruments. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have updated the state's bottle law, enacted in 1982, by adding deposits to some noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water and iced tea, as well as to the carbonated beverages currently covered. Would have directed unclaimed deposits, which are currently kept by bottlers, to a State Environmental Protection Fund.
 Would have strengthened wetland protection laws by authorizing the Department of Environmental Conservation to oversee wetlands of one acre or smaller because current law restricts them to oversight of wetlands bigger than 2.4 acres.

Governance
AWAITING SIGNATURE, VETO OR VOTER APPROVAL
 Would require lobbyists seeking state contracts to disclose their activities, as those lobbying the Legislature are currently required to. State contracts, and the undisclosed lobbying efforts to win them, have been at the heart of a number of recent scandals in Albany. 
 Would close a loophole that allows state workers to evade ethics fines by quitting their jobs.
 Would intensify oversight of the state's scandal-plagued public authorities, whose multibillion-dollar operations have long operated with little scrutiny. Would create an inspector general's post as well as an outside budget office, both appointed by the governor, to monitor the authorities. Would require authorities to set fair-market values when disposing of properties.
 The Legislature struck an agreement with the cable industry to create a local version of C-Span to broadcast gavel-to-gavel coverage of legislative sessions. The governor supports it.
 Would overhaul New York's aging election system to meet requirements of the federal Help America Vote Act and pave the way for the replacement of the state's antiquated voting machines. New York became the last state to pass legislation to comply with the act, and its delay means that some counties -- notably those in New York City -- will probably not have new machines in place by the 2006 elections. The bill allows localities to choose what kind of voting machine to buy, as long as the machines produce a verifiable paper trail of votes, to allow for recounts. 
 Would place a constitutional amendment aimed changing the budget process on the ballot in November, for voters to decide. Proponents say it would improve the budget process, set school spending for two years instead of one, and ensure on-time budgets. Opponents say it would transfer power from the governor to the Legislature, and give lawmakers an incentive not to pass the budget on time so they could replace the governor's spending plan with their own.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have banned all gifts from lobbyists. Mr. Pataki and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the man who wants to succeed him in 2006, sought such a ban but lawmakers resisted and left the current $75 gift limit in place.
 Would have overhauled the state's lax campaign finance laws, which are difficult to enforce. The governor proposed lowering contribution limits, improving enforcement, banning ''soft money'' and requiring more disclosure. The Assembly wanted to do many of those things, but also to establish publicly financed elections.
 Would have established nonpartisan redistricting, taking the power to draw the lines of legislative districts away from the incumbents who often draw lines to benefit the parties in power. 

Gambling
AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would create a board to watch over the actions of the scandal-plagued New York Racing Association, which operates racetracks in the state. It would allow a plan to install video lottery terminals at Aqueduct racetrack to go forward.

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have paved the way for Las Vegas-style casinos in the Catskills. Governor Pataki initially introduced a bill authorizing five casinos there, which would be given to Indian tribes as part of compacts to settle their land claims against the state, but withdrew the bill after it ran into opposition in the Legislature and court rulings changed the legal landscape. He then introduced a bill that would have allowed just one casino, to settle a claim by the Akwesasne Mohawks. The Assembly passed it. But the Senate balked, saying it wanted to authorize three casinos to generate more revenue and satisfy more tribes, including one represented by Kenneth Bruno, a lobbyist whose father is Senator Bruno, the majority leader. 

Health and Social Services
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Extends Kendra's Law for five years, which authorized the courts to order people with mental illness to follow medical advice. 

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would allow pharmacists and nurses to dispense emergency contraceptives, the so-called morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy after sex, to women without a doctor's authorization.
 Would require more thorough disclosure of hospital infection rates. 
 Would streamline the foster care system to allow children in foster care to move more quickly either to adoption, or to be returned to their biological families. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would have bailed out the financially beleaguered Westchester Medical Center.
 Would have allowed public funding for stem cell research.
 Would have provided tens of millions of dollars to help pay for raises in upstate nursing homes, which some critics called a giveaway to 1199/S.E.I.U., the powerful health care workers union.
 Would have created Timothy's Law, a measure to require health insurers to cover treatment for mental health.

Consumer Protection
LEGISLATION ENACTED
 Allows ticket scalpers for events at arenas with more than 6,000 seats to charge up to 45 percent above a ticket's face value; the legal markup for tickets for events at smaller arenas or theaters with fewer than 6,000 seat will remain at the current level of $5 or 20 percent, whichever is greater.

AWAITING SIGNATURE OR VETO
 Would require businesses and the government to alert people when personal information -- such as credit card numbers -- are jeopardized by security breaches. 

LEGISLATION FAILED
 Would repeal the state's vicarious liability law, which currently leaves car-leasing companies vulnerable to lawsuits when leased cars are involved in accidents.

HEADLINE: 10 Years Later, Tormenting Memories of Srebrenica

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE; Nicholas Wood contributed reporting from Bosnia for this article.

DATELINE: SREBRENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 9 

 BODY:
A decade ago here in eastern Bosnia, Camila Omanovic tied a rope around an iron pipe in an abandoned factory. She asked God to forgive her and tried to hang herself.
 Days earlier, Bosnian Serb soldiers had overwhelmed 370 poorly armed Dutch peacekeepers protecting Srebrenica, a pocket of 40,000 Bosnian Muslims that had been declared a ''safe area'' under United Nations protection. In the final and most brutal chapter of four years of ethnic war -- and the worst massacre in Europe since World War II -- the Serbian forces rounded up and killed more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys. Ms. Omanovic's husband was among them.
 Convinced that she faced rape, torture and death, Ms. Omanovic decided on suicide. But two teenage boys saw her, called for help, and peacekeepers came and pulled her to the ground. 
 With as many as 50,000 people expected to gather here on Monday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the killings -- which war crimes judges ruled genocide -- and the forced expulsions of more than 30,000 Muslim women and children, three lives reflect how Srebrenica has changed, and how the effects of its horror live on.
 A Bosnian Serb who arrived in Srebrenica the day after the town fell and helped save two Srebrenica Muslims has sunk into a life shadowed by an anemic economy, criminal mafias and a stubborn denial of the scope of the slaughter here. A Dutch soldier still serves his unit but remains haunted by Srebrenica. Ms. Omanovic and 2,900 other Muslims have returned to the town, intent on reversing the Serbian goal of creating an ''ethnically pure'' Serbian state in Bosnia. ''No one said we would ever be able to come back,'' said Ms. Omanovic, her face flushed with pride. ''I'm not afraid.''

The Pull of a Husband's Grave
 Today, Ms. Omanovic is a woman transformed. 
 A shaken and fragile figure when interviewed just after the town's fall a decade ago, she was assertive and animated on a recent Friday night as she sat in her brother's new Srebrenica guesthouse. She laughed, waved her hands in the air and shook her head in disbelief as she explained how she found the courage to journey home.
 ''Everyone is afraid to come back because everyone has bad memories,'' she said, surrounded by old Muslim friends. ''I thought I would never return.''
 Her homecoming is part of a $21 million American, European and Canadian effort to move Muslims back to the Srebrenica area and rebuild the town. Progress has been slow, and some Srebrenica survivors accuse the United States and Europe of making a tepid effort. Muslims are returning, they say, because they are impoverished and have nowhere else to go. The two Serbian leaders indicted on charges of genocide in the killings, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, remain free.
 For Ms. Omanovic, every Muslim who returns here is a victory. The area's population is now 40 percent Muslim. The town's mayor is a Muslim. Forty percent of its police force is Muslim. Forty Muslim children attend high school with 600 Serbs.
 Ms. Omanovic works as a bookkeeper in the same factory where she tried to kill herself. Now it holds the administrative offices of the sprawling local memorial to Srebrenica's dead. One of the teenage boys who helped save her is a town policeman; the other is a guard at the memorial. After being expelled from Srebrenica, Ms. Omanovic lived in Muslim-controlled central Bosnia. Last year, she was offered the bookkeeping job at the memorial. She could not sleep for three nights. Visions of the war, as well as an unexpected longing for Srebrenica, filled her. Something else also drew her back: her husband's grave.
 DNA tests have identified the remains of 2,070 Muslims found in forests and mass graves. Searchers discovered the body of Ms. Omanovic's husband, an engineer she calls ''my beloved Ahmet,'' at an ambush site. His head and one of his hands were missing.
 ''It's the contentment of the soul,'' she said. ''I feel close to him. I go to the grave.''
 Ms. Omanovic lives on a street of mostly abandoned houses. Her neighbors are eight other Muslim widows.
 Ignoring rumors that the town is haunted, the women have restarted a competition from before the war that honors Srebrenica's most beautiful garden. Amid the abandoned houses of the dead, pockets of carefully nurtured red roses, white lilies and yellow carnations bloom.
 ''I would like this town to be like it used to be,'' Ms. Omanovic said.
 When she met her husband's former assistant, a Serbian woman, they embraced. The Serb trembled and wept. In line at the local bank, Serbs wave Ms. Omanovic to the front.
 But she and other residents say the town's Muslims and Serbs inhabit parallel worlds. They rarely socialize. Both sides, they say, hide their true emotions.
 ''They are very polite, they kiss me,'' she said. ''After everything that happened, I know it's just acting.''

Muslims' Savior Is Bitter
 About a mile north of the Omanovic family's new guesthouse is the home of a former Serbian soldier who grew up in Srebrenica. The former soldier, a middle-aged man, asked to speak on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation if Serbian nationalists learned that he saved two Muslims after the town's fall.
 At the time of the massacre, he was an army soldier who was ordered to separate a group of mostly elderly Muslim men from a crowd of refugees and load them onto a truck, he said. He spotted two elderly Muslim men who had treated him kindly as a youth: the longtime maitre d'hotel of the local hotel restaurant and his favorite high-school teacher.
 Defying a Serb who outranked him, he told the two they could stay with the women. 
 In a separate interview, the Muslim teacher confirmed that the man had saved his life and that of the hotel worker.
 Today the former soldier is more bitter and less confident. He complained that Muslims have more jobs in the town's government, police force and factories.
 Like other local Serbs, he begrudges the changes in Srebrenica and minimizes the massacre, and Serbian responsibility for it. He dismisses the vast amounts of forensic evidence and two confessions from Serbian military officers in war crimes trials, and questions the number of dead.
 ''Islam is financing all that,'' he said. 
 In interviews a decade ago, he expressed confidence that Bosnia's Serbs would have a separate country. But while the Muslims have returned to Srebrenica, the Serbian population has dwindled to 4,000, just a third of what it was after the war. He said the international community was forcing Serbs to live with Muslims. ''We all are aware what is imposed,'' he said. ''We are not that stupid. We understand.''
 He says peacekeepers will have to stay in Bosnia until a strong economy eases tensions.
 But he is cynical, too, about Serbian nationalists. At one point after the war, he was shot when he tried to break up a fight involving a Serb. Western diplomats have said the Serb is a member of one of the Serb nationalist mafias flourishing in the country. 
 The former soldier predicted that the man would never be punished.
 ''We were fighting for a system,'' he said, meaning a well-governed Serbian state. ''This is what we get.''

Dutch Soldier Can't Forget
 Eight hundred miles northwest of Srebrenica, in the Netherlands, Sgt. First Class Theo Lutke, 34, thinks about the fall of the town ''almost every day.''
 ''I think I have a rucksack of experiences,'' he said. ''This experience will always stay in the backpack.''
 He and other Dutch peacekeepers tried to serve as unarmed escorts for the busloads of Muslim women and children expelled from the area. But Serbian soldiers stole their blue United Nations helmets and flak jackets at gunpoint and used them to trick Muslims into surrendering. One Dutch peacekeeper was forced to climb onto a stolen United Nations vehicle, was given a rifle and taken ''Muslim hunting'' by the Serbs. No Muslims were found.
 ''I didn't know if I would come home ever,'' said Sergeant Lutke, who is one of a few dozen Srebrenica veterans still in the Dutch Army.
 After the scale of the massacre emerged, Srebrenica became a national scandal in the Netherlands. An exhaustive investigation forced the resignation of the country's prime minister in 2002. The commander of the Dutch battalion said he moved to Spain because people in the Netherlands shouted ''coward'' at him on the street.
 Sergeant Lutke went through his own soul-searching. ''I looked in the mirror and asked myself, 'Did I do everything I could?''' He believes he did. He blames Serbian nationalists.
 The Dutch government has continued deploying peacekeepers, sending troops to Macedonia, Albania, Ethiopia, Liberia, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 In June 2004, the Dutch unit that served in Srebrenica was sent to southern Iraq. Four Apache attack helicopters backed the unit, firepower that Dutch military officials say could have slowed or stopped the Serbian advance on Srebrenica. A Srebrenica veteran commanded; Sergeant Lutke led a squad.
 ''You feel like a soldier again,'' he said. Yet after his patrol killed two suspected suicide bombers, flashbacks of Srebrenica filled his mind. He returned home early. 
 ''It exploded inside me,'' he said, referring to the reawakened memories. ''I wanted to sleep. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't.''

HEADLINE: Beyond the Cookie Sale

BYLINE: By KATHY CLONINGER; As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS a Girl Scout myself for five years, starting in second grade in Dallas in the late 1950's. My mother was the troop leader and also a secretary with the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I saw her in that role, and then she had this fun leadership role with the Girl Scouts. Seeing her come into her own in these positions was a formative experience for me.
 My first trip with the Girl Scouts was to South Padre Island, a popular beach destination in Texas. We saved money from our cookie sale and chose the destination ourselves. The whole experience was empowering. We were able to just be girls, we didn't have to worry about what any boys would think of us. 
I loved music growing up. My parents always played records around the house. My mother liked Patti Page and Elvis Presley, and my older cousin listened to the Chad Mitchell Trio and Gordon Lightfoot. My family wasn't college-oriented, however. Even though I got straight A's, during my senior year of high school I was flailing -- I didn't know what direction to take. 
 One night I went to a coffeehouse called the Rubaiyat. There was a sign over the sink in the restroom that said ''Waitress Needed.'' I ripped it down, walked out and told the owner he had found his waitress. He said, ''Honey, you have to be 18 to work here.'' I took out my ID and showed him I had just turned 18. He said if I had that much spunk I deserved the job. I stayed five years, long enough to support myself through North Texas State University and the University of Texas.
 Mike Williams was a big-time folk singer at the coffeehouse who played a 12-string guitar and had a song on one of John Denver's albums. I used to just stare at him. I ended up marrying him about 12 years later. When we moved to Nashville we hosted a Nashville Picking Party every Tuesday night for 11 years. It became part of the TV series ''Roots of Country Music.'' The TV staff did a live taping in our living room one Tuesday night. Our parties became the underground connection for songwriters.
 When we moved to New York a year and a half ago, I worried that Mike would miss the sense of community he had in Nashville. He sent out an e-mail and reconnected with a couple of New York musicians. Now about 70 or 80 people gather at our home on Wednesday nights to hear live music by four songwriters. 
 Another turning point occurred after I finished my master's degree. I was feeling my independence and wanted to move to a different state. I can still remember the blind ad I answered in The Dallas Times Herald. It said: ''Youth director needed for northern Colorado agency. Degree required.'' I sent my resume, got a call from the Mountain Prairie Girl Scout Council in Greeley, Colo., and went for an interview. That's how I started in this field.
 One of the most difficult things for any organization is change. Years ago, when I was a young director of the YWCA, we had two programs, one that involved child care and economic development programs, and one that was a therapeutic program for troubled teenage girls living in juvenile detention. The second program involved a monthlong wilderness experience. It was organized as a nonprofit with its own board. I wanted to bring it under the YWCA's umbrella, but that board wanted to hang onto its autonomy. It took all of my leadership skills to persuade the board to let go.
 I often talk to civic groups that have a mostly male audience. Once, when I described how we expose girls to rappelling and other high-risk activities, one man teared up as he spoke to me. He said he had been very involved in his son's scouting, but he had never thought to pay attention to what his daughter was gaining in scouting. He realized he had turned that part of her life over to his wife, and he vowed to take more of an interest in it.

HEADLINE: The Half-Life of Anxiety

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
FOR all their murderous power, the four terrorist bombs detonated in London on Thursday morning have not created anything close to mass panic. It's possible to imagine a scene straight out of the movie ''War of the Worlds,'' an unraveling of society, with people disoriented, afraid for their lives, holing up in their basements or fleeing the city. 
 Instead, on Friday morning, a day after the bombing, Londoners were beginning to return to daily routines, some even riding the buses and subway trains.
Although real terrorism is life-shattering to those directly affected and may help attackers achieve political goals -- last year's bombing in Madrid, for example, may have helped lead to the withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq -- the attacks almost never sow the kind of lasting confusion and mass anxiety that the perpetrators presumably want.
 In Israel, the damage from cafe and bus bombings is typically cleared within hours. In Lower Manhattan, real estate prices have only spiraled upward since the Sept. 11 attacks; the average sale in TriBeCa last year was almost $1.7 million, 16 percent higher than in 2003. And a recent report found that tourism had increased in Madrid since the bombings. 
 ''It says something that it is hard to think of any attack that truly caused a city to cease to function, except perhaps Dresden, Hiroshima or Nagasaki,'' said Dr. Lynn Eden, a senior research scholar at Stanford University's Institute for International Studies and author of the book, ''Whole World on Fire,'' an analysis of military bombing and damage predictions.
 Are Western cities themselves so resourceful and structurally sound that they can absorb just about any blow? Are people adaptable enough that they can live with almost any threat? Or, can certain kinds of threats deeply unsettle a worldly population?
 Strangely enough, the answer to all three questions is yes. Certainly, an attack of the magnitude of last week's in London creates a climate of fear, and no one in England is likely to forget the carnage; July 7 is certain to carry in the English consciousness some of the same resonance as Sept. 11 does in this country. 
 But terror groups like Al Qaeda are widely thought to be after bigger game -- the psychological unraveling, or loss of confidence, in Western society. And high explosives have not done the trick. 
 People understand bombs, for one thing; they know what the weapons can do, and why certain targets are chosen. This allows residents to feel that they have some control over the situation: They can decide not to take trains at rush hour, avoid buses or drive a car, psychologists say. 
 ''Unfortunately, and I think people sensed this in watching the coverage in London, bombings have become familiar,'' and, as such, less frightening to those not directly affected, said George Loewenstein, a professor of psychology and economics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
 And for all their flaws, Western governments typically respond immediately to terror, which is far more psychologically soothing than many people admit. It's the reason Prime Minister Tony Blair flew back to London from the Group of 8 conference in Gleneagles, Scotland. And it's the reason both Rudolph Giuliani and Winston Churchill became national heroes. 
 All the same, it's clear that people in much of the West believe that their societies are fragile, and capable of breaking down. Indeed, as the new millennium approached, there were fears that a large-scale computer meltdown would paralyze hospitals, police and other basic services. And the most unsettling thing about the current brand of extremist Muslim terror is the certainty that the enemy will try anything -- including using weapons whose psychological effects are entirely unknown.
 Even small changes in weaponry can be deeply unnerving. In her history of London during World War II, ''London 1945,'' Maureen Waller describes how Londoners, long accustomed to take cover from the roar of bombers overhead, plunged into confusion when first hit with Hitler's missiles, the V-1 buzz bomb and the V-2 rocket. 
 ''By some acoustic quirk, those in its direct path barely heard a V-2,'' she writes. ''If you did hear it, it had missed you. But that knowledge did nothing to quell the primeval fear each time one exploded.'' The missiles were far more terrifying than the conventional bombardments, Ms. Waller adds. ''Life was uncertain again.''
 Bioterror scenarios are the most obvious modern-day example of such terrifying ambiguity. Despite only a handful of deaths, the anthrax poisonings in 2001 created a rip current of anxiety for millions anytime they opened their mailboxes. Studies find that this kind of free-floating concern, when written across neighbors' or colleagues' faces, is contagious, Dr. Loewenstein said. 
 A similarly frightening mystique might surround the so-called dirty bomb, a conventional explosive containing some radioactive material. A dirty bomb is not a nuclear bomb, as many people assume, and can inflict nowhere near the amount of damage or radioactive contamination, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness and a professor at Columbia University. 
 While a nuclear bomb could devastate much of the city with its blast and radiation wave, a dirty bomb is a local device -- a car bomb, say, that could contaminate a specific area, like Times Square.
 ''There is a whole lot of mythology associated with any nuclear device, and a tendency for people to confuse a dirty bomb with a nuclear bomb, and we just don't know how people will react,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''For instance, would people decide to come back to work and live in an area hit by a dirty bomb?'' 
 The widespread revulsion to any hint of radiation, he said, lends the dirty bomb both an ominous novelty and mystery that are much more likely to induce life-altering psychological anxiety than a conventional bomb would.
 Although such sustained and uncertain threats may fall short of bringing a city to a standstill, they could shatter social networks and slow an economy, experts say. People may still ride the buses, take their children to school and go to work, but a community under continuous assault often turns on itself, with neighbors distrusting one another, research suggests.
 In studies of Alaskan communities that were affected by the oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez in 1989, and of towns dealing with water contamination in New Jersey and New York, sociologists have found what they call social corrosion. Sustained anxiety breaks down social groups and leads to an increase in mental health problems and potentially to economic downturn, said Lee Clarke, a sociology professor at Rutgers University and author of the forthcoming book, ''Worst Cases,'' an analysis of responses to disaster.
 Beyond the unknown, many people wonder whether city residents would stick around if terrorists successfully staged not one bombing but a series of major attacks in a short period of time. Certainly after Sept. 11, many people openly wondered whether another big attack -- a double or triple hit -- might be just enough to cause a kind of collective mental breakdown, an exodus.
 Maybe. But in the absence of new species of horror, the histories of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Belfast and London still suggest otherwise. 
 ''Even if we hypothesize attacks like this for a week, what would happen?'' said Dr. Eden. ''They would shut down the subway, let's say, and my guess is that there would be a run on bicycles. There would be a difficult adjustment period, there would be some economic ramifications, but people would learn to function.''

HEADLINE: Luck of the Draw

 BODY:
STATE and local officials may be hanging their heads about the announcement that London, and not New York City, will be playing host to the 2012 Summer Olympics, but New Yorkers should be breathing a sigh of relief that the Games are now somebody else's worry.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the Olympics would have added more than $12 billion to the economy and generated 135,000 jobs. Experts who study the impact of sporting events on the economy, however, uniformly find that such estimates routinely overstate the effect of mega-events like the Olympics on local economies. A study of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, which I conducted with Prof. Robert A. Baade of Lake Forest College in Illinois, found that the Games there generated as few as 3,500 new jobs, a tiny fraction of the 77,000 new jobs predicted by the local organizing committee in the run-up to the Olympics. 
How is it possible that the hordes of visitors produced by an event of this magnitude don't wind up benefiting the local economy? 
 First of all, there is little net gain in tourism. The Olympics crowds out other potential visitors. Although the Games would have attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city, hotels in places like New York enjoy a brisk business during the summer anyway.
 Certainly no nonsports tourists in their right mind would venture into the craziness of a host city during the Olympics, and therefore their usual spending is displaced by sports fans. Similarly, the crowds and congestion of big events serve to dissuade locals from venturing into areas near the sports venues.
 New York City got a taste of the negative effects of crowding out last year during the Republican National Convention. The presence of the convention, along with the security measures that accompanied it, resulted in major disruptions for residents. This translated into decreased economic activity in the city despite the presence of tens of thousands of visiting conventioneers and journalists. Attendance at Broadway shows, for example, fell a little more than 20 percent during the convention compared with the same week a year earlier. Now imagine these disruptions on a scale of 10 times the size and lasting for an entire month.
 And where does all the spending during the Olympics finally end up? Even though local hotels often charge two or three times their normal rates for rooms during the Games, the hotels don't double or triple the wages of their local workers. The spending at the Olympics would have been a windfall for shareholders back at corporate headquarters, but not for ordinary workers in New York City. Yet it is the local workers whose taxes would have been used to pay for the additional security and public works that holding the Olympics requires. 
 While this tax burden doesn't mean that the Olympics provides no benefits to the host city, it does pose a real question as to how much a community should be willing to pay for the ''honor'' of having the Games. In the wake of Sept. 11, the costs of holding the Games has risen enormously. In 2004, Athens spent more than $1.2 billion on security alone, and with operating costs like this, running the Games without huge subsidies from taxpayers is nearly impossible.
 Furthermore, the International Olympic Committee requires that host cities spend billions of dollars on lavish new sports facilities that have little use after the big event. Not even New York City has much need for a 10,000-seat aquatics center or a world-class archery range once the Games are over. 
 Although local organizers will lament that the city will now miss out on the Olympics' powerful legacy of parks and recreational facilities, nothing bars the city from building training centers for elite athletes and renovating fields for young people if it wishes -- and at a small fraction of the cost that would have been imposed on it by the International Olympic Committee. 
 New York City would do well to remember that Montreal's legacy from the 1976 Olympics includes an empty baseball stadium and government bonds that residents are still paying off. Similarly, many of the Olympic venues in Athens are unused just one year after their debut.
 While New York City has lost the opportunity to ''go for the gold'' in 2012, I can't imagine that London, especially in light of the terrible bombings on Thursday, isn't already having second thoughts.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise Despite Terrorist Attacks in London

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market shrugged off the terrorist attacks in Britain and posted solid gains for the week on optimism about the state of the economy.
 Stocks fell early on Thursday on news of the London bombings, which killed scores of people and injured hundreds. 
But the market bounced back that afternoon and posted gains for the day. On Friday, stocks surged further, after the Labor Department reported modest job growth in May -- enough, perhaps, for healthy economic growth without undue inflation.
For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 145.70 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,449.19. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 17.42 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 1,211.86. The Nasdaq composite index rose 55.51 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 2,112.88. Markets in the United States were closed on Monday for the Fourth of July holiday, so there were only four days of trading.
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose slightly, to 4.09 percent from 4.05 percent the previous week.
 Crude oil for August delivery closed in New York at $59.63 a barrel, up 1.5 percent from $58.75 the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Cheek by Jowl

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
IVAN LOPEZ, an unemployed forklift operator who has lived most of his life in Chelsea, was chatting about his recent lunch with Harrison Ford, a newcomer to the neighborhood. ''I met him at La Taza de Oro,'' Mr. Lopez said, referring to a small rice-and-beans shop on Eighth Avenue.
 ''Well, I didn't really meet him,'' he admitted. ''I was sitting there, and he was so close.'' Mr. Lopez could hear Mr. Ford talking about the luxurious loft he had bought. ''I got his autograph.''
This is today's Chelsea, a neighborhood of sometimes stunning cheek-by-jowl incongruity, where no one was at all surprised the other day to see a wrinkled Latino man in a Panama hat tooling up Ninth Avenue in a motorized wheelchair past two impeccably coiffed blond men in tuxedos hailing a cab. 
 But perhaps the biggest incongruity is this: On Ninth Avenue, in the middle of $2.7 million penthouses on West 19th Street and $3,400 jackets at Chelsea Market, stand Fulton Houses, the 944-unit public housing project stretching from 16th to 19th Streets. Although the average Chelsea household earned about $83,000 in 2000, the most recent year for which data is available, average household income among the 2,215 residents of Fulton Houses is just under $25,000. 
 Once, the two worlds were more similar. When Fulton Houses' 11 brick buildings were completed in 1965, the economic divide between the project's residents and those in the predominantly working-class neighborhood around it was far less pronounced. The average household income at Fulton was $5,408 in 1970, while the average Chelsea household earned $8,505.
 But the character of Chelsea has evolved considerably. Gentrification proceeded gradually in the 1960's and 70's, gathering force in the late 80's and 90's with an accelerating influx of gay professionals and middle-class families. Bodegas and workingman's bars gave way to upscale restaurants. The 1990's also brought Chelsea Piers and a thriving gallery scene in West Chelsea, lending an air of hip prestige that has helped drive real estate prices skyward.
 Other neighborhoods have experienced rampant gentrification around public housing. But as Chelsea becomes a place where two restaurants within three blocks have bathroom valets, the changes around Fulton vividly demonstrate what happens when a mixed-income neighborhood is pressed by forces of wealth and fabulousness. 
 And the area is poised to transform further still. Late last month, the City Council approved a plan to rezone 68 acres of far west Chelsea between 16th and 30th Streets. The centerpiece of the plan is the transformation of the High Line elevated railway into a 22-block-long ribbon of green space, but the rezoning will also add 5,500 units of housing to the neighborhood. 
 While the plan calls for about 1,200 of the units to be affordable to households with low, moderate and middle incomes, the remaining 4,300 would be market rate. And in Chelsea's sizzling real estate environment, where the median sale price of a three-bedroom condominium is currently $3 million, that means even more luxury will be bumping up against Fulton Houses. 
 As these waves of wealth wash up on its shores, some inside the complex feel increasingly cut off. 
 ''We're an isolated little island,'' said Ann Marie Baronowski, secretary of the Fulton Houses Tenants Association. ''We have great apartments and great rent, but we can't afford to do anything here. The only thing we can afford is Western Beef. There are no restaurants you can afford, no food shops you can afford, no clothing stores you can afford. You're living here, but basically all you can do is sleep here.''

Inside the Brick Towers
 Thursday through Sunday nights, the Fulton Houses apartment of Sonia Jamison throbs with music, laughter and alcohol-tinged conviviality. Unfortunately for her, this good cheer originates not in her home but across Ninth Avenue in the Maritime Hotel building at 17th Street, where La Bottega's restaurant, cafe and two cabanas regularly overflow with well-dressed night owls.
 ''I have never been over there because I can't afford that,'' Ms. Jamison said one recent afternoon while chatting with friends in a Fulton Houses playground. ''But I see who goes in and out of there: movie stars, P. Diddy, Jay-Z. A couple weeks ago, some guys came out of there arguing and fighting because they were drunk.'' 
 Ms. Jamison, a mother of three who works as a bank customer sales representative, jabbed a finger toward the gleaming white hotel. ''They put it right across the street from the project,'' she said, her anger building. ''The bottom line is, it's for rich people.'' 
 Not everyone living in Fulton Houses resents the presence of trendy newcomers like the Maritime, the former home of a sailors' union that was redeveloped in 2003. 
 ''Because I work and my whole family is successful, I appreciate this,'' David Nelson, a supervisor at United Parcel Service, said of the proximity of upscale clubs and restaurants. Mr. Nelson, who had just returned from his shift and was sitting on a playground bench, talked proudly about his eldest son, a 25-year-old movie actor whose mother grew up in Fulton Houses with famous siblings, the Wayans brothers comedians.
 ''It brings up the whole area,'' Mr. Nelson said of the high-end new businesses. ''The problem is the drug dealers. If you're building around projects and you bring clientele to places around here, you're making them more money.''

A Golden-Lit Playground
 The midnight scene at the Maritime Hotel on a recent Saturday looked like a cross between Times Square and Tavern on the Green. Honking cabs lined up two deep along Ninth Avenue, disgorging well-scrubbed young men along with young women clutching designer handbags. A white Hummer stretch limo glided by. Above the raised plaza of La Bottega, glowing Chinese lanterns wafted in the breeze, hovering bowls of inviting golden light that provided a striking contrast to the mostly darkened windows of the Fulton Houses across the street.
 In the northern cabana atop La Bottega's restaurant, accessible only through two sets of gatekeepers, young patrons sipped martinis and grooved to Foxy Brown's new single, ''Come Fly With Me.''
 Maurice Rodriguez, the Maritime's director of operations, said petty theft had been a problem, and attributed it to young people from Fulton Houses. ''In fact,'' he said, ''on Thursday night we caught two kids who lived in the projects purse snatching.'' Mr. Rodriguez said that the two youths had told the hotel's security staff that they lived in Fulton Houses.
 Law enforcement officials said they saw no pattern of Fulton Houses residents' being arrested for robbery.
 Many patrons, meanwhile, were oblivious to the proximity of Fulton Houses. ''Are they projects?'' asked Lianne Graubart, a Chelsea resident and real estate agent, when told that a public housing complex sat across the street. ''Are they really projects? Really?''
 ''Housing projects? No way,'' added her boyfriend, Morris Amiri, an asset manager who was wearing a white linen shirt, True Religion jeans and a tan acquired while attending a friend's wedding in Maui. ''That's sad. They're all screwed up, and we're over here having a good time. I hope they're not going to be chased out.''
 Between shots of Patron tequila, he added: ''The rich are getting so rich, and the poor are getting more poor, so you're seeing a situation where extravagance is driving people's happiness. The more they get, the more they want.''

Exit the Middle Class
 Melva Max, a funkily elegant restaurateur who opened the unpretentious French bistro La Lunchonette on 18th Street and 10th Avenue with her chef husband in 1988, is not among those who want more extravagance in Chelsea.
 ''I'm happy about a lot of the changes, like the galleries, but now it's going too far,'' she said the other day, pointing to lots down the block from the projects where luxury condominiums are slated to rise. ''The building of all these super, very, very expensive apartments is disturbing to me.'' 
 Ms. Max, who lives in a rent-stabilized apartment, noted that many customers had been priced out of the area by rising rents, while friends had sold their brownstones for $5 million and moved away. ''These are like normal people, really working-class, middle-class people with kids,'' she said. ''And it's just shocking to me that they're all selling and moving out. I just feel kind of sad.''

The New, the Rich
 Some people buy used mattresses on the Craigslist Web site. Austin Nagel, a 22-year-old Brooklyn real estate developer, bought a $2.7 million triplex penthouse in Chelsea Club, an icy-chic luxury condominium, 12 stories of tinted glass and cast stone rising on the site of a former parking lot on 19th Street near 10th Avenue.
 Mr. Nagel, who has made a quick fortune turning Brooklyn Heights town houses into condos, stood atop his private roof recently and grew giddy as he scanned his sweeping views. He surveyed Chelsea Piers, where he works out; the high-rise where his acupuncturist keeps his office; docked boats bobbing in the glittering Hudson River; and the blocklong Chelsea Market, where one of his new neighbors, a celebrity hair-and-makeup artist, stores fine wines in the Chelsea Wine Vault. He also surveyed the dingy brick buildings of Fulton Houses, where the average monthly rent is $348.
 ''It doesn't even bother me that I'm looking over this,'' he said of the project. ''These people will talk with you if you talk to them. You'll see them when you're walking your dog. They'll say, 'What's up?' They'll get to know you. On the Upper East Side, no one will talk to you.''

Isolated by Affluence?
 Inside the concrete-block-walled office of the Fulton Houses Tenants Association, the group's president, Jimmy Pelsey, sat with a few of the association's members and discussed the scarcity of neighborhood jobs for Fulton residents. A parade of new upscale Chelsea businesses had promised employment for Fulton residents at meetings of Community Board 4, only to later break their word, said Mr. Pelsey, who is a board member. 
 When Richard Born, a co-owner of the Maritime, sought a variance in 2001 to add two structures to its raised plaza, Mr. Pelsey said, ''I asked in Community Board 4, 'What are you going to offer to people in the development?''' Mr. Born, board minutes show, replied that 90 percent of his project's 150 to 175 jobs would be open to the community. Later, said Miguel Acevedo, another board member, ''I personally brought over 150 applicants with applications.'' But according to the two men, no Fulton residents were hired.
 ''We have several people that live within walking distance that work here,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, the Maritime's director of operations, who oversees most of the business's 450 employees, including one living in Covenant House, the center next door for at-risk youth. ''I don't know if they specifically live at the Fulton House. We hire people of all colors and races.''
 The fear that rising rents and the burgeoning development of luxury condominiums might further isolate Fulton Houses and other nearby projects, the Chelsea and Elliott Houses, in a sea of affluence impelled Mr. Acevedo and others to argue strenuously for the city to include affordable housing in the rezoning of far west Chelsea. As the new zoning plan shows, they largely succeeded, and 100 of the mixed-income units will be developed on a Fulton Houses parking lot.
 While Mr. Acevedo maintained that such mixed-income housing would give the children of Fulton residents a chance to stay in the neighborhood, not everyone at the gathering was so optimistic.
 Joe Schuler, a powerfully built man with a salt-and-pepper Fu Manchu mustache, believes that Fulton Houses will eventually be sold to private developers. His comments echoed a longstanding rumor making the rounds at the project. ''You don't have millions spent around a ghetto and have it remain a ghetto,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''We're the sore spot in this neighborhood.''
 Howard Marder, a spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority, insisted that the authority had no plans to privatize Fulton Houses. ''That rumor pops up all over the city, for some reason, whenever a neighborhood undergoes gentrification,'' he said.

'Still a Gay Ghetto'
 The evening after the city's gay pride parade last month, hundreds of well-groomed ''Chelsea Boys'' poured into the Park restaurant on Tenth Avenue near 17th Street for the club's regular Sunday party. Some chatted in the outdoor garden, which is planted with softly illuminated Japanese maples. Others cavorted in the hot tub in the Asian-theme rooftop bar area. 
 But Sophia Lamar, a Cuban-born transsexual who was performing at the party and wore a polka-dotted Balenciaga bathing suit and high heels, was not entirely sanguine about the area's status as a magnet for gays. ''Chelsea is still a gay ghetto,'' Ms. Lamar said, crossing one gartered leg over the other. ''I'm against ghettos, whether they're youth ghettos or black ghettos or minority ghettos or gay ghettos. I don't think there's any need to separate yourself from the rest of the society.''
 For this reason, she said, the juxtaposition of glamorous wealthy people with the low-income residents of Fulton Houses is a terrific thing. ''I've lived in different cities in the U.S., and the housing projects are always in places where people don't go,'' continued Ms. Lamar, who has visited a friend's mother at the housing project and has never felt uncomfortable among its residents. ''And here I think it's wonderful because it shows that there's room for everyone. Rich people are going to a supermarket, and poor people are going to the same supermarket, and that doesn't happen in any other city.''

What the Barber Knows
 When Manuel Manolo and his two fellow barbers are snipping away in the misleadingly named New Barber Shop on Ninth Avenue near 19th Street, the talk, by turns in Spanish and English, ranges from baseball to politics. On a recent Saturday, it settled on Fulton Houses. 
 Eddie Andujar, a longtime Fulton Houses resident who worked as a groundskeeper for the project for 25 years, said that it had been beautiful until about 1990, but had gone downhill since. ''Because of the drug dealers, it's very dangerous over here at nighttime,'' he added. 
 There have been two homicides at Fulton Houses since late January, the police said, but neither was thought to be drug-related. ''Crime in the 10th Precinct has declined dramatically in recent years,'' said Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. ''The Police Department pays close attention to conditions there and responds accordingly.'' Since 1993, robbery in the precinct has dropped 74 percent and felony assault 53 percent.
 Near the spinning barber pole, George Weaver, a 30-year-old Fulton Houses resident in a faded Million Youth March T-shirt, awaited his turn in Mr. Manolo's chair. Mr. Weaver, who recently received an associate's degree in business administration from Monroe College in the West Bronx, said he wished the Housing Authority would screen prospective Fulton Houses residents more thoroughly. ''People from shelters don't necessarily have a sense of community,'' he said.
 To illustrate his idea of how a community should work, he nodded toward Mr. Manolo. ''He always encouraged me to stay in school every time,'' Mr. Weaver said.
 Mr. Manolo, who has lived in Fulton Houses for 40 years and cut hair for just as long, grinned. ''I took a picture of him the day he graduated from college,'' he said proudly as Mr. Weaver climbed into his red leather chair. With that, the courtly barber took a straight razor and ran it gently across Mr. Weaver's Afro, which fell in leisurely dark clumps onto the worn linoleum floor, mingling with the blond hair and eyebrow trimmings snipped from the customer in the neighboring chair.

HEADLINE: Kings of Convenience 

BYLINE: By Amanda Hesser

 BODY:
In Nina Katchadourian's world, the Jolly Green Giant is married to the Indian maiden on Land O' Lakes butter and Little Debbie is sister to the Charmin baby. Mr. Clean and the Brawny Man are now partners and have adopted the Gerber Baby. Katchadourian recently offered these revelations in ''The Genealogy of the Supermarket,'' her 30-foot-wide wall installation displaying an imaginative family tree of American grocery-store icons at the Sara Meltzer Gallery in Chelsea. 
 ''These products display a kind of fantasy: that your Italian grandmother made this sauce for your pasta,'' says Katchadourian, who first assembled the family tree for a magazine called The Believer. ''To take them outside of the package and put them on a family tree seemed like the logical conclusion -- the way you're supposed to feel about them.'' And the way you're supposed to feel about them is an odd mixture of safety and empowerment, wholesomeness and ease. They were the friendly faces on television and in the supermarket that Americans grew up trusting. 
 The only place where Katchadourian went astray was with Betty Crocker, who languishes in a collateral branch married to a man on the Nescafe coffee jar. She should really preside at the top, as the matriarch of the entire clan. Betty Crocker was the first great supermarket icon. She made baking seem not just satisfying but also necessary to a healthy family life, and she later, in the 1950's, was at the forefront in the convenience movement that bore so many of her descendants on this family tree. Betty was the brainchild of Samuel Gale and James Quint, who in 1921 created her to be the ''chief of correspondence'' for Gold Medal flour and to lend a softer image to what was essentially a flour mill in Minnesota. To the men in charge of the company, Susan Marks writes in ''Finding Betty Crocker,'' Betty sounded ''cheery, wholesome and folksy.'' Crocker came from William G. Crocker, the former director of the Washburn Crosby Company, which owned Gold Medal flour.
 Initially, Betty was portrayed as a matronly woman, extolling the wonders of baking cake to a nation of reluctant housewives. Betty Crocker (actually a team of home economists) responded to home cooks' baking questions (even one of Ernest Hemingway's wives, Mary, wrote to her) and grew into a voice on national radio shows and an image of the ideal housewife in ads and on television. 
 Like anyone promoting cooking to the masses, she had a tough assignment. Cooking straddles two worlds that are at odds: art and labor. At the high end, in restaurants, chefs present themselves as artists. Mundane concerns like food costs and dish washing are kept from view. At the low end, the family dinner, cooking is mostly about those mundane concerns -- it's hard to feel like Picasso when your family wants the lasagna on the table now.
 In the early years, Betty Crocker maintained that the labor and art could coexist, but over time the products became increasingly focused on the labor and how to cut down on it with products like cake mixes and instant mashed potatoes. By the 90's, her image had been changed to a computer-generated composite of the 75 winners of the Spirit of Betty Crocker contest -- prim, conservatively dressed and wearing the expression of someone dosed up on happy pills -- someone who pushes mixes, prepackaged icings and convenience foods.
 Such was the fate of many of the food icons that followed Betty Crocker. Rather than serve as companions in the kitchen, products like Pillsbury's premade pie crust and Quaker Instant Oatmeal either did the cooking for you or reduced it to a bare minimum. This kind of convenience cooking is known as ''speed scratch'' in the industry. At Kraft Foods in the 80's, the company developed what it calls ''bowl baking,'' in which all the mixing is done in a single bowl. A traditional brownie recipe was streamlined by replacing the double boiler with the microwave and removing techniques like creaming the butter and sugar. Now, many Kraft recipes are kept to three steps and five or six ingredients, with less than 30 minutes of preparation time. Instructions have also been simplified, replacing traditional cooking terms like ''fold'' and ''dredge'' with ''gently stir'' and ''coat with flour.''
 But now, as Americans become increasingly knowledgeable about food and yet more and more strapped for time, a new brand of streamlined cooking has emerged. Three years ago, Aviva Goldfarb, a mother of two in Maryland, realized that what was holding her and her friends back from cooking was not the actual toil in the kitchen; it was the mental labor it took to be organized enough to cook for a family: the planning of menus, the making of shopping lists. She started a Web site called the Six O'clock Scramble (TheScramble.com) -- as in the evening scramble to figure out what's for dinner. For $4.95 a month, Goldfarb sends subscribers a menu for the week, including recipes and a shopping list. She has about 1,600 subscribers.
 That same year, Stephanie Allen opened the first ''food assembly store'' -- a new business category -- called Dream Dinners in Snohomish, a Seattle suburb. Customers make a reservation and select menus online. When they come to the store, they are given recipes and a prep station. All of the shopping and chopping is done in advance. Over the course of about two hours and for about $200 (including ingredients), they prepare 8 to 12 dishes for a family of four -- like cashew chicken and peach-glazed pork chops -- to take home and freeze. Dream Dinners now has 59 stores in 17 states.
 Let's Dish, a competitor in the Baltimore area, emphasizes the social aspect of cooking. It encourages groups to come in the evenings and assemble food while they drink wine. This, too, has been popular. Let's Dish has five stores with three more planned to open this summer. 
 The convenience movement has finally confronted the heart of the home-cooking predicament. We aspire to be chefs who shape a meal, not the prep cooks who do the shopping and chopping. In the genealogy of the supermarket, there is no icon for the weary shopper standing in a checkout line. 

Cuban Pork Tenderloin With Chimichurri Sauce
2 1-pound pork tenderloins
3 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon
dried oregano
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/2 cup parsley leaves, torn

Freshly ground black pepper.
 1. Place the tenderloins on an 18-inch piece of heavy-duty foil. Coat with 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano and onion. Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons olive oil and the orange juice. Wrap the tenderloin in the foil. 
 2. Make the chimichurri sauce: in a bowl, combine the parsley, lime juice, vinegar and the remaining olive oil, garlic, oregano and salt. Season with pepper.
 3. Heat one side of grill to medium. Place wrapped pork on unheated side. Cook over indirect heat in covered grill, turning occasionally, for 1 hour or until pork is fork tender and has reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees. To serve, slice pork and top with chimichurri sauce. Serve with spicy black beans and rice as well as a slice of fresh pineapple. Serves 4. Adapted from Let's Dish.

Service Cake With Victory Icing
For the cake:
Vegetable oil, for greasing pan
Flour, for dusting pan
1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
3/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs, well beaten

For the icing:
3/4 cup light corn syrup
2 large egg whites
Pinch of salt
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 teaspoon orange extract.
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Oil and flour an 8-inch-square cake pan. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Mix together the milk and vanilla.
 2. Cream the shortening and sugar. Mix in the eggs. Add the flour mixture alternating with the milk mixture. Pour into the pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out dry, 30-35 minutes. Allow cake to cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove and cool on a rack.
 3. For the icing, bring the corn syrup to a boil. In a mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. With the mixer running at high speed, drizzle in the hot corn syrup. Beat in the salt, lemon extract and orange extract until the icing has a creamy texture, about 2 minutes. Cut the cooled cake into 2 layers and spread each layer with the icing. 
 Serves 9. Adapted from ''Finding Betty Crocker.''

HEADLINE: Is It Time To Follow The Pack Overseas?

BYLINE: By AMY FELDMAN

 BODY:
INVESTORS just love foreign mutual funds these days, and no wonder. 
 Funds focused on overseas stocks gained 11.1 percent, on average, for the three years through June, compared with a gain of 9.3 percent for domestic stock funds. And the money has kept pouring in. From the beginning of 2004 through May, foreign mutual funds had $157.1 billion in net inflows, according to the Financial Research Corporation. 
That is 47 percent of all net stock and bond mutual fund inflows since the start of last year -- and from a category that accounts for just 16 percent of total stock and bond fund assets. 
 All that money sloshing around has created a problem for people looking to start investing overseas or to shift their international investments. Many prominent funds have closed to new investors, including Fidelity Diversified International, Julius Baer International Equity and Tweedy, Browne Global Value. Some of those that remain open are looking rather bloated. 
 Assets in the largest foreign fund, American Funds' EuroPacific Growth, have swelled to $54.5 billion, and more than two dozen others top $5 billion. While big funds that buy large-cap stocks can still do well, megafunds are typically harder to run than their smaller, more nimble brethren. A rapid inflow of money can make the task even harder.
 So should investors join the rush to international funds? While chasing returns can be a road to disaster, so can the guessing game for when the market will turn. ''It's been frothy because people were attracted by the high returns,'' said Mark Salzinger, publisher of The No-Load Fund Investor. ''But if you try to be too tricky with the timing you lose out.''
 It wasn't long ago that investing abroad was out of favor. But as the United States economy slogged along and the euro gained against the dollar, returns from overseas exceeded those from domestic stocks.
 ''The weakness of the U.S. dollar has meant that for a U.S. dollar investor, the returns of foreign investing have been very strong,'' explained Jamie Doyle, co-manager of the Causeway International Value fund, a solid performer that closed to new investors this year. 
 Looking ahead, he said that ''we do not see the plethora of massively cheap stocks that we saw two to three years ago.'' That, combined with the recent strengthening of the dollar, may mean that the exceptional returns of the last few years are unlikely to continue. 
 In fact, this year through June, foreign funds declined 0.68 percent, on average, while domestic stock funds rose 0.04 percent.
 Still, financial advisers commonly recommend a foreign stock allocation for their clients' portfolios, typically 10 percent to 20 percent of the equity portion. Over the long term, foreign stocks have remained a worthwhile diversification component for a portfolio. 
 ''What happened in the last three months or will happen in the next three months is not as important as what happens over the long term,'' said Stuart Ritter, a financial adviser at T. Rowe Price.
 Investors looking to buy an international fund may now need to look a little harder because so many funds -- especially smaller-cap funds -- have closed to new investors. Of course, many closed funds are still available to investors through their retirement plans or their financial advisers. But, ''there are still good funds out there that are open,'' said William Samuel Rocco, a Morningstar analyst. ''You need to look for the same thing in an international fund that you always do in a fund -- good management, reasonable-to-low expenses and a proven track record.''
 In addition to large funds with good records, like Harbor International, Templeton Foreign or American Funds' EuroPacific Growth, several smaller offerings are worth a look. Among them are Oakmark International, a large-cap value fund run by David Herro and Michael Welsh, that owns just 63 stocks and posted a three-year annualized return of 12.1 percent through June, and Dodge & Cox International Stock, which had an annualized return of 19.6 percent over that period. 
 Others are Third Avenue International Value, an eclectic, concentrated fund has returned 25 percent a year, on average, over the three years; and T. Rowe Price International Discovery, a smaller-cap fund with an annualized return of 22.3 percent over that time. 
 FOR those seeking a fund with fewer assets, Mr. Rocco points to ICAP International, which has an experienced management team and slightly more than $100 million in assets. It has posted a three-year annualized return of 14.4 percent.
 If market uncertainty makes you want to avoid any stock-picking in a fund, alternatives include exchange-traded funds like iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks a broad index of international stocks. 
 Whatever route investors choose, they shouldn't jump in all at once, Mr. Rocco said. Instead, he advocates investing regularly overseas over the long haul, as one part of a complete portfolio. 
 ''It's probably a mistake to rush in right now,'' he said. ''But it does make sense to dollar-cost-average in. People are too concerned about 'Did I miss the party?'''

HEADLINE: As Earnings Slow, Dividends Pick Up the Slack

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR the past two years, the stock market's run has been fueled by a surprisingly strong surge in corporate profits. 
 Unfortunately, the gas tank is starting to empty. After reaching rates of more than 20 percent starting in late 2003, profit growth is slowing. In fact, second-quarter earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to grow by a much more modest 7 percent, according to Thomson Financial.
Yet that doesn't mean that the case for owning stocks is weakening. At the moment, there is another very positive sign for the stock market: a surge in dividends. Just as corporate profit growth is slowing, dividends paid by S.&P. 500 companies are accelerating. 
 Ever since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, dividend-paying stocks have commanded attention from investors, especially when the federal government cut taxes on qualified corporate dividends in 2003 to 15 percent from as high as 38.6 percent. But it was only at the end of 2003 that dividend growth started picking up speed. And it was only this year that dividends started growing faster than profits.
 In the first three months of the year, corporate earnings grew by less than 14 percent while dividends increased by almost 16 percent. In the second quarter, dividends jumped by nearly 13 percent, or almost double the estimated rate of profit growth.
 Dividends typically have grown faster than earnings only in economic downturns, like the one in 2001. During such periods, it's typically not a case of dividends accelerating but rather of earnings slowing faster than dividends, said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Advisors in Philadelphia.
 ''The fact that this is happening midway into a business cycle is really something,'' he said.
 What does it mean? Because dividends compensate investors while they wait for equity prices to appreciate, investors are being paid more to hold stocks, and more of us should be willing to do so.
 To be sure, the dividend yield on the S.&P. 500 is still slightly below 2 percent, according to Standard & Poor's. But these aren't the roaring 1990's. Stocks aren't posting 20-percent-plus returns. So that means dividends are playing relatively larger roles. Over the last 12 months, for example, the S.&P. 500 has returned around 9 percent -- and one-fifth of that return has come from dividends. 
 The argument for paying attention to dividends right now goes beyond yield. ''Focusing on absolute yields is not a very good approach when it comes to dividends,'' said Howard Silverblatt, equity market analyst at S.&P. Because dividend yields are calculated by dividing a stock's cash dividend per share by the share price, a high dividend yield could just be a sign of a company whose stock has taken a beating. But dividend growth measures the increase in the actual cash payout. This is why growing dividends are often seen as a sign of improving finances, as companies need to generate enough cash flow to return larger checks to shareholders.
 At the end of the day, it is the compounding effect of these growing dividends, reinvested methodically in one's portfolio, that helps engineer big returns, Mr. Silverblatt said.
 For example, from 1995 to 2004 -- a period generally marked by a declining focus on dividends -- the S.&P. 500 rose 164 percent, based on price appreciation. But by reinvesting small but growing dividends, investors earned 212 percent in total returns.
 Eugene C. Sit, chairman of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis, says he thinks dividends in the S.&P. 500 could grow 10 percent to 12 percent annually for the next several years, which should make dividend payers more attractive.
 The fact that government bonds are yielding such paltry sums makes dividend growers even more appealing, he says. ''If you're buying a bond at a 4 percent yield and you're in the highest marginal tax bracket, after taxes you're earning something close to 3 percent,'' said Mr. Sit, lead manager of the Sit Dividend Growth fund. 
 Yet an investor could earn similar or even higher yields through dividend-paying stocks, and those payouts are likely to grow significantly. Moreover, dividend investors are being taxed at a maximum rate of just 15 percent -- at least through 2008, when the current dividend tax law will expire unless Congress extends it.
 Where are dividends growing the fastest? Oddly enough, in the technology sector, which until recently has hardly been synonymous with dividends. Tech dividends have grown 44 percent annually over the last two years as more companies that hadn't previously returned profits to shareholders started doing so. 
 Of course, tech dividends are growing fast because they are starting from a very small base. Other sectors showing strong dividend growth of late have been telecommunications, financial services, consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks. 
 Daniel Clifton, executive director of the American Shareholders Association -- an affiliate of Americans for Tax Reform that is pushing to make permanent the dividend tax cuts -- says investors need to put things in perspective. 
 Dividends may be growing faster than earnings because ''so many companies started withdrawing dividends in the 1990's to pursue growth,'' he said. Many of those companies took cash that could have been paid out in dividends and reinvested it into the company to expand or even to acquire other businesses.
 As a handful of S.&P. 500 companies have begun to reinstate dividends, the growth rate has shot higher. Since the end of 2002, some 33 additional companies in the S.&P. 500 have started issuing dividends, bringing the total to 384. That is still a far cry from the 469 companies that did so in 1980, but the trend is clear and investors are already picking up on it. So far this year, dividend-paying stocks in the S.&P. index have returned 2.9 percent, on average, while those that don't pay dividends have lost 1.5 percent, according to S.&P.
 MOREOVER, since stocks hit their recent lows in April -- amid fears of shrinking profits in the face of rising oil prices and interest rates -- the fastest-growing sectors in terms of dividends have performed the best, Mr. Kleintop said. Those include technology, financial services, industrial, consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks. 
 But the absolute rate of growth is often less important than the sustainability of growth. Standard & Poor's puts together a list of companies that have managed to raise their dividends every year for the past quarter-century. From 1990 to 2004, these so-called dividend aristocrats returned 13.4 percent a year, on average. That's 2.5 percentage points better than the overall S.&P. 500.
 The good news for dividend-growth investors is that there is plenty of room for this trend to grow. Despite the recent pickup in dividend growth, the actual payout ratio -- the percentage of a company's profits paid in dividends -- is still near historical lows. 
 That is one reason Mr. Kleintop says he believes that ''over the next 10, maybe 20 years, we could be in an environment where people are much more focused on dividends than they were in the 1980's and 90's.''

HEADLINE: Galway

BYLINE: By J.P. SLAVIN

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- Ireland, like New York City, is not a place where people go for the weather. But to experience the sun breaking out over Galway Bay, and the headlands of nearby Connemara, the time to travel to Ireland's West Country is July and August.
 Although Galway is Ireland's third largest city, it is more of a village than a megalopolis. Despite its size (population about 70,000) Galway is rich in cuisine and culture, and fabulously wealthy when it comes to good cheer and traditional Irish music. The birthplace of Nora Barnacle, the wife of James Joyce, a country retreat of the poet W.B. Yeats, and the setting of countless canvases by Jack B. Yeats, the Nobel Laureate's brother and Ireland's most celebrated painter, Galway is also home to one of the best performing arts festivals in Europe. The 28th Galway Arts Festival is scheduled to start tomorrow and will run until July 24.

WHERE TO STAY -- Surprisingly, I found no cozy bed-and-breakfasts in the city during my June visit, save for St. Martin's Bed-and-Breakfast, 2 Nuns Island (353-91) 568286. It has four bedrooms, each costing $43 a person a night, at $1.23 to the euro. St. Martin's also has a well-tended garden and a clear view of the River Corrib. Hotels near the city's cobblestoned Left Bank area are the answer. A suitable one is Brennans Yard Hotel, Lower Merchants Road, (353-91) 568166, www.brennansyardhotel.com. It houses a pub, the Spanish Bar, and doubles start at $123. Don't let the medieval stone exterior fool you -- the rooms are small, but modern and comfortable.
 The nearby and larger Harbour Hotel, New Dock Road, (353-91) 569466, on the Web at www.harbour.ie, offers exceptional value, especially when you book online. A big box of building, with 96 rooms, just a few steps from the Atlantic the hotel is popular with business and budget travelers. Standard single rooms are available from $134 and doubles are $97 to $109 a person. Both rates include full Irish breakfast, with rashers (thick slabs of Irish bacon). 

WHERE TO EAT -- Great ingredients -- Irish flour, whole grains and butter -- have long made Ireland's breads some of the best in the world, but its cheeses are starting to take center stage.
 Similar to those of pungent country cheeses found in France and Italy, the strong aromas of Irish cheese hit you as soon as you walk in the door at Sheridans Cheesemongers, 14-16 Churchyard Street, www.sheridanscheesemongers.com, (353-91) 564829, across the street from the historic Church of St. Nicholas, which dates to 1320. One Irish cheese to try is Cratloe Hills sheep's milk, but ask the knowledgeable staff what's at its best. You can shop for a world-class picnic at Sheridans, including cured meats, smoked salmon, olives, breads, healthy soups and salads, and then spread out on one of the five wood communal tables upstairs in the store's wine shop. A takeout lunch is about $25 for two; a bottle starts at about $22. A selection of wines by the glass begins at $5. ''You've got to be different,'' is the motto of the shop's manager, Gerry Flynn, and it shows in his stock of boutique wines from France, Italy and Spain. 
 Sheridans downstairs food shop is open Monday to Friday, 9:30 to 6. It opens at 9 on Saturdays, to coincide with the weekly Churchyard Street farmers' market. During Galway's summer tourist season from May to August, the lower level is also open Sundays from 1 to 6. The upstairs wine salon opens at 12:30. Last call is at about 7:30. The wine shop is closed Sundays and Mondays.
 For breakfast, try a velvety raisin scone for $2.50 at Griffin's Bakery, 21 Shop Street, (353-91) 563683, on the Web at www.griffinsbakery.com. Customers line up from morning to evening at this local institution, which opened in 1876. It serves a bundle of breads and desserts, ranging from brown Irish soda bread to carrot cake, along with Irish jams and honey. Open Monday to Saturday, 8 to 6.
 Enjoying local seafood is a must -- Galway's 51st International Oyster Festival takes place this year from Sept. 22 to 25 -- and a satisfying lunch of mussel chowder with haddock, prawns, and cod ($8.50) with bottle of a crisp Gavi di Gavi ''Ca' da Bosio'' white wine ($32) can be found at the airy and light Ard Bia Restaurant, 2 Quay Street, (353-91) 539897, www.ardbia.com. A delicious rack of lamb dinner entree ($31) is served at the sleek K.C. Blakes, Quay Street, (353-91) 561826. For low-priced sandwiches and fair trade coffee, take your writer's notebook and Irish Times to Scribblers, 3 Middle Street, (353-91) 865930, Monday to Saturday, 8 to 6; closed Sundays.

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- Galway is a city for strolling along the historic waterfront and over the footbridges crossing the River Corrib and keeping an eye out for art galleries and bookshops. Check out the work of emerging artists at the Galway Arts Center, 47 Dominick Street, (353-91) 565886, www.galwayartscentre.ie, which is housed in the former residence of the Irish literary giant, Lady Gregory, who founded the Abbey Theater in Dublin with W.B. Yeats in 1904. Afterward, stroll across town to Forster Street and look for the bust of President John F. Kennedy, who visited Galway in 1963. You'll find the sculpture in Kennedy Park.
 An enjoyable afternoon can be spent exploring the gothic National University of Ireland, Galway, which dates to 1849, and the nearby Galway Cathedral. Check newspapers for recitals at Galway Cathedral, especially when its 3,000-pipe great organ is on the program.
 Angel Aromatherapy on Flood Street, (353-91) 568871, is the place for massage and spa days. Hour-long treatments start at $55. 
 For day trips to the Cliffs of Moher in nearby County Clare, or to the Gaelic-speaking Aran Islands, visit www.ireland.ie. The Cliffs of Moher are one of the great natural wonders in Europe, a five-mile-long jagged bluff that rises 750 feet from the wild Atlantic Ocean. On a clear day, you can make out Galway Bay and the three Aran Islands from the cliffs. As a center of Celtic folklore and the Irish language, the Arans -- 30 miles off the Galway coast -- have long fascinated linguists and anthropologists. There is daily ferry and air service to the islands from Galway, while the Cliffs of Moher can be reached in about an hour's time from Galway by bus or car.

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- One of Ireland's best drama troupes, the Galway-based Druid Theater Company, (353-91) 563109, www.druidtheatre.com, is also a fixture at the city's annual arts festival, which runs this year from tomorrow to July 24. The Druid will stage the complete works of the Irish playwright J.M. Synge, a contemporary of Lady Gregory and the Yeats brothers. More than 400 writers, artists, musicians and comedians from Ireland and 10 other countries are also featured this year. The French artist and sculptor Claude Merle will continue the festival's tradition of street art by placing his life-sized puppets all around town. A performance schedule is online at www.galwayartsfestival.ie. Tickets ($8 to $43) can be reserved through the box office, (353-91) 566577, or on the Web site.
 On Monday evenings, Nimmos, (353-91) 5601114, a dark and romantic supper club near the city's waterfront, turns into a cozy jazz club. The food is too rich and overpriced, but the lighting and ambience -- comfortable and eccentrically chosen antiques on two levels -- are wonderful. A nice, and affordable, red wine by the glass is Vin de Pays de Vaucluse, from Provence, at $5.40.

WHERE TO SHOP -- Irish wool has to be on the top of your shopping list, and some of Ireland's best clothes makers, like Hanna Hats of Donegal (a favorite of the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan), are in the West Country. Two mainstays in Galway are on High Street, O'Maille, (353-91) 562696, www.omaille.com, and Fallers Sweater Shop, (353-91) 565442. I wanted a new sweater, but walked out of O'Maille with a green Irish rugby shirt ($45) and a gorgeous tweed waistcoat ($80) from the latter. Both shops carry selections of classic Irish sweaters, hats, and scarves. Tweed suits, for men and women, are available at O'Maille.
 In a town writers and painters have loved for centuries, there are two excellent bookstores: Charlie Byrne Bookshop, on Middle Street, (353-91) 561766, on the Web at www.charliebyrne.com, for secondhand books and Kenny's Bookshop & Art Galleries on High Street, (353-91) 534760, www.kennys.ie, for first editions and a smart exhibition space. I found a used but signed first edition of Tim Pat Coogan's biography of the ''Big Fella,'' the charismatic Irish revolutionary Michael Collins, for $24.60 at Bryne's and enjoyed the signed portraits of the authors who've read at Kenny's. Look for the one of Norman Mailer, taken when he was perming his hair during the '70's.

HOW TO STAY WIRED -- Considering the high-tech sector is a big part of Ireland's roaring Celtic Tiger economy, it's surprising how little wireless access is available. I Supply, (353-91) 537930, next to the Druid Theater Company on Flood Street, offers full business center amenities, while the nearby Net@ccess Cyber Cafe in the Old Malte Arcade is popular with backpackers and college students. Both charge about $3 for 30 minutes online.

YOUR FIRST VISIT OR YOUR 10TH -- Spending an evening or a Sunday afternoon in a Galway pub enjoying a session (local parlance for traditional Irish music performances) is a national treasure in Ireland. Two local favorites are Tig Coili, on Mainguard Street, (353-91) 561294, and the down and dirty Crane Bar, 2 Sea Road, (353-91) 587419. Tig Coili has more of a tourist following while Crane has the authenticity of a country pub in need of a good cleaning -- but both attract top-shelf musicians. A pint of Guinness Stout or Irish Harp lager is typically sold at $4.30.

HOW TO GET THERE -- Shannon International Airport, with direct flights to Kennedy Airport in New York, is 55 miles from Galway. Bus connections are easily made at Shannon, or you can rent a car. If you're traveling to Galway from Dublin, take Irish Rail, www.irishrail.ie. The journey, scheduled for three hours, is $48 round trip.

GETTING AROUND -- In Galway, it's best to walk, but if a taxi's needed, call Galway Taxis at (353-91) 561111.
